Lecture 17, Mesopotamia, The Search for Eternal Life
In our last session, we discussed the first part of the epic of Gilgamesh, including Gilgamesh's
first encounter with his friend and fellow hero Enkidu, and the two heroes' battle
with Humbaba, the elemental forest monster.
In this session, we will conclude our discussion of the epic of Gilgamesh, with the story of
Gilgamesh's quest for eternal life, a quest that has many parallels in the wisdom literature
we've already considered.
Now, not surprisingly, Gilgamesh's attempts to avoid his human destiny lead to questions
about the proper way to live life, how to live a meaningful life in the face of the
inevitability of death.
And Gilgamesh's quest for eternal life recalls explanations and creation myths.
Creation myths, you'll remember, tell us how things got to be the way they are now.
And that means that they explain some of the issues that are associated with wisdom literature
about how we live and why we live that way to have a successful life.
Now, Gilgamesh and Enkidu have defeated the beast Humbaba.
That is, the elemental forest monster he has faced like coiled intestines.
He threatens them, but they defeat him handily with the help of the four winds.
After his victory over Humbaba, Gilgamesh returns to his royal city of Uruk, and there
he replenishes his strength.
He washes his body, puts on his royal raiment, and we're told that he throws back his long
hair.
And the new refreshed, cleaned, and groomed, and apparently long-haired Gilgamesh quickly
attracts the attention of Ishtar, the powerful goddess of erotic love.
Now, we've already discussed Ishtar's many roles and attributes under her Sumerian name.
Here, Ishtar appears in her role as an insatiable sexual predator.
That is, a woman who is dangerous because of her sexuality.
And here, Ishtar quickly attempts to seduce Gilgamesh by making him a series of very tempting
promises.
Many of those promises, interestingly enough, have to do with fertility gifts.
That is, she says if Gilgamesh will have sex with her, then his flock animals will produce
abundantly, and he'll have many crops, he'll have many animals, and he will, in other words,
enjoy the abundance that Ishtar is able to deliver by virtue of her divine powers.
But, Gilgamesh, the hero is not fooled, and one of the traits of the hero, of course,
is his cleverness and his ability to spot traps.
Gilgamesh rejects Ishtar's advances.
And that's not necessarily a problem, but what is a problem is that Gilgamesh makes
his disdain for Ishtar all too clear.
First, he rejects the idea of entering into an unequal union.
He does not like the idea, apparently, that he would be the junior partner in any sexual
relationship that he has with the goddess.
He, as the man, does not wish to be put into an inferior position.
He asks the goddess, what could I give you if I possessed you?
What can a mortal give to a goddess that would be an appropriate love gift?
But then he adds insult to injury by making a list of the various lovers that Ishtar has
had and then later tired of and betrayed.
A long list of various lovers that Ishtar has taken, enjoyed for a while, and then reduced
to some unpleasant fate.
And this, of course, includes her first lover, her consort and husband, Dumuzi, who now is
subjected to wailing in grief for months at a time down in the underworld.
Ishtar is understandably offended by this list of her sins, their list of betrayals.
And Ishtar, of course, is particularly offended because everything that Gilgamesh says is
true.
He has offended her by simply telling the truth.
She does not have a good history of romances.
So infuriated, Ishtar shows her true nature because she goes in a rage to her father, Anu,
and asks Anu to send the Bull of Heaven to destroy Gilgamesh.
Her erotic interest quickly turns into rejected rage.
Now the Bull of Heaven, once again, we have the figure of the Bull as a symbol of divine
strength, that idea of the sort of virility that the Bull represents as a form of divine
power.
And so the Bull of Heaven, presumably, is an appropriate weapon for Ishtar to use against
Gilgamesh.
You might say all of the power of Heaven is being sent against the hero in the form of
the Bull of Heaven.
The Bull of Heaven attacks not Gilgamesh himself, but his city, Uruk.
He wreaks havoc in Uruk, and it is Gilgamesh and Inkidu who must come to the city's rescue.
And in fact, Gilgamesh makes relatively short work of the Bull of Heaven.
This of course, once again, infuriates Ishtar.
Ishtar, as we know, under her name of Inanna, is quick to fall into a rage, quick to be
offended, quick to take revenge.
Ishtar happens to be standing on a wall of the city of Uruk, watching Gilgamesh meet
the Bull of Heaven and with Inkidu destroy it.
So Ishtar, again, falls into a rage against both Inkidu and Gilgamesh.
And Inkidu, who has been pretty much fed up at this point with Ishtar's behavior, tears
off a haunch of the Bull and throws it at the goddess.
And he threatens her.
He said, if I could get my hands on you, I would do to you what we've done to this Bull.
Not a smart thing to do.
Ishtar takes her revenge.
She is not content to revenge herself against Gilgamesh, who perhaps is too powerful to
take revenge against.
But she, of course, has a clear shot at Gilgamesh's comrade and twin, Inkidu.
And Soon, Inkidu has a prophetic dream that makes it clear he will soon die, and that
his death is a recompense to the gods for the destruction of Humbaba and the Bull of
Heaven.
In other words, Inkidu is to suffer death as a result of the various deeds that he carried
up with Gilgamesh, even though Gilgamesh was the leading actor.
Soon, Inkidu falls into an illness.
And as he lies dying, Inkidu prays to Shamash, the sun god, to curse the hunter and to curse
Shamhat the prostitute, the two people who are responsible for Inkidu becoming civilized
in the first part of the epic.
They are the ones who brought Inkidu out of the wilderness, out of his fellowship with
the animals, and civilized him, made him suitable for human society.
And he wants revenge against them because they initiated the events that have brought
Inkidu to this evil destiny, to die of a withering illness rather than in the glory of battle.
Now, Shamash, the sun god, hears this prayer for a curse against the hunter and against
Shamhat from Inkidu, and he replies to Inkidu from Heaven.
And he rebukes him.
He says you should not curse the hunter.
You should not curse Shamhat because it is Shamhat who civilized you, and by civilizing
you Inkidu, she made you to be the fit companion for Gilgamesh.
It is Shamhat who has not brought you the evil destiny, but has in fact brought you the
friendship of Gilgamesh and the everlasting fame that goes along with being his comrade.
And Inkidu thinks this over and relents.
And instead of cursing Shamhat the prostitute, he blesses her.
But the blessing is rather ironic.
What he wishes for her is that she will have many lovers and tear apart many families and
generally be a successful whore, not really the kind of blessing we might expect.
But now, Inkidu becomes ill and soon, after a series of speeches and series of prophetic
dreams, Inkidu dies.
And it is the death of Inkidu, the brother of Gilgamesh we might say, the twin of Gilgamesh
we might say, certainly the comrade and strong hero, allied with Gilgamesh.
It is the death of Inkidu that confronts Gilgamesh with the inevitability of his own death.
The death that is the ultimate and final fact of his human destiny.
Now it is very important at this point to know that ancient Mesopotamian beliefs about
the afterlife were very different from the optimistic view that is typical of Egyptian
religion.
The Mesopotamian underworld was located below the earth's surface, somewhere below the surface
of the earth, but above the waters of the deep abyss.
And because it was located under the earth, the Mesopotamian underworld is associated
with darkness, with dust, with dryness, with clay, with thirst.
Here all the dead, both the good and the evil, together without distinction, they continue
to exist, but their existence is only a shadowy, semi-conscious state, devoid of any kind of
vitality, a sort of, a sort of, a sort of, a sort of, a sort of, a sort of, a sort of,

Now there is a longer version of
this encounter in the Garden of
the Sung god, in the Old
Babylonian version of the Epic
of Gilgamesh. There in the Old
Babylonian version, in the
Garden of the Sung god, Gilgamesh's
reasons for his quest come
even more clearly into focus.
Because he has a conversation with
Shymash, as well as with
Siduri. The conversation in the
the old Babylonian version of the epic apparently were omitted,
as far as we can tell, from the standard version that is preserved at Nineveh in Akkadian.
In the old Babylonian version, Gilgamesh is first met in the Garden of the Sun God by Shemash himself.
And Shemash, we must remember, has been a supporter and protector for Gilgamesh throughout his adventures.
And Shemash is concerned with Gilgamesh.
He wants to know why he is upset, what he is doing,
but he also tells Gilgamesh that his quest is futile,
because Gilgamesh can never hope to find the eternal life he seeks.
Gilgamesh's reply makes his anguish clear.
His wish is to see the sun and live, to see Shemash and live,
rather than to sleep in darkness for all eternity.
Siduri also appears in the old Babylonian version,
and it's interesting that Siduri's name also appears in an Akkadian list,
where she is identified as Ishtar of Wisdom.
This may explain why she appears in Shemash's Garden,
that she has some connection with Ishtar and some connection with Wisdom.
And it may explain her role in the old Babylonian version of the epic.
Siduri in the old Babylonian version repeats the words of Shemash,
asking Gilgamesh the point of his quest when the gods have reserved
eternal life for themselves and decreed death for humanity.
Gilgamesh's portion of divinity, that two-thirds divinity that he is,
is apparently irreparably tainted by his human mortality.
But Siduri in the old Babylonian version also offers Gilgamesh advice.
She tells him, Gilgamesh, let your stomach be full.
Day and night, enjoy yourself in every way.
Every day, arrange for pleasures.
Day and night, dance and play.
Wear fresh clothes, keep your head washed, bathe in water.
Depreciate the child who holds your hand.
Let your wife enjoy herself in your lap.
This, too, is the work of man.
Now these words of advice from Siduri clearly recall the Harper's songs
we talked about from Egypt, and also similar words of consolation
found elsewhere in ancient Near Eastern Wisdom literature.
Now these words, of course, stand apart from the more optimistic
practical wisdom based in everyday experience that have to do with dealing
with the problems of everyday life and finding success.
This sort of wisdom reflects a conviction that human beings are at the God's mercy.
They have only limited control over the course of their own lives,
and it is necessary to enjoy what you can while you can.
Gilgamesh leaves the Garden of the Sun God and continues his quest,
seeking out Utnipishtim the far away to learn the secret of everlasting life.
He takes up his weapons and leaves the Garden of the Sun God,
and Gilgamesh continues his journey coming to Ursinabi the Ferryman at the Waters of Death.
Ursinabi is the one who must carry him across the Waters of Death
and Gilgamesh is to reach the home of Utnipishtim, who is after all far away.
Now Ursinabi is not a Ferryman of the dead, like Charon in Greek mythology.
He appears to be a man with a boat, but it is a boat that is able to navigate
the Waters of Death that separate Gilgamesh and the rest of the world from Utnipishtim.
And the Waters of Death here are not the Waters that surround the land of the dead.
Instead, it is the sea that provides the inspiration for the idea of chaos in ancient Mesopotamia.
Not the water surrounding the land of the dead, but the waters of chaos that threaten life in lower Mesopotamia,
and therefore may be understood as Waters of Death.
At Ursinabi's direction, Gilgamesh cuts a series of wooden poles,
and these poles allow him to pull the ferry from one pole to another across the Waters to Utnipishtim's home.
Now Gilgamesh's journey in search of Utnipishtim, as I've said, is essentially a search for a revered ancient ancestor,
so that Gilgamesh may learn the meaning of human life in the face of death.
Utnipishtim is very much like Noah. He survived an ancient worldwide flood,
and in the Epic of Gilgamesh, he's presented as a depository of ancient wisdom from the very earliest ages of human life.
Utnipishtim greets Gilgamesh with the same words that Gilgamesh has heard from Suduri and Shamash.
He asks why Gilgamesh's face is weathered, why he is clothed in animal skins.
And Gilgamesh repeats his standard explanation, and Ketu has died, and Gilgamesh fears death,
so that he has come to Utnipishtim to gain wisdom, in other words, how to attain everlasting life.
But, in fact, Utnipishtim proves to have no wisdom to offer Gilgamesh.
He tells him instead to accept human life as the gods who created it, with an appointed time for its fated end.
Utnipishtim, like Suduri, urges Gilgamesh instead to enjoy what pleasures life has to offer while life lasts,
rather than making his life miserable because he is afraid of death.
And given that Utnipishtim has been given everlasting life, this advice is a little bit ironic.
Enjoy life while it lasts, because unlike me, you won't live forever.
Gilgamesh, in turn, is surprised that Utnipishtim is a man like any other.
He's not a hero like Gilgamesh, even though the gods have singled him out for exemption from the human fate of death.
Utnipishtim then tells Gilgamesh the history of the primeval flood,
in a story that has very close parallels to the Mesopotamian story of Atrahasis and the Israelite story of Noah.
And we'll discuss the various versions of this flood story in our next session.
At the end of Utnipishtim's tale, Gilgamesh falls asleep for seven days, partially in indication of his mortality,
and partially in indication that his quest has reached its climax.
When he awakes, Gilgamesh is still in despair.
He asks Utnipishtim what he should do, because he's still dogged by the fear of death,
which seems to haunt him or to threaten his every step.
Everywhere he stays, everywhere he goes, death is waiting for Gilgamesh.
Utnipishtim orders Ursinabi to allow Gilgamesh to wash and put on fresh clothing to return to Uruk, his proper place.
And Gilgamesh, as garments were told, will stay fresh until he returns to his home city.
Utnipishtim also tells Gilgamesh a secret.
Although there is no way to escape death, there is a plant deep in the abyss that will restore a person's youth.
So Gilgamesh resolves to get that plant.
He ties stones to his feet and plunges into the waters of the abyss where he finds the plant.
At that point, he cuts his feet loose and returns to the surface with the plant of rejuvenation.
But later on, as he returns to Uruk, Gilgamesh bays in a pool and sets the plant aside.
And a snake smells the plant and steals it from Gilgamesh.
And as soon as it steals it, the snake sheds its old skin.
It seems to be in part an explanation of why snakes shed their skin and so are rejuvenated on a regular basis.
Gilgamesh can do nothing but weep at his loss.
Both he and Ursunabi continue their journey to Uruk.
And when they arrive, Gilgamesh tells Ursunabi to inspect the city, to have a look at its glories.
Clearly recalling the words that began the poem about the glories of Uruk, bringing the story of Gilgamesh full circle.
By the end of the epic, Gilgamesh has come to understand how things are
and why they are the way they are.
Even a hero who is two-thirds God and one-third man must follow the rules that the gods have decreed for humanity.
It seems that Gilgamesh has come to terms with his ultimate fate.
At the end of the epic, he returns to his role in the civilized world as king of Uruk
and takes pride in the accomplishments of his reign.
When Gilgamesh resumes his kingly rule, he devotes himself to those works that are celebrated at the beginning of the epic.
And this includes writing the first account of his own deeds on a stone monument,
which is presumably meant to be the original source of the epic itself.
So ultimately, Gilgamesh makes peace with the civilized world.
He makes peace with his own human destiny.
He accepts the advice of both Suduri and Utnapishtim to enjoy what pleasures human life has to offer while human life lasts,
because this too is the lot of man.
I think that Gilgamesh, as a story of a hero, is distinguished by the combination of heroic deeds and the search for knowledge.
It's almost as if the first half of the epic draws us in with tales of combat and great adventures,
and then the second half provides the lesson.
Even the greatest of human beings must find what pleasure they can in this life while it lasts.
Now in our next session, we will review and compare the several different versions of the flood story that appears in the story of the epic of Gilgamesh.
We have two different Mesopotamian versions.
The story of Utnapishtim, as it appears in the epic, and the story of Atrahasis.
And then we will look at these two stories in comparison with the Israelite story,
much more familiar to us, the story of Noah, as it appears in the Book of Genesis.
