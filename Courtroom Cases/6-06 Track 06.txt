The army having the right to say to recruits don't ask don't tell you have the right to be homosexual
As long as we don't find out about it, but if you tell us
We will throw you out and we will not ask you so just keep your lives private
Go back into the closet if you remain in the closet if you remain discreet if you don't force it upon us
We will not come after you and seek it out
but if you try to
flaunt it if you try to
Demonstrate it if you try to get us to recognize it. No, that's where we'll draw the line
And that's what gives rise to Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion
He wrote a scathing dissent characterizing majority decision as quote a result oriented
Expedient well when we get to Bush versus Gore in one of the subsequent lectures in this course
We'll see whether or not Justice Scalia has the right to complain about result oriented
Expedience, but for now that was the phrase he used he proceeded then to give a
Parade of horribles that would follow if this decision were to be taken to its logical conclusion
I listen very carefully to the parade of horribles and listen as to whether or not you think
It would be the most horrible thing in the world if the court took this decision and applied it logically
And here's the parade of horribles set out by Justice Scalia
State laws against bigamy. All right, that makes a plausible argument state laws against same-sex marriage
That's what we've been talking about now adult incest. You certainly don't want to permit adult incest
Prostitution, all right, we're getting close there
I think reasonable people could argue that laws against prostitution don't make a lot of sense
But surely the state would have the right to ban laws against prostitution, but here's where it gets interesting
He includes laws against
masturbation, oh my god
The pillars of society would certainly crumble if laws against masturbation was struck down
The vast majority of Americans have no idea that there are laws against masturbation, but there are
in many many states and even the federal government and there was a prosecution of years ago of a guy for
masturbating in the privacy of his own little bathroom in a federal park and
There was a camera in the stall to make sure that there was no homosexual conduct going on and they caught the guy masturbating and they
Prosecuted him so Justice Scalia says that the implications of the Lawrence case would be to strike down state laws against masturbation
Of course, he's right, but you didn't need Lawrence for that the decision of the Supreme Court about birth control
Griswold versus Connecticut decisions of the Supreme Court in other areas of privacy
Surely would support a liberty interest in masturbation
Where does the state get the power to come in and tell a young man or a woman that they are not entitled to
Use their body in the way they choose to he goes on he said it would also strike down laws against adultery
