Mike Tyson was at that time former heavyweight champion in the world, but still at the top of his career and
he came as one of the guests to the
black pageant in Indianapolis beauty pageant and
All the young women were gathering around him and Desiree Washington the victim in this case jumped on his lap and
kind of flirted with him and they both agreed that perhaps he would take her out and
According to at least his testimony in the testimony of another witness
He said to her want to go out and she said sure let's go to a movie and he said no
I'm not interested in going to movie
You know what I'm interested in and then he used a very explicit word that starts with F
Indicating what he wanted to do with her or to her that was testified to by several people who observed the encounter
Then several days later at after midnight
Mike Tyson decided to call Desiree Washington and
Follow through on his on their initial agreement to go out
And he called her it was after midnight. She was in her room ready to go to sleep
but she agreed to come down and meet with him and go out for a date
Interestingly enough she put on a pair of panties. This becomes relevant in the case that were polka dotted panties kind of
Childlike panties and the prosecutor in the case argued to the jury ladies and gentlemen of the jury if this woman wanted sex
She would have won Fredericks of Hollywood black lace panties
But instead she wore these childish polka dotted panties that proved she was not dressed for sex a very strange argument

She had available were those that were the one she actually wore with the polka dots
Not to get too graphic, but it becomes relevant and in rape cases you have to be graphic
It's impossible to talk about rape cases without getting to the underlying facts of the case
She was also having her period at the time and was menstruating fairly
actively and so she wore pad and was and borrowed a very expensive dress
From one of her roommates to wear out for her date that becomes relevant in just a few minutes when we hear what happened in the hotel room
and so they went into Mike Tyson's limousine and
pulled up to his hotel and
Here is where the issue becomes very disputed
She testified under oath that he leaned over to kiss her in the car and she rebuffed him
She had no interest in kissing him or no interest in
Necking with him and that's what the jury heard. That's all the jury heard. Why did the jury hear that?
Because halfway through the trial
