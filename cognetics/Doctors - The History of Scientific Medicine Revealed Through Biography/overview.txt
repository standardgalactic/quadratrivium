Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/01 - Hippocrates & Origins of Western Medicine.txt
1. The Hippocratic physicians, named after the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, were a group of doctors who followed a specific ethical code, setting them apart from other practitioners of medicine at the time. This code emphasized professional conduct, patient confidentiality, and the morality of their practice.

2. The Hippocratic ethics, particularly as outlined in the Great Oath, became the foundation for Western medical ethics and have influenced medical practices and codes of conduct to this day. The oath includes a covenant with various gods and a detailed ethical code that prohibits activities such as assisting suicide or abortions.

3. The Hippocratic physicians were skilled in practical medicine, performing surgeries like setting fractures, drilling holes in the skull to relieve intracranial pressure, and employing their hands expertly during operations. They also paid attention to personal hygiene and patient care.

4. The ethical code of the Hippocratic physicians was not just a set of rules but a professional identity that provided trust and reliability to patients. It ensured that a physician would not take advantage of vulnerable positions, such as seducing female members of a household or divulging sensitive information about their patients.

5. The Hippocratic corpus, beyond the Great Oath, contains other writings that emphasize the importance of compassion and love for humanity in the practice of medicine. These principles are still relevant today and are reflected in the oaths taken by medical professionals in modern times.

Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/02 - Paradox of Galen.txt
 Galen (AD 129-200) was a renowned ancient physician, philosopher, and anatomist who made significant contributions to the understanding of human physiology and medical practice. His extensive research included studying the nervous system, respiratory system, urinary system, and the voice production mechanism. Galen's experiments demonstrated that breathing is a result of a partial vacuum in the chest drawn by the lungs and not due to the expansion of the chest itself. He also confirmed that urine is formed in the kidneys by blocking the ureters.

Galen discovered the recurrent laryngeal nerves during his dissections, which allowed him to prove that the voice originates in the brain rather than the heart as previously believed. Despite some errors in his understanding of circulatory systems and anatomy, largely due to his work on animals other than humans, Galen's influence on medical science was profound.

He advocated for the use of botanicals and minerals in medicine and created complex formulations known as galenicals, which were used until well into the 20th century. Galen wrote extensively, leaving behind 22 volumes of texts that covered various aspects of life, including ethics, philosophy, religion, and contemporary practices.

Galen's works became the authoritative text on medicine for over a thousand years, from the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages, until his teachings were eventually revised with the rediscovery of original Greek manuscripts in the 16th and 17th centuries. This revival was facilitated by the fall of Constantinople in 1453, which led to Greek scholars fleeing to Italy and bringing with them some of the ancient texts. The eventual overthrow of Galen's authority came not from philosophical debate but from the renewed application of experimental methods that he himself had championed, leading to a more accurate understanding of human anatomy and physiology in the subsequent centuries.

Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/04 - Harvey, Discoverer of the Circulation.txt
1. **Harvey's Discovery of Blood Circulation**: William Harvey, an English physician, mathematician, and physicist, discovered the circulation of blood in the body, contradicting the long-held belief that blood stagnated in the body's organs and was replenished by food. His observations using a telescope (later replaced by a microscope) showed that blood circulates in a closed system from the heart to the lungs and back again.

2. **Challenges to his Discovery**: Harvey's discovery initially faced skepticism and resistance. His quantitative approach and the complexity of his ideas made it difficult for many in the medical community to accept his findings. Despite this, Harvey persisted with his research and eventually published "On the Motion of the Heart and Blood" in 1628, which detailed his discovery.

3. **Harvey's Methodology**: Harvey's approach to science was based on inductive reasoning, a method that starts with observations, formulates hypotheses, and then tests these hypotheses through experiments. This method is the foundation of the scientific method. Harvey's work marked a significant shift from relying on authority to observing and proving phenomena firsthand.

4. **Harvey's Later Work**: After his discovery of blood circulation, Harvey turned his attention to embryology, applying the same inductive reasoning that had led to his breakthrough in understanding the circulatory system. His work "On the Generation of Animals" (1651) contributed significantly to the field of embryology and further demonstrated the power of empirical observation and experimentation.

5. **Harvey's Philosophy on Science**: In his later years, Harvey emphasized the importance of observing nature directly rather than relying solely on authoritative texts. He believed that by closely examining natural phenomena and conducting experiments, one could uncover nature's secrets. His philosophical stance was a testament to the power of empirical science and laid the groundwork for future scientific discovery.

In summary, William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of blood and his approach to scientific inquiry revolutionized the understanding of human anatomy and physiology, setting a precedent for the use of empirical evidence and experimentation in scientific research. His work not only changed medical practice but also influenced the philosophical approach to scientific investigation.

Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/07 - Laennec & Invention of the Stethoscope.txt
 René Laennec, a Breton physician, became renowned for his groundbreaking work on chest diseases. His exhaustive treatise, "Treatise on Diseases of the Chest," published in 1819, was the most comprehensive of its time and solidified his reputation. After writing this seminal work, Laennec's health deteriorated rapidly due to overwork, and he resigned from his hospital post to become a gentleman farmer in Brittany.

Two years later, despite his declining health, which was worsened by tuberculosis, Laennec was offered a professorship at the Collège de France, where he conducted clinical work at the Charité. His grand rounds, held in Latin to accommodate international physicians, were highly influential and attracted medical professionals from around the world. His teaching methods set a new standard for medical education in Europe.

Laennec's contributions to medicine were significant, as he was one of the first to use systematic clinical observations and to teach clinical medicine based on these observations. However, his legacy in treatment was limited by the lack of effective medications available at the time, such as opium derivatives, quinine, mercury, and digitalis leaf.

Laennec's personal life remained private; he never married until late in life when he took his nephew's widowed cousin as his wife. The union was short-lived, as they lost a pregnancy, and Laennec's health continued to decline. He returned to Brittany, where he died of tuberculosis at the age of 45, leaving his extensive medical library and his stethoscope, which he considered the crown jewel of his legacy, to his nephew.

Laennec's innovative approach to clinical medicine and his development of the stethoscope had a lasting impact on the field, influencing medical education and practice for generations to come.

Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/08 - Morton & Origins of Anesthesia.txt
1. Crawford Long, a Georgia physician, first used ether as an anesthetic in surgery around 1842. He was more reserved about claiming the discovery and did not push for financial compensation or recognition.

2. Charles T. Jackson, another American physician, independently discovered the use of ether for surgical anesthesia after Long but before Morton. He aggressively sought to prove that he was the true inventor of anesthesia.

3. Dr. William T.G. Morton, a dentist from Boston, learned of ether's anesthetic properties and patented the technique in 1846, claiming he was the first to use ether for surgery. He engaged in a contentious public battle with Jackson over who deserved credit for the discovery.

4. The debate between Morton and Jackson became highly charged, with lawsuits, public accusations, and eventually the intervention of the American Medical Association, which censured Morton in 1864.

5. In 1868, Morton attempted to prove his claim to the discovery by seeking an audience with Congress, but he suffered a stroke and died shortly thereafter.

6. Charles Jackson continued to maintain his claim to the discovery until his own mental health deteriorated after encountering Morton's gravestone, which acknowledged Morton's contribution to anesthesia. Jackson was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and later died there without fully recovering from his psychological breakdown.

7. Crawford Long, who had quietly continued his medical practice and used ether for surgical purposes, died in 1878 under peaceful circumstances while delivering a baby. His contribution to the discovery of anesthesia was largely acknowledged posthumously.

8. The bitter dispute over who should be credited with the discovery of anesthesia cast a shadow over the lives of Morton and Jackson, while Long's legacy grew after his death, eventually leading to the recognition of all three men as co-discoverers of anesthesia.

Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/09 - Virchow & Cellular Origins of Disease.txt
 Rudolf Virchow was a pioneering figure in the fields of medicine, anthropology, and political economy. Born on October 13, 1821, he made significant contributions to scientific research and education, particularly in pathology and cellular pathology. His work laid the foundation for modern scientific medicine, including the concept that diseases are linked to specific causes, which is now a cornerstone of epidemiology.

Virchow was also an avid archaeologist and participated in several excavations, including the famous dig at Hisarlik, where Heinrich Schliemann discovered the ruins of Troy. He introduced the use of x-rays to examine mummies, which he applied during his Egyptian expeditions in his later years. Throughout his life, Virchow published extensively, with over 1,180 papers and a few books, primarily on anthropological topics.

One of his most notable works was a study of 6.76 million German schoolchildren, which he conducted to challenge the prevailing notions of racial superiority in Germany. His findings demonstrated the diversity among Germans and highlighted the fallacy of rigid racial categorizations, particularly refuting the stereotype that Germans were typically blonde and blue-eyed.

Virchow's influence extended beyond his scientific work; he was a vocal critic of social injustices and an advocate for political reform. His liberal views made him a target of the Nazi regime, which attempted to erase his legacy from German history.

Despite his busy schedule, Virchow maintained a relentless pace until his death. He passed away on September 5, 1902, at the age of 80, following a series of complications from a broken femur, which he sustained in an attempt to make it on time to a meeting—a testament to his dedication and work ethic. His passing was mourned worldwide, and Germany honored him with a state funeral, recognizing the profound loss of a man whose contributions spanned multiple scientific and social domains.

Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/10 - Lister & Germ Theory.txt
 Joseph Lister's pioneering work on antiseptic surgery revolutionized medical practices in the late 19th century. Despite initial skepticism and resistance from the medical community, who were deeply entrenched in their belief that spontaneous generation was the source of infection, Lister's methods slowly gained acceptance due to mounting evidence from both France and Germany, particularly the work of French veterinarian Benedict-Augustin Proust and German scientist Robert Koch.

Koch's seminal work in 1878 linking specific bacteria to six different surgical infections provided compelling proof that germs could indeed cause disease, further validating Lister's antiseptic approach. This led to Lister being knighted by Queen Victoria and receiving international honors for his contributions to medicine.

However, as Lister grew older, a new concept emerged—asepsis, which aimed to prevent infection entirely rather than just controlling it after the fact. This shift was facilitated by advances such as the use of sterile gowns, caps, and gloves, improved surgical instruments, and the invention of steam sterilization by Ernst von Bergmann in 1886.

By 1889, aseptic techniques were well established, with precise protocols for scrubbing, dressing, and operating to ensure a sterile environment. Lister was pleased that his antiseptic methods had significantly reduced mortality rates during surgery, even as the field evolved towards more stringent aseptic practices.

Lister passed away in 1912 at the age of 85, having lived to see the medical world embrace both antisepsis and later asepsis, saving countless lives through his pioneering work. He was buried in the West Hamstead Cemetery, and his legacy continues to influence modern surgical practices.

Checking Doctors - The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed Through Biography/11 - Halsted & American Medical Education.txt
 William Stewart Halsted was an influential American surgeon who made significant contributions to the fields of general surgery, breast cancer treatment, and thyroid surgery. Born on July 23, 1854, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Halsted's career began after completing his medical education at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.

In the late 19th century, Halsted revolutionized the treatment of breast cancer by developing radical mastectomy techniques, which involved removing not only the breast but also the underlying pectoral muscles and all the lymph nodes in the armpit. This procedure greatly reduced the suffering associated with the disease and improved patient outcomes, although it was a very invasive operation.

Halsted also perfected thyroid surgery, which was previously a high-risk procedure due to the thyrotoxic effects of manipulating the gland. His meticulous surgical technique minimized these risks and resulted in low mortality rates.

One notable event in Halsted's personal life led him to invent rubber gloves while observing his scrub nurse's damaged hands from handling mercuric chloride. This innovation improved surgical hygiene significantly.

Throughout his career, Halsted mentored young surgeons, encouraging them to specialize and develop their own subspecialties within surgery. Notable mentees include Harvey Cushing, the father of neurosurgery, and Samuel Crow, who became a leading expert in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery.

Halsted's life was not without its personal struggles; he battled drug addiction throughout much of his career, first with cocaine and later with morphine. Despite these challenges, he maintained a productive professional life until his death on August 30, 1922.

Halsted was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, near the graves of other notable figures of the time. His legacy as a surgical pioneer and innovator is enduring, with his techniques and contributions shaping the practice of surgery well into the 20th century. Halsted's work laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements in medical treatment and patient care.
