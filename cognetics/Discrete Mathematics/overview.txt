Checking Discrete Mathematics/02. Basic Concepts of Combinatorics.txt
 In the context of poker hands without pairs, straight flushes, or flushes, we're looking for combinations of five cards where no card shares a rank with another (no pairs), there is no sequence of consecutive ranks (no straights), and no all cards come from the same suit (no flushes). Here's how we can break down this problem:

1. **Choosing Five Unique Ranks**: There are 13 unique ranks in a standard deck of cards. We need to choose 5 different ranks from these, which can be done in "13 choose 5" ways (also written as \binom{13}{5}). This is the number of combinations when order does not matter and repetition is not allowed.

2. **Assigning Suits**: Once we've chosen our ranks, we have 4 remaining suits to assign to these ranks. Since there are no restrictions at this point (no straight, no flush), there are 4 different ways to assign the suits to the chosen ranks.

3. **Subtracting Straights**: We need to subtract the number of combinations that form a straight but are not flushes. There are 10 different straight hands (each suit has exactly one straight possibility from among the ranks chosen). For each of these straights, we again have 4 ways to assign the suits (since there's no flush requirement yet).

4. **Adding Back Straight Flush Combinations**: We subtracted straight hands twice because a straight that is also a flush (a straight flush) was counted once in each subtraction. We need to add these back once to correct the count. There are 10 straight flushes possible, and for each, there's only one way to assign suits because they must all be of the same suit.

Putting it all together, we calculate the number of poker hands without pairs, straights, or flushes as follows:

\[
\binom{13}{5} - 10 \times 4^5 + 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2068 - 10240 + 10 = 10438
\]

And as my student pointed out, this can be factored into:

\[
\binom{13}{5} - 10 \times (4^5) = \binom{13}{5} - 10240 = 10438
\]

This is the number of poker hands without pairs, straights, or flushes. However, as you mentioned, this count also includes four-of-a-kind hands, which are not without pairs. So we need to subtract these from our total:

\[
10438 - 4 \times \binom{13}{4} = 10438 - 715 = 9723
\]

So the correct number of poker hands without pairs, but allowing straights and flushes is 9,723. And if we want to exclude the four-of-a-kind hands as well (since they have a pair), we subtract those one last time:

\[
9723 - 4 \times \binom{13}{4} = 9723 - 286 = 9437
\]

And there you have it, the number of poker hands without pairs, straights, or flushes is 9,437.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/03. The 12-Fold Way of Combinatorics.txt
1. **Combinatorial Numbers and Their Relationships**: We discussed several combinatorial numbers in this lecture, including factorials, exponential functions, Bell numbers, partition numbers, and Stirling numbers. These numbers are related to different ways of counting or arranging a set of items.

2. **N! (N Factorial)**: The product of all positive integers up to N, also representing the number of ways to arrange N distinct items into orderly sequences or sets.

3. **N^N (Exponential Function)**: This represents another way of counting, specifically the total number of permutations of N distinct items where the order matters.

4. **B(N) (Bell Number)**: The sum of Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count certain types of partitions where no part is repeated. It can be thought of as the number of ways to distribute N identical candies into non-identical bags without regard to order or arrangement among the bags themselves.

5. **P(N) (Partition Number)**: The number of ways to partition an integer N into any number of positive parts, where order is not considered and no part is repeated. It's similar to distributing N identical candies into possibly identical bags, but unlike Bell numbers, it allows for repeated parts in the partition.

6. **Recursive Definition of P(N)**: P(N) can be computed by breaking down the problem into smaller problems. If you have k bags and N candies, either the smallest bag has 1 candy, or it has more than 1. For the former, there are P(N-1) ways to distribute the remaining (N-1) candies among the k-1 bags. For the latter, there are P(N-k) ways to distribute N-k candies among k bags, which is the recursive relationship: P(N) = P(N-1) + P(N-k).

7. **Combinatorial Concepts**: These numbers and their relationships are examples of combinatorial concepts that are used to solve problems in a variety of fields including mathematics, computer science, statistics, and more.

8. **Upcoming Lecture**: The next lecture will delve deeper into the combinatorics of combinations by exploring Pascal's Triangle, which visualizes binomial coefficients and has many beautiful properties and applications.

In summary, this lecture provided an overview of several important combinatorial numbers and their relationships, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of combinatorial patterns and structures in the next lecture.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/04. Pascal's Triangle and the Binomial Theorem.txt
1. **Blaise Pascal's Problem:** A and B are playing a game where the first to win five points wins $100. Currently, A leads 9 to 8. They need to decide how to split $100 if the next flip results in a tie (9-9).

2. **Recursive Approach:** Pascal thought about this recursively. If A wins the next flip, they'll either end with A winning $100 or splitting $50 each. If B wins the next flip, they'll play another round, which is a tie (9-9), and then split $100. The average of these two scenarios is fair, leading to $75 for A and $25 for B.

3. **Expected Values Approach:** Pascal also considered the probability of A winning the match outright after the next flip (3/4) versus it going to another round (1/4). Since A has a 3/4 chance of winning the entire $100, it's fair for A to receive three-quarters of the money and B one-quarter. This also results in $75 for A and $25 for B.

4. **Equally Likely Outcomes Approach:** Pascal considered all possible outcomes if they played two more games (for a total of four games). There are 64 possible outcomes, and A wins 42 of them, while B wins 22. This leads to A receiving 42/64 of the $100 and B receiving 22/64 of the $100, which is approximately $65.62 for A and $34.37 for B.

5. **Final Settlement:** To determine who gets that extra half a cent, Pascal might suggest flipping a coin, as it's the most straightforward way to resolve such a small discrepancy.

In summary, Pascal solved the problem using different mathematical approaches, all leading to a fair division of the $100 between A and B, taking into account the probability of each outcome and the expected value of the game. The exact split would be $65.625 for A and $34.375 for B, with any remainder resolved by flipping a coin.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/05. Advanced Combinatorics—Multichoosing.txt
1. **Combinatorial Principles**: Combinatorics involves counting, arranging, or systematically determining the number of ways in which a set of objects can be partitioned into subsets or arranged into sequences, with an emphasis on listing, enumerating, and organizing combinations of items from a larger set of possibilities.

2. **Permutations vs. Combinations**: Permutations are arrangements where order matters, while combinations are selections where order does not matter.

3. **Basic Combinatorial Formulas**:
   - Permutations (order matters): \( nPk = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \)
   - Combinations (order does not matter): \( nCk = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \)

4. **Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**: A way to calculate the number of ways to choose elements from a set, accounting for overlaps between subsets. It helps to avoid overcounting when some elements are shared by different subsets.

5. **Binomial Theorem**: An extension of Pascal's Triangle, which provides a way to expand expressions like \((x + y)^n\) into a sum of terms involving binomial coefficients.

6. **Multinomial Coefficients**: A generalization of the binomial coefficient for cases where there are more than two categories or choices. It allows for the enumeration of ways to distribute n items among k distinct categories or containers. The formula is given by \( \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot ... \cdot n_k!} \), where \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i = n \).

7. **No Coincidences**: Every result or occurrence in combinatorics is the result of a deliberate calculation or principle, and there are no 'coincidental' ways to solve combinatorial problems.

8. **Example Applications**:
   - Distributing candies to four people in specific quantities.
   - Spelling words like "comic" or "combination" with different colored letters.
   - Using the principles of combinatorics to answer questions about arrangements and selections.

9. **Final Takeaway**: Combinatorics is a systematic discipline that relies on clear principles to solve problems related to counting, arranging, and systematically determining possibilities from a larger set of options. It is a fundamental area in mathematics with wide-ranging applications.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/06. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.txt
1. **Problem Statement**: You have N homeworks to return to N students at random. You want to calculate the probability that no student gets their own homework back.

2. **Initial Approach**: You might first think there are N! (N factorial) ways to distribute the homeworks, but you need to subtract the scenarios where each student gets their own homework back one by one.

3. **Constraints**: Each student must get their own homework back exactly once. So, for student 1, you have (N - 1)! ways to distribute the remaining homeworks. For students 2 through N, you similarly subtract (N - k)! for each student k, but only after including all pairs of students (which adds back two times the scenarios where those two students get their own homework back), all triples (adding back three times the scenarios), and so on.

4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: This principle is used to include and exclude different scenarios without overcounting or undercounting. In this case, it's used to subtract the scenarios where multiple students get their own homework back from the total number of distributions.

5. **Summation Notation**: The final probability calculation can be expressed using summation notation as:
   \[\sum_{k=0}^{N} (-1)^k \frac{N!}{k! (N - k)!}\]
   This represents the alternating sum of the fractions where \( k \) homeworks are returned to \( k \) different students.

6. **Simplification**: By breaking down \( N! \) into its factorial components, the formula simplifies to:
   \[D_N = \frac{1}{N! \sum_{k=0}^{N} (-1)^k \frac{1}{k! (N - k)!}}\]
   As \( N \) becomes large, this fraction approaches 1 over E (approximately 0.367879).

7. **Moral**: The principle of inclusion-exclusion is a powerful tool in probability theory and can simplify seemingly complex problems into more manageable forms. For large values of N, the probability that nobody gets their own homework back is approximately 1 over E, which is a constant value not dependent on N.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/07. Proofs—Inductive, Geometric, Combinatorial.txt
1. **SquareSum Identity**: We demonstrated that the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers is equal to the square of n. This pattern was visually illustrated with a geometric proof, where arranging squares of side lengths 1 through n in a certain way forms a larger rectangle whose area equals n^2.

2. **Diagonal Sums and Fibonacci Numbers**: We discussed how summing the diagonals from a given row (or column) in Pascal's triangle yields the Fibonacci numbers. This was explained using combinatorial reasoning, where the sum of the binomial coefficients from the nth row of Pascal's triangle equals the nth Fibonacci number (F(n)).

3. **Combinatorial Proof for Diagonal Sums**: A combinatorial proof was sketched that involves counting the number of ways to tile a sequence of n objects with a combination of dominoes and squares, where k represents the number of dominoes used in the tiling. The total number of tiles (dominoes plus squares) is (n - k), and we choose k out of these (n - k) tiles to be dominoes, which can be done in (n - k) choose k ways. This approach shows that there are exactly F(n) such tilings.

4. **Induction as a Foundation**: While direct proof techniques like combinatorial and geometric proofs are preferred for their elegance, many of these proofs are ultimately based on principles established by induction. For example, the proof that Fibonacci numbers are counted by tilings uses an inductive argument.

5. **Future Explorations**: The lecture hinted at the versatility of the Fibonacci sequence and binomial coefficients in counting various kinds of combinatorial objects, such as tilings with tiles of different lengths or colors, or even on non-standard shapes like circles. In our next lecture, we will use induction to explore a fundamental formula for Fibonacci numbers and delve into algebraic proof techniques that apply to broader combinatorial problems.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/08. Linear Recurrences and Fibonacci Numbers.txt
1. **Lucas Numbers and Fibonacci Numbers**: We've seen that Lucas numbers, which are closely related to Fibonacci numbers, can be expressed using a Benet formula similar to that of the Fibonacci numbers but without involving the square root of 5. This leads to interesting patterns and relationships between these two sets of numbers.

2. **Combinatorial Interpretation**: The Lucas numbers count the number of ways to tile a circular strip (a "bracelet") of length n using squares and dominoes. This combinatorial interpretation explains why there is a direct connection between Luca numbers and Fibonacci numbers.

3. **Tiling Patterns**: We discovered that if you multiply the nth Fibonacci number by the nth Lucas number, you obtain the nth Fibonacci number for 2n (twice the length of the original strip). This is because 5 out of those 7 tilings can be straightened out at the clasp, and two of them have a domino covering the clasp.

4. **Lucas Numbers as a Sum of Two Fibonacci Numbers**: We can express each Lucas number as the sum of two adjacent Fibonacci numbers (f_n + f_{n-2}). This relationship is not coincidental but follows from a combinatorial argument about bracelet tilings.

5. **Counting and Discrete Mathematics**: Combinatorics, a branch of discrete mathematics, often provides a counting perspective on problems that might not initially appear to be about counting. It shows us that counting can be applied in various contexts beyond just enumerating simple sets.

6. **Further Exploration**: The patterns and relationships we've explored in the context of Luca numbers and Fibonacci numbers are just a glimpse into the rich field of combinatorics. In our next exploration, number theory, we will delve deeper into the properties and behaviors of integers and explore their intrinsic beauty without being confined to counting applications.

7. **Transition to Number Theory**: The insights gained from combinatorics will serve as a foundation for understanding many concepts in number theory, which is another major topic in discrete mathematics that deals with the properties of numbers themselves.

In summary, the relationship between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers illustrates how counting can reveal deep patterns and connections between different mathematical objects. The combinatorial approach to solving problems provides a powerful tool for understanding and addressing a wide range of questions in discrete mathematics, paving the way for more complex explorations in number theory.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/09. Gateway to Number Theory—Divisibility.txt
1. We discussed the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and how Euclid's algorithm not only finds the GCD but also finds integer combinations that produce it, as described by Bézout's theorem.

2. The Euclidean algorithm is efficient; Lame proved that for numbers A and B where A > B, the algorithm will find their GCD in under five log(B) steps. This makes it very fast even for large numbers.

3. We explored how to intentionally slow down Euclid's algorithm by choosing specific numbers. The worst case for Euclid is presented by 89 and 55, which will take the most steps to find their GCD.

4. A fascinating property of Fibonacci numbers was introduced: any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1). Additionally, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the nth and mth Fibonacci numbers is the GCD of the numbers n and m itself, with a particularly beautiful result being that the GCD of the 90th and 20th Fibonacci numbers is always the 10th Fibonacci number.

5. We previewed the concept that every integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic), which we will explore further in the next lecture to understand how prime numbers serve as multiplicative building blocks for all integers. This is a key component in number theory and has profound implications, particularly in cryptography and other areas of mathematics.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/10. The Structure of Numbers.txt
1. **Gaussian Integers**: These are complex numbers of the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, and \(i\) is the imaginary unit with the property that \(i^2 = -1\). Gaussian integers can be added, subtracted, and multiplied just like regular integers. A Gaussian integer is a unit (like 1, -1, i, or -i), if it cannot be factored into smaller Gaussian integers other than units. Otherwise, it's composite.

2. **Gaussian Primes**: These are Gaussian integers that are not units and cannot be factored into smaller Gaussian integers. An example of a Gaussian prime is \(2 + i\). The set of Gaussian primes forms a pattern with eight-fold symmetry within the complex plane, where the squares representing primes are about 31 units away from the origin.

3. **Prime Densities**: In the realm of integers (real numbers), there can be stretches without any primes if you limit your search to a small radius. However, in the Gaussian integers, if you are limited to jumps of at most a certain distance (like 5 units), there will eventually be a stretch where you cannot hop from one prime to another. If you can jump farther (like 10 units), it's still an open question whether you would eventually get stuck.

4. **Unique Factorization**: The Gaussian integers, like the integers, satisfy unique factorization, meaning that every non-unit Gaussian integer can be factored into a product of Gaussian primes, and this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors.

5. **Irrational Numbers**: The fundamental theorem of arithmetic even has implications for irrational numbers. An example given was the proof that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational by contradiction. The proof assumes that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational, expressed as \(a/b\), and then examines the exponents of 2 in both \(a^2\) and \(2b^2\), leading to a contradiction since one exponent must be even while the other must be odd. This proves that \(\sqrt{2}\) is indeed irrational.

In the next lecture, we will explore further the properties of even and odd numbers and the pigeonhole principle, which are fundamental concepts in number theory and combinatorics.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/11. Two Principles—Pigeonholes and Parity.txt
1. **The Setup**: You are initially placed on a card with a vowel (which is on a light square because all vowels in the English alphabet correspond to odd positions in the sequence, e.g., A=1, E=5, I=9, etc.).
   
2. **The Rule**: You can only move to an adjacent card (horizontally or vertically), and you cannot land on empty space.

3. **The Trick**: By alternating the removal of dark cards and instructing you to make specific moves (1+2+3 moves, then 3 more moves, etc.), the presenter was able to deduce your position based on parity (the property of having an even or odd number of elements). Since vowels are always on light squares and you started on a vowel, after any even number of moves, you would still be on a light square.

4. **The Execution**: The presenter knew that after six moves (1 initial move plus 5 subsequent moves), you would have to be on a light square because you started on one and even numbers result in a return to the starting color. By strategically removing cards, the presenter ensured that your only options were cards adjacent to the parrot card (P).

5. **The Conclusion**: The presenter predicted that after following the instructions, you would end up on the parrot card (P), which is also on a light square. This was confirmed by the trick's conclusion.

6. **The Mathematical Insight**: The trick relies on understanding parity and how it applies to sequences of moves on a grid where each step changes your position from a light square to a dark square or vice versa.

7. **The Final Reveal**: The parrot card (P) is the final destination after following the sequence of moves, with the knowledge that all vowels are on light squares and that an even number of moves would keep you on a light square.

This trick demonstrates how mathematical properties like parity can be used to create interesting and seemingly complex puzzles or illusions of choice.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/12. Modular Arithmetic—The Math of Remainders.txt
1. In modular arithmetic, division is not as straightforward as addition, subtraction, or multiplication because the result may not be an integer. You cannot always cancel terms from both sides of a congruence like you can with an equality.

2. The cancellation theorem states that if AX is congruent to AY mod M, and A and M are relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), then X is congruent to Y mod M. This means that you can "cancel" A from both sides of the congruence under the condition that A is relatively prime to M.

3. A number A has a multiplicative inverse mod M if and only if A and M are relatively prime. The multiplicative inverse is unique mod M, meaning if there are two numbers X and Y such that AX ≡ 1 (mod M) and AY ≡ 1 (mod M), then X must be equal to Y mod M.

4. Wilson's theorem provides a method to determine if a number N is prime: N is prime if and only if (N-1)! ≡ -1 (mod N). This theorem allows us to check for primality without finding explicit factors, but calculating (N-1)! can be computationally intensive for large N.

5. In our next lecture, we will explore efficient methods for computing powers and their applications in modular arithmetic, as well as look into practical applications such as prime testing, card shuffling analysis, and estimating the size of large armies like that of China, which are all based on principles of congruences and modular arithmetic.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/13. Enormous Exponents and Card Shuffling.txt
1. **Seed Planting Method**: This method involves starting with a base number (like 6), squaring it repeatedly until you reach the desired exponent (in this case, 83). At each red number (every other square number), you add another 6 to the product before squaring again. This works because when you eventually reach the last red number (16 in this case), the number that has been added at each step will have been squared exactly the same number of times as the base number, thus contributing to the final result.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: Instead of calculating large powers directly, we can use modular exponentiation to compute A^N mod M more efficiently. This involves reducing the intermediate results at each step by M to prevent overflow and keep the numbers manageable.

3. **Finding a Lucky Exponent (D)**: If there exists an exponent D such that A^D ≡ 1 (mod M), then A raised to any power N can be simplified mod M by first computing A^(N mod (M-1)) mod M and then raising the result to the power of D mod (M-1). This is because (A^N / A) ≡ A^(N mod (M-1)) (mod M), and if A^D ≡ 1, then (A^N / A) ≡ A^(N mod (M-1)) - A^((N mod (M-1)) D) ≡ A^(N mod (M-1)) * (-A^D) ≡ 0 (mod M), so A^(N mod (M-1)) is the result we're looking for.

4. **Efficiency**: The seed planting method and modular exponentiation are efficient ways to calculate large powers mod M, especially when dealing with very large numbers where direct computation would be impractical.

5. **Lucky Exponent**: Finding a lucky exponent D for which A^D ≡ 1 (mod M) can significantly speed up the calculation of A^N mod M, as it reduces the number of multiplications needed. This is particularly useful when the modulus M is prime.

6. **Prime Testing**: In future lectures, we will explore methods for determining if a big number is prime using modular arithmetic and raising numbers to large powers, which are essential tools in number theory.

In summary, the seed planting method is a powerful technique for efficiently calculating large powers mod M, and it can be made even more efficient when we find an exponent D such that A^D ≡ 1 (mod M), allowing us to simplify our calculations significantly. This method is not only useful for solving problems but also provides insight into the principles behind modular exponentiation and prime testing in number theory.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/14. Fermat's ''Little'' Theorem and Prime Testing.txt
1. **Fermat's Theorem**: If `p` is a prime number, then for any integer `a`, `a^p − a` is an integer that is divisible by `p`. In other words, `a^p ≡ a (mod p)`.

2. **Converse of Fermat's Theorem**: If `n` is an integer and there exists an integer `a` such that `a^n ≠ a (mod n)`, then `n` is composite (not prime). This is the basis for the Fermat primality test.

3. **Fermat Primality Test**: To test if a number `n` might be prime, we can pick a base `a` and compute `a^n mod n`. If the result is not equal to `a`, then `n` is definitely composite. If the result is equal to `a`, then `n` may still be composite (it's a pseudo-prime).

4. **Pseudo-Primes**: Numbers that pass the Fermat primality test but are not actually prime, known as base `a` pseudo-primes. An example of a base 2 pseudo-prime is `341`, which is composite (3×11×17), and an example of a Carmichael number, which is a pseudo-prime for all bases, is `561` (3×11×17)—it's composite but behaves like a prime.

5. **Carmichael Numbers**: A class of numbers that are pseudo-primes for all non-zero integers `a`. The smallest Carmichael number is `561`, and there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers, although they are rare among smaller numbers.

6. **Improvements to Fermat's Test**: To avoid false positives from Carmichael numbers and other pseudo-primes, the Fermat primality test can be modified or combined with other tests like the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is probabilistic but more reliable for large numbers.

7. **Application to Public Key Cryptography**: In our next lecture, we will apply these concepts of prime testing and Euler's theorem to discuss public key cryptography, a method used for secure data transmission over insecure channels. The mathematical underpinnings of this technique are both elegant and highly practical.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/15. Open Secrets—Public Key Cryptography.txt
1. **Historical Context**: In 1729, Christian Goldbach posed a problem to Leonhard Euler based on a conjecture by Pierre de Fermat. Fermat had observed that the numbers \(2^n^2 + 1\) for \(n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4\) were all prime (now known as Fermat primes). He conjectured that this was always true.

2. **Euler's Disproof**: Euler disproved Fermat's conjecture by finding that \(2^{5^2} + 1\), which is 6,700,417 times 641, is not prime. This counter-example was found mentally by Euler, and it sparked his lifelong interest in number theory.

3. **Gauss's Contribution**: Carl Friedrich Gauss solved a problem proposed by Euclid regarding the construction of regular polygons using ruler and compass. He discovered that such a polygon could be constructed for any \(n\) that is a power of 2 multiplied by a product of distinct Fermat primes.

4. **Hardy and Ramanujan**: G.H. Hardy visited Srinivasa Ramanujan in the hospital and mentioned that the taxi number, 1729, seemed unremarkable from a mathematical standpoint. Ramanujan pointed out that it was significant because it's the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: \(10^3 + 9^3\) and \(12^3 + 1^3\).

5. **Modern Applications**: Today, we have various cryptographic systems, such as public key cryptography and digital signatures, which rely on the principles of number theory that were explored by mathematicians like Euler, Fermat, Gauss, and Ramanujan.

6. **Appreciation for Numbers**: The story of 1729 and the lives and contributions of these mathematicians illustrate the depth and beauty found in numbers, showing that their applications are far-reaching and more fascinating than ever imagined by these great minds.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/16. The Birth of Graph Theory.txt
1. **Eulerian Paths and Circuits**: An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. If such a path starts and ends at the same vertex, it's called an Eulerian circuit. A graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex has an even degree (the sum of the degrees of all vertices is even) and the graph is connected.

2. **The Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This ancient algorithm allows us to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.

3. **Bridges of Konigsberg**: The problem led Euler to formulate the principles of Eulerian paths and circuits, solving a problem that had puzzled people for centuries.

4. **Eulerian Tour Problem**: If a graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree, it's possible to draw a trail from one of these vertices to the other that uses every edge exactly once.

5. **De Bruijn Sequences**: These are sequences that contain all binary words (or more generally, all code words) of a given length as consecutive substrings. They can be constructed using Eulerian graphs where each vertex represents a word of length n-1, and every vertex has two edges entering and leaving it.

6. **Hamiltonian Graphs**: A Hamiltonian graph is one that contains at least one cycle (Hamiltonian circuit) that visits every vertex exactly once. This concept is different from Eulerian graphs, which are about using all the edges in a graph.

7. **Future Topics**: In upcoming lectures, we will explore how matrices can be used to represent and solve problems involving systems of linear equations and to analyze paths and circuits in graphs, among other applications. The concept of matrix multiplication and its implications for computing the product of two paths in a graph will be discussed.

8. **Complexity and Algorithms**: We'll delve deeper into the complexity of determining whether a graph is Hamiltonian and how algorithms can be used to solve such problems, which may lead to discussions on P vs NP problems and computational complexity classes.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/17. Ways to Walk—Matrices and Markov Chains.txt
1. **Markov Chains and Equilibrium**: We discussed how Markov chains can model systems where the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. The equilibrium of a Markov chain is the set of probabilities for each possible state such that applying the transition matrix to this set of probabilities results in the same set of probabilities. This is analogous to a stationary distribution where the system settles into and remains at these steady-state probabilities over time.

2. **Two-State Weather Example**: We used a simple two-state Markov chain model to predict the weather, considering only 'sunny' or 'cloudy' scenarios. We showed that after a few transitions (one-third of the way through the states if we consider two-thirds and one-third as the steady state), the probabilities would not change if we applied the transition matrix again, indicating that the system had reached equilibrium.

3. **Extending the Model**: We discussed how a more accurate weather prediction model could be constructed using a larger Markov chain with four states, representing the weather conditions for the last two days. This model would be more complex due to additional transitions and states but would still reach an equilibrium where the probabilities remain constant over time.

4. **Applications of Markov Chains**: We mentioned various applications of Markov chains in different fields such as modeling population dynamics, genetics, stock prices, and games like Blackjack. The common theme across these applications is that they all involve systems where future states are dependent on the current state.

5. **Google's PageRank Algorithm**: A notable application of Markov chains is the Google PageRank algorithm used to determine a web page's importance by analyzing the worldwide web as a directed graph and calculating the equilibrium probabilities for random surfers moving across the web.

6. **Future Lecture**: We previewed the concept of applying graph theory to social networks, where we can model interactions between individuals or groups within a network and analyze how these interactions influence the network's structure and dynamics.

In summary, Markov chains provide a powerful framework for modeling systems with transition probabilities between states, and their equilibrium behavior is key to understanding and predicting future states in various real-world scenarios.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/18. Social Networks and Stable Marriages.txt
1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Perfect Matchings**: The number of perfect matchings (complete set of edges that pair each vertex exactly once) in the two by N grid graph is given by the Nth Fibonacci number, F(N). This is because when you cut a perfect matching horizontally in half, you get a one by N board with squares and dominoes, and the number of ways to arrange these on a one by N strip is also a Fibonacci number.

2. **No Perfect Matchings for Odd M x N Grids**: For an M x N grid graph where both M and N are odd, there are no perfect matchings because you cannot have an even number of edges (since the total number of vertices is odd, you cannot pair them up into matching sets).

3. **Non-Perfect Matchings in General**: The number of non-perfect matchings in an M x N grid graph is not known for all cases and is a complex problem due to the vast number of possible non-perfect matchings.

4. **Structural Balance Problem**: This problem explores how social relationships can lead to stable or polarized societies, where everyone either ends up being friends with everyone else or ends up in two opposing groups with no intermediates. This can be demonstrated using graph theory.

5. **Paul Erdős and Collaboration Graph**: Paul Erdős was a highly prolific mathematician who collaborated with over 500 other mathematicians. The Erdős number is a way to measure the social connections between mathematicians based on their collaborations, with Erdős himself having an Erdős number of zero.

6. **Erdős Number as a Social Metric**: The Erdős number reflects the concept that in a small world scenario, any two people are likely to be connected by a relatively small chain of mutual acquaintances. In mathematics, this concept is represented in the collaboration graph, where each vertex represents a mathematician and edges connect collaborators.

7. **Personal Connection**: The speaker mentions their own Erdős number is three, indicating they are three connections away from Paul Erdős through collaborative work. They invite any viewers with an Erdős number of one to contact them for a potential collaboration.

In summary, the course discusses applications of graph theory in understanding social structures and relationships, both in terms of perfect matchings within grid graphs and the broader implications of how people interact and form groups, as exemplified by the structural balance problem. Additionally, it highlights the importance of collaboration and networking in mathematics through the concept of the Erdős number.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/19. Tournaments and King Chickens.txt
1. **Tournaments with an Odd Number of Players:** In any tournament with an odd number of players, every player can win against exactly half of the other players, and in doing so, becomes a "king." This is because there are an equal number of players who lose to each king, ensuring that every player has the same out degree (the number of edges coming out from a vertex). Therefore, in such a tournament, every player is both a king chicken (every edge enters exactly one additional edge) and a king turkey (there is exactly one edge leaving exactly one additional edge).

2. **Tournaments with an Even Number of Players:** Similarly, for any even number of players, it's still possible for everyone to be a "king." By adding two new players to the tournament and arranging the matches so that each player beats the new players, and the new players beat each other, we maintain the condition where every player can reach every other player in at most two steps. This means that all players are kings in this extended tournament.

3. **Existence of Tournaments with Exactly K Kings:** For any given values of K (between 1 and N, where N is the total number of players) and N, there exists a tournament with exactly K kings. The proof for this is by constructing a larger tournament based on a smaller one that already has K kings. We simply add additional players to the existing tournament, ensuring that these new players lose to all the existing kings and do not win against each other.

4. **Future Exploration:** After discussing the properties of tournaments, we can explore more complex directed graphs, where some players may not play each other or where some teams might play each other multiple times. In the next lecture, we will shift our focus to undirected graphs with weights on the edges, specifically examining trees and their applications. Trees are fundamental structures in graph theory and serve as a foundational concept for understanding many types of networks. They are simple, yet powerful and efficient, and are used to model various real-world phenomena.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/20. Weighted Graphs and Minimum Spanning Trees.txt
1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** An MST is the smallest possible tree that connects all vertices in a weighted graph. The most common algorithm to find an MST is Prim's algorithm for general graphs and Kruskal's algorithm for graphs without cycles.

2. **Greedy Algorithm:** Both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are greedy algorithms as they add edges one by one based on their weight, ensuring at each step that the minimum weight edge is selected.

3. **Weight of T and T*:** Given two trees T and T*, if the weight of EK in T is less than the weight of E* in T*, then T must be lighter than T*. However, T* claims to be the MST, which would mean it has no unnecessary edges. This contradiction implies that T*, despite its claims, cannot be the MST, and T must be the MST.

4. **Determinant and Spanning Trees:** The number of spanning trees in a graph G can be calculated using the determinant of a specific matrix derived from G. This matrix is created by taking the adjacency matrix A of G and subtracting a diagonal matrix D, where each diagonal entry is the degree of the corresponding vertex in G. After removing the last row and column of this resulting matrix (D - A), the determinant of this modified matrix gives the number of spanning trees of G.

5. **Network Efficiency and Redundancy:** Trees are efficient but vulnerable. In network design, it's important to ensure redundancy by allowing cycles or multiple edges between vertices to maintain connectivity in case some edges fail.

6. **Poem: "Trees"** A poem written to encapsulate the beauty and efficiency of trees (spanning trees) in graph theory. It highlights the unique nature of trees and their role in connecting all vertices while remaining efficient and proving theorems.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/21. Planarity—When Can a Graph Be Untangled.txt
1. **Planar Graphs**: These are graphs that can be drawn on a plane without any edges intersecting except at their endpoints. The Kuratowski Theorem states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on five vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with three vertices on one side and four on the other).

2. **k5 and k3,3**: These are two specific examples of non-planar graphs. K5 has five vertices and five edges, while k3,3 has six vertices and nine edges. They are the simplest non-planar graphs and any non-planar graph must contain either a subgraph that is a subdivision of k5 or k3,3.

3. **Euler's Theorem**: This theorem states that for any connected planar graph, the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) are related by V - E + F = 2. This can be used to determine the number of faces in a planar graph given the number of vertices and edges.

4. **Edge-Face Incidence Matrix**: This is a matrix that can represent an undirected graph G, where each row corresponds to an edge in G and each column corresponds to a face (or region) in the plane embedding of G. The presence of an edge in a face is represented by a 1 in the corresponding cell of the matrix, and its absence by a 0.

5. **Subdivision of a Graph**: A subdivision of a graph G is obtained by replacing some edges of G with paths of longer lengths (i.e., adding internal vertices to the edges). The resulting graph retains the same vertex set as G, and any new vertices introduced have exactly two neighbors.

6. **Kurotowski's Theorem**: This theorem states that a graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3. This theorem characterizes all non-planar graphs and is a fundamental result in graph theory.

7. **Graph Notation**: The 'k' in the names k5 and k3,3 does not stand for "complete" but is an honorific for Kazimierz Kuratowski, the mathematician who helped prove the Kuratowski theorem.

8. **Future Topics**: The concepts of planar graphs are crucial in understanding map coloring, leading to the four-color theorem, which states that any planar map can be colored using at most four colors such that no two adjacent regions share the same color. This theorem has implications in various fields, including computer science and mathematics.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/22. Coloring Graphs and Maps.txt
1. **Chromatic Polynomial**: The number of proper colorings of a graph with at most k colors for any tree with n vertices is given by a polynomial called the chromatic polynomial of that tree, denoted as P(G, k). For a tree T with n vertices, it's P(T, k) = k*(k-1)^(n-1).

2. **Properties of Chromatic Polynomial**:
   - It's an nth degree polynomial in k.
   - The leading coefficient is always 1 for any graph.
   - The next term has a negative coefficient equal to the number of edges in the graph (for trees, this is n-1).
   - The terms alternate between positive and negative.

3. **Chromatic Number**: The smallest positive integer k for which P(G, k) > 0 is called the chromatic number of G, denoted as χ(G). It represents the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

4. **Chromatic Polynomial and Directed Cycles**: The value f of -1 in the chromatic polynomial tells us how many ways we can orient the edges of the graph so that there are no directed cycles, which is equivalent to finding a tournament representation of the graph.

5. **Bipartite Graphs**: A graph is bipartite if it's possible to partition its vertices into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. It can be easily determined whether a graph is bipartite by greedily coloring the graph with two colors, ensuring no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

6. **The Four Color Theorem**: It's known that any planar graph (a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing) can be properly colored using at most four colors, but the exact number of colors required cannot be determined from the structure of the graph alone. A graph is planar if it can be embedded in the plane so that no two edges intersect except at their endpoints.

7. **The Millennium Prize Problems**: One of the seven Millennium Prize Problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute is the P vs NP problem. If someone could find an efficient algorithm to determine whether a large arbitrary planar graph can be properly colored using just three colors, they would win a million dollars and worldwide fame.

8. **Coloring Complexity**: Determining if a graph requires three or more colors for proper coloring can be a complex problem. It's easy to prove that some graphs, like the United States graph, are not three colorable. However, for other graphs, especially large ones, it can be a significant computational challenge.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/23. Shortest Paths and Algorithm Complexity.txt
1. **P vs NP**: The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open problems in computer science. It's not a decision problem but an equality statement that if a polynomial time solution exists for any NP-complete problem, then all problems in NP can be solved efficiently. A $1 million prize is offered for a proof or disproof of this conjecture by the Clay Mathematical Institute.

2. **NP-hard vs NP-complete**: NP-hard problems are problems that are at least as hard as any problem in NP, but not all NP-hard problems are in NP (they might not have a solution to verify). NP-complete problems are both NP-hard and in NP.

3. **Efficient Solutions**: Even if a problem is NP-hard, there can be polynomial time algorithms that approximate solutions reasonably well. For example, the Hamiltonian cycle problem for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) can be approximated within a certain percent of optimality.

4. **Graph Theory and Combinatorics**: Problems in graph theory, like finding all possible matches in a complete bipartite graph (K44), can be straightforward when no edges are removed. However, if some edges are removed, the problem of counting exact matches becomes a sharp P-complete problem, which is believed to be as hard as any NP-complete problem but not necessarily in NP.

5. **Number Theory and Cryptography**: Factoring large composite numbers is a hard problem, believed to be outside P, which underpins the security of many cryptographic systems. In contrast, checking whether a number is prime (primality testing) is an easy problem, solvable in polynomial time, as proven by three Indian mathematicians, two of whom were undergraduates at the time.

6. **Future Directions**: In our final lecture, we will recap what we've learned and discuss how discrete mathematics applies to various fields, including cryptography, optimization, algorithm design, and beyond. We'll also touch upon the significance of recent breakthroughs in number theory, such as the primality testing result.

In summary, while many problems in discrete mathematics are computationally hard, there are efficient ways to find near-optimal solutions, and some problems have recently been solved efficiently, advancing our understanding of what's possible within the realm of computational complexity.

Checking Discrete Mathematics/24. The Magic of Discrete Mathematics.txt
1. **Prime Numbers and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**: We began by discussing prime numbers and how every integer greater than 1 either is a prime itself or can be factored into a product of primes, as stated by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

2. **Fermat's Last Theorem**: We explored Fermat's Last Theorem, which was famously proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994 after centuries of attempted solutions. The theorem states that there are no three positive integers a, b, and c that can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer n greater than 2.

3. **Pell's Equation**: We looked at Pell's equation, which is x^2 - D*y^2 = 1, where D is a positive integer not divisible by the square of a prime. Solutions to this equation are important in the construction of certain types of rulers and in the approximation of square roots.

4. **Continued Fractions**: Continued fractions were introduced as an alternative way to express the solutions to linear Diophantine equations, which are equations that have integer coefficients and for which integer solutions are sought.

5. **Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem**: We delved into Euler's pentagonal number theorem, which provides a recurrence relation for calculating the nth prime number (p(n)). This recurrence involves adding and subtracting terms of the form p(k), where k is of the form 3j^2 ± j over 2, and this process continues until reaching a base case.

6. **Partition Function**: We discussed the partition function, which gives us the number of ways to express n as a sum of positive integers. Unlike prime numbers, partitions do not have a simple generating function or formula, but they are related to the coefficients in the expansion of x to the power of -1 when multiplied by a sine function, as shown in the MacMahon Master Theorem.

7. **Hardy and Ramanujan's Asymptotic Formula for Prime Numbers**: We learned that there is an asymptotic formula for estimating prime numbers, which involves e raised to the power of pi times the square root of 2n over 3, divided by 4n times the cube root of 3.

8. **Final Thoughts**: The course emphasized understanding concepts and problem-solving, with an emphasis on proofs rather than formula manipulation. The skills acquired in this course are applicable to various areas of mathematics and can be beneficial in everyday life and future studies.

In summary, the course covered a range of topics in discrete mathematics, from prime numbers and their properties to more complex problems like solving Pell's equation and understanding Euler's pentagonal number theorem. It also touched on the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers and how this relates to both continuous mathematics and the broader field of mathematical thought. The course aimed to develop logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep appreciation for the elegance and interconnectedness of various branches of mathematics.
