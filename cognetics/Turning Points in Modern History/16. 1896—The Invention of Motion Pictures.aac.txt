Let's start this lecture about motion pictures with two astonishing scenes, taking place
at the same time but one in New York and the other in Paris.
In one, it is April 23, 1896.
We're in bustling New York, in Manhattan.
We're at a vaudeville theater, Coster and Beall's Music Hall.
Today, by the way, this is where the new main Macy's store now sits.
In the darkness, light is projected onto a screen set in a gold-colored frame.
Into our astonishment, we see what looks like a painting but is actually moving.
The movie projector is the vitoscope, produced by the great inventor Thomas Edison.
And as we watch with amazement, we see the most astonishing images, real as life, dancers,
a comic boxing match, and a seaside scene.
In that scene, great waves of water rise up and prepare to crash onto us, soaking us to
the bone.
The audience screams and pulls back, but then no water follows.
It's all on the screen.
Imagine what it felt like to see those moving pictures for the very first time.
Now fade out to scene two.
It is still 1896.
In Paris, a magician named Melies, filming the life of the city, accidentally discovers
special effects.
This is how it happened.
His camera jammed for a while as he was filming a city scene, but then he got it going again.
When he later developed the film, he was astonished by the magic he had accidentally created.
In the film, a bus that was going by, drawn by a horse, all of a sudden turned into a
hearse.
While he had been struggling with his camera, the traffic had moved on and created this
astonishing transformation on screen.
Melies had accidentally discovered special effects and would turn them into an art form
that endures into our own day.
What these scenes from the birth of the movies show is the tremendous potential of motion
pictures, movies mirrored reality, like those waves in the New York film, and created dreams
as in the special effects magic of Melies, and as we'll see later, movies could also
create their own reality, persuading audiences through propaganda.
How is this a true turning point in modern history?
It had a huge impact on how humans viewed themselves and the world around them.
After the invention of polished metal mirrors in antiquity, it was really the development
of motion pictures that revolutionized, once again, how the living, moving human body and
image has been regarded.
In addition, motion pictures gave a kind of immortality to the person captured on screen.
So, by documenting, creating artistic visions, and delivering persuasive statements, whether
aesthetic, or political, or commercial, the image took on an authority and effectiveness
that has transformed our social and public life.
And of course, ultimately, it was this turning point that allowed for the marvelous film
lectures of professors speaking to you as part of the great courses.
Yet motion pictures are really in a kind of succession.
They represent but one very late stage in an overall human urge to observe and represent
and to create, and that urge can be seen from cave paintings to the videos posted on YouTube
in our own times.
In the visual arts, artists over the centuries have sought ways to powerfully render the
realities they perceived.
The movement towards perspective that marked the renaissance was a key moment in that quest,
and painters sought to push that verisimilitude, that likeness to real life ever further.
During the Dutch Golden Age, which we discussed in an earlier lecture, that great painter
Johannes Vermeer apparently used optical equipment to produce just such precise detailed paintings.
While his good friend Lee van Hoek was discovering microorganisms through the microscope, Vermeer
used the so-called Kamura Obscura, the dark chamber.
This is an invention that had been known since classical times, and later was described in
De La Rose and Cyclopédie.
The Kamura Obscura was an optical device that, when light passed through a small hole in
its wall, projected an upside-down image of a scene onto a screen, and there that image
could be traced and copied with perfect perspective and color.
As you can tell from the technical description and the name Kamura, or camera, this was the
precursor to photography.
By the first half of the 19th century, chemical processes were being used to fix and duplicate
those images projected onto a screen.
The photographic image was also a huge transformation in how we saw ourselves in our world, but
moving pictures would be incomparably more so.
And yet, what we call moving pictures are not quite that.
In fact, what we see is the mechanically produced illusion of movement.
Pictures flashing by at sufficient speed seem to us to move, and that's a trick of
the eye.
But how was that accomplished?
Movies in cinema were in fact anticipated in the famous work of the English-born American
photographer Edward Mudridge, who from the 1870s worked on motion studies, as they were
called, of animals and people, using a quick series of exposures to capture and freeze
movement.
While he was working in Palo Alto, California, Mudridge was asked to settle a bet by someone
we met in an earlier lecture.
This was the former governor of California, Leland Stanford, who back in 1869 swung at
the last spike of the Transcontinental Railroad and apparently missed, and who also later
founded Stanford University at Palo Alto.
At the time, most people thought that a horse, as it galloped, always had at least one foot
on the ground, but Stanford offered Muybridge $25,000 to prove that it did not.
Muybridge worked for years to get the shutter speed and technique just right to photograph
a running horse.
In the process, he created the technology for motion pictures and helped win the bet.
At this time, other inventors were also working on systems to capture motions.
The Lumière brothers, Louis and Auguste, fused the process of filming and projecting
a film in early 1895.
In films of usually just a minute in length, they captured scenes of everyday life and
showed these to small audiences in Paris cafes as sort of a small entertainment.
But the brothers perhaps did not really foresee the medium's full potential because one of
them called it an invention without a future.
In America, the inventor Thomas Edison had a very different perspective.
He saw this medium as one that had a future and one that would last.
In the United States, Edison bought and improved a projector created by the inventors Thomas
Armot and Charles Francis Jenkins.
Edison renamed it the Vitoscope.
Soon, Edison's studio was turning out a wide range of short movies that appealed
to an ever broader public.
Who was this man?
Edison is a fascinating and yet ultimately elusive character.
He was a genius without much in the way of formal education.
A charismatic but remote man.
An entrepreneur capable as it turns out of considerable brutality when it came to competition.
But above all, Edison was the man who invented the inventor as a cultural ideal.
Edison was born in Ohio in 1847 and raised in Port Huron, Michigan.
As a youth, Edison largely educated himself after some disastrous experiences with formal
schooling.
When Edison wasn't blowing up his parents' house with chemical experiments, he was reading
Thomas Paine's Age of Reason, which he later recalled as a decisive moment of enlightenment
in his own life.
Edison struggled with deafness, that grew worse as he grew older, but he overcame it
in remarkable ways.
Starting as a telegrapher, he moved on to becoming a full-time tinkerer with technology.
Edison produced a cascade of inventions, many around in new forms today, like the electrical
vote recorder, the mimeograph machine, the microphone, and the phonograph to record the
human voice.
Edison also invented, see if you can spot the pattern here, an improved stock ticker,
an improved typewriter, improved telegraph technology, and in fact he was so besotted
with the telegraph that he nicknamed his children dot and dash after Morse code.
He also invented an improved telephone, improved electrical networks, improved dynamos, and
improved storage batteries.
This was classic Edison.
He used earlier inventions of others in new ways, innovating how technology was organized.
As Edison himself put it, I start where the last man left off.
By the end of his life, Edison held more than a thousand patents.
First of all, Edison invented the research laboratory.
He set up his famous workshop that never slept, as the phrase went, in 1876 in Menlo Park,
New Jersey, 25 miles southwest of New York City.
It was the first of its kind.
It came to be called an invention factory.
Edison came to be nicknamed the Wizard of Menlo Park or the New Jersey Columbus.
In this laboratory in 1879, Edison abolished centuries of nighttime darkness by perfecting
the incandescent light bulb.
At a stroke, his improved light bulb altered daily routines that earlier had been ruled
by the sun, and in the process he overthrew the kingdom of night and its darkness.
Clearly, Edison was the very archetype of the genius inventor.
There had been people who invented before, but Edison made it his calling.
We should say that he invented his job of being a genius inventor.
And this is really a decisive moment for our course.
It's the moment of the arrival of newness as a desirable thing in modernity, which we've
traced throughout our lectures.
Edison sealed the characteristic American obsession with technology and technical solutions
or fixes.
After Edison's direction, films poured forth from the custom-built studio that he maintained.
It was one of the first of its kind.
It wasn't much to look at.
It was a black shack covered in tar paper to keep out the light, but it had some innovations.
It was mounted on a circular track so it could be moved to follow the sunlight.
Edison's group produced, among many other films, films of kittens in a boxing match.
So when you see some unbearably cute YouTube video of something like this, you now know
whom to blame for it, a film of a couple kissing, which was a really saucy sensation at the
time, and the first filmed commercial, Purdue's Scotch Whiskey.
Throughout the country, and increasingly worldwide, these short films were shown, but at first
not to audiences.
Rather, people watched them individually.
In so-called Kinetoscope parlors, or Nickelodeons, viewers actually stood over and craned into
a kind of box reminiscent of the Dutch trunks in the early days of telescopes, telescopes
were called.
Inside these boxes, a film was running continuously, and the viewer who deposited some money would
examine it through a magnifying glass.
So there are shades here of Lee van Hoek and his simple microscopes.
And over time, audiences shifted from individual viewing to collective public viewing.
This opened up an entirely new social sphere, even bigger and more inclusive than the print
culture which Gutenberg's printing press had opened up with the print revolution.
By 1908, there were more than 8,000 Nickelodeons in the United States, and millions were attending
them every day.
These early theaters were lively, bustling places, with continuous showing of films,
with seats often not segregated by class or price, and accessible as a result to poor
audiences as well as the wealthy, showing a huge variety of films.
The overall formula was escapism, to lose oneself in the new stories being told in this
new medium.
In fact, some historians of American immigration see movies as a vital integrating medium for
newcomers newly arrived in the United States.
This emerging public also affected what films were produced.
There was kind of a feedback loop in terms of public taste, because Nickelodeon managers
would stand close by and listen to which features they were showing evoked most enthusiasm from
their audience, and then they'd go out to order more of those.
Moreover, this revolutionary development of movies was global for a world audience.
Because the films were silent at first, without spoken dialogue, they were uniquely accessible
internationally.
Now, if words were needed for some explanatory slide that punctuated the drama, if you imported
the film to another country, it could be easily accomplished to splice in a new slide in the
local language.
So this was radical accessibility.
Recall from an earlier lecture how Diderot's encyclopedia had aimed to be useful and accessible.
How delighted Diderot would have been by this medium, which was even more open for all than
print.
At the same time, we might also say that cinema was developing a kind of language on the spot.
Silent films had to create what amounted to a visual vocabulary that would be understood
and accepted, and it was not identical to traditional theater on the stage.
Let me give some examples.
Thus, cutting back from one scene and then back to another was new.
The use of close-ups in camera angles, for instance, or dissolves as a way of showing
a transition between scenes were all new conventions.
An employee of Edison's, Edwin Porter, created one of the most famous early films,
the 12-minute classic, The Great Train Robbery, in 1903, and it was actually his film that
established many of these techniques we take for granted today.
The man who endowed film with a powerful narrative impulse around this time was the Frenchman
Georges Melies.
Without him, the novelty of short features of some half a minute or less might have faded.
By contrast, Melies told magical stories.
In fact, originally he had been a magician who had been entranced by this new medium
of film.
Melies started showing his own movies in 1896, marked by fantastical images and outlandish
creativity.
He is called the father of special effects.
His most famous film is the 1902 film A Trip to the Moon, in which French astronomers
fly to the moon in the process poking the man in the moon in the eye, and on the moon
they encounter moon creatures before making a spectacular escape back to Earth.
What do we know about how these early films were received?
The first audience reactions are a thing of legend, and it's possible that some exaggeration
has been built up about how the audiences reacted.
Reportedly, early audiences reacted with shock and confusion to some unfamiliar scenes.
All from our opening scene at the start of this lecture in 1896, in Koster and Bial's
music hall, how the public was astonished and fearful at crashing waves coming in from
the sea.
It's also said that when films showed oncoming trains, audiences tended to scatter or duck
down screaming.
In the great train robbery film, there's a scene which is really a non sequitur, right
at the very end, where a cowboy appears, points his pistol at the audience, smiles, and shoots.
It doesn't really play a role in the plot, it was apparently put in just for the thrill
of it.
But consider how quickly audiences assimilated and comprehended the new rules and conventions
of this medium.
Films that were made just a few years later, in fact, actually invited sophisticated film
audiences to laugh at those who were not familiar with the conventions.
One example is a 1902 film made by Edison's group, entitled Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture
Show.
It was actually a remake of a British film that had borne the title, The Countryman's
First Sight of the Animated Pictures.
This is a film about film viewing.
It shows a rustic country bumpkin fellow at a cinema who seriously misunderstands what
movies are.
He tries to dance with a dancer on the screen.
He jumps out of the way of an oncoming train that is actually on screen.
And finally, outraged by the depiction of improper behavior on screen, he smashes up
the place in search of the wrongdoers.
Clearly, the audience was being invited to feel proud about its own progress, being modern
and up-to-date compared to the bumpkin for whom all this was new.
So the movies were the cutting edge of the modern.
Another important point to add is that contrary to the name silent films, they were actually
not silent.
First of all, there were the collective reactions of the audience, ooze and oz or shrieks or
laughs.
Sometimes in addition, live actors lip-synced what was going on on the screen offstage.
Actors sometimes had employees who made sounds for special effects like the clip-clop of
horses riding along.
Many theaters also featured musical accompaniment, not always successfully chosen.
Sometimes an employee would play a piano trying to improvise music to match the film that
was being seen.
Some people called these pianos instruments of torture.
Sometimes the music was wildly inappropriate.
There were complaints at one theater, for instance, when a scene of tragedy was accompanied
by cheerful jazz music.
Globally, each society had its own conventions for how to view film.
In Japan, for instance, Ben Shi were narrators who explained to the audience what was going
on screen, speaking the parts, and sometimes offering comments on the film itself.
In Brazil, a kind of hybrid form evolved where singers sang the parts of musicals that
were silent from behind the screen.
From the very first, the movies raised anxieties about morality.
After all, people of different classes mingled in some theaters.
Unchaperoned youths frequented the movies.
Early blockbuster films like D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation had patently racist messages.
Edison's film of the kiss that we mentioned was soon followed by much racier fare.
In addition, violence in movies was a staple from the very first as well, and not just
in the form of kittens in a boxing ring.
Worries about the powerful effect that movies have on us are with us still.
But films also did tremendous things for the mental horizons of the millions and millions
of people who were making the movies a part of their ordinary lives.
Films showing faraway places and notable people and current events in newsreels revolutionized
modern people's view of their world, making it smaller and seemingly more familiar.
Eventually, this industry came to center on the Dream Factory of Hollywood in Southern
California.
The films Hollywood produced were screened around the country and exported around the
world as of course they still are today.
When they were screened, they were often shown in veritable temples to cinema.
The phrase movie palace has it exactly right for those who can still remember what some
of these beautiful theaters used to look like, created to resemble the Alhambra Palace or
Babylonian temples.
The film also created the modern cult of celebrity, a global level of fame unlike anything seen
before.
Stars like Mary Pickford, Buster Keaton, or Bella Lugosi were recognizable to millions
worldwide.
Recall all the way back in our lecture on the French Revolution how King Louis XVI was
trying to escape the revolution but was recognized by somebody, by a fluke, because that person
had seen printed currency with the king's face.
Well the fame of a movie star was infinitely greater than that of the unfortunate king.
And probably the very best example of movie stardom is still Charlie Chaplin.
He had been a vaudeville actor in England.
But Chaplin went on to completely master film and created his distinctive character,
the Tramp, a disheveled and often anarchic character who makes a mockery of respectability
and propriety and social status, while at the same time evoking a shared humanity that
viewers related to with tremendous intensity.
This celebration of the common man, which was also accompanied by some of the most astonishing
pantomime and physical slapstick, showed that the movies could have a democratizing aspect.
Many comedies also poked fun at authority, similarly like the Keystone Cops series.
In 1936, Charlie Chaplin's film Modern Times was a comic comment on modernity itself.
As Chaplin portrayed the little guy who just battled to survive in a technological, accelerated,
and often inhuman modern society.
But Chaplin, even when he was playing the Tramp, especially when he was playing the Tramp,
was a superstar.
By 1918, he commanded a salary of a million dollars a year.
Innovations continued at breakneck speed and they reconfigured the medium of film again
and again.
To meet calls for censorship in 1922, the studios established their own controlling office,
the so-called Hayes office.
Paradoxically, in this practice, what ended up happening was that the self-policing of
the studios meant that quite a lot of vice could be put on display as long as it was
punished at the end and virtuous triumphant.
And after three and a half decades of silent films, recorded sound came to the movies.
It was met with skepticism at first.
In 1909, an article in the magazine Moving Picture World declared,
�The whole business is unnatural, and nothing that is unnatural will ever last long.�
Sound in practice meant rewiring thousands of cinemas, and it also meant losing the universality
and international accessibility of the earlier silent films.
But sound was here to stay after the 1927 film The Jazz Singer.
Color then arrived in the 1930s, the decade of blockbusters like Gone with the Wind and
Wizard of Oz.
The depression created cravings for escapism.
By 1930, 90 million Americans were watching a movie at least once a week.
Films that are still with us today proliferated.
Comedy, social dramas, westerns, horror films, action pictures, animation.
Especially interesting for our purposes are science fiction films, because they were really
thought experiments about world historical turning points.
These films used special effects to conjure up future worlds, whether they were fearful
or attractive.
Let me discuss just one example.
A film made from a book by an author we've actually encountered in these lectures already.
That is the British writer H.G. Wells, and his book was entitled The Shape of Things
to Come.
In his book, published in 1933, he recounted a future world history, taking us up to the
year 2105.
Wells predicted a cataclysmic world war.
This was a really good prediction, because World War II broke out soon afterwards.
And then he predicted the reconstruction of the world on a new basis, led by technical
experts who will use a dictatorship of the air, use air power to impose a benevolent
new world order.
Wells imagines a world government beyond the Westphalian model of sovereignty, a one world
administration.
The film version of this book opened in 1936, directed by Cameron Menzies.
Because of its powerful images, it's considered by some one of the ten greatest movies ever.
Wells, by contrast, was just crushed.
He felt that the movie oversimplified and dumbed down his message.
And Wells is surely not the first or last author to feel this way about a film version
of a book.
I must also include a cautionary note here as well.
If Chaplin's comedies and others carried a democratizing message for the masses, if
science fiction movies like Wells invited us to speculate about new ways of living, movies
also were powerful in the hands of modern dictatorships, as propaganda tools, and this
was illustrated by the Soviet and Nazi regimes.
When the Bolsheviks took power in the ruins of the Russian Empire in 1917, their aim was
to build a new, fundamentally unprecedented revolutionary society.
Their leader, Vladimir Lenin, announced, of all the arts, cinema is the most important
for us.
Why was this?
Film would convince illiterate masses and spread a revolutionary political message.
Political so-called agitprop trains, agitation propaganda trains, rode around revolutionary
Russia showing films to peasants and workers with a radical message.
When Stalin came to power, he dictated a new formula that all artists had to follow, including
filmmakers from 1934.
This was called socialist realism, and it commanded artists to show not what the Soviet
Union was really like now at the moment, but rather the perfect society it was allegedly
evolving into.
This led to films on the formula of boy meets tractor, boy falls in love with tractor, boy
and tractor build socialism together.
Oddly, such films are not much watched today.
In Nazi Germany in the 1930s, the Nazis, for their part, were keenly aware of the propaganda
power of film.
The director Leni Diefenstadt used her considerable artistic talents to produce movies that celebrated
the Nazi vision of a racially united Germany, including that wicked propaganda masterpiece
of 1935 Triumph of the Will, as well as a record of the Nazi Olympics in Berlin.
Like so many inventions we've seen in this course, movies could be weaponized as it were
for political purposes, and they would be.
Today we face another transformation of movies.
The great movie palaces have faded.
Now movies have gone digital.
In 2012, people in America watched an estimated 3.4 billion movies online, not together in
magnificent movie palaces.
Now in fact, people can and do watch films on their cell phones.
It's almost as if we're coming back full circle to the Nickelodeon boxes of the earliest
days of film.
But movies as a thing of dreams are with us still.
Of human dreams, the oldest has been to soar with the birds in the sky, and we'll examine
that turning point in our next lecture.
