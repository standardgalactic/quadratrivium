The lecturer is Bruce H. Edwards, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Florida
since 1976. Professor Edwards received his B.S. in mathematics from Stanford University,
after which he taught mathematics as a Peace Corps volunteer at a university near Bogota,
Columbia. He was awarded his Ph.D. in mathematics from Dartmouth College.
Professor Edwards has taught a variety of mathematics courses at the University of Florida,
from first-year calculus to graduate-level classes in algebra and numerical analysis.
With Professor Ron Larson, he has co-authored a wide range of mathematics textbooks. This
course is based on their best-selling textbook, Calculus.
Professor Edwards has been a frequent speaker at research conferences and meetings of the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. He has won many teaching awards at the University
of Florida, including Teacher of the Year in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences,
Liberal Arts and Sciences Student Council Teacher of the Year, and the University of
Florida Honors Program Teacher of the Year. He was selected by the Office of Alumni Affairs
to be the Distinguished Alumni Professor for 1991 to 1993. The Florida Section of the
Mathematical Association of America awarded him the Distinguished Service Award in 1995 for his
work in mathematics education for the state of Florida. His textbooks have also been honored
with various awards from the Text and Academic Authors Association. Professor Edwards prepared
the course workbook that comes with these lessons. The workbook includes summaries of each
lesson, a glossary, lists of formulas, theorems, and other useful reference tools, a bibliography,
and supplementary problems with detailed solutions to accompany each lesson. To get the most out
of this course, you should review the summary before watching each lesson and work through the
problems and solutions afterward.
