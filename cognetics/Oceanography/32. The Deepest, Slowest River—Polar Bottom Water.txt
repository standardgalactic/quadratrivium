Well, we've taken a look at the surface currents and how they transport water across the upper
part of the ocean and even how they bring some deep water up through upwelling and downwelling
processes.
So now it's time to take a look at ocean circulation at the grandest scale of all.
The circulation that goes on in that great bulk of the water that represents the deep
ocean.
Now, we've seen that the ocean is stratified or layered with the main boundary being the
thermocline, the difference between the warm surface waters and the cold deep waters.
And remember that that stratification is also a density difference.
It turns out that the thermocline is not the only boundary in the ocean, there are others
as well that we'll see in just a moment, deeper down within the deep water mass.
Most of the volume of the ocean participates in a very slow and even majestic deep water
circulation that takes place in specific patterns that are driven by the atmospheric
circulation on the planet, climate, the differences between the poles and the equator, Coriolis
forces and everything else.
So let's take a closer look at that global scale deep slow motion ocean.
Well, to talk about the deep ocean below the thermocline, we could call them deep ocean
currents but in fact that's kind of a misnomer.
They move so slowly and they involve such large volumes of the ocean water that they're
not really current so much as just general transport of water.
Or maybe the right way to really put it is that it's ocean circulation, slow, steady
mixing.
The flow that happens in the deep ocean is different from the flow in the surface water.
The surface currents as you recall were driven by the wind blowing.
The wind blows and Ekman transport takes place and water moves about the surface of the ocean.
So that's fundamentally driven by the drag of the wind on the surface.
By contrast, the deep ocean, which is not of course in contact with the wind or any
force like that, is in motion due specifically and exclusively to density differences.
And so ultimately it's gravity driven flow.
Denser water sinks and less dense water rises relative to each other.
Well density, I'll remind you, varies specifically with two major things, temperature and salinity.
The amount of dissolved solids in the water is the salinity that makes the water more
dense as it gets more saline and colder water is denser than warmer water.
Water expands a little bit when it warms and that makes it less dense.
The two have similar scales of effects on that water density.
So sometimes temperature is the dominant density variation in the water, sometimes salinity
is the dominant, sometimes it's the combination of the two.
But the water in the deep ocean then acquires different temperature and salinity characteristics
that drives density differences and the density differences in turn through gravity drive circulation.
And in fact we call that circulation thermohalene circulation.
Thermohalene, what does that big word mean?
Thermal, so heat and halene, remember halite are geological term for the salt crystal.
So thermohalene circulation is just heat, salt circulation and in fact it's because
those two things are the variables that govern density in the water.
Thermohalene circulation, density circulation.
Well there are different water masses in the ocean, just in the way we talked about air
masses meteorologically speaking, that even though it's a fluid medium, there's still
sort of volumes or parcels of the water, a vast scale that acquire certain persistent
characteristics.
They're not persistent forever, but as we'll see water moves a lot more slowly than the
atmosphere does, so water masses can retain certain characteristics and be identifiable
for longer periods of time than certainly than the atmosphere does.
So there are different water masses and we define them largely by depth, at least at
the most basic level of definition.
So we can talk about the surface waters, we've already mentioned them quite a lot.
That's basically down to the beginnings of the thermocline.
The surface water is from zero to about 200 meters give or take, sometimes shallower sometimes
deeper the thermocline varies around the world.
Below that over the span of the thermocline is a water mass that is less clearly identifiable
and isn't even a term that's not always used but sometimes called the central water from
that 200 meters or so to the base of the thermocline.
But below that is a very important water mass that is simply called intermediate water and
that's down to about 1500 meters or so and we'll see why that's an important number a
little later on.
And then from 1500 meters on down to nearly the bottom of the ocean, remember the average
depth of the ocean spread over large areas is about 4000 meters so from 1500 down to
close to the bottom is called deep water, simple term the deep water in the ocean.
But below the deep water there's one more layer of water at least in some parts of the
ocean we call that bottom water.
So water that's just simply in contact with the bottom and just maybe occupies the lower
most few hundred meters in some cases maybe even a thousand meters maybe less and that's
the deepest water of all so surface water, intermediate water, deep water and bottom
water are the important ones we want to remember.
Now these water masses form due to processes that happen exclusively at the surface.
Turns out that even the water at the very bottom of the ocean actually acquired its characteristics,
its density, salinity, temperature structure at the surface of the earth.
And acquired it due to processes of heating and cooling, freezing and precipitation.
So let's take a look at those.
Well, the density dependent layering then is a function of these different water masses
and as water becomes denser or less dense it will sink or rise until it's in some kind
of equilibrium just like again our old analogy of the hot air balloon you put some heat into
the balloon, it rises in the atmosphere until it's at an equilibrated buoyancy or density
structure.
Add a little more heat it goes up, let it cool off for a while it starts to sink.
The same goes for masses of water so they get certain density properties.
We're going to see that that process is basically just an upscaled version or a larger scale
version of our upwelling and downwelling that we've already discussed.
And one important principle behind all of this density dependent layering is the concept
of something called continuity of flow.
And I already described that when we talked about upwelling that the ocean, you know any
time water moves in the ocean other water has to come in to fill in the space that it displaced.
So you can't create holes in the ocean, the volume of the ocean isn't changing over time
certainly not significantly for our purposes here so you're always displacing other water
whenever you move one mass of water around.
Okay so what are the differences among these layers or masses of water?
Well the surface water is the least dense, not surprisingly.
It's typically warm water, it's low in salinity because there's rainfall on the surface of
the ocean that dilutes it, there's even in some areas enough river runoff to dilute the
water a little bit.
So the surface water of the ocean basically forms tropically in high precipitation areas.
It places where the water gets the warmest and it gets rained on a lot, you generate
water of relatively low salinity and high temperature.
Conversely the deep water is the most dense not surprisingly so it's very cold and very
saline at the same time.
It forms at the surface though as I said and it forms it turns out in high latitude polar
regions and we'll take a look at that in just a moment.
And then in between are these intermediate waters and even the central waters and they're
just what they sound like.
The intermediate waters are intermediate in density and therefore intermediate in the
salinity and temperature profile to the surface and deep waters they also form at the surface
but in very specific areas of the world's oceans as we'll see.
Okay so how does this deep water and even the bottom water form?
Well you need to generate that cold salty water somewhere in the ocean so the cold regions
naturally are the north and south polar regions and the water forms and sinks to form those
deep water masses so it sinks through a downwelling process due to those density differences.
Ultimately it turns out that from the polar regions it spreads throughout the entire ocean
as we'll see.
But let's take a look at how that formation process takes place.
If you go to the North Atlantic in the Arctic Ocean or in the areas offshore of Greenland
or if you go to the far Antarctic in the areas off Antarctica then what's going on there
is that there's certainly the air temperature is cold, the ocean is losing heat to the atmosphere
so the water is getting colder that's making it denser.
At the same time sea ice is forming when water freezes and ice forms as we said a long time
ago in this course of course you make fresh water ice so if the ice that's formed floating
on the ocean surface is fresh water then that means it's excluded the salts that were in
that volume of water that turned into ice.
The adjacent water around it that's still liquid has to take up those excess salts.
The water becomes more saline so it's simultaneously is getting more saline and getting colder
and therefore that water starts to sink.
So we have voluminous amounts of downwelling going on not by any kind of wind currents
but just by the formation of dense water in the Northern Atlantic and Arctic regions and
then offshore Antarctica.
Well as that water forms it sinks down and starts to spread through the ocean so we can
come up with a kind of a conceptual model of pure thermohaline circulation.
When that takes place the water sinks in the polar regions and remember that one of the
functions of the polar regions is that there's very little thermocline it's cold water at
the surface it's cold water deep and the sinking water is happening and so therefore the temperature
structure of the water is pretty much constant or near constant with depth weak thermocline.
Water moves through it very easily the water is not particularly layered or stratified
but it spreads across the ocean towards the equator and then ultimately it has to be filled
in by surface water that flows towards the north or south pole if water sinks it has to
be replaced so the surface water is drawn northward or southward from the equator and
therefore water has to well up in equatorial regions in a much much smaller or broader
and more diffuse upwelling than what we saw with actual equatorial divergent upwelling
but nonetheless it's an upwelling so water moves across the well-developed thermocline
very slowly in equatorial regions. This conceptual model of pure thermohaline circulation is
a major part of the heat transfer from equator to pole on the planet that we talked about
already that smooths out the temperature differences between equatorial regions which have this
excess input of heat and polar regions which have a deficit of input of heat.
Well the real situation is a lot more complicated than a simple diagram like that of sort of
the conceptual model of thermohaline circulation if we look at the Atlantic Ocean there are
all kinds of water masses in there so we'll take a look at that shortly and see what the
actual differences are in these deep water masses, intermediate water masses, bottom
water masses. But first I'd like to spend a couple of minutes just talking again about
how all this detail is known, how do physical oceanographers find out the complicated temperature
depth salinity profiles of the ocean? Well we talked already about some of the methods
so I've introduced you to the idea of the CTD, the Conductivity Temperature Depth Profiler
with the Nisgen bottles on it, many different bottles, lowered off a ship, triggered at different
depths that sample the water so they can get a water chemistry sample and continuously measure
temperature and salinity because of the electrical conductivity against depth. So oceanographic
ships have been going on the ocean for decades now making tens of thousands of these measurements
and they generate a temperature profile at a given location with depth and they also
generate a salinity profile with depth. Go around the ocean in enough different places
you can build up all those data sets and start to draw contours around areas of constant salinity
or temperature or the combination which is density. But that's a laborious process it
takes a long time to lower down a sampler and do all of that and so other ways of trying
to get more data faster have been devised especially in recent decades. So for example
floats have been dropped into the ocean that basically drop in the water and they're weighted
in such a way so that they will be neutrally buoyant at a predetermined certain depth position
and then they drift along with the currents and they actually have sonar pingers that
send their data out to a ship with a sonar sensor on the bottom of the hull or something
or sometimes a moored buoy that's just constantly getting their data. They can be cheap and
so lots of them can be thrown in the water they drift passively but they allow lots of
measurements to be made in lots of different places and sometimes they last a very long
time one of them sent data for over nine years this way. Another method that's even more
sort of a sophisticated sensor system is something called an acoustic Doppler current profiler
ADCP. This is a transducer on the bottom of a ship that's sort of like an echo sounder
but it's designed with frequencies that instead of bouncing off the bottom and coming back
actually go down in the water and are reflected back from the suspended particles of plankton
and things like that in the water. Well it turns out that the Doppler's shift of frequency
the same thing that makes a train sound louder when it's coming towards you and quieter when
it's going away from you allows you to calculate the velocity that the water is moving and the
different frequencies allow you to calculate that at different depths so an ADCP without
lowering anything down in the water can actually make a profile of the speed of movement of the
water at different depths from the surface so that's pretty good that gets you a lot of data
quickly. There's also gliders I showed you the Slocum glider in a previous lecture so things that
are autonomous devices sent out in the water that can that can measure and then come to the
surface and beam their data to satellites. Another type is actually towed behind the ship on a
cable like a sort of underwater kite and it has controllable wings so it can go up and down and
measure values in different levels of the water. All of these sorts of things and many others were
put together increasingly in recent years to really profile the whole ocean so there's a major
program in the 90s called the world ocean circulation experiment that revolutionized our
knowledge of the deep circulation with millions literally of measurements like this and today
even more measurements like that are going on including the development of something called the
ocean observatory initiative which promises to put sensors on the seabed and in the water
looking up through the water column and then actually sending their data through fiber optic
cables back to land so that real-time measurements can be kept. One other interesting method actually
uses literally chemical tracers in the water and the story is a fascinating one because it's
another place where science has serendipitously benefited from other things that happened.
In the 1950s and 1960s there was the atmospheric nuclear bomb testing era that generated a lot of
the isotope called tritium which has a half-life of 12 and a half years so if there's tritium in
the water you know it came from the bombs so over the course of those decades now the tritium is
basically depleted because there's no more testing going on atmospherically or on atolls in the
pacific but for a long time water samples were taken the amount of tritium was measured and so it
could determine the signature of water that had been at the surface and had displaced in the deep
subsurface. Carbon 14 with a longer half-life is also used actually in a similar way and nowadays
chlorofluorocarbons that were released that don't occur naturally but were released through
industrial production of CFCs are being used as a deep ocean tracer so chemistry of these things
that get in the water inadvertently starts to tell us about ocean currents. Okay so let's go back to
our deep water formation now we can see that persistent and identifiable water masses form
and two really important ones are the north atlantic deep water and the Antarctic bottom water
first the Antarctic bottom water as the sea ice forms off Antarctica it leaves behind the coldest
and highest salinity water of all in the ocean the conditions are so extreme down there and
rapidly forming sea ice it gets a salinity of something like 34.8 per mil and a water temperature
actually below zero because it's saline it can get down to minus half a degree c is typical for
this water it's forming at a prodigious rate 20 to 50 million cubic meters forming every second off
Antarctica it rapidly sinks off the Antarctic shelf and down the continental slope the Antarctic
bottom water spreads slowly northward and it actually tongues in along the deep sea floor it's so
dense and so cold that it sinks all the way to the bottom of the ocean and then spreads
along the sea floor hugging the sea floor of the Atlantic all the way to the equator
in kind of the the widest and slowest moving river of them all on the planet let's just say
it takes actually something like 500 to a thousand years to reach the equator traveling at a rate of
10 to 20 kilometers per year remember our surface currents traveled at a rate of miles per hour
one to five let's say this is 10 to 20 kilometers per year
it's been shown through these chemical signatures and through other kinds of phenomena like that
that it retains its characteristics for as much as 1600 or even 2000 years so this Antarctic bottom
water once it gets down there stays down there for a very long time before it ultimately mixes
with water around it well the north Atlantic the northern hemisphere also generates cold
deep water the same process occurs in the Arctic off of Greenland and in the north Atlantic in that
region it forms water of similar salinity 34.9 per mil remember the average is between 33 and 34
but it generates water that's a little bit warmer 2 to 4 degrees C and that water sinks
and moves southward the water is a little bit less dense because of that little bit higher
temperature than the Antarctic bottom water so the north Atlantic deep water kind of comes in and
layers in on top of the Antarctic bottom water bottom water is down here in north Atlantic
deep water they're coming from opposite directions on the planet and converging in the middle of the
ocean it turns out that most of the bulk of the Atlantic water in the ocean most of that
entire region of deep water is made up of north Atlantic deep water this is where huge amounts
of water are generated and huge amounts of water sink and fill in the ocean so kind of a cross
section through the Arctic or through the Atlantic ocean for all the way from north to south shows
this intertonguing of the two types of deep water that are that are being generated at the opposite
poles of the planet well what about the intermediate water then i said we would talk about intermediate
water well it forms in a couple of different locations in the world and it's an important
part of the overall mixing of the ocean especially the mixing that governs how strongly stratified
the thermocline is in the southern hemisphere basically in the Antarctic region water also
forms that's cold and salty but not nearly as cold and salty as the really high concentration
stuff and so Antarctic intermediate water forms a i w near the continent and it's at about five
degrees c and 34 per mil and it kind of layers in a tongue sitting in on top of the north Atlantic
deep water so we have yet another kind of sheet of water spreading out but balancing out at a
particular depth of just between sort of a thousand and fifteen hundred or so meters depth
in the Atlantic ocean in the northern hemisphere very important source of intermediate water is
actually the Mediterranean sea the Mediterranean is an enclosed basin it evaporates a lot of water
and so the water gets pretty salty 37.3 per mil actually quite a bit saltier than the rest of the
water in most of the ocean but it's also pretty warm 13 degrees c so this water has a kind of
intermediate density and forms intermediate water it actually comes out the Straits of Gibraltar over
the kind of the shallow water shelf at the Straits there comes out of the Mediterranean it mixes with
some Atlantic water so it kind of grows in volume and becomes a little less less distinct density
wise but it sinks to about a thousand meters depth and that's where it finds its kind of buoyancy
neutral point its balance point and so it spreads out and this Mediterranean intermediate water can
actually be traced as much as 2,500 kilometers away from Gibraltar and identified as a persistent
water mass once again out in the Atlantic Ocean so if we take a look at a profile of the entire
Atlantic Ocean a profile running from north to south which shows Antarctica in 80 degrees south
on one side 60 degrees north and the Arctic basin on the other side the equator right in the middle
we can look at what the density and temperature structure is of the ocean itself and it's based
on all those millions of measurements that were made by all the different sensors we talked about
so in the contours you see that they outline zones of particular you know kind of constant density
or constant salinity and constant temperature we see the very low temperature waters associated
with the region just offshore Antarctica even less than zero in places and then the waters
associated with the north Atlantic deep water forming this large tongue surrounded by the three
and four degree kind of contours in the in the north Atlantic if we actually look at that same
kind of profile but really map to the entire Atlantic basin then we can identify these persistent
water masses that I've been talking about the north Atlantic deep water tonguing in and crossing
right across the equator with its constant salinity and two to four degree temperature
filling in most of the volume of the ocean the Antarctic bottom water layering and beneath
that with its extreme low temperature and high salinity and then the water that's coming out
of the Straits of Gibraltar and filling in as intermediate water in the north Atlantic
filling in the center of the north Atlantic basin and extending down to about the equatorial region
well what about the Pacific Ocean the Pacific is a little bit different story it's the biggest
ocean so it should be the biggest player but the Pacific doesn't really have a significant source
of Arctic cold water in the way that the Atlantic does because the Bering Sea and the Aleutian
Islands are kind of in the way and form a shallow water barrier so there's no source of Arctic
cold water there's no real equivalent of north Atlantic deep water formation there's some weak
deep water formation Gulf of Alaska and off the Bering Sea but it doesn't it doesn't amount to
anything like the Atlantic there's also just for oceanographic reasons lesser amounts of the
Antarctic bottom water forming in the Pacific basin area off of Antarctica and so there's not
much water actually deep water being generated in the Pacific it's slowly trickling down there
there is Atlantic deep water coming in getting entrained into the region the deep water region
that's underneath the west wind drift circling circulating around Antarctica that moves into
the Indian Ocean and actually very slowly even moves into the Pacific basin so the deep water in
the Pacific is actually the slowest moving water on the planet and the conditions are actually
quite uniform below about 2000 meters there's not a real source for very distinct intermediate
water either and so it's kind of got more of a less featured and slow steady gradient in the water
it does mean though that the water in the Pacific Ocean is the oldest water at depth and by age I
mean the time since it left the surface region and therefore related to the residence time of water
in the ocean how long it takes to come back to be surface water again and kind of acquire new
characteristics in the Pacific is at least several thousand years it can be three fourth
or more thousand years for deep water to actually end up as surface water in the Pacific basin
if we look at that same sort of contour cross section of the Pacific basin again vertically
exaggerated but we see that the stratification is simpler and the structure is less complex in
general than the Atlantic but it shares some characteristics with the coldest water being
in the southern ocean adjacent more or less to Antarctica well all of these deep circulatory
systems in the ocean let's call it link up in some way with the surface currents and so the surface
currents and the deep circulation together make up something that's been referred to as the global
conveyor belt for water and heat in the ocean the north Atlantic deep water formation takes
place up there and it sort of hugs the continental slope as it goes down and fills in the Atlantic
same as happening in the Antarctic so the water is filling in the Atlantic basin and it's spreading
as I said south of Africa south of the Indian Ocean south of Australia and eventually adding some of
the deep water to the Pacific basin ultimately that water moves through the Pacific basin as well
so there's been this sort of diagram that became actually kind of popular in the 1980s showing
what was called the global conveyor belt and the idea that the surface waters moved through the
ocean in a certain way the deep waters moved through the ocean they were linked in the north
Atlantic and in the Antarctic and not much of anywhere else really in order to sort of link
them up and form that deep water and create a global circulation pattern and the implication
of course also is that that global conveyor belt is not just transporting water but transporting a
great deal of heat around the ocean again smoothing out the heat gradient on the planet making it a
pleasant place to live for us and for the denizens of the sea but that diagram was probably always
an oversimplification even in the time it was made and it certainly was recognized as an oversimplification
at that time but on the other hand measurements that have been made since then the WOC and the
recent measurements have shown basically that the situation is considerably more complex than was
even recognized in the 1980s so through the the 90s and into the 21st century we have a much more
nuanced and complex view of world ocean circulations but maybe one way that the global conveyor belt
diagram really doesn't do world circulation pattern justice is in the idea of the linkage
because the surface waters and the deep waters are circulating at very different kinds of time
scales there's only a limited amount of exchange between the two of them especially in the point
of view of surface water turning in or deep water turning into surface water remember surface water
flows at meters per second deep water flows at you know kilometers per year barely and can live
down there for thousands of years by contrast water that gets entrained into the surface oceanic
gyre of the atlantic the gulf stream in the north atlantic current and the canary current and back
down to the equatorial currents that can make an entire circuit around the ocean one molecule of
water might make it all the way around in not much more than a year or so so the residence
time of surface water might be relatively high but it moves around a lot the deep water residence
time by contrast you know how long it stays down there and circulates in the deep water is anywhere
from 250 say in the indian ocean to 3500 years or more in the pacific ocean so these are these are
very different systems operating at different scales well i've talked a lot about deep water
formation so what about surface water formation you must be wondering well where's the surface water
coming from well we said that surface water requires its characteristics in the tropics generally
where there's warm warm water and a lot of rainfall and that's essentially true and it's true in a
diffuse and slow upwelling going on all over most of the ocean surface in the tropical region so
everywhere where it's warm there's sort of water diffusing upwards slowly about a centimeter per
day spread out over large areas of the ocean not not insignificant centimeter per day is something
you can potentially measure and that's filling in the gap left behind by the surface water that's
entrained and forms deep water in the high latitudes north and south now the equatorial and
especially the coastal upwelling zones also contribute to surface water formation bring
deep water up the downwelling zones wind driven downwelling zones bring shallow water down and
so mixing of these systems is occurring especially around the continental margins all over the world
all the time in a complex pattern of exchange that the conveyor belt model doesn't quite
you know do complete justice to so you have to think of these sort of wheels within wheels
going on at the scale of the whole ocean well so our global scale and density driven thermal
halion circulation now we've seen is what moves the great bulk of the ocean slowly but inexorably
transferring the water and heat around the planet those deep water masses form exclusively in the
polar regions and exclusively at the surface and so they're all part of this massive heat
redistribution engine that is the ocean and is intimately linked in fact inextricably linked
with the atmosphere and its heat redistribution system and these are the things that control the
earth's surface climate so in the next lecture we're going to take a look at that heat system and
all of its interlinkages and understand a little better why the earth is a habitable planet today
