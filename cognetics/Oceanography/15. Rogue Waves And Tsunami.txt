Well, in this lecture, we're going to take a look at the fortunately rare, but sometimes
incredibly destructive special waves that happen in the ocean of various kinds.
We're going to look at the roughest seas and the biggest of wind waves.
We're going to look at things like rogue waves and we're also going to look at tsunami
and how they're generated and why they are so destructive.
Big waves and heavy seas perhaps are symbolized by this Japanese artist Hokusai's famous
1830 print, the wave off Kanagawa.
It's often taken actually to represent a tsunami, but really it's meant to be a depiction
of just ordinary heavy rough seas in big wind-generated waves that are certainly a bane to fishermen
both in Japan and around the world.
So let's take a look at all these sorts of pathological waves.
Well, we have very large swells and rough seas and gales and for a long time, of course,
it was known that seas could get very bad and ships have been wrecked for millennia
from heavy seas.
But in recent years with actual satellite data and measurements from instruments on ships,
for the first time it's been documented how big wind waves really can get.
And then we have to look at the special classes of destructive waves that actually form by
completely different processes and are not simply wind waves that have gone out of control
and that's the rogue waves and then the tsunami.
So let's take a look at them all in order here.
First of all, when we think about heavy seas, we can imagine what it's like to be on a
ship at sea.
And this view that is a direct sort of point of view, a look out the windows of the bridge
on the research vessel James C. Ross, which is down near Antarctica in the high latitude
southern ocean.
It's the reason that seafarers call the roaring forties because it's got absolutely ferocious
weather, mainly because the westerly winds can blow all the way around and circling the
entire globe around Antarctica.
There's no land that gets in the way.
So the wind blows around and around and around.
It has a fetch that grows and grows and grows and builds up wind waves to make the heaviest
seas on earth.
And these are just an example of big building seas slamming into that vessel and ships have
to be built to be able to overcome these seas that get to as much as 10 or 15 meters in
height as much as 50 feet tall, just ordinary waves.
But they have wavelengths so great because they're tall, they have large fetch so they
get very long wavelengths and even a ship that's several hundred feet in length can
be at risk from these kinds of waves because the ship can actually get balanced from peak
to peak and literally split in half or get twisted too much by the peaks and troughs
in order to survive those kinds of waves.
Well again, these kinds of wind waves were known to be bad but how bad they were wasn't
really known until good reliable data started to become available just in the past few decades
with both satellite measurements which recorded even averaged out over large areas, wave heights
of 15 meters or more, and then instruments on ships.
There was a British research vessel that was off the coast of Scotland in a region of the
North Sea notorious for these kinds of very large wind generated, storm generated waves.
And in the year 2000 they were out there and for the first time recorded waves with a significant
wind height which is just a, sorry, significant wave height which is just defined as 33% of
all the waves were at 61 feet or more and spikes at individual waves much higher than
that.
Well, fortunately the researchers and shipscrews survived and in fact the ships survived being
out literally for days in weather like this but when they brought the data back to land
and saw that the wave height had been actually literally that high and that high in a sustained
way it really caused the people who do wave modeling, the physical oceanographers who
study these waves to go back to the drawing board of their computer models in some way
because physics suggested that wind generated waves couldn't even get to that height and
yet there was the data, there was no denying it, there was no arguing with that data.
So how big can wind waves actually get?
Well there are some examples from that expedition which suggested they can get to 85, 90 feet
or even 100 feet but wind generated waves can actually get even larger when different
trains or different sets of wind waves start to interact with each other and they interact
with each other in ways that include constructive and destructive interference.
So let's talk about a classic observation first and then let's look at the interference
processes.
Well the USS Ramapo was a naval tanker vessel that was out in a big storm in the Pacific
Ocean, actually a storm that had lasted for days in February 1933 and they were experiencing
waves of 45 feet and more fairly continuously actually.
But one of the watch standards actually Lieutenant Frederick Margraf was standing in the middle
of the night on the bridge deck or at the bridge and looked back across the stern of
the ship and he saw a crest unlike any other wave that was out there in the ocean, something
that really stood out from the background of all the waves and in a very quick witted
way he noticed that as he stared at that wave or as he looked out at that wave he could
see the crest was lined up directly with the crow's nest on the ship and so probably
not in the moment but later on a little quick geometric calculation showed that by lining
up at the crow's nest he could confirm that the wave height was something like 112 feet
or 34 meters high.
This was the highest documented wave by far at that time and the first sort of really
reliable eyewitness account that had some kind of documentation behind it of a wave
in excess of 100 feet tall.
Well as I said that Ramapo wave stood out from the background.
It was in a big storm in an area where very large waves were forming but it was unlike
all the other waves and those kinds of waves when they reach a height that's in excess
of two times the sort of background of all the waves around them are sometimes called
rogue waves.
If they hit the coastline sometimes they're called sneaker waves because they sneak up
on people but they form it seems by constructive interference of different wave trains and
so if you think about the concept of constructive and destructive interference you know you
can imagine some cyclical thing like a wave and if you have one then you have peaks and
valleys but if there's a second wave train superimposed perhaps there's two sets of waves
coming from different directions they will interfere with each other or two sets of waves
actually even moving in the same direction but with slightly different wavelengths and
so if they have slightly different wavelengths then in some places the peaks of both waves
will correspond to each other will superimpose on each other and in other places the peak
will superimpose on the trough or vice versa.
So you have interference that's constructive and destructive where they're superimposed
peak to peak or trough to trough you get an especially large wave amplitude and then you
can also have destructive interference where the wave is sort of damped out for a smaller
amplitude actually this constructive and destructive interference concept explains why surfers
at the beach typically see waves or think of waves as coming in sets they'll see waves
a set of 6 or 7 or 9 waves that are larger and then waves that are smaller so they ride
the big ones in and then maybe swim out during the period of smaller waves that's basically
when multiple swells are arriving or multiple wave trains with different wavelengths of
swells they're just a little bit out of phase with each other so you get a series of constructively
interfered waves and then a series of destructively interfered ones.
But when we go back to thinking again about the rogue waves this kind of interference
pattern can produce individual single very large waves relative to all the background
so they're sort of freak waves or sometimes a short series of freak waves.
There's a famous case of the Dropner Oil Platform which was operating out in the North
Sea in 1995 the platform had a water height gauge on it and in that storm it was recording
background waves that were pretty substantial pretty bad but it recorded a single rogue
wave that you can actually see in the graphic image that was something like 20 meters from
trough to peak much much greater than any of the background waves and so this was the
demonstration one of the first again real data demonstrations that rogue waves could
exist and could be much larger than the theoretical maximum for a fully developed sea even under
those conditions.
Well these rogue waves which are sometimes also referred to as episodic waves remain
actually poorly known and understood how they can get that big and but it must be through
a combination of this constructive interference with just the dynamics of water sloshing up
into peak somehow to hold up the height of that wave for long enough so that it just
doesn't collapse under its own sort of gravitational weight.
Certainly they had been described for a long period of time long before the Ramapo or Dropner
or any of these other incidents but this was almost seen as wild speculation or maybe
the exaggerated recollections of sailors for a long time by the oceanographers and so they
were really forced to confront the fact that they existed.
But these waves are actually incredibly damaging and a lot of ships are lost at sea probably
to rogue waves and episodic waves in 1978 the 850 foot cargo ship MÃ¼nchen was out in
the middle of the ocean sent out a distress call never seen again went down with all 27
hands on board.
The distress call said that they were experiencing a sudden onset of enormous probably 100 foot
high waves that probably broke up the ship and destroyed it.
Well according to Susan Casey's gripping book called Just the Wave which is an examination
of large waves, rogue waves, surfers on the biggest waves etc.
Every year on average more than two dozen large ships cargo ships, tanker vessels and
things like that sink or go missing along with their crews.
It's something we don't even seem to hear about a lot in the news it's worldwide, it
often happens in very remote regions, imagine if 747s were going down and nobody was really
paying that much attention at a rate of two dozen per year.
But this is true and most of these vessels probably are victim of enormous swells, enormous
swells like the southern ocean ones or actual rogue waves that have formed through constructive
interference.
Well so those are the largest of the sort of the general wind generated waves with or
without constructive interference but there's another whole class of wave in the ocean that
has certainly been in the news a lot in recent years and that is tsunami and tsunami waves
and we know of course that those are generated by some completely different process that
has to do with underwater earthquakes or landslides.
So let's take a look at the processes that generate tsunami.
Another word we might use for tsunami would be seismic sea waves and the reason for that
is that they are, that's evocative, they're generated by earthquakes and they're waves
in the sea as opposed to say the actual seismic waves of the earthquake that are measured
on seismographs and things like that.
Tsunami have happened throughout history, in fact the woodcut engraving that we see is
from an 1869 book talking about the incident due to the earthquake at Sumatra but it doesn't
mean the earthquake of 2004 at Sumatra with the Indian Ocean tsunami that was so devastating
to that region.
It was an 1861 earthquake that was very much the same and of course throughout all of history
with plate tectonics there have been great earthquakes on the coastlines or offshore
that have generated big tsunami but we can ask the question have tsunami somehow become
more frequent because it seems like they're in the news more recently and the fact is
that's actually true in a certain sense.
There's been about a 40 year period or there was a 40 year period up until 2004 with a
few tsunami happening around the world but none of great significance that were very
large disasters and then all of a sudden they roared into the news with the 2004 Indian
Ocean tsunami, the 2011 Northern Japan tsunami and even other ones that were a little bit
less destructive but still very large in magnitude like 2010 had a tsunami that was generated
by an earthquake off the coast of Chile.
Now from 1944 through 1964 before that 40 year hiatus there were a number of major tsunami
in that period also caused by big earthquakes in the ocean.
So this was just sort of a pause in the intervening period.
Probably it was a statistical gap just that earthquakes of the magnitude that are big
enough and have the right characteristics to cause tsunami are pretty infrequent so
if only a half a dozen or so occur per century then maybe they just happen to come clustered
in time.
We don't really know if there's some causative relationship that means that we're in a patch
of more tsunamis than usual recently but certainly the fact is there have been more than there
were for 40 years before that.
Well let's take up the question then what is this tsunami and what causes them?
First of all what is this word tsunami?
It's a Japanese word and it just combines two words Tsu which means harbor and Nami
which means wave a tsunami is a harbor wave and it was given that name very long time
ago at least a thousand years ago in Japan because these are the waves that overwhelm
even the protected harbors the regions where water doesn't normally come in and the wave
just crashes right over the harbors defenses as we saw very graphically and very tragically
in March 2011.
So the tsunami is a wave that inundates the coastline and inundates the harbors they're
not tidal waves they have nothing to do with the tides and so the word is a misnomer they
really are waves generated by earthquakes and sometimes generated by landslides so let's
just stick with the term tsunami for them I think everybody's heard that enough now.
They're generated mainly by a specific type of event and that is an undersea subduction
zone earthquake.
Do you remember the subduction zones that we talked about before?
Both Indonesia and Japan are subduction zones places where the ocean floor plate is being
carried beneath the rocks of the continent or of the Indonesian and Japanese islands
in these two cases and the plates are converging on one another they're convergent zones.
These types of locations are the source of virtually all the large tsunami that have
occurred at least in in recorded history in each of these cases the plates are moving
and one plate is going beneath the other and the plates move and the sort of the big picture
at a steady rate but at the actual boundaries between the two plates the plates stick together
and so if one plate is going down the other plate is riding over it but at the boundary
between them especially in the upper most part of the earth's crust between sort of
the seabed and about 30 or 40 kilometers down they stick together and so as they stick the
one plate goes down and it kind of buckles the upper plate up it's like it's pulling
it back like an arch you're pulling a bow string back.
It stores actually elastic strain or the the bending of the whole rock of the earth's crust
backwards until finally and maybe after hundreds of years of accumulated plate tectonic motion
remember at just a few centimeters per year it exceeds the strength of that rock and it
pops forward and it pushes the land out underneath the water and that flings the water literally
up so if the seafloor moves upward then the water over it moves upward as well this creates
a bulge in the water and when that water bulges then water of course won't hold a bulge it'll
flatten out by gravity and that starts the wave moving both back towards the nearby land
and also out towards the open ocean that is the tsunami itself.
So when a tsunami begins it begins with this very large scale displacement of the seabed
actually the March 2011 earthquake in Japan seems to have produced according to seismologists
the largest displacement of the seafloor we've ever recorded in fact the largest displacement
of any earthquake we've ever recorded the offshore region of the earth's crust just down
by the Japan trench moved outwards towards the Pacific Ocean by something like 60 meters
200 feet in one earthquake and it moved the seabed upwards by something like 8 meters
or so so suddenly the seabed pops up it generates this wave which has a wavelength of something
on the order of 200 kilometers it's also a very long wave along the whole distance of
the coastline that the earthquake took place but the width of the wave so therefore the
wavelength is 200 kilometers well a 200 kilometer wave is a shallow water wave even in the deep
sea now that seems strange the water depth is 4 or 5,000 meters in that part of the Pacific
Ocean so how can this be a shallow water wave well it is a shallow water wave because remember
the definition is any wave where the water depth is only a 20th of the wavelength well
for a 200 kilometer wave a 20th of the wavelength is 10 kilometers so it starts to propagate
across the ocean as a shallow water wave and that means that in deep water it moves fast
but in shallower water back towards the coast it slows down and unfortunately also piles
up so the open ocean tsunami is traveling across the ocean and it doesn't have a very
large height these are not 1 to 7 waves like the wind waves where the height and the and
the length kind of come to equilibrium they only have a height maybe of you know one to
two or maybe for the case of the Japan one a few more meters four or five meters in the
open ocean and a wavelength of 200 kilometers so if you're in a ship at sea you'd never
notice the tsunami if you were out in open water off the continental shelf the tsunami
will be a very gradual lifting of your ship in a very gradual decline back down it also
travels across the open ocean at a rate that's determined just like all shallow water waves
by by the water depth square root of the water depth times the square root of gravity
the gravitational acceleration so they start going across the ocean at hundreds of kilometers
per hour the speed of a sort of an international jet line or flying back and forth from Japan
to the US is comparable to the speed the tsunami propagates across the open ocean coming back
towards the nearby shoreline they reach shallower water they slow down and then pile up and get
deeper and deeper water so the tsunami gains in amplitude gains in wave height which is
of course why they're so destructive nearby so as we saw in so many of the videos that
were available from Japan in 2011 because there was the earthquake took place that gave the
people on the coastline some warning that the tsunami was likely to come and so in fact news
helicopters and police helicopters and everything were out and videotaping as well as many
many hundreds or thousands of amateurs a videotaping what happened when the tsunami reached the
shoreline so they've actually our best record of a tsunami ever from this event by far and
so the the tsunami slowed down to maybe only as much as say 30 miles an hour in shallow
water but the height grew many times its initial height and it washed across the landscape
first arriving not so much as an enormous breaking wave the kind of Hokusai image of
the tsunami but more like a almost like a tidal bore remember they're not tidal waves
but like a surge of water that's pushing in and just inexorably raising the water level
with a foamy front to it but then water level that keeps rising for minutes and minutes
and minutes and then drains back down sometimes drains back down to a trough where the water
has now receded well out to sea and then back again and there's usually there were several
peaks of tsunami waves during the Japan event and during most of them in general the open
ocean height of the tsunami was just a few meters but because of this shortening and
growing and also because of the funneling effect of some harbors where there's deep
water in a canyon offshore the tsunami height was very large and of course that's why so
many people lost their lives in some of these regions the maximum height that the tsunami
actually reached on land was has been documented as something like 38 meters in some of those
villages along the north coast of Honshu Island in Japan 125 feet the height of something
like you know eight or ten storey building is how high the water came in in many of these
regions and of course that's what's washed away the houses and buildings and more or
less everything in its past path through the hydraulic force of all that water well when
the earthquake happens and the land suddenly releases all that stored up energy that comes
from plate tectonics it not only launches the tsunami but it also can have effect on
the level of land the offshore region pops up but that actually means that the onshore
region like the sort of the back end of the spring drops down and this can actually be
seen really graphically in something that shows up from the from the region of Banda
Ache Indonesia the north end of Sumatra Island very close to the source of the 2004 tsunami
when that earthquake took place same sort of thing happened the run up of water was
also in the scale of 35 meters or so in this region very close to the earthquake source
and it washed over the land and washed away all the buildings but it also left the land
permanently altered in the sense that the whole landscape the whole crust of the earth
dropped down one to two meters so we can see satellite images of part of that city before
the tsunami and then after the tsunami and we see that yes the buildings have disappeared
but also a bunch of the land looks like it's underwater it's not because it was washed
away by erosion by the waves it's because it literally dropped down as part of the drop
down of the earth's crust during that event tsunami in the Pacific Ocean have happened
many times in the 20th century and now of course in the 21st century as well and they
don't just do damage locally they also can do damage because tsunami are such a long
wavelength wave they travel across great expanses of the open ocean without dissipating
in energy very much at all so they can arrive at the far side of the Pacific with a with
a pretty large magnitude and back in the 1940s and in the 1960s the several different very
large earthquakes the magnitude 9 scale earthquakes like the 1960 Chilean earthquake launched
tsunamis that went across the Pacific Ocean no warning systems were in place at that time
and did damage both in Hawaii and caused actually a lot of loss of life in some of
the same regions of Japan that were damaged in 2011 1946 in an earthquake in the Aleutian
Islands caused a lot of damage in Hilo Hawaii as well and also came in inundated and flooded
coastal regions in California like Crescent City and even on down to to Los Angeles so
these long distance tsunami are a hazard and this is actually one of the real success stories
now in understanding of tsunami and their properties as a shallow water wave because
we have a really effective long distance tsunami warning system on the planet today there are
a number of buoys that have been placed in the ocean they're called dart buoys and basically
they just have a sensor on the sea floor that's a pressure meter and it measures the pressure
in the water very precisely and that pressure measurement tells the pressure meter how deep
the water is above it and then it's tethered to a buoy that had that just basically sends
that data to a satellite and back to the Pacific tsunami warning center in that particular
case which is in Hawaii and so the pressure meter records data all the time that shows
the height of the tide going up and down not surprisingly it shows waves and everything
else but when a sudden wave event like a tsunami comes along it creates a spike in that pressure
record where it changes suddenly the rate of change of the water depth on the sea floor
so for example if we look at a signal from one particular station that was off the north
coast of Japan not very far away from the region that generated the tsunami we can actually
see the signal just in the middle of the day on March 11th where the tide was going up
and down but then all of a sudden a big spike occurred which was the generation of the tsunami
so this was detected and the information sent back from this station and others to the tsunami
warning centers now because tsunami are a shallow water wave shallow water waves have
a speed of propagation that's determined only by the water depth and so once the earthquake
occurred computer modelers people who study tsunamis and try to understand them could
immediately run a computer simulation as we have a bathymetric map of the pacific
ocean occur to see all that satellite data so we know what the water depth is everywhere
so they start a tsunami propagating they calibrate it to the actual height of the tsunami as
recorded at those dart stations and then you can see the wave spread just like shallow
water tank waves or something like that across the entire pacific ocean and within an hour
or so after the tsunami was initiated and many hours before it arrived even in Hawaii
or California or any place else around the pacific basin they predicted the exact time
of arrival at each island in Hawaii and they also predicted that the height would be about
six to eight feet or so and that prediction was very accurate the water did actually do
some damage in the Hawaiian islands but there wasn't loss of life or actually maybe one
person foolish enough to try to go photograph the tsunami but otherwise no loss of life
because they were able to make this tsunami prediction and this is something in the modern
world now we can do with a lot of precision and it's because tsunami behave as shallow
water waves.
If you look at a map based on that computer simulation of where the wave heights are predicted
to be it's kind of interesting to see that there are certain regions that get more tsunami
than others even at the same distance away from the original earthquake source so you
can see the colors which are wave height from the computer simulation for the whole pacific
basin and most of it's sort of yellow this relatively low wave height so it arrived at
places around the world but didn't actually do any significant damage but you see a sort
of a finger of red veering off towards California actually and we know that this is the only
place on the North American mainland that the tsunami did any damage in 2011 was Crescent
City California and Santa Cruz California and a few other coastal harbors well that finger
of red is actually determined by a little bit shallow water portion of the sea floor
that focused the wave energy along because of refraction just like the refraction we
saw with waves in basin beaches and things like that and that shallow water region in
the pacific ocean is actually the Mendocino fracture zone that great trace of the transform
fault from the spreading from the east pacific rise so another whole way that plate tectonics
links back into things that play out over just hours and days of time well maybe you'd
like to ask the question then you know could this happen in North America well the answer
of course is that yes actually it could happen in North America and we know that it has happened
in North America but just not within the historical record of the past the pacific northwest
from northern California actually the Mendocino region Cape Mendocino region all the way up
to Vancouver Island in Canada is a subduction zone a small plate called the Juan de Fuca
plate is subducting beneath North America it ultimately fuels the volcanoes of the
cascade mountains like Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens but offshore the two plates are
locked together there's never been an earthquake in historical time since Europeans since sort
of Lewis and Clark days in the earlier explorers in that region of this kind of scale there
have been earthquakes of course but not one that ruptured the entire locked part of of
the two plates offshore but we actually know that this region had a tsunami had an earthquake
of something like magnitude nine that generated a huge tsunami on a very specific day January
26 1700 at about 930 in the evening and the reason we know that is twofold the most important
piece of the evidence is that there was a tsunami that was recorded in historical accounts
in records of harbor masters and people like that over in Japan that arrived in that region
actually the next day a number of hours later but had no earthquake associated with it so
it was sort of this phantom or mysterious tsunami and so people who were interested in the question
of whether there were possible magnitude nine earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest talked
to their Japanese colleagues they looked for and searched through all these records discovered
that a tsunami made it to Japan and actually from the size of the tsunami over there and
the day they could run one of those same computer simulations are backwards in time and calculate
that an earthquake of this size had to come from across the Pacific Ocean on that particular
day and actually had to come from the Pacific Northwest of North America it's a phenomenal
story it's further confirmed actually by studies of the salt marshes and estuaries along the
coastline of the Pacific Northwest that show when they trench down into the peaty soils
of the of the intertidal region the salt marshes show that there are deposits of sand that show
great flooding and inundation of seawater along that coast that is associated with the death
of whole forests of trees right along the coastline confirmed by tree ring dating that all comes
back to right around that same time 1700 so we have this puzzling story of a tsunami in Japan
that tells us that the tsunamis have happened in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. and in fact
we also know that tsunamis can happen again in that region and there have been several of these
earthquakes in the geological record back through the last few hundred or couple of thousand years
that suggest that on an average reoccurrence time of 300 to 500 years or so the Pacific Northwest
has these kind of earthquakes again so now if you go to the coastline in Oregon or Washington
and you're in the coastal towns that are low down at sea level you'll see these signs that say
tsunami hazard zone in case of earthquake go to high ground or inland and those are signs
that are worth paying attention to and taking seriously even in this part of the world that
hasn't had a historical event like this well we've looked at all of these pathological waves
and we've started from the smallest waves and we've gone to these ones with hundreds of kilometer
wavelengths like tsunami but in the next lecture we're going to look at something that has the
longest wavelength of them all the biggest waves on the planet and I think you'll be surprised
to find that there's something you don't think of as a wave at all
