Well, now it's time to turn our attention to the kind of poster children of the ocean.
The big marine mammals, the reptiles like sea turtles, the marine birds and like penguins
and things like that, all of the organisms that are familiar to us all from television
specials and trips to ocean aquariums and things like that, we'll take a look at kind
of how they make their living in the ocean as well, how some of their adaptations relate
to what we've seen already with fishes and other organisms and what they share and what
they don't share with all of the other really large scale organisms that live in the sea.
Well, we'll look at all of these different ocean dwellers, but first let's talk about
the birds.
We might not think of birds as marine organisms at all, but what they share with the marine
reptiles actually and also with the mammals is a total adaptation to life at sea.
The ones that we think of as true sea birds are birds that cannot live without the ocean
as their total food source for example and as a large part of their habitat for virtually
everything except for nesting itself.
So all sea birds breed on land, but all the true sea birds at least do feed at sea and
they're all specifically adapted to the marine environment in a variety of ways that I'd
like to describe at least just a few examples of.
First of all we can think of sea birds that run the spectrum of extremes in terms of flight
from extreme flyers like the albatross and arctic terns and sooty shear waters I'll describe
to you in a minute that fly great distances and are very at home in the open ocean in
fact pelagic environment all the way to totally flightless birds like penguins who have adapted
to life in the sea by adapting their wings to be optimized for swimming and not for flight
and not just their wings actually as we'll see in just a moment.
In fact penguins are adapted to swim and feed exclusively underwater and these adaptations
take a number of different forms and this is just a reminder of the kind of convergent
evolution I talked about in the last lecture.
First of all flightlessness the fact that they've abandoned the requirement of flying
means their body can be very differently shaped from virtually all other birds.
They can be large, first of all they can have a lot of mass and have a lot of fatty insulation
sort of like a seal or a sea lion does and so that can keep them warm in cold water and
in cold environments like in the Antarctic over wintering and things like that.
They can also have stubby appendages also to keep warm and very importantly they can
maintain neutral buoyancy just as the fish do that we talked about in the last lecture.
In the case of the penguins they maintain it by a combination of this fatty insulation
fat deposits in their bodies as well as sort of greasy feathers that are laden with a lot
of insulating fat as well and so when a penguin swims through the water it can maintain neutral
buoyancy just as a fish can do.
So penguins are adapted to phenomenal abilities to dive deep in the ocean.
Emperor penguins, the largest of penguins, are known to dive to depths of 265 meters
or more and stay submerged for as much as 10 minutes.
A few species of penguins really are almost entirely seabirds.
They spend two uninterrupted years at sea in between individual breeding episodes and
then just come on land or on the ice shelves to breed.
Of course we know that penguins are southern hemisphere organisms.
They live only in the southern hemispheres, no penguins in Alaska.
There are penguin species that live as far north as the Galapagos, there are tropical
penguins actually living near the equator, but the majority live at high southern latitudes
in New Zealand and South America and certainly in Antarctica where we've seen so many nature
films about penguins and penguin lifestyle.
Well in fact when we talk about seabirds in general most of them actually live in the
southern hemisphere and maybe that's because it is the ocean hemisphere, it's the hemisphere
where there's not much land and lots of very large areas of open ocean.
And so the flying seabirds are, there are a number of different varieties.
We can think of the gulls and the near sort of shorebirds, the pelicans, things like that.
These are sort of transitional land marine animals.
They feed at sea largely except for the gulls that scavenge up a lot of food from the boardwalk
when you're down at the beach and steal your french fries and things like that.
But largely they're feeding on fish and invertebrates as are the penguins, sorry the pelicans virtually
exclusively.
But really the true seabirds I think the ones that excite us in terms of being open
ocean seabirds are the pelagic birds that are called tube noses.
Not a very romantic or dramatic name but these are incredibly beautiful creatures like the
albatross and sooty shear waters that travel across open areas of the ocean and are exquisitely
good flyers and fly specifically over the sea.
What they have in common with each other is the tube in their nose literally which is
both a kind of almost like the pitot tube on an airplane, something that samples the
airflow and tells them about their speed through the air but also includes special salt excreting
glands that concentrate the salt in their bodies because they have no access to fresh
water and flows it out much like if you would have a runny nose but flows a brine out over
their beaks to get rid of the excess salt.
Most of these seabirds in fact virtually all marine birds are organisms that live a fairly
long time, have few offspring and mate monogamously or near monogamously largely on remote rocks
and islands in the southern hemisphere so uninhabited places where their nests are virtually
undisturbed and they only return to nest and otherwise spend virtually all their time
wheeling across the ocean and feeding on surface fish and surface invertebrates like squid.
Well let's take a look at the tube noses, the albatrosses, shear waters, petrels and
things like that.
The largest seabird in the ocean is the wandering albatross of seafaring lore and these are incredible
birds.
They have wingspans up to 3.6 meters something like 12 feet yet only weigh about 10 kilograms
or 22 pounds or so so they're very light, very large wingspans, very delicate bone structure
and optimized wing shape for soaring and they barely flap their wings at all in fact many
of them, the albatross in particular have a resting heartbeat that's lower while they're
flying than while they're actually sitting on the water bobbing up and down suggesting
how comfortable they are in flight.
One albatross has been tagged having traveled 500 miles over the course of a day at an average
speed of more than 35 miles an hour, they're just tremendous flyers, they actually fly
often wheeling very low over the water when you're out in the open sea on ships sometimes
you'll see these albatross I have myself and they use the actual updrafts created by the
rise and fall of the waves so they'll swoop over the water getting lift from being just
above the water surface and then use the updrafts to keep them aloft off of each individual
wave.
Only go to shore, they only go ashore to breed on remote islands and again they mate for
life over time but they will spend many, many months at sea and then bring materials back
to the chicks, bring food back to the chicks, finding these remote islands and navigating
to them over thousands of mile distances across the open ocean possibly again because they
have some magnetic sensing ability in their bodies somewhat similar to what we talked
about with the sharks.
Another example of this tube nose class is the sooty shear water, it's a southern hemisphere
bird as well and they're just the most amazing long distance flyers perhaps in the ocean.
In fact as part of the census of marine life a number of researchers from the US and New
Zealand tagged a number of these birds.
You can see Dr. Scott Schaefer tagging the sooty shear water here with geolocation devices
basically GPS units and they found that these sooty shear waters could fly incredible distances
as much as 950 kilometers, more than 500 miles again in a single day.
They dive also to great depths in the ocean, 68 meters depth they're not very large birds
but can dive to such depths for fishing.
But the most amazing thing about the sooty shear waters of all is just the mapping of
what these birds do over the course of a year.
They live in as Dr. Schaefer describes in an endless summer meaning they spend their
summers in the southern hemisphere in their rookeries, the areas that they nest and made
in, in the region around New Zealand and the great southern islands of the far south Pacific
and then annually they take off and fly across all the way across the equator to the far
distant northern hemisphere to spend the northern hemisphere summer up there and return.
They fly across the entire Pacific Ocean and these tagged birds were shown to fly across
the ocean in a figure eight pattern making stops in Japan, Hawaii and Gulf of Alaska
or the Aleutian Islands but this is the longest electronically recorded bird migration.
These 19 individuals, only 19 birds are actually represent all of the track lines that are shown
on this map over the course of just two thirds of a year.
They travel an average of something like 70,000 kilometers in that year.
Flying mostly alone actually, they don't fly in flocks but they fly as individuals and
you can see how the tracks show you very different patterns they took as individuals across the
ocean all ultimately returning back to their southern hemisphere summer home around New
Zealand and their northern hemisphere summer home up around the Pacific Northwest and the
Gulf of Alaska.
Truly amazing birds, the longest migrations of any bird on the planet.
Well related in some ways to birds through their common relationship to the dinosaurs
and other even earlier organisms are the marine reptiles and of reptiles today each main group
of the present day reptiles has some marine species not many they're mostly land dwelling
organisms but some marine species so we have the turtles, we have lizards and snakes and
we have crocodiles are all representatives of different types of reptiles of course
as reptiles they all breathe air none of them are aquatic in the sense of having gills
they also have special salt glands to excrete excess salt from their bodies so they've evolved
those in another example of convergent evolution.
There are seven different species of sea turtles like birds of course they come ashore to lay
eggs but at very infrequent intervals and they spend virtually all of their life history
in the ocean some of the species of sea turtles come ashore either every two three or four
years but otherwise spend all their time at sea they home back to their original beach
and in fact the original spot on the same beach that they were born in to lay eggs even
several years later with incredible sense of navigation and ultimately presumably smell
and taste that allows them to find not only the same island let's say or the same general
region that they were hatched in but the same location on the same beach using something
about the characteristics of that particular environment to home in on that location.
Sea turtles like the green sea turtles that you'll see if you go on vacation in Hawaii
or perhaps in in Mexico or Florida are a little bit different from land based turtles
and tortoises they can't retract their heads and limbs into the shell the shell is protection
from predators but their their fins which are of course evolved from four legs and hind
legs and heads are always out they swim through the water with relatively slow gentle propulsion
they're incredibly beautiful to see if you happen to have the fortune good fortune to
see them snorkeling or diving or something like that and amazingly the adult sea turtles
essentially have no predators in the ocean so they they don't have to move very fast
and they're not afraid of anything unfortunately the one predator they do have is human beings
who will hunt them for food or for their shells or other material and we've become sea turtles
predator and all of the major sea turtle species are at least threatened species and some of
course are very very much endangered they all feed in shallow water on algae seagrass
and plants so they hug coastline areas and continental shelf regions where there's a
lot of this kind of vegetative material for them to feed on well let's turn our attention
now to the marine mammals the big organisms that we are so familiar with and know and
love so well from all of the different marine shows and wildlife television programs and
everything else so we'll talk about three different groups of marine mammals each one
that evolved independently from land mammals that moved into the sea and all of which have
lost the ability to live totally on land though as we'll see some of them spend a little bit
of their life cycle on land in the way that the birds and the reptiles do so the three
types are the serenia the carnivora and the cetacea that is the the manatees and their
relatives the seals and sea lions and then the whales and dolphins so let's look at them
sequentially well let's talk first actually about the common features that each of these
organisms have all of them are in fact mammals so that implies they feed live young they have
live young and they feed them with milk they breathe air so all their time spent at sea of
course as we know they breathe air through their blow holes or nostrils or their organs they all
have the streamlined body shape of good high energy high active high activity swimmers they
have slippery skin or hair that has developed special oils to both retain heat and retain sort
of a slippery smooth profile and of course all of them are internally heated they're warm-blooded
organisms they have to maintain a high endothermic body heat and so they need a high metabolic
rate they need to consume a lot of food and burn a lot of food as well as be well insulated with
fatty tissue and actually their large size is good for retaining heat because they have a good
surface to volume ratio right they don't radiate too much heat because they have a large large body
volume that's generating all of that heat they also have unusual respiratory systems that
efficiently use oxygen as we'll see many of the marine mammals have special biochemistry that's
optimized to retain and use oxygen during deep prolonged dives a diving whale or elephant seal
can use up to 80% of the oxygen that it takes in with each breath and efficiently exchange it in
its lungs you or I are much less efficient we only use 25 to 30% of the oxygen that we take in
the lungs can collapse in some of these organisms to tiny volumes to accommodate the pressure of
going very deep so gases collapse under high pressure and they accommodate that by actually
allowing their lungs to collapse after they've taken oxygen into their their bloodstream or while
they're doing that in fact the pressure helps drive the dissolved oxygen into the bloodstream and
they also have very strong osmotic adaptations to living in saltwater a recurring theme with all
these organisms we've been looking at there's little to no intake of seawater they don't drink
water at all for the most part all of these different marine mammals instead they get their
fresh water from food tissues so directly from the food that they're ingesting and also from the
metabolism of carbohydrates remember the photosynthesis respiration give and take the
process of respiration that involves combining carbohydrates with oxygen has a byproduct of
producing H2O there's free water that's generated by that by that process so they recycle and reuse
the water reabsorb the water from their digestion from their metabolic process in order to retain
water and virtually none of them need any fresh water whatsoever okay well let's look at a few of
these marine mammals then in more detail first of all I'd like to talk about the serenia the ones
that are like sirens of the ocean and in fact in mythology and in historical lore they were seen as
something like the mermaids of the sea these are the manatees manatees actually even strikes and
composes when they're when they're feeding their young that reminded sailors of the old days or
people of the old times of mermaids as they held a calf close to their bodies to to nurse it but
the manatees and the dugongs of Indonesia are virtually the only examples there are three
species of West Indian manatees and one of the related dugongs of Indonesia they're the only
four extant species of these organisms on the planet all of them are herbivorous marine mammals
are the only herbivorous ones so they basically graze on seagrass they're closely related to the
land-based grazers like elephants and water buffalo and other ungulates so calling them
sea cows is not much of a stretch they are pretty much organisms that have adapted to being in the
water so much so they have no legs they have fins but they they exclusively graze on seagrasses
and things like that they're all very large bodied slow-moving and virtually unafraid of most
predators they stay in quite shallow water where for the most part the large marine predators like
orca whales don't come in or sharks don't come in and graze in these seagrasses and so they've
been an easy target for human beings and in fact the manatees and dugongs are both endangered
species to this day or at this time maybe the most amazing story is the story of the Serenian
that's no longer around the Stellar's sea cow now these were even larger than manatees up to 30
feet long and 20,000 pounds Stellar's sea cows were discovered at least to science in 1741 named
by George Stellar who named so many different organisms as a naturalist on Vitus Bering's
exploration voyages they were in the Bering Sea named of course for Bering himself and they were
on the Commodore Islands of the Bering Sea between Russia and Alaska and perhaps native people knew
about these but the Europeans described them first in 1741 and and gave them this name while seal
hunters who were just beginning to move into this area from Russia mainly found them to be pretty
easy pickings they basically don't move very fast they're enormous there's a lot of food on them
they're great for provisioning and unfortunately they only inhabited a relatively small number of
islands up there in the far northern Pacific and Bering Sea so they were hunted for meat and only
27 years after they were first discovered they were extinct and they've been gone since 1768
a fate that we hope doesn't happen to the manatees and dugongs as well
well the next group I'd like to talk about are the what are called the pinnipeds and
physipeds they're all of the order carnivora the carnivora are dogs cats bears and weasels all
the animals like that but of course the pinnipeds are the seals and the sea lions and the walruses
and the physipeds are the sea otters that swim in the sea all of these are relatively recent
arrivals at least in an evolutionary sense in the ocean pinnipeds themselves seals and sea lions
are mostly marine living they spend almost all their time in the water but they come on land to mate
and to fight over mating and to birth their young and then head back out into the ocean and spend
most of the year at sea the difference between seals and sea lions is something you've probably
learned somewhere but forgotten multiple times seals have no external ear parts whatsoever
a more streamlined shape they swim with a fused hind set of hind limbs that's essentially turned
into a single flipper and don't swim with their forelimbs at all while sea lions have external
ears they look a little bit more maybe dog-like in the face somehow and their hind limbs are still
partially separated sea lions and their front flippers are used for swimming actively as well
they're a little bit more mobile on land and in fact sea lions are what are in all of the seal
shows that you might see at an aquarium or something like that the walruses of course are the largest
of the pinnipeds and the most massive and live mostly in very cold water environments where
their massive size is an advantage to to to maintaining body heat well the largest of the
seals and the most interesting is one that you can actually get a chance to see if you're on the
california coast and they're very beloved by people there that because there are a number of
locations where the elephant seals come out on land spend lots of time on land and are relatively
easy to observe in their mating and in birthing their young kinds of stages of their life cycle
elephant seal bulls can reach five meters in length 2700 kilograms they're called elephant seals due
to these large proboscis that they have they're the greatest divers of all of the of all of the
pinnipeds and in fact have been documented diving as deep as or deeper than most of the whales 1500
to 2500 or more meters in depth all the pinnipeds including the elephant seals mate and give birth
on land uh elephant seals in large colonies with harems of females that are fought over by the
alpha bulls for the opportunity to mate seals and sea lions can be seen of course on land too in
many places especially along the west coast pulled out on piers and beaches and things like that
sunning themselves and pretty much ignoring the human beings that are paying attention to them
most seals and sea lions have a pretty rough life cycle though the pups that are born basically
have to make their own way out to sea after they're born they head down to the water and they are
targets for sharks and other organisms that want to prey on these easy to easy to catch young
still immature mammals and in fact an elephant seal pup has only about a one in five chance of
survival to the six to eight years old that it needs to reach in order to reach breeding age
well sea otters are the last of these group that i want to talk about they're the geologically
most recent newcomers to the ocean and they're the only marine fissipeds all the other fissipeds
are land organisms and just one group the sea otters actually went to sea we see them in the kelp
forests of california in large numbers in the pacific northwest as well as many other places
around the pacific they feed on mollusks crustaceans and sea urchins in great numbers they actually
have to consume something like 20 of their body weight each day in order to to maintain their
high metabolism and stay warm in that in that chili water and the sea otters of course have the fur
that was the most prized by people so they nearly went extinct from hunting the entire pacific otter
population descends actually from just a few individuals that were left over from early 20th
century hunting okay and now finally i want to discuss the citations the whales the dolphins and
the porpoises these are the the the big organisms that are the most fully adapted perhaps to oceanic
life among the mammals because they spend their entire life cycle at sea and don't come out for
giving birth to live young at all they all evolved from early ungulates so they've been in the sea
longer than most of the others closest land relatives are actually sheep and horses we can
break down the citations into two classes or two categories the odontoceti the toothed whales
and the mystoceti the baleen whales uh odontoceti has the word daunt in it like going to the
orthodontist or something like that so you can remember that they're the toothed whales in particular
these toothed whales are the top predators in the ocean in many ways top predators of many
fishing invertebrates they exist for the most part at a very high trophic level they tend to consume
relatively large fish that are already several trophic steps removed from from the base so the
dolphins porpoises orca and beluga the narwhal are all examples of the toothed whales they all
have small to moderate sizes at least relative to their cousins the mystoceti the sperm whale the
largest of the of the toothed whales and they're all of course extremely skillful fast-moving
predators the sperm whales when you look at a depiction like this are virtually always depicted
with a giant squid in their mouth and that's because as we said it turns out the giant squid is
probably a primary source of food a primary diet although not the exclusive diet of sperm whales
and the reason that we know this is that during all the years of whale hunting of course whales were
were were cut open all the time and whales sperm whale stomachs in particular are virtually always
filled up with the indigestible hard part of a squid the the so-called beak of a squid
which which collects in the sperm whale stomach and is never expelled and based on the size of the
squid beaks the species were identified as the giant and colossal squids in large parts and
in vast numbers occur in sperm whale stomachs well all the odontocetes share echolocation so
we're familiar with the idea of dolphins and their sonar and the other whales the other toothed whales
use it as well they use combinations very sophisticated combinations of clicks that we've heard before
and hearing dolphin dolphin sonar sounds and actually rising or falling tones that you hear
which is a way of sending out different frequencies that give you different kinds of depth range
information from low frequency to high with a rising tone or vice versa with a falling tone
as they move in on home in on and echolocate their their prey that they're going towards
it's been said that their sonar is sophisticated enough that they probably in those large brains
those large convoluted brains we know and and the reason why we expect that dolphins and whales are
very intelligent organisms one of the things those brains are probably for is actually building
mental images using sonar so much the way we see with our eyes and form an image of what's around us
uh dolphins and whales almost certainly form a direct image of things in the water in front
of them using their sonar there's evidence too that the sonar is not just for location of prey
it's not just echolocation but actually used offensively to stun their prey with extremely
loud bursts in fact bursts of sound energy up to 230 decibels many or uh many times higher
than the loudest sounds we might hear on land and something that would probably actually
stun or even kill another organism it's not understood why the dolphins themselves can
generate this loud burst of sound without hurting their own their own delicate structures in their
heads and brains well we know the dolphins and whales are playful of their great swimmers uh
seemingly using the ocean effortlessly and can move very rapidly due to their very streamlined
optimized shapes and well-developed fins that again all evolved from from from limbs and
examples of convergent evolution let's take a look at the baleen whales now the misty cds
they're maybe mystic uh and mysterious in a way none of them have teeth they have the plates of
baleen which you've probably seen but is this horn-like fibrous material which uh hangs down
inside their mouth in such a way that um an overlapping plates that creates a kind of a mesh
or net so they can take in great mouthfuls of water as they feed in surface waters they don't
dive deeply they basically feed just at the surface especially in Arctic and Antarctic zones
taking great amounts of krill strain the water back out through the baleen and then capture all
that zooplankton and phytoplankton and and live directly on it the blue whale the largest of all
animals on earth eats three metric tons of Antarctic krill per day during feeding season
and they're living at a very low trophic level they are basically living in a in a food chain that
just involves phytoplankton to krill and straight to these big whales so it's an efficient you know
use of of of of trophic um energy remember the the tenfold increase in the amount of biomass
that has to be consumed at each trophic level and that's perhaps what can support these very large
organisms the baleen whales of course use sound as well they are famous for their whale song and
they emit low frequency but also very loud sounds that can be heard over long distances perhaps
thousands of miles across the open ocean and recently researchers have been learning a great
deal of new things about whale song in whales like the humpback which create very complicated
song patterns that um the meaning of which is unknown but they're clearly for communication
among members of particular groupings or families over longest over short distances and long
interestingly the whale song has recently been shown to actually
change and evolve over a course of a few seasons and in fact whale songs were found to originate
with a few individuals on the eastern side of the pacific near north america and then spread
from group to group and individual to individual were it such that a couple of seasons later
that same new song had spread to the far south pacific in a sort of uh some kind of a top 40
chart or something like that of humpback whales understanding the mysteries of baleen whales
and their whale song is something that's going to occupy marine mammal researchers for a long
time to come i'm sure well these baleen whales the humpback the grays the blue whales and the
minky whales which are actually the most abundant whales on the planet these are the ones you're
likely to see if you go out on a whale watching cruise uh either in the atlantic or the pacific
ocean certainly in bahá california humpbacks are there in great profusion or mali uh if you
go during the winter time they are actually migrants similar to the city shear waters and in fact
most of these whales spend the summertime in the high productivity zones that we've already seen of
the bering sea and the anardic waters and then migrate to places like hawaii and bahá california
and more tropical waters to over winter and to um uh to do their mating after they've fattened up
during the course of the summer well one of the unusual features of whales is whale strandings
and we've heard about these you know an example in this photograph of 55 pilot whales that beach
themselves on south african beaches in 2009 20 could be rescued it's very common when whale
strandings happen the whales beach themselves uh well-meaning people try to get them back in the
water and some of the whales turn around and come right back on shore again the reasons for whale
beachings are just entirely unclear they mostly happen in toothed whales not not baleen whales
and in whales that that tend to live normally out in open ocean in deep water and they'll just come
into shore for these beachings one thing we do know about whale strandings is they've been going on
for a very long time and probably are not the result of human disruption of their activities
because for hundreds and even thousands of years they've been described here in this 1577 engraving
we see three beach sperm whales um by a dutch artist uh showing that this has certainly been
something that's been well known to people for at least hundreds of years well we've taken a very
quick look at the marine birds the reptiles and mammals and seen how they're all derived from land
organisms that successfully return to the sea using different but similar and convergent adaptations
they all had unique ways to adapt to the life of the mariner and become part of the pelagic ocean
environment so in the next lecture we'll take a look at the human use and the human interaction
with these as biological resources meaning we're going to talk about the topics of whaling and
fishing both in history and today
