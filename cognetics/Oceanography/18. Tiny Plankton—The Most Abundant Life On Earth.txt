The open ocean, the realm without walls, is the pelagic habitat.
And it's really the world's biggest habitat.
So now we're going to try to take a look at some of the actual organisms that are making
their living out there in the open ocean.
And for this lecture, I'd like to really concentrate on the plankton.
Plankton are floating microscopic organisms, and they comprise a wide range of both plant-like
organisms and animals, and they're the foundation of the marine food web as we've already seen.
And they're also, it turns out, the most abundant life on the planet.
So anything that's pelagic, that lives in the pelagic environment, is living somehow
suspended in the water.
And we can break down pelagic life into basically two fundamental categories.
One is the necton, the organisms that actively move around by swimming through the water.
We're going to consider them a little later on.
And the other is plankton, organisms that drift or maybe very weakly propel themselves
in a very limited local way in the water.
Plankton comes from the Greek word planktos, which means wandering.
So the drifters, so the drifters of the open ocean.
And we think of mostly the microscopic plankton, and that's actually what I'm going to focus
on in this lecture, but plankton also includes macroscopic organisms, creatures as large
as eight meter long jellyfish, and colonial organisms like salps that we'll see a little
later on in this course as well.
So the plankton cover this wide range, but what they have in common is that they drift
with the ocean currents and waves or with the motions of the water relative to where
the photic zone is and things like that.
It doesn't mean though that they don't care where they live in the water.
In fact, they often have very specific habitat requirements that we'll see related to things
like staying within the well lit euphotic zone.
But let's take a look at defining a few of the key plankton that, or let's take a look
at defining what the different plankton are that are living in the ocean.
First of all, there's the phytoplankton, I've already talked about a little bit.
The microscopic, single celled, photosynthetic organisms, mostly algae that are primary producers.
Things like diatoms and dinoflagellates and coccolithophoreids.
Second there's the zooplankton, as the word zoo or zoo seems to imply.
These are small animals.
They're still often microscopic in size, but they're primary consumers.
They generally graze on the phytoplankton.
This includes things that we're maybe familiar with like krill or the jellyfish, but it also
includes things that maybe you're not so familiar with like copepods and tenephors that we'll
see in just a few minutes.
Then the zooplankton also includes single celled protistans or protist organisms.
They're still grazers and consumers, but they're just simply single celled organisms.
These include things like the radialarians and the foraminifers that we'll take a look
at.
Actually there's even more plankton, ones that you're even less aware of perhaps, but
there are many different bacterial plankton that we'll look at.
The bacterial plankton, as one mouthful of a word, includes both the autotrophic cyanobacteria
and also the heterotrophic decomposers.
All the bacteria that are out there breaking down the dead flesh of organisms that have
died and fallen through the water, fallen to the seafloor.
Finally there's the myroplankton, and myroplankton are the larval stages of some of the other
animals, the nectonic and perhaps even benthic organisms that live in the sea.
We have the larval stages of corals and of many fish and of crabs and things like that.
We'll look at those kinds of plankton in later lectures as well.
We're going to concentrate for the most part today on the first three categories, the phytoplankton
bacteria plankton and the zooplankton.
Well you can see then by just this definition that the plankton represent all the different
domains of life on earth.
Things from the simplest prokaryotic organisms, the archaea and the bacteria, up through the
various animals and protistans that are parts of the various domains of what we call the
eukarya, the more complex organisms that diverged early on from the single-celled bacteria
and archaea.
Well I described habitats earlier on and so we're really going to deal with the plankton
that live in the pelagic open water habitat, as I said the world without walls, and we're
going to largely focus now on the shallow and near-surface euphotic zone, the habitat of
the primary producers that represent much of the plankton as well as the primary consumers
that graze directly on those organisms.
Plankton have to adapt to remain in the photic zone.
If you're a phytoplankton then you need to stay where the sunlight is available to you
to photosynthesize and by definition if you're plankton you can't swim through the water
and yet you still need to be able to remain in the photic zone.
Now most organisms including single-celled organisms and phytoplankton have bodies that
are largely water and have some solutes so they have a similar density overall to seawater
but they always have a little bit more heavy material than seawater so they tend to be
a little bit negatively buoyant meaning they will tend to sink through at least still water.
Many of them as we've already seen and we'll see some more examples of have shells or tests
made of silica or carbonate these are basically minerals so they're heavier than water.
So these organisms need to find sort of adaptations or strategies to remain in the photic zone
and they have a number of them.
One is to just simply be as close to what we call neutral buoyancy as possible meaning
your density within your body should be as close to the seawater around you as is possible
so minimize the amount of heavy material but you can compensate for that by actually
secreting things like oil droplets within the protoplasm of the organism and so those
organisms actually do secrete oil droplets or little bits of fatty acids which are less
dense than water and so they compensate for the more dense than water parts of their shells
and maintain those little oil droplets either on or within their actual protoplasm or cell
walls or bodies.
Another thing that is helpful to stay basically in the same place in the water so you don't
sink through the water at least don't sink through too quickly is a large surface area
or a large surface area to volume ratio is more important so just by being small means
you have a small volume that increases your area to volume it means the drag of falling
through the water tends to slow you down if your surface area to volume ratio is large.
You can increase that ratio even more by having a complicated body shape lots of spines or
appendages sticking out from the body that slow down again you're sort of sinking through
the water and then you can add to that by having a flat shape or maybe extend by making
colonial chains with other organisms such as yourself other types of organisms that
are similar we'll see examples of that later on as well and then finally even single celled
organisms can have basically little propellers or flagellae or cilia things that they can
use to beat in the water and propel themselves at least short distances but because these
organisms are so small they're basically living in water that to them is a very viscous medium
now if we jump in the water or a dolphin jumps in the water it's certainly you know more
viscous more dense than air it's harder to swim through but it's a medium we can swim
through but when you shrink your body size down to being down to sort of microscopic
or even submicroscopic scale the medium is by comparison very different it's so viscous
it's like to us it's like what to us would be swimming in honey or something like that
so they can really only move very locally in their immediate environment even with flagellae
or cilia or other other mechanisms that that can move the water just a little bit.
Well we have all these different plankton and I'll talk about the varieties in just a second
but let's stop and say well how do biological oceanographers marine biologists sample the
plankton and the fundamental method hasn't changed a whole lot for most of the plankton
at least since the 19th century meteor and challenger expeditions which pioneered the
use of the plankton net and a plankton net is nothing more than a very fine meshed very
conical narrow sort of windsock shaped net with a special cup at the base to wash all
the material that comes in the net down to and it's towed through the water on a cable
usually at some specific depth for some specific length of time so that a calculation can be
made of exactly how much water pass through that net and then the concentration of plankton
in the net divided by that much water gives you a density of the plankton that was actually
in the water that you captured.
Now one disadvantage of a plankton net is you only get material you only get organisms
or things in the water that can be caught on that size mesh of the net so even for a
fine meshed net it will catch plankton down to a certain size and then anything that's
actually smaller might pass right through and not be captured and it turns out that for
a very long time for over a century marine biologists actually missed a whole lot of
the organisms in the ocean for that very reason because they were very small we'll see those
in just a few minutes.
If you look at the catch on a plankton net then it's a concentrated sample of what was
ever whatever was in the water at that particular depth and we find that actually both phytoplankton
and zooplankton are ubiquitous and are present in the water in large numbers, variable numbers
depending on the productivity of a particular zone but we find both the primary producers
and those consumers in any plankton net catch and so that includes very small animals as
well as these sort of plant-like or algae-like actually phytoplankton.
Well the phytoplankton themselves I introduced in the last lecture and we talked about primary
productivity quite a lot so let's look at who some of those primary producers are.
The phytoplankton are kind of amazing for the fact that they are a vast and ubiquitous
biomass on our planet.
We said that they basically make up 40% or so nearly half of all photosynthetic production
on earth.
They live in the global euphotic zone all over the surface of the ocean.
They make much more of the photosynthesis going on in the ocean than the things that
you might look at and say oh that looks like a photosynthesizer like a seaweed or seagrasses
the plants and green things of the ocean that we can actually see are actually a pretty
minor component of the total photosynthesis compared to all of these mostly microscopic
or very close to microscopic phytoplankton that we really can't see but you can catch
in a plankton net.
There are about eight major types of phytoplankton but we'll talk about just three essentially
the diatoms, the dinoflagellates and then the coccolith forids.
So let's take a look at those in a little bit more detail.
Diatoms are the most productive of phytoplankton and they are single celled algae essentially
that make a transparent silica glass shell.
It's called a frustule and these transparent shells are often very complex, very delicate
looking structures.
They're beautiful.
They're full of little pore spaces and very complex geometric arrangements that you can
see in some of the images of what these diatoms look like.
Those shells, those frustules are sort of like the diatoms own little personal greenhouse,
not in the sense of keeping something warm but in the sense of they provide protection
for the protoplasm of the actual organism which includes chloroplasts or cellular bodies
that have chlorophyll in them to do the photosynthesis work and they provide protection to all of
that material but also let light in.
They're clear transparent glass and let the light in so that photosynthesis can be efficient.
Diatoms are among the most, they are actually the most efficient photosynthesizers on the
planet.
They can use as much as 80% of the incoming sunlight in terms of converting it directly
to chemical energy and they store that energy in the form of food essentially but they store
that energy as fatty acids and oils which provides them with the carbohydrates they
need and also helps with the buoyancy problem that I just discussed to keep them floating
in the near surface water in the sunlit euphotic zone.
These shells of the diatoms actually have an interesting morphology.
They come in two parts that fit together very tightly almost like an old fashioned hat box
or a tightly fitting gift box, one slightly smaller than the other and when the diatom
reproduces it breaks apart and each of those two shell parts then grows a new shell or
the organism breaks apart by mitosis and then a new shell is constructed in both larger
half and the smaller half, the two valves of the shell.
You may have seen actually that diatoms are used as an industrial product because they're
so full of these tiny microscopic scale pore spaces then we use something called diatomaceous
earth actually as a filtering system.
Most swimming pools have a filter that's filled up with diatomaceous earth and you pump water
through it and all the little pore spaces in the diatom shells from of course not living
diatoms but from geologic deposits of them as sediments, the pore spaces are then able
to filter out dirt or whatever is present in the water of the swimming pool.
Well a second type of single celled autotroph is a dinoflagellate also silica based organism.
They have a completely different body morphology and they're kind of having a long gate part
and they orient themselves with their chloroplasts in a certain direction towards the sunlight
and so they actually have two whip like flagella, little appendages that can be rotated by the
organism and one is basically to beat to move it upward or downward relative to the
sunlight relative to the euphotic zone and then the other rotates and so that actually
orients the organism in the optimal direction to catch the sunlight and because these guys
can move through the water a little bit more efficiently they actually have a tendency
day and over day and night cycles to be up in the euphotic zone during the sunlight period
but then move down a little deeper in the water to get away from a lot of the consumers
that are going to try to try to eat them up overnight and then move back upwards again
and so actually during in dense concentrations or dense blooms of these kinds of phytoplankton
they can actually sometimes be seen on echo sounders and fish finder type devices moving
upwards and downwards through the water column over the day.
Well plankton like this all of these autotrophs have the ability like most single celled organisms
to very rapidly reproduce so we see geometric expansion if limiting nutrients are available
and don't provide a lot of limits and sunlight is available and all the conditions are favorable
they will divide and double and their doubling times can be as little as 12 to 24 hours through
asexual reproduction and so when the conditions get good the plankton bloom in incredible
profusion and that produces a great deal of the biomass seasonally in the oceans that we'll see
in just a second. It also produces some negative features and that includes what are so-called
red tides and other blooms of dinoflagellates. Red tides are actually just great masses of
innumerable dinoflagellates along the coastline and when conditions are good for them they will
bloom like that and it creates what's called an HAB or a harmful algal bloom so some of these
organisms that produce very strong neurotoxins that affect both fish and other marine life
and also affect human beings who eat shellfish and things like that are actually just basically
the direct metabolic products of those dinoflagellates. Fisteria for example is one of the specific ones
but there are a whole range of individual neurotoxins that come from dinoflagellates so the red tide is
just a massive bloom of literally millions of individuals per gallon of water turning the
water or the shoreline bright red and completely unsafe for consumption and the organisms unsafe
for consumption sometimes even for for breathing in the area when red tide washes up on the beaches
and dries that can cause people that can cause harmful damage to lungs even for human beings
especially people who are allergic or susceptible. Well the third type of phytoplankton is not a
salacious organism but one that is calcareous remember the one that built the white cliffs of
Dover that we talked about before the coccolithophorids the calcareous phytoplankton the most common one
is a single organism called emilliani-huxleyi tremendously productive and tremendously ubiquitous
in the ocean and this little organism also microscopic has a cytoplasm that includes a whole
bunch of individual platelets that are made of calcium carbonate made of chalk essentially
and the organism lives in the ocean floats in the water photosynthesizes when it dies that whole ball
of individual platelets sinks to the bottom and often breaks up into the individual platelets
which form those those calcareous ooze deposits and ultimately chalky rock.
Well all of these different phytoplankton as we said bloom when conditions are right and so they
have different distribution in different parts of the world. Generally speaking in the tropics
things don't get a lot warmer or cooler over the course of the year the thermocline and picnocline
is fairly constant throughout the year and so the nutrient barrier to vertical circulation that I
discussed in the last lecture is present and so the tropical region has sort of a certain amount
of productivity of phytoplankton biomass all year round but it's pretty steady. Contrast that with
the polar regions where just during the summer months June July August for the for the northern
hemisphere you get enough sunlight and a tremendous amount of nutrients because there isn't that
thermocline barrier and so you get a huge bloom of phytoplankton in the mid-summer months both
high latitudes north and south. Temperate regions are a little more balanced they tend to have spring
and fall blooms during the summer the water gets too warm and the nutrients are inhibited during
the winter it's too cold and there's not enough sunlight but in in between you get night you get
nice conditions for blooming so you get seasonal variations in these organisms.
Well we looked at this sort of averaged out map in the last lecture of primary production
in the world's ocean so now let's take a look at the seasonal variability of that primary production
year by year. This is a video image that starts in 2002 and runs just the satellite imagery
throughout the years and you can see as winter comes and goes you see the high productivity
high northern and southern oceans during the winter during the summertime and then it goes to
basically zero during the during the winter time the tropics don't change all that much
and the subtropical gyres don't change all that much but the coastal regions have greater spring
and fall productivity and then relatively less in the summertime and in the winter time.
Okay well that's not the whole story it turns out when we want to talk about primary productivity
all of those different uh planktic organisms that photosynthesize and that are caught in the
plankton nets were thought to be the whole story until about the 1980s and by the mid 1980s when
people took actually ceramic filters to see and caught a smaller size fraction of whatever was
in the water and then eventually even took what are called flow cytometers very sensitive devices
that can that can map out the chemical signatures of biological processes they found that there was
actually an entire class of photosynthesizers in the ocean that have been totally missed up until
then and in fact they're still only just being kind of completely explored and discovered in the
21st century and that is a whole variety of very small cyanobacteria or photosynthetic bacteria
and these have been given the name pico plankton because they're much smaller than all the plankton
that was already known in fact most of them have body sizes down in only the uh two micron down to
as little as two tenths of a micron in size that's very close to the size of the smallest bacteria
known getting down to sort of virus in size these weren't even discovered till about 1985
but they seem to be possibly actually very likely the most abundant bacteria on the planet so this
image of the organism called prochlorococcus a mouthful to say is a photosynthesizer and you
may be looking at the thing that there is or the organism that there is the most of on the entire
planet within the entire photic zone there's something like a hundred million of them in every
single liter of seawater anywhere on earth from the poles to the tropics well these prochlorococcus
are actually amazing light scavengers most of the photosynthetic plankton live in the euphotic
zone they live in the shallow well lit region where photosynthesis using chlorophyll can go on
the prochlorococcus actually live to even very deep depths in the dysphotic zone places where you get
down to where there's only 0.1 percent of surface light is penetrating anymore most of those other
organisms can't even make a living by photosynthesizing at those kind of depths but these guys have
some very finely tuned abilities to use even the blue light the very weak blue light that
penetrates to those kind of depths so all the activity of these organisms as well as a whole
bunch of other related cyanobacteria microcelliates and other tiny organisms that weren't discovered
until people went beyond the plankton net method of sampling fuels an entire food web that was
unknown to science as little as 20 or 25 years ago called the microbial loop it's largely independent
of the main marine food chain but it's a key important component of that food chain if we think
of the main marine food chain as being the one that phytoplankton feed zooplankton and other primary
consumers which feed the larger necton and fishes and things like that and everything is then recycled
by decomposers that's the what we think of as the marine food web the microbial loop is another
side that is almost completely independent of it where primary bacterial producers feel primary
bacterial consumers and primary bacterial decomposers that have sort of their own unofficial almost
like a black market food chain going on okay well we also have in addition to the phytoplankton
we have a whole variety of zooplankton the zooplankton as i said are animals that eat the
phytoplankton in fact eat each other and so they're all heterotrophs now they are plankton
meaning that they're mostly small and uh well they're all small they're all basically microscopic
or very close to microscopic in size and they can't swim around very much on their own because they
have that same problem with the water viscosity and their small size to really move very far on
their own but some of them look a lot like the larger organisms that we're used to seeing
we can actually break them down into two categories the holoplankton which um are the
organisms that spend their whole life as plankton easy to remember right because it's holoplankton
like whole life or the muroplankton and the muroplankton are basically juvenile forms of
other organisms like the crabs and the barnacles and clams and things like that that only spend a
portion of their um life as plankton so what are some of these zooplankton well let me introduce
you to the copepod a copepod is a crustacean kind of looks like one it looks sort of vaguely like
a shrimp or something like that but they're they're different different types of crustaceans
they're all invertebrates they're nearly microscopic they would just be a spec and you really need a
microscope to see any of these body structures that you see in these images and you are looking at
the most abundant animal on earth the most abundant category of animals on earths are
the copepods they're ubiquitous throughout the water both in the shallow water we've been talking
about today and also down to great depths in the ocean a little bit larger in size really
macroscopic certainly um but still zooplankton because they they have only a limited ability to
move around and they're basically carried by ocean currents and things like that are the krill krill
that look like shrimp they're sort of a smaller size they're also related they're arthropods
but also crustaceans like the copepods are they are tremendously productive seasonally especially
in the waters off Antarctica and also in the far north Bering Sea and they're the primary consumers
that are largely feeding on those great blooms of phytoplankton and the primary producers
so the krill uh followed just uh with a slight lag time behind the primary producers
in their great summer blooms in the far north and far south and these are the basis of the
food chain for the baleen whales in fact they're almost the exclusive food of some of the largest
organisms on the planet like blue whales um and essentially are the base of the high latitude
food chain in general or i should say are the the first consumer in the high latitude food
chain in general finally some of the zooplankton are single cell basically something that's
analogous to an amoeba and one of the most common of those also fairly ubiquitous in the ocean
is a foraminifer and a foram as they're called for short is an organism that sort of looks
like a phytoplankton but it's not it's actually an animal it's a single celled animal um and it
consumes other phytoplankton and even other zooplankton so a foraminifer builds a test
like some of the other phytoplankton that we saw it builds a kind of a skeletal structure
and it has a lot of delicate spines that stick off that skeletal structure
in order to hold it in the water a little bit better those spines actually get colonized by
phytoplankton and those phytoplankton are in a kind of a symbiotic relationship with the foram
so that the foram is essentially farming all of these small green creatures that are
feeding carbohydrates down to the to the amoeba that's at the center
in a pretty positive relationship for both of them I would say
forams have these incredibly delicate structures as well and they're beautifully illustrated actually
in this nice image from one of the the great early illustrations of a lot of microscopic
marine organisms which is Ernst Heckel's Art of Nature published in 1904 and you can see this
sort of central mass that is actually as a foram grows it adds chambers that are all filled up
with the cytoplasm and a certain amount of oil droplets that allow it to become neutrally buoyant
in the water and then the spines on the outside for for both maintaining flotation and also for
providing habitat essentially or a site for all of those phytoplankton to live on
now as I said forams are single celled organisms and they feed on other organisms
not just including the phytoplankton but also zooplankton so we can actually see examples
where this thing that looks like a just kind of a well it almost looks like any inanimate object
but it certainly looks like the phytoplankton and then a different zooplankton like a copepod that
really does look like an animal to us and yet it's the foram that's eating the copepod
and not the other way around like an amoeba it can go in and literally digest that microscopic
animal that was unfortunate enough to get stuck onto its spines well so we've introduced a whole
bunch of different microscopic plankton in this lecture and the thing is that these largely out
of sight plankton out of sight and out of mind but they represent an enormous proportion of the primary
production on earth they represent the greatest biomass turnover on earth as we talked about in
the last lecture and they are especially including the bacterial ones the most abundant organisms
on the planet they're the things we should be the most familiar with in some way at least based on
their abundance they represent all three of the basic biological domains and include many different
animal species and even today in the 21st century it seems like virtually every expedition to see
to look at the planktonic forms and the planktonic species are making new discoveries that are rapidly
advancing and understanding our understanding of both the abundance and also the energy and
food systems that they are the basis of for the entire ocean so now in the next lecture we're
going to take up the macroscopic drifters the larger scale plankton and then the necton the active
swimmers of the pelagic ocean
