In this lecture, we're going to take a look at the denizens of the deepest zones of all,
the bottom dwellers, or benthic communities of the bathyl, abyssal, and even hadal zones
of the deep sea floor.
Now, if we think about the deep sea floor, it's a hard place to access.
Actually, no human eyes had ever seen any scene from the bottom of the deep ocean until
the 1940s when Bruce Heisen, he of the Mapping the Mid-Atlantic Ridge fame, rigged up an
automatic camera.
It's a lower down on a cable and photograph the sea bottom.
And that was the first illumination to human eyes of what the sea floor looked like.
And what it looked like, of course, was muddy and vast, and yet, apparently, with a great
deal of life living in it.
Well, in the mid-1800s, people began dredging up sea bottom samples before the Challenger
expedition even.
And after a man named Edward Forbes, in particular, began dredging up samples from on the continental
shelf and into sort of the beginnings of deep water, he noted that he found life in these
samples.
We'll talk about some of the different life forms that are found on the deep sea floor
once we get out of the photic zone.
But they were dwindling in number with depth in his samples.
And so he took a straight line and basically extrapolated to a depth of about 300 fathoms,
500 or 600 meters or so, and said that his line extrapolated to zero, no life forms whatsoever.
So he made the leap of logic that this was the azoic zone, a region in the bottom of
the sea that would have absolutely no life because it was deep and dark, it was cold,
and at high pressure, and perhaps this was a place where biology simply couldn't exist.
Well, it turns out that nothing could be further from the truth.
The deep sea is populated to the greatest depths of the ocean, as we know today.
In fact, this was already beginning to be disproven even as Forbes formed this azoic
zone hypothesis, although the azoic zone persisted in the scientific literature and understanding
for a number of decades, even as people were dredging up materials and finding, there was
life in the deep sea.
One early theory, extant at the same period in the late 19th century actually, because
the Challenger expedition and other expeditions that were pulling plankton nets through the
water were finding that there was this sort of jelly-like mass that I described already
once.
Perhaps that jelly-like mass was actually a sample of some sort of living protoplasm
that covered the entire seabed everywhere in the ocean, and that it was actually even
one single living organism, which actually was given the name Bathibias.
Bathibias Huxleyi, it even got a specific scientific name after one of the Huxleys,
the founders of this idea.
Well, Bathibias Huxleyi was actually simply a mistake.
There is not one single living organism covering the entire ocean floor, and in fact it was
partially identified on the basis of some mistakes of understanding how the preservative
that was used to preserve all the jelly-ish samples were interacting with the chemistry
of the seawater and the seabed mud.
But Bathibias was sort of an interesting sort of just sidetrack on the way to understanding
that the deep sea bottom has a whole variety of many different species, and is a zone of
oases and differences, even as it seems monotonous when we take our first look at it, and when
he's and took his first looks at it.
Well, let's take a ride down the continental slopes then and look at what the benthic fauna
and benthic ecosystems are as we go down through the dysphotic zone into the toilet waters
and into the deep dark waters, and eventually emerge out onto the abyssal plains.
As we drop down, one thing is certainly true about what Forbes said, the abundance of life,
the biomass does diminish rapidly as we move off the lit continental shells and into the
deep water.
There's certainly not as much productivity out there, and different organisms take hold.
However, even down the continental slopes, a number of both sessile, meaning rooted in
organisms into the sea bottom, live on the seafloor.
The mud itself that's blanketing the continental slopes from all this tariginous sedimentation
is processed and digested by a whole range of different kinds of both epiphauna and infauna,
remember fauna that live on the seabed and fauna that live burrowing within the seabed,
and then macrophana, fish, skates, and cephalopods in the form of octopus and squid live near
and adjacent to the seafloor and graze on all of these organisms as well.
So there's a pretty diverse ecosystem down the continental slopes even.
For example, some of the epiphauna and the sessile organisms that root into the seafloor
include things like sea fans or gorgonians, they're common in the coral reefs, but they're
also present all the way down the continental slope and into even deep water.
Image of some of these beautiful sea fans from the Gulf of Mexico show these sort of
fanning forms that are rooted into the sediment or rock and then stick up into the water.
Sea pens are another example in this image from the Pacific Northwest, a continental slope
off the coast of Vancouver Island.
Both of them are nadarians, they're essentially polyps and they're filter feeders, they're
related to corals and sea anemones and things like that.
Deep water anemones are also present in all these depth zones, and all of them share the
trait of basically sticking up into the water so they can filter the slow-moving water currents
that glide up and down along the bottom and bring various detrital materials, stuff that's
raining down, organic matter raining down from above them and landing on the seafloor and
swirling about in the waters at depth.
They take advantage of that and digest whatever material they can find, as well as whatever
living organisms, microorganisms, plankton, happen to be in this particular zone at depth.
Deep water corals, as I described in a previous lecture, also exist, so there are a whole
number of both soft and even sort of semi-reforming corals that live in the deep water.
This example is called bubblegum coral for its particular kind of configuration, it has
little bits of bubblegum stuck all over it, but those are just the coral polyps themselves.
And there are even these deep water, they're not really reefs, but they form masses that
are called bioherms or accumulations of biological material that build up on the seafloor.
These corals of course are not, they don't have the zooxanthellae, they don't do any
photosynthesis, they live simply as polyps and live as primary consumers.
Well all of them are living on detrital material, and in fact at the bottom of the ocean you
may be surprised to find out that it's continuously snowing.
Now it's not snowing snow, it's snowing something called marine snow, but any camera
tow through the bottom of the sea, especially on the productive continental margins, will
find what looks like a constant rain of little white particles that look a lot like snow
swirling in the water.
What they actually are is little bits of organic detritus, they're dead parts of organisms
that live far above in the shallow waters, they're bits of the kind of the mucous nets
that I talked about being cast by terrapods and other marine organisms that then have
cut loose with little bits of organic detritus stuck to them.
Marine snow is ubiquitous, it's snowing all the time at the bottom of let's say the slope
off the coast of either eastern or western North America, and that material is what the
detritus feeders are feeding on.
Well, there are lots of macrophona as well associated with the continental slopes and
as we go down through the seaflooring areas that are productive, then we have organisms
crawling around in the bottom that are not really exactly like anything we've seen on
land or maybe are something from our worst nightmares on land.
This example of what's called a giant isopod, an organism that's related to the pill bug
or wood louse on land is truly daunting in size and kind of frightening looking the way
it's been sampled here.
It's basically a scavenger, it crawls around the seabed as epiphania and scoops up and
eats whatever it can find along the way, but it's also actually a carnivore of fish
and even squid, and these isopods can move remarkably quickly as video surveys have showed.
So they're very common on the Gulf of Mexico seafloor in particular as well as out in the
Atlantic Ocean.
Well the continental slope has numerous macrophona that are crawling around and living there
and all of the various studies and alvendives and things like that to the deep continental
margins have found a great profusion of crabs including the large crabs that are actually
the target of some of the deep sea trawling, skates and rays are present, octopus are tremendously
common on the continental slopes and out on the deep seafloor as well as these ubiquitous
fish that are known as rat tail fish because of their sort of elongate shape, no really
strongly developed tail fin, they don't have to move very often and very quickly but they
hover just above the seafloor and feed on the epiphana and infana that they can find.
Much of the continental slope is just a muddy, gentle slope leading down to the deep sea
bed and so like the deep sea bed it has relatively small concentrations of fauna in any given
location although they are ubiquitous at the same time.
But any particular place where there's something to hang on to, something to stick to and for
sessile organisms to root into produces essentially an oasis of life, so a rocky outcropping on
the seafloor or even just a ball of clay mud that has rolled down from above and landed
in a particular place but is a little firmer than the surrounding soft gooey ooze will
create an oasis of life and it will have all innumerable numbers of sea pens and fans,
deep sea sponges and various kind of species of anemones living all over those rocky regions
and then those of course fuel a larger ecosystem that includes a lot of macrophana so there's
entire sets of sort of habitats associated with just small rock outcroppings on the continental
slope and in fact on the abyssal plains as well including out on the seamounts that stick
up from the deep sea floor into shallower but still deep water.
In many places those seamounts are rocky outcroppings that stick up maybe from the 4,000 meter seafloor
up to 2,000 meters or 1,000 meters in depth and ocean currents as we'll see later sweep
over the tops of those and are kind of concentrated so the filter feeders are especially abundant
on tops of these seamounts.
Well in the waters of the lower continental slope and then out onto the broad abyssal plains
one of the most common kinds of organisms that you'll see moving around on the surface
of the seafloor are these ophiorians or ophiorids which are commonly known as brittle stars.
They're another form of echinoderm and they are similar to starfish that we see in the
shallow water but they're especially well adapted to life in the deep sea.
They can actually move quite quickly when they want to or they can remain sessled and
not eat anything at all for weeks and apparently even months at a time but they are opportunistic
and whenever there's a source of a small amount of food they'll move over to it and start
consuming it and they consume in the same way that a regular starfish does by passing from
their arms using the kind of suction grip that they have passing food in towards the
central mouth at the center of the organism.
Brittle stars are virtually ubiquitous in waters below 500 meters depth or so on the
slopes and out onto the abyssal plains and all over the world a whole variety of species
that all have the same basic brittle star these sort of long and skinny five pointed arms
are found on the organisms and we see them all over the seafloor and they're the first
thing that I saw when I looked out the view at the seafloor the first time that I visited
the bottom of the ocean in Alvin myself.
So if we go and take a look at the broad abyssal plains that represent the whole sea bottom
even after the discovery that yes there was life out there in the late 1800s with the Challenger
Expedition and on through the first half of the 20th century it was seen as a place where
life forms existed but it was sort of seen as a monotonous zone where the same few life
forms probably dominated the brittle stars as I said a few types of worms and a few types
of fish maybe an octopus or two lived all over the sea bottom all over the world because
the conditions were about the same everywhere temperatures were similar currents were slow
the only food available was essentially marine snow detritus raining down from above and
so perhaps this was a zone that was populated but pretty boring but it turns out again that
was really upended once people were able to do a little bit more sophisticated job actually
sampling the deep abyssal plains.
Now certainly there's no sunlight and there's little energy down there and it's cold so
these are scavenger based food webs just as they were on the continental slope and the
organisms that exist down there mostly do move and grow slowly but starting from the
1960s when scientists got a little bit more sophisticated about how they sampled the benthic
fauna it was discovered really that there are surprisingly diverse and diverse life
forms and robust ecosystems even if the actual total biomass is relatively small on the deep
sea bed it's not it's far from a desert in the sense of having diverse life.
A couple of scientists from Woods Hole actually devised a special sampling trawl that would
sample the deep sea floor a little bit better than it had been done before they called it
the epibenthic sled and it was just a rig that would basically sample scoop into the mud
so it would sample the upper few centimeters or so or a few tens of centimeters of mud
but sample at the same time the water for a meter or so just above the bottom and what
they did what they found when they dragged this sled through the mud and after just trawling
along for an hour or so and pulled up what they got it was incredibly diverse and incredibly
large surprise to them how many different species they found.
They found literally hundreds of species and thousands or even tens of thousands of individual
organisms in each toe of the epibenthic sled out there in just a sort of let's say average
place on the Abyssal Plain in the Atlantic Ocean or in the Gulf of Mexico.
Well one study later on found that when they really looked at a specific zone in the ocean
employing cameras every square meter of the sea floor again in the Atlantic Ocean on the
garden variety Abyssal Plain found 4,500 organisms in a single square meter representing 798
different species so this zone may be relatively unpopulated but it's certainly not depopulate
it has a vast diversity of life existing in very very specific niches that have evolved
to work together and exploit every available resource in this relatively scarce zone of
the deep sea floor.
Well let's take a look at what a kind of a typical scene then from about 50% of planet
earth most of the surface of the earth is the Abyssal Plains.
Well this is a zone that's dominated by worms and echinoderms. Worm burrows and small mounds
that are the places where the worms have expelled mud from the seabed are ubiquitous and these
worms called polychaete bristle worms are one of the best adapted organisms on the entire
planet they exist from the shallow coral reefs all the way to having been discovered at the
bottom of the Challenger Deep now the deepest place in the entire ocean is populated at
least in part with what are called bristle worms they're also adapted to the mid ocean
ridges as we'll see.
Another type of worm that lives down there a little bit more complicated organism is
called an acorn worm that forms a U shaped tube in the seabed and basically just eats
its way through the sediment taking in all the mud and sand digesting every bit of organic
material that's in it and then expelling what's left out behind and into these complicated
worm castings that cover large parts of the seafloor so they're a little bit like the
earthworms of the sea bottom.
And then in addition to the worms we can really say that the kings of the deep seafloor are
the echinoderms, holothurians which are called sea cucumbers, brittle stars I've already
described another organism called a crinoid all of these are like starfish or like sea
urchins that we see in the shallow water are really the dominant species in terms of processing
the seabed and being what you find present on the seabed all over the world. There are
many thousands of different species of echinoderms. Now echinoderm literally means spiny skin
so we think of a sea urchin we think of an echinoderm and if you remember what a sea
urchin looks like they tend to be circular with a pentagonal kind of symmetry a five
pointed body plan and a central mouth and an anus to expel food waste. Well all of these
different organisms in very many different shapes and perfusions are all echinoderms
and we'll take a look at a few of them but one thing about the echinoderms that's interesting
is that the largest phylum remember a phylum is sort of the most basic class within the
kingdom of animals, anemalia, they're the largest phylum that has no fresh water or
terrestrial representatives they're exclusively marine, exclusively oceanic. Well the real
king perhaps of the seafloor at least in terms of photographability are the holothurians
the so-called sea cucumbers. This example is actually called a sea pig and they're crawling
around the abyssal plains and even the deep sea trenches in the hadal zone in great numbers.
They're the real waste processor of the deep and they're essentially little machines for
eating mud once again. They have a body that is actually unlike most of the other echinoderms
not spiny at all they're completely soft and they're essentially inflated by water they
pump themselves up with water pressure and that's what holds them into their given shape
when they want to move they pump a little water into particular sort of pseudopod or
leg and inflate that one and move it and then move other ones with muscle contractions but
all of it is about moving water around so they're kind of a little hydraulic system of an organism.
They eat the waste that they find in the seafloor so they're great detritus feeders and when
they were first discovered on the deep sea floor in these various camera surveys they
were quickly discovered to sometimes turn up in great profusion literally by the thousands
in sort of herds of sea pigs or herds of holothurians thundering across the abyssal plains.
Well maybe not thundering they move kind of slowly but no one really is quite clear on
why they herd together perhaps it's because they find some particularly rich feeding ground
or perhaps because it's just hard to reproduce and find mate on the abyssal plains so sticking
together makes a lot of sense but the holothurians are certainly one of the most abundant organisms
on the seafloor. Well we've seen that every square inch then every bit of the muddy seafloor
has continuously been worked over by scavenging organisms like these brittle stars and holothurians
like the polychaete or bristle worms and they reprocess all the available organic matter
literally every bit of the seafloor has been through the gut of some organism multiple
times over so it's a very efficient scavenging system out there and it's a very diverse one
just tiny little differences perhaps in the available resources on the seafloor have led
to the evolution of different species in a patchwork all over the planet. There are also
sort of isolated zones like the deep sea trenches where at the bottom of a deep sea trench there
is one particular set of all of these types of organisms one particular set of species
that are different from the ones say in a different trench between the Japan trench
for example in the Mariana's trench or the Peru Chile trench so similar environments
but of course not surprisingly have evolved different organisms because of the great distances
in between them. Well one of the sort of sets of oases that exist on the deep sea floor
is the existence of basically detrital falls of windfalls of great amounts of food and
one thing that's been discovered just in the era again of deep sea exploration by submarines
and ROVs is that whale carcasses and presumably other large organisms that die up in the water
column somewhere and fall to the bottom are a great source of food. The existence of these
whale carcasses has really upended our understanding of how rapidly life can proceed at the bottom
of the ocean because when one of these happens and now they've been captured on video a couple
of times and actually dead whales have been submerged by researchers and then watched
and it's found that organisms come out of the woodwork it seems literally from everywhere
around and start to very quickly digest and can in fact completely denude one of these
carcasses over the span of just a few days or weeks. Hagfish, specialized worms, the
sea cucumbers themselves and crabs all come in great numbers from the region somehow smelling
or sensing that dead organism and digest all of the available flesh right down to and including
the bones of the whale which is perhaps why we don't find as many fossils as one might
expect in deep sea sediments because even the bones are digested within a matter of weeks.
Well we've looked at the abyssal plains now and so I want to turn my attention to the really
remarkable deep sea vent communities. We've already mentioned them a couple of times now. If we go
to the mid-ocean ridges we see these vast profusions of organisms right around those black
smokers in the hot hydrothermal vents. All the marine ecosystems we've looked at so far including
the detrital ones are ultimately based on photosynthesis fueled by the sun. In fact until
the late 1970s it was believed by all biologists that all life on earth was based on photosynthesis
that was the only pathway for primary production to take place. But in 1977 the discovery quite
by accident of the thriving benthic community the deep sea tube worms and clams that were
living at the hydrothermal vents on the Galapagos rift of the East Pacific rise showed that this
entirely different way of life exists and that's the one we call chemo synthesis or chemo
autotrophy. So chemo synthesis is a different pathway than photosynthesis and it uses chemical
energy not sunlight to basically make the carbohydrates and sugars that life depends on for food. So
if you have carbon dioxide and oxygen and you combine it with hydrogen sulfide then an organism
that can exploit this and can make this reaction take place through chemical pathways that catalyze
that reaction can take that hydrogen sulfide can make glucose C6H12O6 in fact and then they use
the sulfide, they use the energy in the hydrogen sulfide to make the glucose to assemble those
molecules and then that produces a whole bunch of free sulfur as well as a bunch of water. So most
of us can't do this in part because we can't deal with the sulfur that's a poison to us and so
these organisms have had to develop an ability to resist the toxicity of that sulfur to manage it
and get it out of their bodies. But the chemo synthesis of the chemo autotrophic bacteria that
live at the mid ocean ridges was an entirely novel concept of science at this time. So in
particular or the way it works is that you know hydrogen sulfide as well as many other chemical
species but in particular hydrogen sulfide comes out in the hot vent water of the black smokers.
There are bacteria that can oxidize that sulfide to make the carbohydrates as I said
and they live freely in the waters both actually within some of the mid ocean ridge vent rocks
just adjacent to the hottest of the water but also within the guts of the larger organisms
that are masked around them in these great profusions. So there's this symbiotic relationship
going on between them. If we take a look at some video footage of what things look like down there
at the mid ocean ridges you see that there are these very large tube worms the what are called
the rift tube worms riftia or they're all vestimentiferans is the name for them. They can grow to
great lengths three meters or more in length and you see the actual worm itself sticking out from
its kind of chitinous casing the tube in the gut of that worm down inside the tube are great masses
of these bacteria the bacteria chemosynthesize they make the food the worm lives on the food
and that's the only food that that worm gets it can filter feed a little bit out of the water but
it's just filter feeding more of the same bacteria that are floating around that same region that
you actually see as that sort of flocculated snow again that looks like it's coming out of the
of the black smokers. Surrounding these worms and surrounding these communities are a number
of other organisms as well they're very large clams that live in the region they grow very
rapidly they can achieve sizes sort of like this you know 10 20 centimeters in length
there are mussels there are these crabs that live around that are are are actually feeding off of
all of the food generated by the clams mussels and and and tube worms the tube worms the clams
and the mussels all share one really interesting trait and that is that their their flesh is red
and in fact it's red because they bear hemoglobin essentially the thing that makes our blood red
is also common or it's it's present ubiquitous in all of these communities organisms that live on
the chemoautotrophs and the reason is that they need that to bind the sulfur and get it out of
their systems so they have red flesh and sort of red blood in a sense these are clams that you
wouldn't want to eat by the way that red flesh and and and and the actual clam material stinks to
high heaven of h2s if you bring it up to the surface there are also shrimp living in this
environment that have special organs on the backs of their heads and can sense the heat from the
hot vents coming out of the water and they orient themselves around these hot vents so these whole
communities of organisms based on a totally symbiotic relationship with the chemo synthetic
bacteria are living down there and in fact have been living down there since time immemorial it
seems virtually certain that these in communities were evolved early and have been present in the
bottom of the ocean for at least hundreds of millions of years there are many many different
varieties and species we've seen that they've been found along rifts now all around the world
ocean not just the galopagus but throughout the atlantic and pacific and indian ocean more
than 900 species associated with the hot vents have been catalogued one of the interesting ones
is a bristle worm called the pompeh worm because it lives right up adjacent to the hot water all
of these organisms that can live in these hot vent areas are sometimes called hyperthermophiles
they love heat thermophiles so the hyperthermophiles can live not actually in water that's at 400
degrees but right up adjacent to it in water in excess of 100 degrees c now chemo synthetic
communities of other types have actually been located in a bunch of other non hydrothermal
vent environments over the past couple of decades we've shown that they're far more widespread and
varied than was initially recognized some of the best known ones are the communities of what are
called cold seeps methane or hydrogen sulfide the seeps out of the seafloor on the continental
slope and in fact in areas where there are hydrocarbons or petroleum coming out of the
seafloor in places like the gulf of mexico and elsewhere places where there's no special heat
involved but just the chemical energy is present these cold-seat communities are actually uh
they actually are comprised also of clams and tube worms and some similar organisms but very
different species that can adapt to and exploit the fairly small amount of energy coming out of
a cold water seep that just bears a little bit of concentrated h2s or methane remember those
alvin dives that i talked about that were my first big project as a graduate student well this
photograph is of one of these cold seeps a scraggly little bunch of tube worms an octopus
living nearby uh to feast on the clams perhaps um but but not much compared to the mid-ocean
ridge black smokers but still a community that thrives in the deep and is living and has been
living since time immemorial in places where energy from the interior of the earth in this
case subduction zones not mid-ocean ridges is fueling the chemical life that they that they
depend on the bacteria that they depend on at the mid-ocean ridges we see actually even more
profusion or sorry not at the mid-ocean ridges but at oil and gas seeps on the seafloor we see
profusions of life because there's more energy coming out in places where those hydrocarbons
are leaking out of the seabed so we can't digest you know oil and fuel ourselves the way our cars
do but these organisms these tube worms and clams and the actually the chemosynthetic bacteria they
host can do that equally well in places like the gulf of mexico where it's seeping out of the seabed
in actually pretty large amounts uh you know beyond oil spills there's a lot of natural
oil and methane gas seeping out of the seafloor in any of the big petroleum producing basins
of the world and they host very similar communities of organisms well so we've seen that although
it's deep and dark and cold the deep seafloor of the continental slopes and abyssal plains is far from
devoid of life it's really the kingdom of the echinoderms and worms though and the holothurians
seem to rule the world all the way to the greatest depths in the bottom of the ocean in the bottom
of the deep trenches it's characterized by hosting complex ecosystems of low biomass but
very steady productivity and capable of taking advantage of a real windfall though in the form
of say a whale fall and and moving very quickly when it needs to the chemo autotrophs of the black
smokers and the cold seeps are a form of life that is simultaneously totally new to science just
in the past few decades but possibly the most ancient of all life on the entire planet well
we've taken a real look through the life that fills up the entire ocean and the nature of the
water column as a whole but next we're going to sort of turn the page and zoom out to look at the
ocean in motion how the processes that govern the ocean include all the currents and the movements
of the water through the sea in order to do that we're going to have to look at processes at the
other edge we've looked at the extreme bottom of the ocean now we'll have to look at the extreme
edge of the ocean in the form of looking into the atmosphere the surface currents and how climate
and movements of heat on the planet govern those ocean currents and movements in the water
