Your lecture is professor Harold J. Tobin a professor of geoscience at the University of Wisconsin Madison
Dr. Tobin is an expert in oceanography and a veteran ocean-going explorer a fellow of the Geological Society of America
His fascinating insights into the ocean depths have been featured on the Discovery Channel's Science Channel and the History Channel
Professor Tobin has been a joint oceanographic institution's distinguished lecturer and has won a Best Instructor Award from the students of the University of Wisconsin Madison
Viewed from space the earth is surely an ocean planet unique in our solar system and in fact unique among all the planets we know of earth is covered by a liquid water ocean
This is the most fundamental feature that governs the geology of our planet the plate tectonics it governs the biology and development of life on this planet and certainly it governs so much of human history
Down here on the ground we human beings have been fascinated with the ocean for millennia who among us has not stared out at the sea in wonder wondering what's beneath the waves what lies out there what is it that makes the ocean the way that it is
I'd like to take you on a voyage of discovery in this course and I'd like to start this first lecture with an exploration of what oceanography is
I'll begin with my own story now my name is Harold Tobin and I'm a marine geologist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and I have a confession to make you know I did not grow up particularly fascinated by the sea
Oh sure I was a person like everybody else enjoyed playing in the waves at the beach as a kid or going out on a sailboat or a kayak or something like that and enjoyed the landscape enjoyed the ocean itself
But I was an earth scientist and as an undergraduate I was a geologist I was fascinated by the way the planet works and mostly that was onshore not offshore
But my adventure in ocean science began with the start of my graduate studies or actually just a little bit before the beginning when I got a chance to join the crew of a research vessel that was heading out to the Pacific Ocean
So I was sent down to San Diego young nervous hadn't really even started graduate school yet didn't feel like an expert in anything and I had been offered a position as a volunteer watchstander
Crew scientist that is on a British research vessel the RRS Charles Darwin docked in San Diego and ready for a 36 day voyage out into the Pacific Ocean
So it was just me 40 British scientists and crew and I had to meet them make friends and start this great adventure
We headed off to sea off the coast of Panama Columbia and Ecuador and we were surveying the sea floor we were mapping out the sea bed itself
We were making measurements of the force of gravity the strength of the Earth's magnetic field all the marine geophysical measurements that we're going to look at in much greater detail later on in this course
All of those days and nights at sea as I stood watch on a 24 hour kinds of schedule I was learning about the science but I was also just feeling the incredible power and romance of being out on the ocean doing this and seeing things for the very first time that no one else had ever seen before either
For in fact what we were doing was we were mapping the sea floor and we were mapping features even huge mountains on the bottom of the ocean that had never been seen before and this is only 1989 it's not so long ago
The excitement of revealing these literally uncharted waters these unmapped features was just phenomenal to me
And even beyond that while I was on the ship and when I was off my shift work then there was the beauty of the sea all around me we were watching the waves there were dolphins and porpoises playing in the bow wave of the ship as we sailed along
There were flying fish landing on the deck literally all night long big storms would arise other times the sea was calm the living nature of everything around me in the ocean absolutely captivated my imagination and added to the excitement of the science that we were doing
All of those days and nights at sea 30 some days without ever coming into port I had never been out of sight of land before in my entire life so this was a really a completely new adventure
We finally ended the expedition with a trip through the Panama Canal and we had to go into port in Cartagena Columbia at the end of the expedition
So as we sailed through the Panama Canal all lit up at night standing out on the deck our work was done for the expedition and there we were just enjoying the ride through the the Panamanian jungle
I just realized that this was something I had to do I had to make a part of my research life was really the oceanographic side of the science that I was interested in
So roll forward a year later and I'm ensconced in my graduate studies and the first big research opportunity I got as a graduate student was even more exciting in a way than that
And that involved going out to sea on the ship the Atlantis 2 and diving to the bottom of the ocean in a research submarine called Alvin
Now Alvin is absolutely unique there are only a few subs in the world capable of diving to these kinds of depths
So here I am yes in the classic 1980s mode of bearded graduate student in the sciences that seems to be what all the California students were like
And we were getting ready for our first dive learning all of the procedures to go inside the submarine and go 2,500 meters almost 8,000 feet beneath the waves off the coast of Oregon to study the plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor down there
So we got into the submarine and you crawl into it it's very small it's the size of a kind of a Volkswagen Beetle on the inside
Three people one pilot and two scientists only a tiny porthole this big to look out of and get at least a glimpse of what's out there in the ocean
And as you drop down through the water you pass down first through the lit up zone of the water near the surface and then further down into the darkness
And outside the window of the porthole as we were diving down to the bottom the ocean I could see little flashing lights bioluminescent organisms everywhere thousands of them I couldn't believe how alive the middle of the water was with all of these organisms
Kept diving down to the bottom eventually reach the seabed and then the alvin pilot turns on the lights and we're seeing the sea floor just a muddy expanse at first but we're seeing some piece of the earth surface that no one has ever seen before in the history of this planet
It just completely blew my mind at that moment that I could be an explorer here and at that time the end of the 20th century and again mapping things that no one had ever seen before
As we drove along the sea floor then we looked out through the windows and we noted some of the features that we were seeing
Our job was to map the geology to map what was going on on the seabed and describe the types of rocks that were down there the attitudes and the angles
We drove the submarine up through submarine canyons where we could see outcrops of rock and take the attitudes of the bedding planes of the rocks and things like that
And I was there for the geology but meanwhile you know the life outside the window the porthole of alvin was what was really fascinating to me
I kept seeing all kinds of creatures on the sea bottom and yes I was doing my job in mapping the geology and I was certainly fascinated by that
But it was hard not to be distracted by the fact that even here way down at the bottom of the ocean a mile and a half deep
We were still seeing not just a few organisms here and there but all sorts of life of all sorts of species and sizes octopus and skates, tube worms and clams
Various organisms all living down there having never seen light before in their entire life except perhaps for a few of those bioluminescent organisms
So we did our work and in fact the interesting part about our work touches on a theme that I will try to develop in this entire course
And that is that we were mapping the geology but our interest was in how fluids, how water was seeping out of the rocks along fault lines
And that those fluids that water was actually controlling aspects of how the earthquake faults at the bottom of the ocean work
The way we were mapping those fluids was because biological organisms, the tube worms and clams of what we call cold water seeps
Were living on the water that was coming out of the rock
So the geology and the hydrology was controlling where the biology was
The biology can live there only because special chemistry, energy that they get from the water that's coming from inside the earth
Because it's carrying hydrocarbons and other things that they can live on
So the biology and the geology were intimately merged, intimately linked and we were mapping geology by mapping biology
That in a nutshell is the story of oceanography
That is really what it's all about and what this course will be all about is how all of the different sciences come together in the study of the ocean
And the only way to really understand the ocean in all its myriad facets is to bring together a whole range of different sciences
So here I am in this image, you know, exhilaration is mixed with relief as I exit the cramped interior of that sub and you can see it in my face I think
The excitement and the wonder of what I've just seen at the bottom of the ocean
A number of dives later, that excitement never really went away
And the ability to make an adventure out of science is something that stuck with me to this day 20 plus years later
Ocean science is still fundamentally an adventure and maybe more so than any other science on the planet
There is so much that's unexplored and yet also so much that we've learned over the course of the past centuries
About how the oceans work, about how the life lives in the oceans and what's going on both above and beneath the sea floor
And that is where I want to take you in this course is understanding what that adventure is all about
Well let's look at the planet as a whole
I referred to earth as a water planet and fundamentally surely that's what it is
71% of the surface of the earth is covered by the ocean
Land is not the dominant feature of earth although we as land organisms have a tendency to be a little bit biased in the direction of land
Almost all the water on the planet is in the oceans
Sea water, salt water is 97% of earth's surface water
All the fresh water, the polar ice caps, the Greenland ice cap, the Antarctic ice cap
All the fresh water that is on the land like the Great Lakes, lakes, rivers, streams, ponds
All the ground water that lies beneath our feet that supplies our drinking water
That's 3% of the water on the planet, it's almost a forgettable amount of water compared to what's sitting out there in the oceans
The ocean also is a constant on this planet
For nearly all of the history of the planet as we'll see, most of the 4.5 billion years that earth has been around
The ocean itself has also been around
And the ocean has been essential to life
The ocean has been essential to the climate and what makes the earth a habitable environment
And it's even been essential to the geological forces of the planet
You might be surprised to learn that plate tectonics probably wouldn't exist the motion of the plates on the surface
If it weren't for the water in the ocean and the water on the surface of the planet
So in many ways, the ocean is that most fundamental feature of the earth
And we're going to have to explore it, we're going to have to explore it in all of its different facets
Well let's think about what oceanography is then as a science
And who oceanographers are? I called myself a marine geologist at the beginning of the lecture
What does that mean to say I'm a marine geologist?
Well fundamentally, oceanography is just all of the natural sciences, but applied to understanding the marine realm
We could just as easily call it marine science as oceanography
But we can break it down and say that oceanographers are a number of different scientists in that case then
We have physical oceanographers and chemical oceanographers who just simply apply the principles of physics and chemistry
To the study of the water column itself, the water that's above the sea bottom
We also have marine geologists and geophysicists like myself
Who are interested in how the ocean basins got the way that they are
How the shape of the sea floor is a reflection of things like plate tectonics
Or also how the record of the earth's history, the earth's climate history, is present in the sediments that accumulate over eons on the sea floor
And that we can sample and access and study as scientists
But equally true, marine scientists include the people who studied the life that lives in the ocean
So marine biologists are another huge aspect of oceanography
And the biology and the history of life, meaning the paleontology in the ocean is another facet of oceanography
That has to be linked back to the physical oceanography and the chemical oceanography and the geological oceanography
So we have people whose specialty in fact are things that we call paleo oceanography or paleoclimatology
And that just means the study of not the current state of the ocean, but the past state of the ocean
And that's typically through understanding of the sediments and the accumulated biological fossils that are in them
Or the chemistry of those fossils that tells us about the state of the water
At different times, thousands of years ago, hundreds of thousands of years ago, millions and even billions of years ago in the sea floor
Now I've talked about oceanography as an exploration and a science of kind of discovery
But of course oceanography is a modern science in so many ways
And it involves specialists in things like mathematical modeling, computer simulation of how the water flows through the ocean
And large-scale ocean currents
Or mathematical modeling of the density variations or the heat content of the ocean and how that changes as the Earth's climate changes over time
We also have a huge component of engineering in the ocean
Ocean engineers have been around since actually ancient times in terms of understanding how to build ships, how to navigate
We'll look at all of that in lectures to come
But even today, engineering involves all sorts of very sophisticated, some of the largest structures on the planet are now built on the sea floor
As part of, let's say, offshore oil installations or tunnels and bridges and things like that
There are special needs for engineering to deal with the pressures, the conditions on the seabed at great depth below the sea floor
So all of these fields wrap together and ultimately are all part of what we can call just under the umbrella term oceanography
The roots of our science, all lie as we're going to see in the practical needs, mostly of sailors and traders, especially if we go back to the early days
In the next lecture we'll talk about some of the history of exploration
But science comes first from a practical need, perhaps, to understand, say, where ocean currents go
This map from the 1760s drawn by Benjamin Franklin, based on observations of his cousin and navigator, shows the Gulf Stream
And it's so similar, in fact, to a satellite image of the exact same thing that we see today, using the most modern technology of imaging the temperature structure of the surface of the ocean
Satellite altimetry, satellite thermal measurements, showing us exactly where the Gulf Stream lies
And reflecting that same urge to understand what's out there at sea that Benjamin Franklin had, in his case, for a very practical reason
Because it was easier to sail back and forth to England if you knew where the Gulf Stream was and could carry your sailing vessel further along
The scientists who are looking at the satellite imaging now have some of the same practical interests
They want to know the weather patterns, they'd like to know the currents, the energy in the ocean that's going to drive features like hurricanes and storms
But we're also driven today, maybe, by a level of curiosity about just what's the fundamental science, how does our planet work?
And I think scientific curiosity has always been around, but we'll see it certainly come to the forefront over the course of maybe the past century or century and a half in a way that didn't exist before that
Fundamentally, oceanography is really a young science, I just described to you all the practical applications and the ways technology started to develop
But we will see that even 50 years ago or so, the most basic nature of the deep ocean remained a mystery to us
As the Earth beneath the sea has gradually been revealed, the origins of the planet and the life on it have come into focus
And that's a story that plays out just over recent generations in a way that makes it very much alive as a science, and a science that's developing extremely rapidly even today
So this story then, if I can summarize that, is one of pure exploration
It's evolved into modern science and it's been facilitated by engineering and technological change all the way along the way
We'll explore all of that in lectures to come
As just one example, you know, soundings and mapping of the continental shelf because people needed to know where they could sail their vessels into and out of harbors without running on ground
That gradually revealed the shape of the sea floor, it starts with ropes and cables, later with sonar, most recently with satellites
That mapping has evolved into studies that focus on a particular question, we don't simply just go out and map for the sake of mapping anymore
We're interested in addressing hypotheses in science, testing our theories, perhaps plate tectonic history, perhaps theories about the habitat that different organisms live in
So we see different ages developing over the course of the development of oceanography as a science
Ages of exploration and discovery were really just getting out there and seeing new things was so remarkable that that's all that was necessary to do
And then how that has evolved into an era of measurement
And now even today, monitoring, continuous monitoring of ocean processes that in the past was completely impossible to do any more than just sample very briefly or very occasionally
Something like looking at the Gulf Stream current but looking at it on a daily or even hourly basis as satellites make those measurements at the surface
Well, I'd like to carry you through then just a little sampler of what some of those different fields that I described a few minutes ago as the branches of oceanography actually do
So first marine geology, certainly that's the study of how the ocean basins have been constructed
But still are being constructed, certainly it didn't stop, we're in the middle of plate tectonics today
Just as much as we were if we could go back 50 million years or 100 million years or even a billion years
And marine geology is also the study of how sediments record Earth's history
How the accumulated material on the sea floor is a record of what's happened to the planet over all of its time
Some of those sediments are still on the sea floor, we need to go out into the deep sea in order to sample them
Others have been brought up onto the continents by plate tectonic processes and we see them as sedimentary rocks that we can look at on land
The most fundamental thing we've learned in marine geology over the course of the past century or so, even less than the past century in fact
Is that the ocean floor is the most dynamic of geologic environments on Earth
And we'll explore that in a lecture to come as well
The sea floor is continuously being remade and this is something that just wasn't known even a few generations ago
Volcanoes are constantly erupting under the ocean, in fact most of the erupting volcanoes on the planet are actually at sea
And we see this beautiful image of people capturing that live in a photograph taken near Tonga in the South Pacific
Of an undersea volcano that was actually erupting under the water but was so close to the surface that it was blasting its volcanic ash and eruptive gases right through the water surface so people could witness it
The revolution in Earth Sciences that we call plate tectonics has shown us that most of all the plate tectonic action is about the ocean floor, not about the continents
And we'll explore in future lectures all about how that plate tectonic activity has been discovered and it's been discovered really through, only through the understanding of what's at the sea floor
Let's consider marine biology now, the myriad organisms that live in the sea range from the completely familiar, the fish on your dinner plate, the crab running along the beach
To the virtually alien life forms that live in the deep water, the jelly-like combs and tenophores that light up with bioluminescence, the strange creatures that swim through the deep sea vents at the sea floor
In fact, those life forms were so alien-seeming that when James Cameron wanted to make an alien world for his film Avatar, he based everything that he saw down there, or that he based everything that he used in the film on what he had seen during all those dives to the Titanic and other vessels that he had done as part of his earlier work
Almost unimaginably varied and filling every niche of depth and temperature and pressure in the ocean, life's been evolving and adapting in the sea for up to four billion years, as we'll see, almost as long as the Earth has existed
Life's been right there with it and it's been part and parcel of the ocean
More so the ocean actually than the land, life has only been around on land for a relatively short portion of Earth's history
Everything that lives in the ocean is connected in a way that is not vague, but a way that's very specific in terms of the food webs
The smallest denizens of the sea and the largest and everything in between are intimately linked in this continuous energy exchange that we think of as primary production and predation and one organism eating another
So we'll see how the microscopic feed the macroscopic, the largest organisms like whales, and then vice versa, how that cycle continues back the other way in an energy exchange in the ocean
All this is so though and in fact life itself is possible because of special properties of water and special properties of ice and how water converts from a gas to a liquid to a solid
How those properties control the environment of our planet, from the arctic to the tropical regions
And it's really those properties of water that have actually made life possible
And the chemistry and the physics of this fundamental fluid that we don't even think about because we take for granted so much around us as we'll see is the thing that makes Earth special and unique
So we'll have to explore chemical oceanography and we'll have to explore physical oceanography in order to understand everything about how water moves in the ocean
How water traps heat in the ocean, how water interacts with the atmosphere and with what's below it, below the sea floor in this complex and ever changing yet continuously staying the same system that we call the ocean
So we'll look at these ocean environments and habitats that range all over the planet, from ice shelves in the arctic to tropical reefs to the deepest water, the open lifestyles of living in the water column
Divorced completely from any solid substrate at all and then all the way down to the bottom of the deep ocean where organisms live in the deep and the dark abyss where there's no light, no chance for photosynthesis
And yet somehow organisms make a living down there. We'll have to explore how they can possibly do that and where the energy comes from that fuels that life at the bottom of the ocean
We'll also have to take a look at the interaction between the sea and the landscape because the sea meets the land at the coasts and that's a constantly changing environment
It's governed by fundamental processes again of physics and chemistry, of the pounding of the waves on the coast, breaking down the rock, causing erosion, deposition of sediment, creating habitats and niches for life to live in
And ultimately governing so much of our human interaction with the sea because we are coastal creatures, 80% of the population of the planet lives within just a few hundred miles of the coastline
And in some way depends for economic activity or for recreation or something else on the sea itself and the interaction of the land and the sea at the coast
We'll also look at the more malevolent aspects of how the sea interacts with the land
The tsunami that occurred in 2011 in Japan, the tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean in 2004 are huge reminders of what happens when the sea encroaches on the land and doesn't really behave as we would like it to
But instead shows us the incredible hydraulic power of water, again the physics of water coming into play to show us the erosive force and the power that it has that can really overwhelm any kind of human defenses against these kinds of changes
And overwhelm in fact all of our constructions along the coastline
We use the sea in so many ways of course, we rely ever more on the resources that we use from within and beneath the sea
These are critical benefits to human society right, we get all sorts of mineral resources, one third of oil and gas now comes from offshore drilling
And that of course is a positive in the sense that our society absolutely depends on the energy that we get from that
But it has an impact, it has an impact on marine life that's already present in the ocean where we're changing the ocean environment by doing all of this engineering and putting new objects out there, putting new noise into the ocean and things like that
And sometimes of course at real cost to the ecosystems as we've seen with large scale oil spills
And sometimes we've also found in recent years certainly with the 2010 deep water horizon oil spill that these costs aren't necessarily the same ones we think they are or think they will be
And so understanding the ocean system is absolutely critical to understanding then how those kinds of activities or those kinds of events will impact the habitat and the ecosystems that are beneath the sea
The ocean is our place of recreation, we love to use it not just for resources but also for play and for fun, we get food from the ocean, we get fuel from the ocean
We are a species that is in intimate contact in every way with what's going on beneath the sea
This course is going to explore all of those different aspects of human interaction with the ocean as well but we're going to use the underpinnings of knowing the science behind the chemistry, the physics, the biology, the nutrient cycling
And even the geology generating earthquakes and tsunamis to understand much better how human interactions with the ocean really take place and what governs, what forces govern our interactions with the sea
Well what I've tried to do in this introductory lecture then is to describe how this umbrella that we might call oceanography really weaves together geology, biology, physics, chemistry
All to illuminate the vast, deep and mostly dark ocean that defines our planet
What I'd like you to do now is join me in exploring the oceans and understanding through the science of oceanography so much more about the mystery of what lies out there beyond the waves when you gaze offshore
