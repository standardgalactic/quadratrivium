Lecture 22, Early Experience and Aggression
We return now to try to understand the complex interrelations of our different biological
buckets in trying to make sense of animal primate human violence.
And what we've gotten to now is working our way down our chart, working from the far
right, looking at the behaviors themselves, and by now we have a sense of the neurobiology
that helps to mediate aggression, the immediate environmental factors that can trigger such
neurobiology, the hormones which can change the sensitivity of the nervous system to those
factors, and working our way back, continuing now to consider what it is about child development
that increases, decreases the likelihood of an aggressive act in an adult, of an inappropriately,
of a socially, inappropriately aggressive adult.
And what we left with at the end of the last lecture was looking at the role of empathy
during child development, the fact that you really can't develop it until you understand
that there is a you separate from the rest of the world, that you understand those who
are not you can have different thoughts, different feelings, different emotions can be in need
of help, support, solace at times that you have no need for it, the beginnings to think about
that, and then at the very end looking at how those features get intermixed with the particular
values, the particular notions of what counts as appropriate aggression in your social group
and your society, so on.
Now within this framework, we now look at how children begin to learn to do the harder
thing, to do the harder thing in the context of appropriate moral behavior.
And the whole realm of moral development than children has fueled a gazillion different
careers in academia, but probably the single most dominant figure has been a man, a psychologist
at Harvard named Lawrence Colberg.
And Colberg's work is just the defining one in the field, people base their careers on
whether they are Colbergian or not, entire conferences assessing what aspects of his
work are most relevant to understanding where things are.
Like a lot of developmental psychologists, what he perceived was a set of stages, a set
of stages that kids move through into adulthood, very importantly in his view, a set of stages
that some children and some adults never achieve, a set of stages built around why do you do
the right thing?
What are the things that motivate you to do so?
And Colberg constructed this schema where it was basically a half dozen stages in pairs
of them that he termed the pre-conventional pair of stages, the conventional and the post-conventional.
And anybody who has had a child will recognize sort of the logic of the structuring, why is
it that a child, an adolescent, an adult resists the easier thing and does the right thing in a
moral setting?
And what he showed and generations of his followers showed in all sorts of studies is early on
what it's about is the immediacy of punishment.
Why do you do the right thing?
Because if I do the wrong thing, I will get my hand slapped, I will get a time out, they will
take this toy away from me, whatever the immediacy of a very personalized sense of punishment.
And as one gets older still within that framework, you begin to deal with the notion of a time
delay, aha, think dopamine and frontal cortex, which we'll get to shortly, a time delay,
why do you do the right thing?
Not just because if I don't, I'm going to get a time out right now, but beginning to
incorporate the notion of because if I don't do the right thing, I'm likely to get caught
at some point.
And a brain that can begin to deal with the notion of at some point, somewhere down the
line, a sense of the future, negative reinforcer is one that is beginning to expand sort of
the muscular effort metaphorically that could be put into the frontal cortex, getting you
to do the harder thing.
And what Colberg would have termed his pre-conventional stage, moral behavior is about the immediate
consequences and immoral acts for you.
Now by the time you get to the conventional stage, you have leapt into the realm where
why do you do the right thing?
And the best way of summarizing what this one is about is an answer like, because what
if everybody did this?
What would happen to society without rules?
What you begin to see is this very dramatic sense of the future.
What would be the consequence?
We would eventually regret it.
There are societal rules, there are conventions, and you need to follow them because what
if you didn't?
And we as a society would get a timeout, would get our wrists slapped because eventually
at some point in the future we would get caught.
A conventional sense of morality, morality is the agreed upon social contracts.
And in the post-conventional Colbergian realm, one that many people never meet, the highest
levels where people debate whether anybody actually gets there, the sense of morality,
what is the right thing is independent of social contracts, independent of rules, independent
of what if everyone else did it and is completely built on what if at the end of the day I didn't
do the right thing, how am I going to live with myself?
I don't care what the rules are, I don't care if I will get punished for doing so, this
is the right thing.
And we have entered the world of civil disobedience and we have entered the world in which you
could say just because it's conventionalized, just because the majority thinks this is right,
it is not necessarily right.
And our history is filled with people in post-conventional stages who questioned all sorts of things that
were viewed as norms, as to who counted as humans, as to who counted as humans who could
be owned and sold and not recognized as being independent humans by the courts of our land,
etc., people challenging conventionalized thinking, I don't care what the rules are,
I don't care what the laws are.
Now this in a very simplified way is the Colbergean view and not surprisingly lots of criticisms
of it, there has been pointed out that his stages make a whole lot more sense in a gender
biased way, it is somewhat more predictive of male moral development than female, much
more of an emphasis on rules in boys and girls, in girls much more social interactive sort
of features.
It's also been pointed out how culturally Eurocentric his rules were very different
sequences in other cultures, nonetheless a very strongly organizing set of ideas and
often good empirical evidence of how kids begin to learn what's the right thing.
Now somewhere in there you then have to ask the really uncomfortable awkward sort of
bumpious question of does this predict in the slightest who's actually going to do the
moral act somewhere later on?
This certainly may predict sort of what kind of professorial, fatuous lecture you're
giving about the nature of morality, does this predict anything about who's going to
step out of the crowd and do the difficult act that nonetheless is the right thing to do?
And what most of the studies have shown is your Colbergean stage of rarefied moral development
predicts squat in terms of who will be the person who steps out of the crowd and does
the brave, scary, more difficult thing because it's the right thing to do.
What are the predictors instead?
They make perfect sense rather than what Colbergean stage and your philosophical view of your
responsibilities towards society, it is simply the more you were raised with doing the
difficult moral act as a daily imperative, the more likely you were likely to be to do
that as an adult, the more it becomes a reflex.
And this makes perfect sense when you look at the studies of the guy who leaps out of
the crowd to run into the burning building and carry out the stranger they've never seen
before and the interviews afterward are they describing some really highfalutin Colbergean
stage that went through their mind?
No, most often they say the same thing, I couldn't stop myself.
Before I knew it, I had gone in there.
It is not a reasoned decision, it is an implicit reflexive pathway of you do the right thing.
The more a child is raised with the experiences of doing that at whatever Colbergean stage
they will eventually meet, they are more likely to turn a philosophical stance into actual action.
Now how do we frame this view of the world in the neurobiology that we've looked at already?
And initially it looks like we could explain everything.
And what we see here in this diagram is a transition from the very early Colbergean stage,
why do you do the right thing?
Because I'll get a time out otherwise, to next because I'll eventually be caught,
to next because what would society be like if nobody, what we're doing is increasing the time delay
until you would get the bad consequences of doing the wrong thing.
What's this about?
This is dopamine, this is anticipation, this is the frontal cortex
and lots of ways what moral development is about is developing a frontal cortical system
with more staying power, with more aerobic capacity, with more connections,
with more myelin, that part of the brain that's developing very late in life.
In lots of ways all of this can be effortlessly explained by you do the right thing
because otherwise right now I will get slapped and I would anticipate that as being a bad thing
to do anticipating somewhere down the line what would happen to society,
what moral development is about is an increased capacity of the frontal cortex
and no doubt the serotonin and dopamine inputs into it to hold on longer and longer
in order to do the harder thing that's right.
But then you get to the most advanced levels of the post-conventional Colbergean stages
and this whole model falls apart.
Somewhere in there you get the most extreme cases of a frontal cortex holding out.
Why do you do the right thing even if it costs you your life and you have an area of reward,
what if I go to hell?
An area of beliefs of consequences after your life or beliefs in certain cultures
that your sins are passed on to subsequent generations,
I can't leave my children with that burden,
that is still within a framework of enormously delayed consequences
and ego boundary issues as to where you start and where your descendants begin,
that sort of thing but then there's the whole world of people who do the utterly mysterious acts
of doing moral hard things outside the realm of any of this.
And to make sense of this you look at the people who sort of give aid and solace
to the person sitting on death row who has done the unspeakable acts
and things of that sort and you get this sort of paradoxical view
that runs through a lot of religious philosophy
but a paradoxical view that can also be independent of that which violates all the neurobiology.
We have learned here a view of the less lovable the person is, the more they must be loved,
the less forgivable the act, the more you must find the means to forgive them.
Kierkegaard once said being a Christian consists of being able to hold two contradictory facts
in your head at the same time and in a lot of ways this is the same thing,
a realm where the less plausible it is to do the harder thing the more you must
because who else is going to do it and the consequences don't matter
and what happens at that point is we've just gone off the edge of the cliff
of making sense in the realm of frontal cortex
and that's outside the realm of thinking about what will be the consequences
down at the other end I couldn't stop myself.
If I didn't run into the burning building
no one else with the less plausible it was to leap into the river and save the person
the more you must because who else is going to do it
and as far as I can tell there is zero neurobiological insight as to what that's about
and it is hugely mysterious and moving and that's where neurobiology is at a loss
but up until that stage I think our models of a part of the brain
that makes you do the harder thing under the heavy influence of rewarding pathways
built around anticipation, a part of the brain that does not develop well
until into adulthood as having so much to do with the transition that most of us
can do between doing the harder thing when it's simply not taking that piece of candy
to doing the harder thing some of the most difficult moral quandaries of our lives.
Now another issue in making sense of development
is now of course having to introduce the features of hormones during early development
and we will shortly see what that's about in the fetal world
but what's it about instead during adolescence that sort of thing
and once again what we have to deal with is male violence and testosterone
and all of that built around the fact that testosterone levels peak in late adolescence
violence peaks in males around that time
there's a whole subtype of alcoholism where rather than the picture of someone
who is quietly, low-gradedly alcoholic throughout their lifetime
being able to maintain a job but drinking alone in the evenings
instead this is the picture of the 20 year old male who when drunk becomes violent
highly in a social context where the traits disappear typically 10, 20 years later
it's not a whole lot of 40 year olds who get drunk and brawl in the bars
this whole realm of high testosterone, adolescence, a period where all sorts of social provocations
drive you in the direction of violence, how much are you seeing determinacy there
and once again back to the same studies and the same diagram we've seen in previous lectures now
that enormously predictable peak of aggression right around adolescence in the men
the adolescent boys, etc. in London and Toronto and Detroit
and once again the finding that the age of those individuals and their testosterone levels
are dwarfed in terms of predictive importance simply by knowing what society they're being raised in
and the importance of these societal factors have come through in all sorts of unlikely studies
including a non-human primate, it's a primatologist named Franz Duvall
to Emory University who's done wondrously encouraging studies
different macaque species, rhesus macaques, stumptail macaques
there's a whole bunch of them differ markedly in their levels of aggression
and how rigid their hierarchies are and how much reconciliation they have after fights
and what he has shown is rhesus monkey adolescents, rhesus monkeys who are the thugs
and the most violent in the macaque world being raised in social groups
of the more peaceable stumptail macaques can take on the cultural attributes
the social behaviors of this other species and maintain it back in their own kind
there is no inevitability in that species
similarly a study with wild baboons one that I've spent the last 12 years working on
and showing this has to do with another one of these very pleasing optimistic pieces of primatology
and this was a troop I had been studying since the late 1970s
in the mid 80s they had a disaster
which was there was a baboon troop neighbor to them
had a tourist lodge open up a large garbage dump in there
and baboons go and immediately start spending a lot of their time eating the leftover food, the garbage there
and what you wind up seeing is just like we westernized humans
they begin to get metabolic syndrome, insulin levels go up, tooth decay
all of that, not a good thing
and in this troop that I was studying what evolved was each morning
the most aggressive least socialized males would pick up, run a mile
to fight with the males of that troop for some of the garbage
the most aggressive because this would be a half dozen guys trying to take on 20 resident males in that troop
the least socialized because this is a time of day fraught with social interactions
these guys would rather eat leftover desserts in the garbage dump from this tourist lodge
the most aggressive least socially connected males
during that period a massive tuberculosis outbreak occurred
based on contaminated food in that garbage dump
killed most of the animals in that troop and killed all the males in this troop
who went and ate there
in other words you were left with a troop with half the typical numbers of males
and the only males who were left were the least aggressive, most socially-affiliated males
that made for a remarkably different culture in the troop
and what is most extraordinary is now 15 years later
when young adolescent males transfer into the troop which is what baboons males do
they leave their home troop around puberty
young adolescent males who have grown up out in the mean aggressive, violent, hierarchical world of typical baboon troops
when they come into this troop it takes them about six months to take on the cultural style of this troop
this culture of less aggression is being passed on multi-generationally
and we even have some insights by now as to how that's done
they're not being taught, they're not observing, they're being treated better by the resident females
and that successively makes them less aggressive
and the main point of that one is you look at any anthropology textbook
written in the last 500 years and somewhere in there
outcome the Savannah baboons with their hierarchical male-dominated aggressive societies
and in one generation you can transform the culture in one of these troops
and if these guys are freed from the predictions and archetypal, you know,
central casting roles for them in the anthropology textbooks
we as a species have no excuse to say we have inevitable social structures
so what else about development?
one particular finding that was published a few years ago that has been about as controversial as any in the business
was a finding a pair of social scientists at Stanford University of Chicago
pointing out one of the biggest predictors of somebody growing up and showing antisocial behavior
is having been unwanted as a child
and the controversy of what they showed in their study was ever since the legalization of abortion
what is wound up happening is wherever that has occurred
there are fewer and fewer children born who nobody wanted them born
nobody cared about and what you wind up seeing is that winds up explaining
about 50% of the decline of violence in this country in the United States over the last 20 years
being wanted by someone, someone wanting you to have been born
is a wonderful predictor of growing up in a world where you are not inappropriately violent
really, really important study, no surprise, really controversial one
okay, we shift now to hormones, not hormones in the bloodstream of adolescent acne males
but hormones back when you were a fetus
and a large literature with rodents, with non-human primates
show that there are organizational effects of testosterone at the time
what do I mean by an organizational effect?
testosterone in your bloodstream right now will make your amygdaloid neurons work differently
but this is testosterone back when you were a fetus affecting how your neurons are going to respond later in life
and this is a classic notion in endocrinology
there are activation effects of hormones
hormones in your bloodstream right now in adulthood affecting something about behavior
or there are organizational effects, hormones back when you were a fetus
affecting how your brain responds to the activation effects of hormones later on
and what that literature shows is prenatal testosterone
masculinizes patterns of aggression
and causes appropriate changes in the brain in areas one might guess
and makes for individuals including females who have been masculinized prenatally
who are more aggressive, more easily provoked towards aggression
what about humans?
there are a couple of rare syndromes
one of them called congenital adrenal hyperplasia
where you wind up getting a fetus exposed to a lot of androgens
a lot of testosterone prenatally
and a huge literature by now showing that these are girls who grow up
and have higher than expected levels of aggression in certain settings
that have less interest in gender stereotypical toys like dolls
things of that sort
here we have evidence for the same exact thing in humans
one huge whopping confound of those studies though
which is that these girls are born with all sorts of masculinized genitalia
and they go through all sorts of rounds of surgery early in life
in this very interesting, very private but very sort of attracting of attention
part of the body, painful, disturbing
every reason to think that they are raised differently
by parents who see them as somewhat of an ambiguous gender there
it is very hard to tell in that literature
how much it is due to prenatal androgenization from hormones
and how much it is due to the environment in which they're raised
so that remains an open question in humans, very clear in other species though
so now we shift one step further back
biology of very long-term effects
what are we talking now, we're talking genes
and the whole notion that genes have anything to do with aggression
is enormously controversial sufficiently so
that conferences on the subject by some of the most sobriotists
and careful of scientists out there have been canceled because of protests
the whole notion that genes have anything to do with aggression
smacks of some of the darkest chapters in our history of science
eugenics, movement, scientific rationales for genocides
things of that sort, genes is inevitability
genes is don't blame me, it was my genes
we know by now, umpteen lectures into it
that genes are not about inevitability
they're about tendencies, blah blah, we know that one by now
and we also know that genes have something to do with aggression
we know that every time that we would be perfectly fine with our five-year-old
playing with a beagle but not with a pit bull
because pit bulls have been dread from, have been dread, have been bred
that was not a random mistake, have been bred for millennia
of pit bull generations to be extremely aggressive
to be easily provoked into aggression
and the pulling on the ear of a beagle that just results in savage licking of your face
instead results in something very different
there are genetic components to aggression
different strains of rats and mice can be bred to be higher low aggressive
people who for whatever bizarre reason follow bull fighting
have known there are lines of bulls that have been bred for centuries
for higher low levels of aggression
there are genetic components to aggression
this is undeniable
is there genetic inevitability?
yes, obviously not
are there genes that specify exactly what sort of amygdalae you're going to develop
not in the slightest, what are the genes relevant to aggression
going to turn out to be about how much stress hormones you release
how sensitive your pain receptors are
how readily your frontal cortex controls impulsivity
your sensory input, how sensation seeking are you
how rapidly do dopamine levels habituate
things that are going to be relevant to lots of other realms of behavior as well
there is not a set of genes let alone a gene
which is the one which is focused in on aggression
it's going to be relevant in lots of other realms
and what we of course know is it's going to be extremely intertwined with environment
and that was shown in a spectacularly important study a few years ago
we heard earlier about another study from this group
looking at a huge population of kids growing up from age three or so
up into young adulthood and the study we heard about already
looking at genetic predictors of depression in adulthood
and what we saw was the critical finding from that study was
there was a certain gene relevant to serotonin
relevant to the same neurotransmitter that Prozac works on
a certain version which was a bad one
put you more at risk for depression
was there genetic inevitability
absolutely not what that study showed was if and only if
you were raised in an environment with lots of childhood stress
you were more at risk for it
ooh textbook gene environment interactions
what that group showed in their other study
the earlier one was looking at another gene
very relevant to brain chemistry
a gene relevant to the breakdown of serotonin, neuro-pinephrine
a gene that had already been implicated
as maybe having something to do with aggression
some other studies, animal studies
and what they showed here was there's a couple of different flavors
of that gene where it produces a protein that works better or worse
and we know exactly what that means
a slightly different shape, a slightly different amino acid sequence
and the main point there was one of the versions
by all logic should have been associated with more aggression
less regulation of the frontal cortex, all of that
so ooh they go and check all their subjects in there
and come back with exactly the answer everybody was hoping for
sort of
and what they showed was yes indeed
the version, the variant of that gene was relevant
but only once again in certain environments
and what you've got shown in this diagram
in a totally, totally simplified way
you could view these two genetic variants as the good version
or the bad version, the good version
which did more of this breakdown of the neurotransmitter
the other, okay, simplified the good versus the bad version
and now we have good versus bad early environments
what's a bad early environment in this realm?
child abuse
growing up with or without child abuse
with or without this particular variant of this gene
a gene called monoamine oxidase for trivia fans
and what you wind up seeing is
combine the good genetic variant with a good early environment
low typical levels of aggression and antisocial behavior
now combine the good variant of the gene
with the abusive early environment, still low normal levels
combine the wrong version of the gene, the bad variant
with a good environment and still low levels
is it only once again when you combine this genetic vulnerability
of the bad gene with an abusive early environment
once again our screamingly boring cliche by now
of a gene environment interaction
to the extent the genes have to do with anything
we know by now from those earlier lectures
these are genes built around how they respond
to environmental influences
so once again what this reductive genetics teaches us is
biology of environment is just as important
from the environmental end
now the last piece of genetics that becomes relevant
is just to briefly debunk one of the great myths in the field
and people who follow mass murders
and knew immediately who Charles Whitman was
will probably recognize the name Richard Speck
and Richard Speck in the late 1960s
killed eight student nurses in Chicago
an absolutely galvanizing event
people just horrified by just the sheer savagery of this
and Richard Speck who spent the rest of his life in jail
it was discovered shortly after he was incarcerated
that Richard Speck had a genetic abnormality
that he had a rare chromosomal disorder
back to females they've got two X chromosomes
male have an X and a Y
Richard Speck was an XYY male
he had an extra Y chromosome
people went berserk at that point
if the Y chromosome is what makes you male
two Y chromosomes
this guy must be some hyper male
no wonder he's totally aggressive and murderous
this started this whole bandwagon
of screening for people who were XYY
trying to find whether this was predictive of more aggression
and many studies later what became clear is
this is nonsense it's a red herring
XYY is not a predictor of increased levels of aggression
and most remarkably it was eventually discovered
that they had blown the lab test on Richard Speck
Richard Speck turned out not to be an XYY male
he turned out to be a perfectly normal XY
sociopathic murderous male
nothing chromosomally there to describe his excesses of violence
so once again seeing hints of biology
and in this case run away with it as it turns out
that one is not relevant
okay so we've now gotten all the way from
the neurobiology of limbic action potentials
a second before the violent act
now back to genes
genes in individuals
genes affecting lifelong responses to environment
and what we know by now is where we need to go
for our next step our final bucket to look at
if we are looking at genes having anything to do with these behaviors
we now must ask where did these genes evolve from
what are the factors in evolution natural selection
ecological factors that have sculpted us
to have this complement of genes that do what they do
and fail to have some of the effects that they are constrained by
so what does evolution have to do with this subject
that will be our next lecture
thank you
