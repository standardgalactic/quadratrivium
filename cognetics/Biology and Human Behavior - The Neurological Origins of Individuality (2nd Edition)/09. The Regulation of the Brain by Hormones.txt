Lecture 9 The Regulation of the Brain by Hormones
You are back just in time for neuroendocrinology.
Neuroendocrinology, where have we gotten through so far?
We started with our one neuron and expanding ever outward, we've looked at ways by which
the brain, large parts of the brain, can regulate the body.
Number one, by way of the autonomic nervous system.
Number two is seen in the last lecture by way of hormones.
The brain as a neuroendocrine gland, the brain as controlling hormones released throughout
the body.
What we do in this lecture is one of the things that science often does, which is to complete
a loop, show a big old regulatory loop, now looking at not how the brain regulates hormones,
but how hormones in the circulation get back into the brain and regulate brain function.
Now pristine card carrying neurobiologists have often been very resistant to the idea
that hormones can muck around with brain function, but it should be obvious for two reasons.
The first one, as we heard in the last lecture, is the oldest experiment in endocrinology,
going back millennia showed that hormones coming out of the testes can affect the brain,
could affect behavior produced by the brain, testosterone has some effect on aggression.
The other reason why this should not be surprising is built around the simple definition of what
hormones do.
Hormones affect cells, neurons are cells, glial cells are cells, all the cells in the
brain are as much subject to hormonal effects as anywhere else in the body.
So what you can immediately predict is hormone receptors occur throughout the brain.
Neurons, glia, receptors for virtually every hormone out there, and in all the logical
interesting places.
So what we'll be doing in this lecture is looking at some of the ways that hormones
can affect brain function, and what we will see is can do some really dramatic things
ranging from changing the amount of neurotransmitter coming out of a neuron to changing whether
neurons live, whether neurons die, remarkably powerful effects, and as we'll see some
of these have tremendous implications for some psychiatric diseases.
Some of this will have tremendous implications as well for the lectures to come looking at
the biology and thus as part of it the neuroendocrinology of aggression.
Now starting off with the first case, how do hormones affect neurotransmitter release?
Neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmitter breakdown, they affect it in exactly the ways
you can imagine by the way of a hormone binding to receptors in some neuron, it could change
the synthesis of a neurotransmitter, it could change the amount of some enzyme that degrades
it in the synapse, it could affect the amount of receptors for neurotransmitter, all the
usual suspects in terms of effects.
Let's look at an example of this and a very interesting one.
And as shown in the first diagram here, we have a neuron up on top that releases a neurotransmitter
that we've talked about a bit in different contexts but now having a very interesting
function, the neurotransmitter dopamine.
You remember back we heard about dopamine in one part of the brain having to do with
sequential logical thoughts, schizophrenia, dopamine in another part of the brain having
to do with fine motor control Parkinson's disease, here we've got dopamine in another
place in the brain having everything to do with pleasure.
And the anticipation of pleasure, dopamine, this is the system worked on by cocaine, other
euphorians, dopamine in this part of the brain is about pleasure and about the anticipation
of it.
And it turns out all sorts of hormones affect this dopamine system.
One really interesting example, you remember from the last lecture I made reference to
some steroid hormones released during stress, we come back to them now in more detail, these
are called glucocorticoids.
The human version known as cortisol, hydrocortisone, there's a rodent version related to it, structurally
similar, these are hormones released during stress.
And they get into the brain where there are plenty of glucocorticoid receptors on these
dopamine neurons and glucocorticoids do two really interesting things there.
Short term stress, talking about a couple of minutes, maybe an hour or so, short term
stress that is not too extreme causes a transient rise in glucocorticoid levels, only for a
certain amount of time and not too high, and under those circumstances what those glucocorticoids
do is really interesting, they increase the amount of dopamine coming out of those neurons.
What is that about?
What do we call short term transient stress?
We've seen this principle earlier in the LTP lecture, it's stimulation and stimulation
feels good.
The right amount of stimulation and you secrete these stress hormones and among other things,
they make you think more clearly, they enhance LTP, we know that already, and they increase
the amount of dopamine coming out of these neurons.
What's that about?
We know what that's about, stimulation feels stimulatory, it feels great, it feels
wonderful, we pay to be stressed in the right way, we pay to see a good scary movie, we
pay for a really great roller coaster, and what we see in those cases is a transient
moderate rise in glucocorticoid levels, feels wonderful, addictively so in some cases,
and this is the reason for it, it increases dopamine release.
This is such a clear mechanism that a laboratory rat will actually work, work at pressing a
lever over and over and over to get infused with just the right amount of glucocorticoids
that maximizes dopamine release.
Short term stress feels wonderful by way of dopamine release.
The key thing here is short term moderate stress.
Massive stress, no matter how short term it is, having your limbs twisted painfully are
not going to lead to wondrous dopamine release and I feel wonderful and alive and all of
that.
Otherwise, no matter how moderate of a stressor, if it's really chronic, that's not going
to feel great either.
It's not by chance that roller coaster rides are not three weeks long.
The transients, once you have glucocorticoids now being secreted long term, what we see
in the bottom of this diagram, they do just the opposite.
They deplete dopamine neurons of dopamine and what's that about?
You begin to feel awful.
Short term, we heard a few lectures back, anhedonia, hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure,
anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, sustained stress, triggers anhedonia and
this is the mechanism for it, depletion of dopamine and there's lots and lots of reasons
to think this is one mechanism linking chronic stress with the onset of clinical depression.
Okay, so we see here a way in which hormones in the circulation can get into your brain
and alter aspects of neurotransmitter trafficking.
Now we look at another aspect.
We've already seen an example of this, but let's look at this in more detail.
Back from that LTP lecture, LTP, you remember LTP, synaptic plasticity, thanks to repeated
experience, those glutamate systems passing a threshold and suddenly triggering a synapse
to now be more excitatory for the rest of time and at the end of that lecture, we looked
at some factors that modulate LTP.
Lots of energy facilitates it, energy shortage disrupts it, alcohol disrupts it and we saw
that same dichotomy and there before as we just looked at, short term stress and glucocorticoids
enhance LTP and as we saw also long term glucocorticoids disrupted.
We have our classical pattern of LTP, stimulated neuron, you get your little bit of your dendritic
activation, now stimulate it like crazy over and over and over and you get your LTP, your
potentiated response and what we see in the second case is prolonged glucocorticoid exposure
and you block that induction of LTP and that is not a good thing.
Now that's what's going on in the hippocampus, meanwhile next door in the amygdala, something
very different is happening with glucocorticoids.
You remember the amygdala, amygdala and fear, amygdala and anxiety, amygdala and aggression
as we will hear about, what glucocorticoids do there is just the opposite, glucocorticoids
and stress enhance LTP, chronic stress makes the amygdala more excitable and when do you
see that, you see that with individuals with trauma disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder,
you do brain imaging on these folks and you flash up a scary image to anybody and you
could show the amygdala lights up and these individuals, the amygdala lights up and stays
on much longer, what traumatic experience does is often make the amygdala hyper excitable
and literally what happens there is the synapses undergo LTP and glucocorticoids drive that
effect.
So we see this interesting contrast in the hippocampus, short-term glucocorticoids enhance
LTP, long-term they disrupt it very dramatically, meanwhile in the amygdala, chronic stress
enhances LTP.
Now put those pieces together and you get something very interesting going on there.
Okay, mass if the stain stressor comes along and what is it doing by way of glucocorticoids,
facilitating synaptic activity in the amygdala, it's disrupting synaptic activity in the hippocampus.
What happens when you put those two pieces together, hippocampus filing away conscious
explicit memories with enough of a stressor, your hippocampus is pretty much going offline.
Meanwhile the amygdala sure is filing away the autonomic, the arousal aspects of the
emergency of the trauma and what happens the next time something like that comes along,
the amygdala kicks into gear like crazy and you find yourself by way of the hypothalamus
and the autonomic nervous system, you find yourself with your heart racing and getting
sweaty and all of that and you haven't a clue why because your hippocampus never filed away,
your amygdala sure remembers, your hippocampus doesn't.
What have we got here, a neuroscientist at New York University, Joe Ladoo has put forth
this model where this is somewhat of an explanation for free floating anxiety, this sense of panic
and you have no idea why. Now the question becomes how can glucocorticoids,
saying the hippocampus do this business, short term they enhance LTP, short term they enhance
dopamine release, long term they do just the opposite, how does that work mechanistically,
the trick was sorted out about a decade ago, there's two different classes of glucocorticoid
receptors in those parts of the brain, one of which works real fast, one of which works
slower. So we see there this very interesting contrast between short term stress and long
term stress and between what happens in one part of the brain and another. Meanwhile,
is a very interesting other neuroendocrine interaction with LTP, estrogen turns out
to enhance LTP in the hippocampus, we get our usual response, stimulate the neuron like
crazy and when there's estrogen on board, you get a vast potentiation of the potentiation,
estrogen makes LTP occur more readily. Now these same themes continue at the next level,
we already know a whole big aspect of the story of neurons, there's these 10,000 dendritic
spines and the axon terminals and turns out this is a very dynamic plastic process to
use the jargon from earlier lectures and what you wind up seeing is different types of events
experiences can cause neurons to grow more elaborate, dendritic branches can cause them
to shrivel up and we see the exact same theme here, chronic stress, chronic glucocorticoids
and those dendritic branches in the hippocampus shrivel up, what's the consequence of that,
straight out of the network lecture, what you're doing is you're disconnecting networks and
that's sure going to disrupt things, it's bad enough if you've got a synapse which thanks to
chronic stress is not doing LTP very well anymore, it's even worse if you're ripping that synapse
apart because your dendritic spines are shriveling up, chronic stress, chronic glucocorticoid
exposure causes atrophy of these dendritic arbors, these dendritic branches throughout the
hippocampus and you guessed it, meanwhile next door in the amygdala not only do glucocorticoids
enhance LTP, glucocorticoids stimulate amygdaloid neurons to grow new branches and that's part
of that story again about why the amygdala is this hyper excitable part of the brain with
anxiety disorders, with post-traumatic stress disorder, next just like with the LTP story
along comes estrogen and what estrogen does is stimulate hippocampal neurons to grow new
processes, aha so you were sitting there and saying this generates all sorts of predictions
when estrogen levels are high, hormones working in the hippocampus, estrogenic hormones cause
hippocampal neurons to grow new processes, for synapses to work better does that mean
that learning and memory gets better when estrogen levels are high, absolutely that
is shown in humans and all sorts of circumstances naturally over the course of the ovulatory
cycle it is shown in humans where hormone levels are manipulated for any of the number
of reasons, it's shown in laboratory rats here's how amazing the effect is, in a laboratory
rat just as we heard in the very first lecture as with hamsters various rodents there's a
four day ovulatory cycle, every four days estrogen goes up goes down ovulate that sort
of thing it's a four day cycle as opposed to the 28 day one and primates humans and
what you've got there is this amazing phenomenon over the course of this very short cycle the
hippocampus and a female rat gets bigger for two days and then gets smaller and gets bigger
it's like this accordion getting bigger and small as you grow new processes and retract
them and memory cognition hippocampal dependent learning and memory peaks when estrogen levels
are high as it oscillates back and forth absolutely remarkable. Now what's even more remarkable
is the next step we've now gone through these hormones affecting neurotransmitter release
which is a very transient effect affecting LTP a much longer lasting effect affecting
the actual structure of neurons the next remarkable thing is some of these hormones can affect
the life and death of these neurons in there and this brings up some really interesting
issues the first question being what are you talking about the birth of new neurons
in the brain everybody who has taken introductory neuroscience anytime in the last thousand
years somewhere in the first week learns the exact same cliche which is the brain is a
non dividing organ neurons do not divide once you're about a year old you've got the
most neurons you are ever going to have for the rest of your life all you can do is squander
them with abuse of alcohol and staying up too late and God knows what else you don't
get any more neurons so you better be careful with your brain and naturally this turns out
to be totally wrong and this is the biggest revolution in neuroscience in a long time
this is the hottest subject there is the discovery of adult neurogenesis that the adult brain
can indeed make new neurons and this is a recent finding that is swept through the field
except is one of those classic great history of science stories it's not such a recent
finding there were a couple of pioneers back in the sixties who saw the first evidence
of this and were roundly ignored and often viewed as having their careers greatly impaired
by them coming up with this observation that everybody knew that was not true the adult
brain does not make new neurons go back and check your experiment this can't be true and
by the recent decade it has become clear the adult brain makes new neurons it makes it
in two interesting places one is the olfactory system that's not so interesting you smell
some really strong odor some some toxic sort of smell some very abrasive odor you kill a
bunch of cells there and it takes a couple of weeks to grow new neurons that's not very
exciting except for the suggestion that hormones released during pregnancy probably prolactin
causes you to grow a gazillion new neurons there in your olfactory system what's that
about it's right in time to give birth you've got this spanking new renovated olfactory system
perfect for imprinting on the smell of your child very cool what that also probably explains
is if you spend all the pregnancy ripping out the scaffolding in your nose there and
changing all the olfactory neurons and putting in new ones that are not quite working no wonder
stuff smells weird and your taste is all out of whack during pregnancy that's one area
where this occurs and as we see there a very powerful hormone effect on that meanwhile
the one other place in the brain where there clearly is a lot of this adult neurogenesis
is so interesting it's just perfect where is it you guessed it in the hippocampus and
when does it occur for exactly the logical reasons the same exact circumstances you would
pick stimulating environment learn something new enriched setting all sorts of aspects
of voluntary exercise and you stimulate neurogenesis there and there's increasing reasons to believe
that these new neurons actually get integrated into networks function that's very controversial
at this point but it's beginning to look as if that's the case so along come our hormones
and two effects that are right up there that are very clear at this point what's the single
biggest inhibitor of adult neurogenesis you guessed it glucocorticoids have something
stressful come along and your hippocampus is not going to be making a whole lot of new
neurons and conversely along comes estrogen and not only are you enhancing LTP and growing
new processes in the neurons already there but that stimulates neurogenesis and everyone
is very interested these days to see just how much that winds up explaining changes
in cognition when your hormones are changing now that glucocorticoid angle is very interesting
because there's one additional step in that story it looks as if under circumstances of
truly massive amounts of stress glucocorticoids can actually kill neurons in the hippocampus
and even better documented lots of stress lots of glucocorticoids can endanger hippocampal
neurons make it harder for those neurons to survive all sorts of insults so what you
wind up getting in the realm of glucocorticoids is that these stress hormones can disrupt
aspects of synaptic plasticity can cause the neurons to retract their processes can cause
the neurons to fail to be born inhibit adult neurogenesis can make the neurons more fragile
in the face of all sorts of traumas and maybe even at an extreme might kill the neurons
so you sit there and you say uh oh this is not a good thing does this mean prolonged stress
does bad stuff in your hippocampus there's beginning to be reasons to think that this
story mostly a laboratory rat story begins to apply to the human brain and there's three
circumstances in which this is relevant and they're of increasingly bad news the first
one is a fairly rare endocrine disorder called Cushing's disease you get a tumor in some
weird unexpected place in the body and even more bizarrely this tumor often in the lungs
of all places secretes some hormones that stimulate glucocorticoid release you get elevated
glucocorticoid levels all sorts of things go wrong in Cushing's disease one of the things
that happens though is you begin to get severe memory problems it's in fact called Cushing
oil dementia and the first few brain imaging studies are now being done showing people
with Cushing's disease begin to get atrophy of their hippocampus their hippocampus shrinks
it seems to only be the hippocampus the higher the glucocorticoid levels the more shrinkage
and the more memory problems now how fast does this affect the best guesses are it emerges
over the course of a couple of years is this due to killing the neurons almost certainly
not because what the most recent studies are showing is you go in and you correct the tumor
and over the next year or so the hippocampus comes back to normal size what's that about
that's the flip side of what we've heard already lots of stress and glucocorticoids and those
hippocampal neurons have their dendritic processes shrivel up end of stress and the glucocorticoid
exposure and very slowly they can regenerate the next model is worse news simply for the
number of people involved people with a history of severe stress people with PTSD post traumatic
stress disorder combat vets childhood abuse it is known they get memory problems and there's
by now a very clear literature showing a smaller hippocampal volume the more severe the history
of trauma and some of these studies the more shrinkage the more memory problems is this
reversible seemingly not because these are people decades after Vietnam decades after
the childhood abuse and the atrophy is still there now in that particular literature there's
a wildly incendiary controversy right now built around does the trauma cause the hippocampus
to shrink or is coming into the trauma with a small hippocampus set you up for being more
vulnerable to the PTSD there's evidence for both at this point the jury is still out now
the third syndrome is the most worrisome one because it applies to merely 10 15 20% of us
or so and it's one that's been floating around at a bunch of these lectures major clinical
depression elevated glucocorticoids you find that in about half of depressive it is a classical
psychiatric disease of sustained stress we've already seen how sustained glucocorticoid exposure
could give rise to the anhedonia the dopamine depletion it also could give rise to hippocampal
damage does that occur a handful of studies now showing big time long-term depressives
atrophy of the hippocampus pretty much only in the hippocampus the more severe the depression
history the more hippocampal atrophy the more memory problems and this also appears to be
a syndrome that does not reverse with time because you look at some of these folks years
decades after the depressions have gotten under control with medication and the volume loss
is still there these are very disturbing studies there's also an additional literature to worry
about people who take synthetic glucocorticoids prednisone dexamethasone there's a suggestion
that those taking very high doses long-term get problems there as well this is a very very
fertile area of research these days the one thing that should be emphasized at this point
is if you are stressed like you're stuck in traffic jams every day or you're in a lousy
relationship or you've got an abusive boss there is zero evidence at this point to think
that that's rotting out your hippocampus do not panic these are major league stressors
major league examples of glucocorticoid exposure so don't panic too much there a final example
here of how hormones can affect the brain and this is an enormously complex area built around
the fact that a whole bunch of different hormones from very unlikely places can affect appetite now
no surprise this is a massively studied subject since our lack of control over appetite has
something to do with what is fast becoming the number one killer in this country metabolic
syndrome related to adult onset diabetes how does your brain figure out one enough is enough
how does it figure out when it should make you feel hungry and go out foraging out in the
grasslands or the supermarket what it's doing is getting an enormous amount of endocrine
information from the body people used to think the easiest thing was it just measured how much
glucose you got in your bloodstream glucose levels go up you stop feeling as hungry glucose levels
go down you start feeling real hungry makes perfect sense it turns out there's a whole
orchestrated set of hormones that come from all sorts of unlikely places
your pancreas okay that's not so unlikely insulin that makes sense but hormones coming out of your
gut intestinal hormones no one ever considered that getting into your circulation hormones coming
out of your liver out of your muscle recognized in the last couple of years muscles or endocrine
glands fat cells or endocrine glands all sorts of hormones secreted under those circumstances
which collectively get into the bloodstream and part of your brain figuring out are we still hungry
is sitting there and getting endocrine input from all these different hormonal systems that
reflect something about your energy state your metabolic state ranging from do you have a whole
big lump of food distending the walls of your intestines to how much fat you have stored away
and that regulates which hormones your fat cells make and no surprise this is a frantic area of
research because if people can understand how some of these things can work and make some
artificial versions some pharmacological imitators of these hormones these may be important
regulators of appetite things of that sort okay so this has been a very quick tour of some different
ways that hormones can affect the brain and the main point of that is not only to teach
these specific examples but to get a very important point across and this is one that's
going to come back to haunt us in the aggression lectures okay aggression we're going to think
a lot about testosterone and why males on the average are more aggressive than females on the
average and what's testosterone doing in the brain and it's going to be all over the places you would
guess the limbic system the amygdala like crazy and then you get this temptation to start getting
this very deterministic model of the world aha hormones control aspects of the brain aha
hormones determine certain behaviors aha as we will see down the line the temptation to say
testosterone causes aggression and we will see that's not how testosterone works and that's now
how hormones work in the brain they do not cause behaviors they make pre-existing tendencies
more or less capable of eliciting those behaviors and that is the first example of us looking at
function of the brain and the brain is not sitting there in vacuo instead hormones modulating how
sensitive the brain is to the outside world and thus for example if there's some environmental
trigger that tends to cause aggression pain frustration things of that sort what you wind
of seeing is testosterone lowers the threshold for pain to elicit aggression this testosterone
cause aggression in and of itself not at all this is a theme that runs through the endocrine
literature hormones are no more master messengers than the brain is at controlling everything
the interaction between the two and as we will see over and over the interaction between the two
in the context of the environment now this brings us to a perfect point here to summarize
because we've now pretty much completed our overview of the nervous system complete with how
the nervous system does not control the entire world all on its own but is instead subject to
hormonal control and now that sets us up perfectly for the coming dozen lectures or so to now see
we understand a bit about how the brain works and how it might produce behavior what we now shift to
is how things regulate the brain today this lecture how hormones regulate the brain but now
beginning to look at how early experience does how ecological factors regulate brain development
how the brain evolved the evolutionary pressures that brought about the sort of brains that we have
and of course the intervening step in there the evolutionary pressures which gave rise to
certain patterns of genes which note here do not cause behaviors but have an influence on what
sort of behaviors occur this is our segue now to begin to consider all of these factors that
regulate brain development brain evolution brain function what we will switch to next on our time
chart here comes the behavior at the very right end of it under the control of the brain switching
back to the very beginning how do we think about the evolution of behavior what we're saying there
is how do we think about the evolution of the brain how our brains have evolved with the structure
of the functions that we've seen how our brains have evolved to regulate behavior so that's our next subject
