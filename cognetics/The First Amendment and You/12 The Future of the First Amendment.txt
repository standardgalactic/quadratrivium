Lecture 12, The Future of the First Amendment
The First Amendment was drafted by the First Congress in 1789 and ratified in 1791.
Its colonial antecedents include a statement concerning the right of petition in the Massachusetts
Body of Liberties adopted in 1641, a religious freedom guarantee passed in 1663 in Rhode
Island, the Virginia Declaration of Rights adopted in 1776, and several other colonial
acts.
Its ideological antecedents go back even further, tracing at least to the Enlightenment,
if not to more ancient influences.
Although the world around it has changed dramatically, perhaps in part because of the First Amendment
itself, its 45 words have never been altered or amended.
But the meaning and application of the First Amendment has certainly changed, sometimes
dramatically, and it promises to continue to do so.
Consider just two questions we have yet to discuss in detail, questions that ask us to
look forward to the First Amendment's third full century.
First, how will the First Amendment apply to new technologies of communication and expression?
Should new technologies of expression cause us to reconsider well-settled First Amendment
rules?
And second, how, if at all, does the First Amendment apply to the Internet?
In this lecture we will take up both of these questions with a view toward helping us to
understand what the First Amendment might mean as the world around us changes.
First, how will the First Amendment apply to new technologies of communication and expression?
Consider this scenario, pulled from a newspaper headline on the very day I started to draft
this lecture.
You are a college student fulfilling a photography course assignment.
You photograph the police making a routine traffic stop.
The cops see you, shove you, and order you to stop.
You don't and are arrested and spend the night in jail.
Is the arrest a violation of the First Amendment?
Or to be more precise, does the First Amendment protect a citizen's right to videotape the
actions of police officers in public places?
Of course, my scenario is not just hypothetical, it's real.
And in fact, similar episodes have been played out many, many times over the past few years.
In this age of ubiquitous digital and cell phone cameras, several federal courts have
been asked to address the First Amendment implications of their use with mixed results.
Just recently, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice filed a brief in
one of those lawsuits, indicating that it supported the claim that citizens do have
a First Amendment right to record the police while they perform their official duties.
I want to quote from the Department of Justice statement.
Recording governmental officers engaged in public duties is a form of speech through
which private individuals may gather and disseminate information of public concern, including the
conduct of law enforcement officers.
Continuing, the statement concludes that individuals have a right to record in all traditionally
public spaces, including sidewalks, streets, and locations of public protests.
This is an opportunity for us to review some of what we have learned, as well as an opportunity
to think about whether those rules make sense in the context of new technologies.
What sorts of restrictions does the First Amendment permit on speech in public forums?
The Justice Department statement argues that the First Amendment right of citizens to record
police can be limited only by reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.
In addition, the statement argues, and I quote,
A person may record public police activity unless the person engages in actions that jeopardize
the safety of the officer, the suspect, or others in the vicinity, violate the law, or
incite others to violate the law.
As I suggested, some federal courts have reached a similar conclusion, but others have been
less inclined to find First Amendment protections in such cases.
I wonder which approach the Supreme Court will adopt.
The Supreme Court has already spoken with respect to another fairly new technology.
Does the First Amendment apply to video games?
The court took up this question in the recent case of Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association,
decided in 2011.
Brown involved a challenge to a California law that restricted the sale of violent video
games to minors.
The court voted 7-2 to strike the statute.
Perhaps most important for our purposes, the majority, speaking through Justice Scalia,
wrote that video games deserve full First Amendment protection.
I quote from his opinion.
Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate
ideas, and even social messages, through many familiar literary devices such as characters,
dialogue, plot, and music.
That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.
The court then applied strict scrutiny, concluding that the state's interest in preventing physical
and psychological harm to minors was insufficient under the First Amendment.
When you had tried to escape strict scrutiny, by arguing that violent video games were
akin to or a kind of obscenity, and thus entitled to no First Amendment shelter at all.
The court rejected the comparison to obscenity, and added that a new category of proscribed
speech, and I quote, may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain
speech is too harmful to be tolerated.
That quote is actually language the court had used in an earlier case, namely, United
States versus Stevens, which was decided in 2010.
In the Stevens case, an 8 to 1 majority of the court declared unconstitutional the federal
government's efforts to ban the sale of so-called crush videos, or videos in which small animals
are stepped on and crushed by people.
The government had argued that depictions of animal cruelty, as a class of speech or
expression, are categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.
The court disagreed, concluding that I quote, that our decisions cannot be taken as establishing
a free-wheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.
Maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but
have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.
But if so, there is no evidence that depictions of animal cruelty is among them.
The decision in Stevens reminds us that there will always be new problems and challenges
for the court to take up under the First Amendment, if only because human beings will always find
new and sometimes disturbing ways to express themselves, and states will inevitably try
to find ways to limit or proscribe that expression.
The court's decision in Brown attracted a fair amount of attention, perhaps because
the facts of the case are so absorbing and easy to understand.
But another decision in the same week is at least as important.
In the case of Sorrell v. IMS Health Incorporated, the court struck a Vermont statute that prohibited
the sale, disclosure, and use of pharmacy records that revealed the prescribing practices
of individual doctors.
The state had argued that the information was not a form of speech at all, but a mere
commodity and I'm quoting with no greater entitlement to First Amendment protection
than beef jerky.
According for a 6-3 majority, Justice Kennedy rejected the state's claim, arguing that
the information at issue is clearly protected under the First Amendment.
According to Kennedy, and I quote, speech in aid of pharmaceutical marketing is a form
of expression protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
In other words, beef jerky may not be speech under the First Amendment, but talk about
beef jerky is.
Kennedy went on to note, and I quote him again, that facts are the beginning point for much
of the speech that is most essential to advance human knowledge and to conduct human affairs.
As a consequence, he said, Vermont's statute must be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny.
The law cannot satisfy that standard.
These cases seem strongly to suggest that the court's inclination when considering the
application of the First Amendment to new technologies of communication is to utilize
existing doctrinal frameworks.
In other words, the court tries to use existing rules and analytical frameworks when it considers
the application of the First Amendment to these new technologies.
One can't help but wonder if this isn't how many of us adapt to new and unfamiliar technologies.
Perhaps there is a great course's lecture series that considers this very question.
This leads us to our second question, how, if at all, does the First Amendment apply
to the Internet?
There are many issues we might consider here.
For example, are tweets protected speech?
Is Facebook a public forum?
Can a blog post be defamatory?
Can school officials require students to disclose their passwords to Facebook?
Or can potential employers require prospective employees to tell them their passwords?
In recent years, state and federal courts have wrestled with all of these questions.
We should probably begin by noting that at one time, the routine technologies we take
for granted, such as telephones and broadcast television and then cable, were considered
not only new, but profoundly troublesome in the First Amendment problems they portended.
Now each is governed by fairly well-established First Amendment rules and doctrines.
A healthy First Amendment, one informed by a sense of purpose and a sense of history,
should be able to accommodate changes in information technology, perhaps even fundamental or revolutionary
changes.
But I don't want to minimize the difficulties either.
New technologies of communication yield issues that are not only different in degree, they
may also differ in kind.
After all, a defamatory story published in a newspaper might reach 100,000 readers in
a day, whereas a defamatory post in a blog, or a text message, or a tweet may be seen
by millions and be immortalized on Google.
To get a sense of some of the First Amendment challenges the internet presents, let's look
at a 2002 case called Planned Parenthood of Columbia Willamette Incorporated vs. American
Coalition of Life Activists.
In this case, a federal appellate court considered whether a website called the Nuremberg Files
was protected speech.
To be blunt, the website was pretty strong stuff.
It argued that abortion is murder, and stated that a group of concerned citizens was collecting
dossiers on abortionists in anticipation that one day we may be able to hold them on trial
for crimes against humanity.
The website contained the names of approximately 200 people that identified as abortionists,
as well as the names of the president and numerous federal judges.
The site also provided personal information of several providers of family planning services.
Some of the information was presented in the form of a wanted poster.
And in addition, the names of clinic workers who had been murdered by anti-abortion activists
appeared on the list with strikes through their names, while the names of those who were injured
were shaded in gray.
The majority of the court held that the pattern in which the posters appeared, coupled with
the fact that other abortion providers had been killed, transformed the posters into a
threat, and that threats are unprotected by the First Amendment.
Of what relevance is the publication of this information on the internet?
Would our analysis be different if the material took the form of a flyer, or a poster on a
telephone pole, or an advertisement in a newspaper?
Why is the threat somehow more ominous, more serious, when made on the internet?
I think it remains to be seen whether and to what extent virtual communities, to use
a well-known term coined by Howard Reingold, are like traditional communities and can be
governed by the same or similar rules and conventions.
And this takes us directly to our next inquiry.
Our discussion of free speech in the internet should begin, however, and perhaps oddly,
with a case that involved a somewhat more established medium, the radio.
In Federal Communications Commission vs. Pacifica, decided by the court in 1978, the court
upheld an order by the FCC that disapproved of a radio station's broadcast of George
Carlin's filthy words monologue.
If you do not know it, the monologue makes heavy satirical use of seven words that the
FCC had said could not be on the airwaves, words I cannot say here because, ironically
enough, the Great Courses is censoring me.
Although as you well know, this is not a violation of my First Amendment rights because the Great
Courses is a private actor, not a state actor.
In upholding the FCC order, the Supreme Court noted, and I quote, that each medium of expression
presents special First Amendment problems, and that broadcasting in particular has historically
been afforded the least amount of protection under the First Amendment.
There are, the court noted, two reasons for this reduced degree of protection.
First, broadcasting is, in the court's words, uniquely pervasive in the lives of Americans,
and second, it is uniquely accessible to children.
Indeed, the court likened broadcast indecency to an intruder that can confront citizens
without warning.
Especially telling to the court's decision to uphold the FCC restriction was the inability
of existing technology to shield indecency from the young without restricting the expression
at the source.
Pacifica has been much criticized, and the court has appeared unwilling to extend it
to other areas.
In sable communications versus FCC, decided in 1989, for instance, the court refused to
apply Pacifica to the dial up porn industry, in part because users had to make an effort
to receive the communication, and in part because the court could identify filtering
technologies that could prevent minors from accessing that communication.
In the leading case of Reno versus ACLU, decided in 1997, the court considered the
application of the First Amendment to the Internet directly.
At issue was the constitutionality of the indecency provisions of the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, in which Congress tried to protect minors from explicit material on
the Internet.
When finding these sections of the Act unconstitutional, the court concluded unambiguously that speech
on the Internet should be afforded full constitutional protection.
In making this determination, the court distinguished the Internet from the broadcast media, noting
and I quote, that unlike the conditions that prevailed when Congress first authorized regulation
of the broadcast spectrum, the Internet can hardly be considered a scarce expressive commodity.
It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communications of all kinds.
Writing for the majority, Justice Stevens concluded and I quote, the Communications
Decency Act effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional
right to receive and to address to one another.
That burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be
at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve.
The court's language suggests strongly that it applied the familiar test of strict scrutiny.
I am not entirely sure that the court used that test the way it has in the past.
But there seems no doubt that the decision in Reno offers a broad degree of protection
for speech on the Internet.
Speaking to the state's interest in protecting children from exposure to indecent materials,
Stevens wrote and I quote, it is true that we have repeatedly recognized the governmental
interest in protecting children from harmful materials.
But that interest does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults.
As we have explained, the government may not reduce the adult population to only what is
fit for children.
In response to the court's decision in Reno, Congress subsequently passed the Child Online
Protection Act to protect minors from exposure to sexually explicit materials on the Internet.
The law provided a defense to web speakers who restricted access to prohibited materials
by requiring the use of a credit card or any other reasonable measures that are feasible
under available technology.
Writing for the majority in the 2004 case of Ashcroft v. ACLU, Justice Kennedy struck
this second congressional effort as well, concluding that the law did not satisfy the
least restrictive element required in a strict scrutiny analysis because it did not consider
the potential of filtering software as a regulatory alternative.
You may recall another case from lecture five, Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, which was
decided in 2002.
In that case, the court declared unconstitutional an effort by Congress to make virtual child
pornography illegal.
In virtual pornography, images are generated by computer and do not involve the filming
of actual persons.
The court distinguished cases in which it had upheld restrictions on child pornography
by noting that in them, it was not the offensiveness of the speech that justified its restriction,
but rather the negative effects that producing it had on actual children.
In contrast, the court argued, computer-generated child pornography, quote, records no crime
and creates no victims by its production.
In sum, the court has concluded that the First Amendment applies fully to what Justice Stevens
called the vast democratic fora of the Internet.
Which seems to suggest that there is nothing about the Internet as a medium of expression
that requires the creation of special, extraordinary, or new tools of First Amendment analysis.
On the other hand, there may be good reason to hesitate before we conclude that the Internet
raises no special or unique First Amendment issues.
In Doe v. Reed, for example, decided in 2010, the court heard an argument by an organization
called Protect Marriage Washington.
The organization claimed that compelled disclosure of signatures on its petitions burdened the
group's First Amendment rights and chilled political participation.
The court voted 8-1 to permit disclosure generally, but the court remanded the case to determine
whether, in this instance, opposing gay marriage would expose petition signers to unique danger.
You may recall our discussion of a similar claim concerning California's Proposition
8 in our lecture on freedom of association.
Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the court, concluded that public disclosure of the names
on referendum petitions does not necessarily violate the First Amendment.
He also noted that the state's interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral
process is important to rooting out fraud.
But here's where the Internet comes in.
Writing separately, in a concurring opinion, Justice Alito worried that if the information
were posted on the Internet, anyone with access to a computer could find the names of signers'
spouses, phone numbers, driving directions to their homes, the price of their houses,
and their children's school information.
In Justice Alito's words, the potential that such information could be used for harassment
is vast.
I am reminded of Justice Alito's lone dissent in the Westboro Church case, where he worried
aloud that speech might sometimes brutalize.
In his dissent in the same case, Justice Thomas likewise argued that there is a vital relationship
between political associations and privacy in one's associations.
Like Alito, he warned, and I quote, the state of technology today creates at least some
probability that signers of every referendum will be subjected to threats, harassments,
or reprisals if their personal information is disclosed.
Justice Scalia, however, in a concurring opinion, responded to these fears by arguing, and
I quote, requiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage,
without which democracy is doomed.
Which position do you think is more persuasive?
Is there a reason grounded squarely in the First Amendment to favor one particular perspective
over another?
In a subsequent case, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker presided at the trial concerning
the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8, in which voters approved a ban on same-sex
marriage.
Judge Walker had decided to allow the proceedings to be taped and then aired on YouTube.
But the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to prohibit the broadcast, explaining, and I quote, that
some of the witnesses have already said they will not testify if the trial is broadcast,
and they have substantiated their concerns by citing incidents of past harassment.
So, the court has determined that the First Amendment does in fact apply fully to the
Internet, although there may be instances where its unique features may pose special
problems.
But so far, at least, the court has applied traditional First Amendment rules and doctrines
to resolve those problems.
Now that we know speech on the Internet is entitled to First Amendment protection, let's
consider the application of some traditional First Amendment problems to the Internet.
For example, can there be fighting words on the Internet?
Consider the proposed Arizona legislation I referenced in Lecture 6, the legislation
that arguably makes it illegal to use the Internet to terrify, intimidate, threaten,
harass, annoy, or offend someone.
Can that legislation, if passed, be appelled as an application of the Fighting Words Doctrine
identified in Shiplinsky?
Mean words are not hard to find on the Internet, as I am sure you are all well aware.
Email and other Internet communications all too frequently reduced to flame wars, with
insults, name-calling, and the near-inevitability of one side calling another fascist or Nazis.
Hence we have Godwin's Law, defined this way.
As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis
or Hitler approaches.
Are mean words and references to fascism fighting words?
Probably not.
Because as we saw in our discussion of Shiplinsky vs. New Hampshire in Lecture 6, one standard
part of the Fighting Words Doctrine is a face-to-face confrontation.
Most communications on the Internet won't satisfy that test.
But what about Skype, which resembles a telephone communication in real time, and, through the
use of digital camera technology, can even put users face-to-face?
Or what about libel?
It is remarkably easy to defame someone online.
After all, the numerous opportunities for anonymous speech, coupled with the very distinct
possibility that a speaker is beyond the reach of U.S. law by virtue of residence in some
other country, means that some of the traditional disincentives to defamation don't apply.
Moreover, the great expanse and communicative potential of the Internet mean that defamatory
remarks may find a vast audience, and in so doing may cause all that much more harm to
an individual's reputation or business.
In addition, a principle called intermediary liability makes defamation lawsuits difficult
to carry forward.
The principle of intermediary liability, established by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, provides
that Internet providers, such as broadband companies, are not liable for the traffic
or communications that run through their network.
The owners of sites like Facebook, for example, or the persons who host blogging platforms
or other hosting services cannot be held liable in court for what other people say or post
on such sites.
Assuming a speaker can be identified, however, is there any reason why the traditional rules
that govern defamation should not also apply to the Internet?
There is a larger question here.
Would new technologies of expression cause us to reconsider well-settled First Amendment
rules?
You will remember that one such rule is that the First Amendment constrains only governments
or state actors.
It does not protect us against the actions of powerful private interests or concentrations
of private power that may sometimes significantly threaten freedom of speech.
As we look ahead to the next century, we might ask, does the First Amendment do enough to
protect us from threats to freedom of expression presented by private power?
This question might take on an added importance in light of two contemporary developments
in communications technologies.
One development is the seeming growth of large media monopolies in both print and broadcast
media.
To the extent that such private monopolies exist, they may actually reduce or limit the
number of diverse opinions and viewpoints that can be heard in the marketplace of ideas.
You may recall that we touched briefly on this point when we discussed the Red Lion case
in Lecture 8.
On the other hand, we can point to a second development that seems to push in the opposite
direction, because there is no denying that the Internet has greatly democratized speech
for better or for worse.
Anyone with access to a laptop or a smartphone can reach millions of other people in ways
that were simply unimaginable only a few decades ago.
Has the First Amendment anything to say about these two developments?
Here are ongoing debates, for example, about network or net neutrality.
Net neutrality refers to a problem that lies at the intersection of these two trends.
The vast majority of citizens in the United States get their access to the Internet through
a DSL provider or a cable television company.
It is through them that we speak, in some important sense, and it is through them that
we hear and are exposed to the speech of others.
Should these providers be required by law to make access to all speakers and content
providers available on an equal basis?
Or should these providers be permitted to block access to certain sites or favor the
content of others, perhaps sites with whom they have favorable business relationships?
Similarly, should Internet providers be able to charge more for access to heavily trafficked
sites like Google or to sites like YouTube that use significant amounts of bandwidth?
Proponents of network neutrality argue that network providers ought not to have the authority
to discriminate in this way, at least as a general proposition, and that formal rules
are necessary to protect and promote space for a wide variety of voices and speech in
cyberspace.
Others disagree for a variety of reasons.
Among them is one that should sound familiar.
Some opponents of net neutrality argue that it violates the property rights of Internet
service providers because they produce and own access to the Internet.
Is the First Amendment relevant to these debates?
We should probably begin by noting that insofar as most Internet providers are private corporations,
they are not state actors, and so cannot be held directly to conform to First Amendment
principles.
But even if they do, it is far from clear what that would mean for the constitutionality
of net neutrality rules.
It seems possible to argue that such rules, although they may be said to advance some
basic First Amendment principles, such as the free flow of information in a diverse
marketplace of ideas, also may infringe on others, such as the right of Internet providers
to use editorial judgment in the selection of the content they choose to carry.
I invite you to think back to our lecture on freedom of the press.
Is the logic of red lion the appropriate precedent here?
Or the logic of tornillo?
Or do we need a new and different rule altogether?
Let's consider two additional examples that speak to the distinction between public and
private and its relevance to freedom of speech.
To what extent, if any, does the First Amendment protect the right of public school students
to criticize school officials when those criticisms are voiced on social media sites outside of
school hours?
Consider the case of a high school student in Connecticut.
School administrators barred Avery Doninger from running in a student election after she
criticized them online for their handling of a student event called Jam Fest, a yearly
music festival.
In a blog post, Doninger called the school officials douchebags and asked her fellow
students and their parents to complain to the school superintendent in order, quote,
to piss the superintendent off.
In response to her post, the school board barred Doninger from running for reelection
as class secretary for her senior year.
Doninger sued and lost in a lower court.
In considering the case on appeal, a federal circuit court wrote, and I quote,
�The Supreme Court has yet to speak on the scope of a school's authority to regulate
expression that does not occur on school grounds or at a school-sponsored event.
We have determined, however, that a student may be disciplined for expressive conduct,
even conduct occurring off school grounds, when this conduct would foreseeably create
a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment.
We are acutely attentive in this context to the need to draw a clear line between student
activity that affects matters of legitimate concern to the school community and activity
that does not.
This observation is even more apt today when students both on and off campus routinely
participate in expressive activity unrelated to the school community via blog postings,
instant messaging, and other forms of electronic communication.
As you can probably surmise from the court's comments, it then proceeded to conclude that
school authorities could reasonably have concluded that the speech here would cause substantial
disruption.
The court wrote, and I quote, �The blog posting directly pertained to events at the
high school, and that Avery's intent in writing it was specifically to encourage her fellow
students to read and respond.
Do you agree with the circuit court?
And what about this case, involving a fake MySpace page created by an eighth grade student
in Pennsylvania?
In addition to accusing the student's principal of engaging in sex in his office and hitting
on students and their parents, the fake MySpace profile said that the principal's wife looked
like a man and that his son resembled a gorilla.
Did I mention the fake page was done by an eighth grader?
Even though the page was created by the student on her home computer, on a weekend, the school
suspended her.
Moreover, the principal threatened to take legal action for harassment.
The girl sued, claiming her punishment violated the First Amendment.
She lost in a lower court, but an appellate court reversed, saying, and I quote, �Though
disturbing, the record indicates that the profile was so outrageous that no one took
its content seriously.�
The court went on to say, and I quote, �Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever
allowed schools to punish students for off-campus speech that is not school-sponsored or at
a school-sponsored event and that caused no substantial disruption at school.�
What is the difference between these two cases?
Both courts seem to accept the view that off-campus speech that is school-sponsored or at a school-sponsored
event is subject to restriction.
Their difference appears to be in their assessments of whether the speech in each case was likely
to cause a substantial disruption at the school.
Final observation about the collapsing distinction between public and private.
Although as a general principle the First Amendment does not directly govern or restrain
private non-state actors, there are ways to make the First Amendment principles apply
to private actors.
Indeed, the state of Connecticut has done just this through the mechanism of a statute.
The Connecticut law provides that any employer who disciplines an employee for exercising
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment shall be liable to the employees for damages
caused by that discipline, provided that the employee�s activity did not substantially
affect the job performance or the working relationship between the employee and the employer.
I do not want to suggest that the Connecticut statute goes a long way to protecting speech
rights against private actors.
It certainly does not.
But it does speak to the issue of whether and to what extent we may claim speech rights
against private actors instead of governments.
I wonder if other states will follow suit or devise other ways to protect speech against
private actors.
If I may, a few concluding words.
According to one respected scholar, in the 18th century the First Amendment was given
a home in the Constitution.
In the 19th, it was extended from federal to state and local governments.
And in the 20th century, the Supreme Court embarked on a long and sometimes uncertain
project of implementing the First Amendment.
In the 21st century, we can be sure only that the First Amendment will confront new challenges,
including challenges we cannot now foresee or anticipate.
The future of the First Amendment rests in decisions we will make about how to regulate,
manage and control access to digital communication and emerging technologies of communication.
A healthy, vibrant First Amendment must find ways to nurture and democratize these new technologies
to use them in ways that service the values the First Amendment itself promotes.
The choices we will make about the meaning of the First Amendment are also choices about
who we are and about who we want to be.
They are choices about the kind of country we want to be and about what we believe.
The enduring importance of the First Amendment and the key to its relevance as we enter its
third full century is not what it means in any specific case, not what the Supreme Court
or any judge thinks it means, but rather what it asks us all to do, to choose for ourselves
and to take responsibility for those decisions.
Finally, as we think about how the First Amendment applies in its third full century,
we should also think about its influence and application in other constitutional democracies,
for their experience might have much to teach us as we confront new challenges and problems.
As we look around the world, I think we see that freedom of speech in the United States
is often more robust than it is even in countries with deeply entrenched commitments to freedom
of speech and religion.
In the United States, the countervailing claims sometimes used to restrict speech rights
in other constitutional states, claims grounded for example in appeals to human dignity, equality
and social order, are less likely to find a receptive audience.
I do not mean to suggest that the First Amendment is or should be insensitive to such claims
or that the constitutional experience of other countries is superior to our own.
I do want to suggest, however, that in studying others, we can learn much about ourselves.
And one of the things we should learn is that the First Amendment has had an incalculable
influence in the development and understanding of human freedom, not only in the United States,
but in many other countries as well.
The influence and the importance of the First Amendment are not confined to its past or to
our shores.
We can well expect that the causes it seeks to advance, freedom of speech, freedom of
expression, freedom of religion, freedoms of the mind are freedoms that are not ever
fully secure, whether in the United States or in the newly emerging democracies that
aspire to self-governance and the improvement of the human condition.
That I think is the meaning of the First Amendment, and that is the meaning of America.
