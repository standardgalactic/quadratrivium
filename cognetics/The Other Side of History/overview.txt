Processing Overview for The Other Side of History
============================
Checking The Other Side of History/01. Taking on the Other Side of History.txt
 In this lecture, the speaker emphasizes the importance of daily life history and understanding the human experience across different times and cultures. The speaker highlights how historians have shifted their focus from merely describing physical conditions to also exploring psychological and social aspects of historical figures' lives. This approach allows us to empathize with people from the past and understand our shared humanity.

The speaker uses an example from the Iliad, where Priam, a Trojan king, begs Achilles for the body of his slain son, Hector. This moment illustrates the profound connection between enemies and the capacity for empathy and compassion across cultural and historical divides.

Furthermore, the speaker references Jakob Bronowski's poignant moment in his series "The Ascent of Man," where he physically connects with the past by touching the mud at Auschwitz, symbolizing the need to make a tangible connection with history to allow the voices of the past to be heard.

In the upcoming lecture, the speaker invites the audience to imagine themselves as people from different eras, such as Paleolithic humans or a Roman slave, to gain insight into their daily lives and perspectives. This exercise is meant to help us appreciate our interconnectedness with all of humanity throughout history.

Checking The Other Side of History/02. Being Paleolithic.txt
1. **Paleolithic Survival**: Our Paleolithic ancestors survived the last Ice Age by adapting to the changing environment, hunting animals like reindeer, wooly mammoths, steppe bison, and wild horses. They preserved food in permafrost, built shelters from animal hides, and engaged in trade, particularly of obsidian.

2. **Climate Change**: Around 10,000 BC, the climate warmed up rapidly, leading to a shift from a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled life as forests expanded. In some cases, people became voyagers who traveled across bodies of water for resources like salt.

3. **Human Differences**: What sets humans apart from other species is not just our physical attributes but also our cultural heritage, complex social institutions, language, and the ability to represent the world through art and symbolic thinking. Our large brains and shared 98% of DNA with chimpanzees are evidence of our common ancestry.

4. **Cultural Inheritance**: Studying prehistory involves understanding how humans inherited a culture and developed complex social organizations, language, and the ability to express themselves artistically. It also includes recognizing the intelligence, resourcefulness, and cooperative nature of our ancestors.

5. **Population and Sustainability**: Throughout human history, the available resources on Earth have limited population size. A supervolcano eruption 74,000 years ago may have reduced the human population significantly. Today, we continue to face challenges in living within a balanced ecological budget.

6. **Neolithic Age and Human Evolution**: In the next stage of human evolution, known as the Neolithic Age, climate and landscape will again play crucial roles in shaping societies. This period also saw the emergence of humans subjugating their own kind, leading to more complex social structures and the foundations of civilization.

Checking The Other Side of History/03. Living in Mesopotamia.txt
1. **Early Human Societies in Mesopotamia**: The early societies in Mesopotamia emerged around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which provided fertile land for agriculture and enabled a sedentary lifestyle. This led to the development of complex social structures and eventually the invention of writing.

2. **Uruk Period (c. 4000-3100 BC)**: The Uruk period saw the establishment of cities with massive walls, temples, and the world's first urban planning. The concept of a standardized unit of measure for trade and architecture, the "nus," was developed.

3. **Sumerian City-States (c. 2500-2334 BC)**: After the Uruk expansion, Mesopotamia fragmented into city-states, each with its own ruler. Sumerians invented cuneiform, the world's first known complex system of writing.

4. **The Standard of Ur (c. 2600-250 BC)**: This artifact provides evidence of trade, warfare, and possibly human sacrifice. It also represents the power dynamics of the time, with one side depicting a king receiving tribute and the other side showing him in battle.

5. **Akkadian Empire (c. 2334-2154 BC)**: The Akkadian Empire was the first empire to unify Mesopotamia under a single rule, spreading its influence throughout the region and beyond. The Akkadian language became the common tongue, while Sumerian was relegated to religious and scholarly contexts.

6. **Cultural Commonalities in Early Societies**: Across various cultures during this time, people were predominantly involved in agriculture, traveled by foot or water, had a lifestyle dictated by natural cycles, faced high rates of infant mortality and short life expectancy, dealt with disabilities, had limited knowledge of the world beyond their immediate area, were susceptible to illnesses and parasites, and experienced physical wear and tear.

7. **Impact of Rivers on Human Flourishing**: The presence of rivers like the Tigris and Euphrates allowed for sustained life, leading to the development of human culture, including agriculture, urbanization, and writing systems. These developments laid the groundwork for civilization as we understand it today.

In the next lecture, the focus will shift to another river system, the Nile, and its profound impact on Egyptian civilization.

Checking The Other Side of History/04. Being Egyptian.txt
1. **Origins of Writing**: The earliest form of writing in Mesopotamia evolved from pictorial symbols to a more abstract system that combined logograms (words) and phonetic signs (sounds). This cuneiform script emerged around 3200 BCE.

2. **Egyptian Hieroglyphs**: The Egyptians developed their own writing system, hieroglyphs, which could be written in various directions: left to right, right to left, or top to bottom. This complex system combined ideograms (visual representations of objects) and phonetic signs. Hieroglyphic writing lasted for about 4,000 years and ended around 394 AD with the last known inscription on Philae Island.

3. **Deciphering Hieroglyphs**: The decryption of hieroglyphs by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion in 1822 after examining the Rosetta Stone, which contained a Greek translation of a hieroglyphic and demotic text, revolutionized our understanding of ancient Egypt.

4. **Cultural Artifact Controversy**: The Rosetta Stone, a contested artifact found in 1799 by the French and later purchased by the British, is currently on display in the British Museum but is a subject of debate regarding its rightful home.

5. **Egyptian Literature**: A wealth of Egyptian literature has survived, including religious texts, romances, advice on reaching the afterlife, magical texts, letters, business documents, and more.

6. **Song of the Harper**: One notable piece is the "Song of the Harper," which dates back to around 2100 BCE and emphasizes the importance of living fully and enjoying life, a Carpe Diem theme that predates Roman philosopher Horace by 2000 years.

7. **Historical Context**: The unique geography and climate of Egypt, particularly the Nile River, facilitated communication, travel, and trade. Herodotus recognized these factors as crucial to the civilization's development.

8. **Literacy and Reconstruction**: Written records, such as those left by the Egyptians, enable historians to reconstruct aspects of daily life, providing insights into family dynamics that are otherwise inaccessible from illiterate societies.

In conclusion, the discovery of ancient Egyptian writing systems has provided an unprecedented glimpse into the daily lives and values of this fascinating civilization, allowing us to appreciate the depth of their culture and society.

Checking The Other Side of History/05. Belonging to an Egyptian Family.txt
1. **Daily Life and Diet**: In ancient Egypt, the diet of the average person was simple, consisting mainly of bread, onions, and beer. Hunting, fishing, and fouling were common ways to supplement one's diet, using bows, arrows, throwsticks, lassoes, and weighted ropes.

2. **Social Gatherings**: Socializing often took the form of gatherings at home, which could be quite festive. Wealthier individuals might hire professional singers and dancers, and even magicians for entertainment. Magicians performed impressive feats like reattaching the heads of animals.

3. **Gender Roles**: Women typically socialized with other women during gatherings, while men socialized among themselves. Taverns were not respectable places for married couples or women of high standing.

4. **Leisure Activities**: Board games like Senet were popular forms of entertainment. The Tale of Sinui is one of the classic stories that has survived from this period.

5. **Public Entertainment**: There was no formal theater in ancient Egypt, so all entertainment was private or religious in nature.

6. **Divorce and Family Dynamics**: Divorce was relatively common, and if a woman was divorced, she would usually return to her father's or brother's household. Divorce could lead to a loss of social status and financial hardship for the woman.

7. **Family Life**: The family was central to Egyptian life, providing security, identity, emotional support, role modeling, education, and recreation. The extended family unit was more like a community than a modern nuclear family.

8. **Challenges in Family Life**: While the communal living might have provided support, it could also be stifling, and conflicts between different generations were not uncommon.

9. **Children in Divorce**: The fate of children in the event of divorce is less clear, but they would likely face significant changes and challenges.

10. **Conclusion**: Egyptian family life was a closely-knit community system that offered a rich tapestry of support and belonging. Despite potential tensions, it provided a stable and structured environment for its members.

In the next lecture, we will explore the role of religion in ancient Egyptian society, including the rituals performed for the gods and the responsibilities of the priesthood, as well as an examination of the attempt to introduce monotheism within this tradition-bound culture.

Checking The Other Side of History/06. Multiple, Complex, and Changing Goals.txt
1. **Goals and Their Complexity**: Goals are dynamic, evolving throughout the conflict process. They can be multifaceted, encompassing different aspects such as the specific outcome (topic goal), relationship maintenance (relational goal), personal identity (identity goal), and the procedural aspects of how to handle the conflict (process goals).

2. **Clarifying Goals**: Identifying one's own and the other party's goals requires careful thought and courage. It involves distinguishing between different types of goals, which can provide clarity and guide more effective conflict management strategies.

3. **Assignment**: For a chosen example of conflict from lecture one, students are asked to identify their own and the other party's topic goals, relational goals, identity goals, and process goals. Using the lens model from lecture three as a tool for understanding perceptions, this exercise aims to uncover more possibilities for win-win resolutions.

4. **Upcoming Lecture Seven**: The next topic will be power in conflict, exploring how conflicts are inherently intertwined with power dynamics and the importance of understanding these dynamics for effective conflict management. Power struggles can occur even within close relationships, and recognizing this aspect is crucial before moving on to discuss specific processes for handling conflict.

Checking The Other Side of History/07. Being a Dead Egyptian.txt
1. Embalmers in ancient Egypt were tasked with preparing bodies for the afterlife, a process that was gruesome and unlikely to be performed by someone who truly believed in the immortality of the soul. During the Ptolemaic period (332‚Äì30 BC), there are records of embalmers creating mummies using parts from different corpses, suggesting some may have been more focused on their craft than the spiritual implications.

2. Tomb robbing was a significant issue in ancient Egypt, with incentives for robbers being the valuable goods buried with the dead. Despite harsh penalties and curses meant to deter them, tomb robbers consistently found ways to access and loot royal and common tombs alike.

3. The Egyptian authorities employed various security measures to protect tombs, including portcullis blocks that could be locked into place and false burial chambers with locking mechanisms. However, these measures often failed to prevent theft.

4. Tomb robbers were among the first archaeologists, as they excavated and removed artifacts from ancient burials. The belief in the "curse of the mummy" may have its origins in the actual curses inscribed on tombs or from a Victorian-era stage show involving real mummies.

5. To avoid repeated looting, pharaohs of the New Kingdom (around 1550‚Äì1070 BC) had their tombs built in the Valley of the Kings, a secluded area behind the cliffs at Thebes. Yet, even this secure location did not protect most royal tombs from being robbed.

6. The only intact royal tomb discovered so far is that of Tutankhamun, which was disturbed by tomb robbers who were then disturbed themselves, thus preserving its contents. Most other tombs in the Valley of the Kings were extensively looted.

7. In the next lecture, we will explore the lives of the Egyptian workers who constructed these elaborate tombs and consider the various professions that existed in ancient Egypt, including those who toiled under difficult conditions simply to survive.

Checking The Other Side of History/08. Being an Egyptian Worker.txt
 In this lecture, Professor Trevor Bryce provides an overview of the living conditions and work environment of a skilled craftsman in ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, specifically one who was employed in constructing royal tombs at Der El Medina, near Thebes. This craftsman and his family lived in a shack on-site for eight days out of ten, working under the administration of a Vizier, which indicates high status. They enjoyed good conditions, including time off for religious festivals, the right to engage in other forms of work like making furniture or funerary items, and the ability to strike if their wages or beer were delayed.

The craftsman was well-compensated, receiving more grain than needed to trade for additional necessities, as well as an annual allowance of food and drink including fish, vegetables, beans, onions, salt, fat, ointments, beer, and firewood. Water was provided by water carriers, and laundry services were available with the use of tags for identification. If a family member fell ill, there was a part-time physician among the workers who could provide medical assistance.

The craftsman's earnings placed him in the top two percent of the population, indicating a life of relative comfort and status. Despite this, some craftsmen resorted to bribery and corruption to secure jobs for their children, as evidenced by ancient texts. The lecture sets the stage for understanding how such stable and well-cared-for workers could produce the extraordinary achievements in art, architecture, and culture that characterized ancient Egypt. In the next series of lectures, Professor Bryce will explore the civilization of ancient Greece, a culture shaped by its rugged landscape, islands, and maritime traditions.

Checking The Other Side of History/09. Being Minoan and Mycenaean.txt
1. **The End of the Dark Age in Greece**: Around 900-800 BC, Greece emerged from a period known as the Dark Age into a time of prosperity and cultural resurgence. This recovery is marked by advancements in various aspects of Greek life, including pottery, art, and writing.

2. **Pottery and Art**: The production of grand-scale pottery, such as the dipylian amphora, exemplifies the artistic revival during this period. These vases often depict scenes of human activity, like lamenting the dead, reflecting universal themes despite their aristocratic context.

3. **Writing System**: The reinvention of writing through the adoption and adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet to the Greek language around 800 BC was a pivotal moment. This innovation allowed for the written transmission of laws, poetry, and other important information, significantly impacting society.

4. **Laws and Governance**: With the advent of writing, laws could be formally documented for the first time in Greece, providing protection and structure for citizens, including the less powerful and marginalized members of society.

5. **The Influence of the Sea**: The sea played a crucial role in Greek history, facilitating contact with other cultures, such as the Phoenicians, which led to the borrowing and adaptation of their alphabet and eventually to the spread of Greek culture and influence.

6. **What's Next**: The lectures that follow will explore various aspects of Greek life, including the experiences of women, children, slaves, citizen soldiers, refugees, the sick, disabled, and elderly, as well as what it meant to be Greek during this transformative period leading up to the classical Greek renaissance.

Checking The Other Side of History/10. Being Greek.txt
 The lecture focuses on the trial and execution of Socrates as an exemplar of the rapid changes and complexities of Greek culture around 400 B.C., a time when the old ways of Egypt were static and valued, while Greece embraced change and novelty. The trial of Socrates highlights the tension between individual freedom and societal expectations; it also underscores the paradoxes inherent in Greek society, where human potential was valued but only within certain social norms, and where democracy coexisted with an attitude of xenophobia and misogyny.

Socrates, a philosopher who questioned traditional values and beliefs, was found guilty by a jury of his peers on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth. Despite the recommendation for a lenient punishment from Socrates himself, the jury voted to execute him, reflecting the societal pressures that valued conformity and traditional norms over individual dissent.

The lecture emphasizes that being Greek meant belonging to an exclusive club that valued human potential but also required maintaining the status quo and keeping non-Greeks and women in subordinate positions. The fate of Socrates serves as a cautionary tale about the cost of challenging the established order, even within a so-called free society.

In the next lecture, the speaker will delve into how Greek culture, as exemplified by the trial of Socrates, shaped the identity and values of its citizens, particularly in terms of gender and social hierarchies. The lecturer reflects on the complexities of Greek civilization and its influence on history up to that point.

Checking The Other Side of History/11. Growing Up Greek.txt
1. **Girls' Education in Greece**: Outside of Sparta, education for girls was limited and not a formal right. In Athens, some aristocratic girls may have received a rudimentary education related to religious duties at sanctuaries like Artemis Brauronia. The poetess Sappho is often cited as potentially running a school for young women on the island of Lesbos, but evidence is not conclusive.

2. **Spartan Education**: Sparta had a rigorous state education system aimed at producing disciplined, obedient citizens and soldiers. Boys were taken from their families at an early age and subjected to a system that involved harsh living conditions, minimal diet, and training in stealth and cunning. At twelve, they moved into barracks, and at sixteen, they joined the Crook Tire, a sort of military police, for two years of training in Messinia, where they had to fend for themselves and intimidate the local population.

3. **Athenian Youth**: In contrast to Sparta, Athens faced issues with youth delinquency, as evidenced by the vandalism of the herms, which was seen as a grave omen and occurred just before a significant military campaign.

4. **Death and Social Awareness**: Greek children were often exposed to death from a young age due to high mortality rates and frequent wars. They grew up acutely aware of their place within a hierarchical society, where not all individuals were considered fully human.

5. **Slavery**: Slaves in Greece, both male and female, were treated as property and lacked rights. Male slaves were often referred to as 'boys' by their owners, reflecting the power dynamics and the dehumanization inherent in slavery.

In the next lecture, the focus will shift to the experiences of these slaves and the nature of their lives under Greek ownership.

Checking The Other Side of History/12. Being a Greek Slave.txt
 The helots were an indigenous population in Messinia who lived under a state of unfreedom, without political or legal rights, and could be executed or hunted down without trial. They primarily worked the land for their Spartan masters, the citizen body, who were either engaged in military training or away fighting. Despite their harsh conditions, helots managed to lead somewhat independent lives at home, not subject to constant beck and call. The Spartan youth organization known as the Kruptire was responsible for committing acts of violence against helots to instill fear. Helots could retain any excess production beyond what they owed to their masters, and occasionally, they were granted freedom, especially from 450 BC onwards, though this came with significant risks. In 464 BC, the helots staged a major revolt that took the Spartans five years to suppress. This revolt highlights the reality that the cultural and military achievements of ancient Greece were underpinned by slavery, as evidenced by the large number of slaves who served as light-armed troops in significant battles like Thermopylae and Plataea. In the next lecture, we will explore how Greece's victory over the Persians was facilitated by these slaves and the broader implications of slavery within ancient Greek society.

Checking The Other Side of History/13. Being a Greek Soldier or Sailor.txt
 The rise of mercenaries in ancient Greece was a significant shift from the reliance on citizen militias for defense and became particularly prevalent due to economic hardships following the Peloponnesian War. Mercenaries were recruited from various parts of Greece and even beyond, as men sought security, adventure, or economic stability. Being a mercenary required specialized training in different combat techniques, as battles often took place in difficult terrains.

Mercenaries were typically seen as the undesirable elements of society‚Äîrefugees, deserters, or criminals‚Äîwho would fight for anyone willing to pay them. This perception was highlighted by the Athenian orator Isocrates, who warned that the increasing number of mercenaries could pose a significant threat to Greek civilization.

The economic implications were also substantial, as a considerable portion of the Greek male population became itinerant soldiers, leading to significant changes in family dynamics and possibly affecting women's lives at home. In the next lecture, we will explore the world of Greek women, examining their roles, perceptions, and potential alternatives to being wives and mothers within Greek society.

Checking The Other Side of History/14. Being a Greek Woman.txt
 In this lecture, we explored the roles and relationships of men and women in ancient Greece, considering both historical evidence and literary representations. We discussed the unique position of Spartan women, who underwent rigorous training to become effective mothers for the production of new citizens. Their ability to own property was an exception to the norm in ancient Greece, particularly when compared to Athenian women, who had no such rights.

Despite these limited roles and shorter life expectancies, Greek women could sometimes hold significant power and influence within their households and communities. The famous Spartan mother's farewell to her son, as recorded by Plutarch, exemplifies the strong role mothers played in reinforcing societal values.

The relationship between men and women in ancient Greece was complex, with both positive and negative aspects. While legal systems often favored males, and there were instances of domestic violence, there were also examples of mutual respect and intimacy. The relationship between Odysseus and Penelope from Homer's "Odyssey" illustrates the interdependence and partnership that could exist between a man and a woman, even in a male-dominated society.

Greek drama provides further evidence of the strength and complexity of women in Greek culture, with characters like Clytemnestra, Antigone, and others displaying agency and influence that challenged societal norms. The goddesses of Greek mythology also embodied power and autonomy, suggesting that real-life women may have had significant roles and voices.

Finally, the Greeks valued the ideal of homofrosune or hominoya, which translates to a like-mindedness and harmony between spouses, similar to the modern concept of an ideal marriage. This suggests that despite the gender disparities, ancient Greeks also aspired to egalitarian and harmonious partnerships.

In conclusion, while the roles for women in ancient Greece were often limited and their lives could be fraught with challenges, there were instances of strong agency, partnership, and even power. The Greek fascination with achieving a state of bliss within marriage reflects the universal human desire for companionship and mutual respect. In the next lecture, we will delve into the various ways the Greeks sought to relax and enjoy leisure.

Checking The Other Side of History/15. Relaxing Greek Style.txt
1. **Relaxation as Civic Expression**: In ancient Greece, relaxation was not merely a way to unwind but often intertwined with civic life and duty. For men, there were numerous opportunities for leisure, primarily centered around athletics, musical competitions, and theatre festivals, which were deeply integrated into Greek culture and even had the protection of the gods.

2. **Athletic Games**: Men could participate in or attend various games dedicated to different gods, such as the Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean games. These events were held annually and included a variety of athletic and military contests.

3. **Theatre Festivals**: Theatrical performances, particularly in Athens during the Dionysia festival, were state-sponsored events where tragedies and comedies were performed. These festivals allowed men to engage culturally and artistically.

4. **Limited Opportunities for Women**: Women had far fewer opportunities for leisure and relaxation. They were mostly confined to the domestic sphere, with limited exceptions such as hosting or visiting female friends, participating in religious festivals (both exclusive to women and open to all), and spending time with their husbands at home.

5. **Women's Status**: The lives of Greek women were heavily restricted, with their social roles being primarily that of a wife and mother within the household. Their opportunities for public engagement or relaxation were very limited compared to men.

6. **Spartan Women's Independence**: One notable exception was Spartan women, who enjoyed greater independence due to the frequent military campaigns in which their husbands participated.

7. **Relaxation as Work**: The Greek concept of leisure was not entirely separate from work; both were seen as forms of civic expression and social responsibility.

8. **Upcoming Topic: Homeless and Stateless**: In the next lecture, we will explore the lives of those who did not share the same stability or opportunities for relaxation‚Äîthe homeless and stateless individuals in ancient Greece. Their experiences were markedly different, characterized by hardship, uncertainty, and vulnerability to depredation.

Checking The Other Side of History/16. Being a Greek Refugee.txt
 In this lecture, we explored the historical treatment of various groups of people who were compelled to leave their homelands in ancient Greece, focusing on pioneers, evacuees, asylum seekers, and exiles. Here's a summary of the key points discussed:

1. **Pioneers**: These were individuals or families venturing into unknown territories for colonization or trade purposes. They often faced hardships, including isolation, lack of resources, and potential conflict with indigenous populations.

2. **Evacuees**: In times of war or crisis, citizens might be evacuated from their homes to safer regions. An example provided was during the Peloponnesian War when Athens evacuated its citizens to the island of Salamis. These evacuees faced the challenges of displacement and the struggle to maintain a sense of community and normalcy under difficult circumstances.

3. **Asylum Seekers**: Individuals or groups seeking refuge from persecution, war, or other dangers could appeal to the sanctity of religious spaces, like temples dedicated to Zeus Hikecius. Upon entering such sanctuaries, they would claim asylum under the protection of the gods. The local authorities, such as the people of Athens, would then decide their fate based on the merits of their case. If accepted, they were granted permanent residence and protection.

4. **Exiles**: Those found guilty of serious crimes or political dissenters might be banished from their cities. Their status as exiles often meant a life of wandering, with little hope of returning home. An iconic example is the Trojan Prince Ineos, whose story is recounted in Virgil's "The Aeneid."

5. **Alexander the Great's Amnesty**: In the 4th century BC, the refugee crisis reached such proportions that Alexander the Great issued a panhellenic amnesty, allowing refugees to return to their native cities and reclaim their property. This decree was aimed at addressing the grievances of those who had been exiled or banished from their homes. However, it presented significant bureaucratic challenges, especially for those who had been away for long periods.

6. **The Fate of Theban Refugees**: A notable example of a large group of refugees was the 30,000 citizens from Thebes, who were driven into exile after their city was destroyed by Alexander the Great following a revolt. Their fate post-exile is not well-documented, highlighting the often overlooked human impact of historical events.

The lecture underscored that these groups of people were relegated to the "other side of history," reflecting the marginalized status and hardships faced by those who had to leave their homes and adapt to new circumstances or endure lifelong exile. The next lecture will examine the experiences of another marginalized group: the sick and the disabled in ancient Greece.

Checking The Other Side of History/17. Being a Sick or Disabled Greek.txt
1. In ancient Greece, disabled and deformed individuals faced significant challenges due to societal attitudes and practices.
   
2. At birth, children in Sparta were inspected by elders of the tribes, and those deemed defective were abandoned in the wild, often to be preyed upon by animals.

3. Ancient Greeks believed that deformities were signs of divine disfavor or ill-will. This belief permeated oaths, where breaking an oath could invoke monstrous children as a curse.

4. Disabled individuals were often stigmatized and marginalized, unable to serve as priests or enter temples due to the belief that physical perfection was necessary to serve the gods.

5. They could be identified as farmacoi, or scapegoats, driven into exile and cursed during times of crisis.

6. Disabled individuals had limited roles in society, often working in professions that did not require whole-body functionality, such as blacksmithing, pottery, or music.

7. Some exploited their deformities by becoming entertainers at drinking parties, where they could make a living by performing and being the subject of ridicule.

8. Extended families and tighter community bonds in antiquity may have offered some protection and support for the disabled.

9. Despite any protection or support, individuals with disabilities were often met with loathing and fear, as their existence was seen as a sign of divine disfavor by many in society.

10. The history of the disabled in ancient Greece is a critical aspect of social history that has been overlooked in conventional accounts but deserves attention for its humanity and relevance to understanding societal attitudes towards disability.

Checking The Other Side of History/18. Practicing Greek Religion.txt
1. **Religious Observance in Ancient Greece**: Greek religion was deeply intertwined with daily life and was centered around the prevention of miasma, a form of pollution associated with bodily functions, death, and childbirth, which could bring misfortune or disaster to individuals or communities.

2. **Miasma and its Causes**: Miasma could be released through involuntary or voluntary homicide, contact with the dead, and childbirth. It was believed that saltwater, sulphur, and particularly the blood of a pig could neutralize miasma.

3. **Expert Interpretation**: In cases where there was uncertainty about religious obligations or rituals to perform, Greeks would consult an expert in sacred law to ensure proper observance and avoid the consequences of miasma.

4. **Greek Gods**: The Greek gods were powerful but also flawed, engaging in activities that could be considered immoral by human standards. This contrasts with the Christian view of a divine moral code.

5. **Delphi and Apollo's Oracle**: Delphi was a significant oracle where people sought advice from the god Apollo. The priesthood there was not corrupt, as the oracle's longevity attests to its credibility. Maxims inscribed at the temple, such as "know yourself" and "nothing in excess," emphasized the importance of understanding oneself and moderation.

6. **Greek Religion vs. Christian Religion**: Greek religion was fundamentally different from Christian religion, offering no comfort or consolation but rather a relationship with the gods that was fraught with danger and the need for constant vigilance to avoid miasma.

7. **The Dilemma of Aging**: The lecture hints at the human challenge of aging and the lack of divine guidance on this issue, which will be explored further in the next lecture.

8. **Divine Immutability**: The gods remained eternal youths or adults, never aging or showing signs of infirmity, highlighting the stark difference between the divine and human experiences.

9. **Conclusion**: Greek religion was a vital part of life, requiring vigilance, knowledge, and understanding of sacred laws to navigate the dangers presented by miasma and the capricious nature of the gods. It took courage and resilience to live in a world where divine favor could change at any moment.

Checking The Other Side of History/19. Being an Old Greek.txt
 The lecture explores the perspective on aging in ancient Greek society, contrasting it with the respect for elders shown by Spartan ambassadors. While the Greeks, particularly Athenians, often struggled with tensions between younger and older generations, leading to elder abuse in some cases, philosophers like Plato offered advice on managing generational relationships. Sophocles' trial at age 90, where he defended his mental faculties by reciting his own poetry, highlights the challenges faced by the elderly in Athens.

The Greeks viewed old age with apprehension, and Mimnermus lamented the loss of youth and the pleasures of sex. However, Cephalus in Plato's Republic and Sophocles himself offered a more positive view, emphasizing the relief from the "raging beast" of sexual desire that comes with old age. Euripides also noted that even when elderly people pray for death due to the hardships of aging, they typically do not wish to die once death is near.

The lecture concludes by noting that while ancient Greeks might have been more self-reliant in their older years, they were likely to remain active and vigorous until their final illness, which was often brief and relatively uncomplicated compared to modern experiences of dying. In the next lecture, the discussion will shift to the Greek view of death and the afterlife.

Checking The Other Side of History/20. Being a Dead Greek.txt
1. **Beliefs about the Afterlife**: The lecture begins by discussing different Greek beliefs about the afterlife, contrasting the idea that the dead are cut off from the living (as seen in Hades) with the belief that the dead remain connected to their graves and the living. This connection is demonstrated through practices like visiting tombs and leaving offerings, which suggest a belief in an eternal human fellowship that transcends death.

2. **The Kuroi**: Young aristocratic warriors who died were commemorated with statues known as Kuroi, which represented them as youthful and ageless, physically perfect, and assimilated to the god Apollo.

3. **Murder Victims**: Those who died violent deaths, particularly murder victims, were considered both vengeful and malignant. Rituals like mascalismus were performed to invoke their assistance, often by placing lead tablets inscribed with curses in their graves.

4. **Heroic Dead**: Heroes, who were not necessarily good but had extraordinary life experiences, held significant power at their gravesites. They could be summoned for protection or aid, typically through blood offerings. The Athenian heroes from the Battle of Marathon are an example of this.

5. **Greek Attitudes Towards Death**: The Greeks maintained strong emotional ties with their deceased and believed in performing rituals to ensure the welfare of their dead. However, unlike the Egyptians, they did not preserve their dead's physical remains. Socrates' response to how he wanted to be disposed of after death‚Äî "anyway you like, so long as you can catch me"‚Äîreflects the Greek philosophy of accepting the inevitability of death.

6. **Conclusion and Future Lecture**: The lecture concludes with a reflection on the Greeks' relationship with death, emphasizing that while they held onto their dead, they did not preserve their bodies physically. In the next lecture, we will explore the lives, mindset, and interactions between the Greeks and the Persians, delving into the roots of the ongoing east-west dichotomy.

Checking The Other Side of History/21. Being Persian.txt
1. **Persian Perception**: The Persian Empire, which extended from Central Asia to Europe, was a vast and diverse realm with its own values and systems of governance. While the Greeks viewed the Persians as savages due to their experiences in the Persian Wars and their political differences, an ordinary Persian might have had mixed feelings about Greek culture or felt grateful for the stability offered by autocracy.

2. **Education and Values**: Herodotus, a Greek historian, noted that Persian education focused on horse riding, archery, and speaking the truth, which may suggest that there were values in Persian society worth admiring.

3. **Social Structure**: The Persian social structure was hierarchical, with the king at the top and the subjects below him. The nobility held significant power but had to be careful not to challenge the king directly.

4. **Destruction of Persepolis**: The Persian Empire fell to Alexander the Great in 330 BC, culminating in the burning of Persepolis, an act that symbolized the end of Persian dominance and the beginning of Hellenistic influence.

5. **East-West Divide**: The clash between Greece and Persia solidified an East-West divide that would persist throughout history, influencing future conflicts and interactions between civilizations.

6. **Hellenistic World**: After Alexander's conquests, Greek culture spread to the east, leading to the Hellenistic period where Greek influence extended as far as Afghanistan and India, shaping a new world order.

7. **Alexander's Actions**: Alexander's decision to permit or even command the destruction of Persepolis shows that the concept of barbarism is not confined to one culture or another and that such acts can contribute to long-standing divides between peoples.

8. **Future Exploration**: The next lecture will delve into the daily life of Greeks in Egypt during the Hellenistic period, exploring how Greek civilization influenced and merged with local cultures as it expanded beyond its original borders.

1. **Alexandria's Founding and Cultural Dynamics**: Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great's general Ptolemy Soter in 332 BCE after the death of Alexander. It became the capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt for three centuries. The city was built on the remains of a smaller Egyptian settlement and incorporated its sacred lake, Lake Mareotis, into its design.

2. **Cultural Integration and Tensions**: Alexandria was a melting pot of cultures, including Greeks, Egyptians, and Jews. While the Ptolemaic rulers respected Egyptian religion, there were tensions with the Jews who worshipped one God and rejected Greek religious practices. The different communities lived in separate districts to maintain cultural integrity.

3. **Alexandria's Administration**: Alexandria was self-governing with its own laws, magistrates, council, and assembly, similar to a typical Greek city. It had a complex bureaucracy that managed economic activities such as irrigation, agriculture, taxation, and market regulation.

4. **Alexandria's Prosperity and Legacy**: The city prospered due to its strategic location for trade and as a port for exporting Egyptian grain to Rome. It remained a center of learning and culture, giving rise to the Neoplatonist School of Philosophy and the astronomer Ptolemy. Christianity also found a home there.

5. **Alexandria's Transition to Roman Rule**: After the defeat of Cleopatra VII at the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE by Octavian (later Augustus), Egypt became part of the Roman Empire. The city continued to thrive until the Arab conquest in the 7th century AD.

6. **Upcoming Lectures**: The next ten lectures will explore what it meant to be Roman, focusing on the lives of ordinary people, including slaves, soldiers, women, and the poor, as well as celebrities, criminals, pagans, Jews, and Christians. The lectures will aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of Roman daily life through the eyes of those who lived it.

Checking The Other Side of History/23. Being Roman.txt
1. **Artistic Appreciation**: In ancient Rome, owning original Greek sculptures was a status symbol equivalent to owning famous art today. Due to the high value placed on Greek art, there was also a market for copies. Despite Romans' admiration for Greek culture, they may have viewed Greeks as untrustworthy and felt culturally inferior to them.

2. **Materialism**: Romans were extremely materialistic, valuing possessions from across their empire. They enjoyed a variety of goods imported from different regions, which they displayed in their opulent homes.

3. **Privacy**: Romans had much less privacy than modern societies due to the prevalence of slavery. Slaves often knew intimate details of their owners' lives, and public latrines meant that bathroom visits could involve social interaction. Clothing was loose, providing some cover during these visits.

4. **Physical Conditions**: Life in Rome could be harsh, with unsanitary living conditions, a wide economic gap between rich and poor, and health risks such as plague and malnutrition. Despite these challenges, there were opportunities for advancement, particularly for those who were hardworking and ambitious.

5. **Slaves**: Slaves in Rome were at the bottom of society but had the potential to gain their freedom and become part of the free population, making it a unique system with significant upward social mobility. The next nine lectures will explore various aspects of Roman life, starting with the experiences of slaves.

In summary, Roman society was marked by a strong appreciation for Greek culture, materialistic values, limited privacy due to slavery, and challenging living conditions that coexisted with opportunities for advancement. Slaves were an integral part of this system, with a possibility of freedom and social mobility unparalleled in other ancient societies.

Checking The Other Side of History/24. Being a Roman Slave.txt
1. **Freedom and Obligations for Roman Slaves:** Upon manumission, a slave became a freedman (libertus/liberta) and took the name of their former owner as a patronus. Freedmen were expected to maintain contact with their ex-owners and provide service to them, which was known as obsequium. The loss of respect towards one's former master could result in the revocation of freedom.

2. **Earning a Living:** Former slaves who had acquired skills or trades during their servitude could become self-sufficient artisans or artists. Talented individuals had the potential to amass considerable wealth, with some achieving fortunes rivaling those of modern billionaires.

3. **Notable Freedmen:** Pallas and Narcissus were two famous freedmen who served under Emperor Claudius and owned estates worth over 200 million cestresses. Trimalchio from Petronius' "The Satiricon" is an infamous example of a wealthy, boastful, and uneducated freedman, often despised for his vulgarity.

4. **Social Restrictions:** Freedmen were excluded from holding official posts, with the exception of those who officiated in the imperial cult as Augustalis. They faced social exclusion and were often shunned by respectable Romans in public.

5. **Legacy of Freedmen:** The children of freedmen, known as libertini, automatically became Roman citizens and could rise to high social statuses, including the equestrian order (knights) or even the senate. Many distinguished individuals, such as the poet Horace and the historian Tacitus, were descended from slaves.

6. **Choosing Roman Slavery:** If given the choice, one would likely prefer to be a slave in Rome rather than Greece due to the opportunities for manumission and the hope of gaining freedom and social advancement. The Romans recognized the value of their freedmen and the contributions they could make to society.

7. **Next Lecture:** The upcoming lecture will explore the lives of Roman soldiers, who formed an essential part of Rome's defense and expansion.

Checking The Other Side of History/25. Being a Roman Soldier.txt
1. **Military Life and Benefits**: The Roman Army offered significant benefits, including opportunities for domestic life through common-law marriages, known as hospitae or focariae. Soldiers could accompany their families on marches and had access to prostitutes. While there were restrictions, such as the prohibition against owning property in the province they served, these were not always strictly enforced, especially in the Western provinces.

2. **Marriage and Property Restrictions**: Until Emperor Septimius Ceueros, soldiers couldn't marry unless they were centurions. There was a prohibition against owning property in the province they were serving, but this was not consistently enforced.

3. **Financial Incentives**: Soldiers received low pay, called stipendium, which was supplemented by monetary gifts (donativum) from new emperors and upon their death. After 25 or 26 years of service, soldiers could retire with either a grant of land or a financial gratuity, or they might receive Roman citizenship if they were foreigners serving as auxiliaries.

4. **Retirement and Risks**: Retirement was only possible on alternate years due to high mortality rates and the constant risk of death in battle or from disease.

5. **Vindolanda Tablets**: These wood tablets provide valuable insights into the lives of Roman soldiers and their families, particularly those stationed in Britannia. They include administrative records as well as personal correspondence, such as a letter from Claudia Ceuhera to Sulpicia Lepidina, which is one of the earliest known examples of writing by a woman in Latin.

6. **Social Rank and Interaction**: The Vindolanda tablets show that even in military contexts, there were women of high social rank, like Claudia and Sulpicia, who maintained social connections and participated in events such as birthday celebrations.

7. **Next Lecture**: The next lecture will explore the roles and status of Roman women, particularly among the upper classes, highlighting their influence and the various outlets available for their talents and social engagements.

Checking The Other Side of History/26. Being a Roman Woman.txt
1. **Sipronia**: According to Salast, a Roman historian, Sipronia was a high-born woman from the 1st century BC who defied traditional gender roles. She was well-read in Greek and Latin literature, intellectually gifted, and socially influential. Salast describes her as being more assertive with men than they were with her and possessing both wit and charm. Although Salast views her negatively, associating her with prostitutes, he also acknowledges her appeal to men. Sipronia was not confined to the traditional female virtues of frugality, chastity, modesty, or devotion. She had political clout and was known for her intellectual and artistic talents.

2. **Clodia and Sir William**: Clodia, a contemporary of Sipronia and the subject of Catullus's poems, also defied traditional roles. Her relationship with Caesar indicates her political influence. Sir William, another contemporary, had an affair with Caesar and played a significant role in Roman politics despite being a woman.

3. **Women's Influence in Politics**: Despite not having the right to vote, women still influenced politics in Rome. Evidence from Pompeii shows that women endorsed political candidates and likely participated in rallies and canvassing.

4. **Eumarchia of Pompeii**: Eumarchia was a priestess of Venus, the most important goddess in Pompeii, and also a patroness of the Guild of Fullers. She came from a humble background but rose to prominence through her talents, energy, and wealth. Her story demonstrates that a woman with ambition could achieve significant social status and influence in Roman society, challenging traditional roles for women.

5. **General Observations**: The lives of Roman women are largely unknown due to the scarcity of their literary testimonies. It's difficult to gauge their personal feelings about their roles and experiences in society. However, the examples of Sipronia, Clodia, Sir William, and Eumarchia show that some women were able to transcend traditional expectations and exert considerable influence within the constraints of their era. In the next lecture, we will explore the lives of the urban poor, who faced even greater challenges and less agency within Roman society.

Checking The Other Side of History/27. Being a Poor Roman.txt
 In this lecture, we discussed the various ways in which the poor in Rome could find enjoyment and a sense of quality in life despite their modest circumstances. Despite not having the luxuries afforded by the wealthy, there were still many aspects of Roman society that allowed even the least fortunate citizens to experience some level of contentment.

1. **Public Entertainment**: The state provided entertainment such as gladiator fights and wild animal shows at the Colosseum, which were free for all citizens. Additionally, the Circus Maximus hosted chariot races where hundreds of thousands could watch for free.

2. **Bread Doles**: The distribution of free or subsidized bread, known as the "panis frumentarius," was a critical lifeline for the poor, especially during election times when politicians sought their votes with handouts.

3. **Public Spaces**: The bars in Rome served as communal spaces where the poor could seek refuge from the elements and engage in social activities. These establishments were affordable and provided a venue for leisure and relaxation.

4. **Social Mobility**: There was a chance, however slim, for individuals to improve their status or wealth through various means, such as through military service, inheritance, or the favor of powerful patrons.

5. **Philosophical Consideration**: Philosophers like Cicero, despite his wealth and status, did not focus on the plight of the poor in his writings. This reflects a broader disconnect between the elite and the common people.

6. **Dreams of Wealth**: The poor could find solace in dreams of sudden riches, imagining what their lives would be like if they were to become wealthy overnight.

7. **Social Reform**: Unlike Cicero, individuals like the Seventh Earl of Shaftesbury demonstrated concern for the welfare of the poor and sought to address societal issues.

In the next lecture, we will explore what it would have been like to be a wealthy Roman, examining how the rich lived, the luxuries they enjoyed, and how they were able to insulate themselves from the harsh realities faced by the urban poor.

Checking The Other Side of History/28. Being a Rich Roman.txt
 Today's lecture explored the opulent lifestyle of the wealthy elite in ancient Rome, focusing on the Villa of the Papyrus near Herculaneum as an exemplar of such luxury. We discussed the sophistication and education that a person like Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninos, Julius Caesar's father-in-law, would have enjoyed, including his patronage of Greek culture and philosophy. The Villa of the Papyrus contained an extensive library with over 1800 papyrus rolls, a large number of marble and bronze statues, indicating the owner's deep interest in Greek art and culture.

The lifestyle of the rich in Rome was markedly different from that of the average citizen. The elite enjoyed extravagant homes filled with art, participated in intellectual discussions, and hosted elaborate entertainments. These individuals were Phil Hellenes who appreciated and collected Greek art and engaged with Greek philosophy and literature.

Despite the allure of such a life, it's important to note that the opportunity for social and economic mobility among the common people was extremely limited. The chances of becoming seriously wealthy were slim, akin to winning the lottery. Yet, the dream of escaping one's humble beginnings was still very much alive.

In the next lecture, we will examine how some ordinary individuals could gain celebrity status and potentially change their fortunes in ancient Rome. This avenue provided a path for a few to rise above their circumstances and achieve renown, albeit not through wealth alone but through various forms of exceptional achievement or service to society.

Checking The Other Side of History/29. Being a Roman Celebrity.txt
 In this lecture, we explored the concept of celebrity culture in ancient Rome and discussed how it primarily favored men, with a few notable exceptions. We examined the lives of two extraordinary women who managed to achieve fame and influence: Cleopatra VII, the Queen of Egypt, and Theodora, the wife of Emperor Justinian.

Cleopatra was known for her intelligence, beauty, and ability to manipulate powerful men, such as Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, to advance her political and personal interests. Her story illustrates the power of a woman who knew how to market herself in a man's world.

Theodora, on the other hand, rose from a humble background as a mime artist to become an empress. Despite the scandal surrounding her performances, she proved to be a capable and influential partner to Justinian. Her rise to power demonstrates that even those who started in less than ideal circumstances could achieve high status if they were talented and ambitious enough.

Despite the presence of female artists and performers who gained recognition, the overall landscape of Roman society was still largely biased against women achieving celebrity status outside of certain fields, particularly those related to entertainment and performance. The lecture highlighted the limited opportunities for female talent in a world dominated by men and emphasized the need to recognize and value the contributions of women across all domains.

The lecture concluded with a teaser for the next topic of discussion, which would be the world of crime in ancient Rome, a field also primarily occupied by men, despite the involvement of some notable female figures.

Checking The Other Side of History/30. Being a Roman Criminal.txt
1. **Capital Punishment in Ancient Rome**: The Roman Empire had a variety of brutal execution methods, including being thrown off the Tarpeian Rock, crucifixion, drowning, or beheading. These punishments were often reserved for slaves, non-citizens, and those from lower social classes.

2. **Social Stigma**: For upper-class citizens, less severe penalties such as loss of civic rights, exile, and confiscation of property were more common. Being deprived of the right to vote (infamia) was a significant social stigma in Roman society.

3. **The Fate of Ovid**: The poet Ovid was banished to the shores of the Black Sea by Emperor Augustus, likely due to his controversial works and possibly an affair with Augustus's daughter Julia. His punishment was a form of living death, as he would be cut off from Roman society and surrounded by 'barbarians.'

4. **Julia's Exile**: Augustus's own daughter, Julia, was also banished to the small island of Pandateria for her adulterous affairs. The isolation and confinement she faced were severe, reflecting the social values and strict moral codes of Roman society.

5. **Criminality and Law Enforcement**: Despite the harsh penalties, the Roman Empire managed to avoid complete lawlessness due to the social desperation that might drive individuals to crime and the relatively effective methods of controlling crime at the time.

6. **Conclusion**: The severity of punishments in ancient Rome acted as a strong deterrent against criminal activity. The stark contrast between the wealthy elite and the lower classes, along with the allure of wealth, could tempt some into a life of crime. However, the risks of being caught were somewhat mitigated by the social structures and law enforcement practices of the time.

In the next lecture, we will explore how Romans relaxed and entertained themselves, including the various games, sports, and cultural activities they enjoyed.

Checking The Other Side of History/31. Relaxing Roman Style.txt
1. **Entertainment in Ancient Rome**: The lecture begins by discussing various forms of entertainment that were popular among Romans, including gladiatorial combats, chariot races, and public executions. These spectacles served as a form of escapism for the masses and were often linked to concepts of Roman virtues like duty and piety. However, Pliny the Younger expressed his disdain for such bloodthirsty entertainment.

2. **Gladiatorial Games**: Gladiators were often prisoners or slaves who fought in arenas for the amusement of spectators. These games were a significant aspect of Roman culture and were seen as a way to satisfy the masses, maintain social order, and display Roman power and control over conquered peoples.

3. **Chariot Races**: Chariot racing was another popular spectacle where drivers from four different stables‚Äîreds, whites, blues, and greens‚Äîcompeted in hippodromes across the Eastern provinces. These races were highly competitive and sometimes led to serious riots, as seen in Constantinople in A.D. 531.

4. **Leisure and Relaxation**: The lecture also touches on how the wealthy Romans enjoyed leisure and relaxation by visiting resorts close to their homes or owning private islands like Emperor Tiberius did in Capri. These retreats allowed them to escape the rigors of daily life and the intense public spectacles.

5. **Social Function of Entertainment**: The Roman sense of "grouchy task"‚Äîreferring to the fulfillment of social duties‚Äîwas balanced by the need for relaxation and enjoyment. The entertainment provided a means for the society as a whole to function, especially in keeping the large population satisfied, particularly with the peace and stability brought by the empire.

6. **Religion in the Roman Empire**: The lecture sets the stage for the next three lectures, which will explore various religious practices and beliefs within the Roman Empire, including polytheism and monotheism, and their impact on individual lives and societal norms.

In conclusion, while some of the Romans' entertainment seems barbaric by today's standards, it was a part of their culture and contributed to maintaining social order and the empire's dominance. The lecture emphasizes that the Roman sense of duty and piety had its counterbalance in the need for leisure and relaxation, which was no less important in ancient society than it is today.

Checking The Other Side of History/32. Practicing Roman Religion.txt
 In this lecture, we discussed the role of religion in ancient Rome and how it influenced political life, including the use of religious positions to gain favor, control elections, and wield power. We established that Roman polytheism held significance for its adherents, as evidenced by its enduring presence even after Christianity's rise. The Romans were generally tolerant of foreign religions, allowing people under their rule to maintain their own beliefs and practices, so long as they showed some form of respect for the native Roman gods and did not engage in human sacrifice, like the British Druids.

From the late 1st century BC onwards, there was an expectation that individuals, regardless of their cultural background, acknowledge the divinity of the Roman Emperor, a practice influenced by Eastern traditions that revered kings as gods. This emperor worship was a way for the ruler to assert their authority and divine status, which many Romans accepted, especially after the tumultuous period of civil war ended with Augustus' establishment of peace and order.

However, there were exceptions to this tolerance, most notably among the Jewish people, who refused to acknowledge any deity other than their own God and therefore could not comply with the Roman expectation to venerate the emperor. This led to significant tensions between the Jewish community and Roman authorities, setting the stage for future conflicts.

In the next lecture, we will explore what it meant to be Jewish in the Roman Empire, including the challenges and conflicts that arose from differing religious beliefs and practices.

Checking The Other Side of History/33. Being Jewish under Roman Rule.txt
1. The fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 was a pivotal event for the Jewish people, resulting in the destruction of the Second Temple and the end of Judean autonomy under Roman rule.

2. After the Roman siege and the subsequent sacking of the city, Jews who escaped were forced to flee as refugees, beginning the second diaspora. Many perished along the way due to hardships and dangers from predators and the Romans themselves.

3. Despite the loss and trauma, Jewish faith remained strong. The memory of the Temple's destruction and the hope of return would be a defining aspect of Jewish identity for centuries.

4. The Western or Wailing Wall in Jerusalem is a remnant of the Second Temple and serves as a symbol of the enduring connection to the site for Jewish people.

5. The fortress of Masada, which fell six years after the destruction of the Second Temple, became a nationalist emblem of resistance and freedom, especially after its dramatic archaeological discovery in the 20th century.

6. The Roman response to the Jewish revolt was brutal and massive, with significant loss of life and prisoners taken. The scale of the military operation demonstrated the might of Rome but also its determination to suppress any challenge to its authority.

7. Jewish identity during this period was diverse, with different communities and sects experiencing Roman rule in various ways. This diversity would continue to evolve and adapt over time.

8. In the next lecture, we will explore the experiences of another marginalized group within the Roman Empire, the early Christians, who also struggled with their place within the dominant culture and polytheistic religious landscape.

Checking The Other Side of History/34. Being Christian under Roman Rule.txt
1. **Decius' Persecution (249-250):** The emperor Decius issued a D.A. imperie, a general supplication to the gods and an oath, to ensure the safety and victory of the state. This led to a persecution of Christians throughout the empire. Most Christians complied with the decree, but the few who became martyrs played a crucial role in maintaining the faith's integrity.

2. **Valerian's Persecution (257-258):** Under Emperor Valerian, another persecution of Christians occurred due to military defeats and perceived threats to Rome's security.

3. **Diocletian's Persecution (302-3, 304):** The most severe persecution of Christians was initiated by Emperor Diocletian in 304, with an edict sanctioning the killing of Christians who refused to sacrifice to the gods. This edict failed because public opinion had shifted, and a majority of non-Christians were no longer willing to support such extreme measures against their fellow citizens.

4. **Toleration Edict (311):** The edict of toleration was issued by the dying Emperor Galerius, ending the persecution of Christians.

5. **Adaptation of Christianity:** Early Christians often held onto pagan beliefs and practices while converting to Christianity. They chose key Christian feasts, like Christmas, close to existing pagan festivals to ease the transition. This also involved repurposing pagan sites into Christian churches, which helped maintain a sense of continuity with the past.

6. **Inclusive Community:** Christianity introduced a novel concept where community was based on faith rather than wealth or nobility. It emphasized the inclusion of all, including the sick, poor, and sinners, as beloved by God, marking a significant shift from previous societal norms that judged individuals based on their social status.

7. **Britain's Pagan Practices:** In contrast to the Mediterranean, where Christianity was spreading and reshaping existing beliefs, Britain and many other parts of Europe continued with pagan practices, including human sacrifice, well into the historical period. This highlights the diverse paths that different regions took in their religious evolution.

In the next section, we'll explore how Christianity eventually spread to Britain and the eventual end of its indigenous pagan practices.

Checking The Other Side of History/35. Being a Celt in Ancient Britain.txt
 The Celts were a diverse group of peoples who inhabited much of Europe and parts of Asia during the Iron Age. They were skilled warriors, using war chariots and their martial prowess to expand across the Mediterranean, establishing settlements as far as Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and even into Russia, Poland, and the Ukraine. Their religion was polytheistic, with a multitude of spirits associated with natural elements like rivers, hills, and groves. Priests known as Druids attended to these gods and were also responsible for legal matters and judgments. Despite their influence, only a handful of Celtic words have been absorbed into the English language, but their impact on the British Isles' genetic makeup and linguistic structure is significant. The Celts practiced human sacrifice, as evidenced by archaeological finds such as Lindow Man, who was found with signs of a violent death likely due to ritual killing. Although the Druids were banned by the Romans upon their conquest of Britain, Celtic influence persisted and even helped preserve Roman culture after the withdrawal of the Roman legions. In our next lecture, we will explore how the Celts responded to the first of many invasions of their lands, which in this case was carried out by the Romans. Additionally, the Celts played a crucial role in the spread of Christianity and classical learning in later historical periods.

Checking The Other Side of History/36. Being a Roman Briton.txt
 The lecture provided an overview of how Britons might have felt as they witnessed the gradual decline and eventual departure of the Roman Empire from Britain. Initially, under Roman rule for 365 years, the Britons enjoyed a period of peace, infrastructure development like roads and cities, cultural advancements, and the adoption of Roman laws and customs. The Romans introduced important elements of civilization, such as writing, which was evident in various forms of inscriptions across Britain.

As the Empire weakened in the late 3rd century AD, the Romans took defensive measures by building forts along the southeast and northeast coasts to protect against Germanic tribes like the Saxons, Angles, and others who were advancing across Europe. This was a clear sign that Britain was considered an outlying and vulnerable part of the Roman world.

The withdrawal of Roman troops began in the late 3rd century as more pressing issues arose within the Empire. Although initially presented as temporary measures to maintain order, it became apparent that the Romans were not returning. This led to a sense of relief for some, but also anxiety and concern about what the future held without the Romans' military presence, law enforcement, and economic stability.

As the Roman administration withdrew completely by 410 AD, Britain faced an uncertain future. The economy began to decline, and with no central authority or army, local populations turned to burying their valuables as a desperate measure of protection. This period set the stage for the eventual arrival of the Angles, Saxons, and other Germanic tribes, who would go on to establish what is known as the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy, marking a new chapter in British history. The next lecture will explore the immediate post-Roman period leading up to these invasions.

Checking The Other Side of History/37. Being Anglo-Saxon.txt
1. **Conversion to Christianity**: The spread of Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England was often initiated by kings, who were influential in leading their subjects to adopt the new faith. Political reasons frequently motivated these conversions, and the process was usually top-down.

2. **Impact of Christianity**: The introduction of Christianity had a profound impact on the daily lives of ordinary people, with the church becoming a significant force in society. It influenced laws, prohibiting adultery and incest, and shifted cultural values towards prayer, renunciation, humility, forgiveness, and obedience.

3. **Christian Missionaries**: The missionaries who brought Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England were often exceptional individuals with persuasive skills and a resilient determination, willing to face hostility from warrior cultures.

4. **Monastic Life**: Monks and nuns played crucial roles in early medieval society, living lives of prayer and manual labor, protecting only their faith in a violent world. They were responsible for producing intricate manuscripts like the Lindisfarne Gospels, which required significant resources and time to create.

5. **Preservation of Classical Learning**: Monasteries preserved Latin learning, essential for religious texts as well as for secular knowledge, and they fostered the survival of Greek and Roman culture. Over time, an Anglo-Saxon literary tradition developed, with Beowulf being a prime example.

6. **Legacy**: The Anglo-Saxon period left a lasting legacy, including illuminated manuscripts, outstanding metalwork, the foundation of English laws, and the unification of Britain. Perhaps most importantly, it gave rise to the English language, which has become a global lingua franca.

7. **Transition to the Viking Age**: The next phase in the history of England would be marked by the influence of the Vikings, who settled in parts of the country and left their own indelible mark on its culture and governance. This transition will be explored in the following lecture.

Checking The Other Side of History/38. Being a Viking Raider.txt
1. **Christianization**: The Scandinavian countries, including Norway and Sweden, were among the last regions of Europe to convert to Christianity, with the process taking place over several centuries after the 8th century AD. There is evidence of a blended belief system in Viking graves, where symbols of both pagan deity Votan and Christianity were found.

2. **Burial Practices**: The typical Viking burial involved placing the body in an unburned ship, covered by a mound, similar to Anglo-Saxon practices. A notable example is the Osberg Ship Burial from Norway around 830 AD, which included two women and at least 14 horses, among other offerings. The purpose of these burials was likely to honor the deceased and provide for their needs in the afterlife.

3. **Viking Influence in Britain**: Despite the fearsome reputation of the Vikings as invaders, they never established a dominant presence in Britain outside of a few specific areas, such as York (Jorvik) and parts of the Midlands. The Viking invasions, however, did lead to the unification of England under a single ruler, albeit a Viking one‚ÄîKnut the Great.

4. **Normandy**: The Vikings who settled in northern France became known as Normans. They struck a deal with the Carolingian rulers to govern the region on their behalf, eventually adopting the French language and culture. This settlement marked a transition from raiders to settlers and rulers within the wider Frankish/French political landscape.

5. **Future Lecture**: The next lecture will explore the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, led by Duke William II of Normandy, and its impact on English society, politics, and culture.

Checking The Other Side of History/39. Living under Norman Rule.txt
1. The Norman Conquest in 1066 significantly altered the landscape of England, with William the Conqueror defeating the Anglo-Saxons and establishing Norman rule.
2. The Normans, a French Viking tribe, brought their own architectural styles, demonstrating their intention to permanently settle in England through impressive constructions like castles and churches.
3. Initially, relations between the English and the Normans were tense, with William I expecting the English to accept his rule as the rightful heir. However, the Anglo-Saxons lost land and faced brutal suppression of uprisings.
4. Over time, the Normans became more assimilated into English society, leading to a peaceful coexistence where the two races blended into one over a century. The English language prevailed, while the Normans retained their French heritage and influence at court.
5. England's geographical position as an island off the continent influenced its interactions with Europe, particularly with France, Italy, and Germany.
6. The Norman Conquest marked a shift in England's cultural and institutional ties, moving away from Scandinavia to the European mainland.
7. In the next eight lectures, we will explore medieval England, focusing on the late middle ages during the 14th century, examining the lives of both the wealthy and the poor, the role of religion, daily life, and the concept of chivalry as embodied by the knights.
8. The Norman Conquest had a profound impact on English society, leading to cultural integration and setting the stage for centuries of interaction with the continent.

Checking The Other Side of History/40. Being Medieval.txt
1. **Lingua Franca**: Latin was once the common language for education and governance across Europe, but over time, European vernacular languages like English, Spanish, and Italian became more prevalent due to a push from below, supported by figures like Dante Alighieri and literature in the native tongues such as William Langland's "Piers Plowman."

2. **Literary Renaissance**: The rise of the vernacular languages was facilitated by the emergence of world-class literature written in those languages, which helped solidify their importance and use.

3. **Anti-Jewish Sentiment**: Anti-Semitism emerged in England around 1144 with the Norwich blood libel accusation. Jews were often moneylenders due to restrictions on their participation in other trades, leading to resentment and false accusations, such as the one in York in 1190, which resulted in a massacre and later, in 1290, the expulsion of Jews from England by King Edward I.

4. **Crusades**: The concept of crusades as holy wars against Islam was born during this period, reflecting the East-West divide and shaping Western perceptions of the 'other.' This idea has persisted over centuries with remarkable adaptability.

5. **Economic Divide**: The economic divide between rich and poor was stark in the Middle Ages, and it had lasting effects that extended even beyond death, influencing social structures and relationships throughout society. In the next lecture, we will explore this divide further and its impact on medieval life.

Checking The Other Side of History/41. Being Poor in the Middle Ages.txt
1. **Solar to Private Chamber**: The lecture begins by describing the layout of a typical medieval castle, emphasizing the solar (sunning room) as the private living space for the lord and lady. Adjacent to the solar is a small private chamber, which serves as a retreat for prayer, reading, or solitude away from the bustling castle life.

2. **Privacy and Poverty**: The Middle Ages did not place a high emphasis on privacy as we do today. The poor, in particular, had little to no personal space, and even after death, their bodies were often buried in crowded cemeteries or disinterred to make way for new burials.

3. **Dungeon and Purgatory**: If one fell out of favor with the lord or was captured, they might end up in a dungeon‚Äîa dark, smelly, and oppressive place. The concept of Purgatory also loomed large, where souls underwent purification before entering heaven.

4. **Afterlife for the Poor**: The poor were often buried outside churches or in charnel houses due to space constraints. Their graves might be reused after a short time, and their remains could even be disturbed by grave diggers seeking space for new burials.

5. **Attitude of the Church Towards Poverty**: Despite Christ's teachings on the difficulties of the rich entering heaven, the church often condemned extreme poverty as heretical, especially after the Franciscans took their vows of poverty to an extreme that was seen as a threat to the church's wealth.

6. **Saint Francis and Chivalry**: Saint Francis of Assisi, a major religious figure, advocated for the poor and lived a life of self-denial and service to his "lady," the Blessed Virgin Mary. His influence was significant, yet the church ultimately clashed with the Franciscans who took his teachings too literally.

7. **Life of Medieval Women**: The lecture concludes by hinting at a future exploration of the lives of medieval women across various social and economic strata, highlighting the limited choices available to them.

In summary, the medieval castle was both a place of power for the lord and lady and a microcosm of the social hierarchy, with the poor having little to no personal space or privacy in life or death. The church's stance on poverty was complex, and while it acknowledged the teachings of Christ on the subject, it also worked to maintain its own wealth and influence, often at odds with the ideals of saintly figures like Saint Francis. The lives of medieval women will be the focus of the next part of our exploration of medieval life.

1. **Clothing**: In the Middle Ages, both men and women dressed modestly. Women were expected to cover their heads, arms, and legs to maintain propriety. Wealthy women adorned themselves with expensive jewelry to showcase their status.

2. **Women's Role in Absence of Male Relatives**: When husbands or sons went off to war, such as on crusades, women often took charge at home, commanding respect and sometimes wielding significant power. This was the case for Eleanor of Aquitaine.

3. **Courtly Love**: The concept of courtly love emerged during this period, where a man would be devoted to an unattainable woman, often his lord or lady. This phenomenon was an expression of emotional attachment that superseded physical desire and influenced the upper classes.

4. **Social Dynamics**: While courtly love idealized women, it also reinforced the idea that women were to be admired but not physically possessed. Meanwhile, lower-class men might emulate their social betters by courting local women with a courtly demeanor.

5. **Reality vs. Ideal**: Despite the ideals of courtly love, there was still a reality where many medieval people engaged in more casual relationships outside of marriage. The Church's influence often oppressed women and reinforced their subordinate status in society.

6. **Overall Assessment**: Being a medieval woman could be challenging, with limited autonomy and frequent marital oppression, but there were also instances where women held significant power and influence, especially in the absence of male relatives. The Church played a significant role in shaping societal views on women, often devaluing them.

 In this lecture, we explored the concept of heresy during the Middle Ages and the severe measures taken by the Catholic Church to combat it. Heresy comes from the Greek word "hyracis," meaning choice, and referred to any belief that was at odds with official Catholic doctrine. The church viewed heretics as a threat akin to a disease that needed to be eradicated, which often led to harsh interrogations, tortures, and even executions by burning at the stake.

One notable heretical movement was Lollardy, which emerged in the mid-14th century and was led by John Wycliffe, an Oxford theologian. Wycliffe and his followers, known as Lollards, challenged the church's authority, advocating for a direct relationship with God for laypeople, the translation of the Bible into English, the possibility of women as religious teachers, opposition to chantries, and various other beliefs that were considered heretical by the church.

Despite Wycliffe's death in 1384 being peaceful, the church's animosity towards his teachings persisted. In 1428, his remains were exhumed and burned as an act of formal condemnation. The lecture highlighted the immense influence and control the medieval church had over religious beliefs and practices, and how it used this power to maintain orthodoxy and enforce its will upon society.

In the next lecture, we will delve into how the church leveraged its influence to mobilize the faithful for warfare under the banner of Christianity, a topic that further illustrates the complex interplay between religion, power, and conflict in medieval Europe.

1. **Courtesy as a Virtue**: In the Middle Ages, courtesy was a virtue associated with being civilized and moral, particularly among men, who were expected to uphold the Code of Chivalry. This code emphasized the protection of women, widows, orphans, the sick, the weak, and those who worked on the land.

2. **Knighthood**: The Order of Chivalry outlined the expectations of knights, but in practice, these ideals were not always followed. Some knights abused their power, mistreated the vulnerable, and acted brutally towards their enemies, sometimes even to the extent of committing atrocities like eating enemy bodies.

3. **Decline of Knighthood**: The ranks of knights declined over time due to various factors, including the rise of the common soldier equipped with the longbow. The longbow proved to be a more effective weapon than the crossbow, which required a more laborious method to reload and allowed for fewer shots per minute.

4. **The Battle of Cressy (1346)**: This was one of the first battles where the effectiveness of the English longbowmen was demonstrated. In just five minutes, they released an estimated 5000 arrows, causing significant casualties among the French knights armed with crossbows.

5. **Impact on Chivalry**: The dominance of the longbow signaled the end of the age of chivalry and the rise of the common soldier in battle. This shift marked a significant change in military tactics and the social order.

6. **Assessment of Knighthood**: While knighthood had its negative aspects, it also embodied ideals that were noble and commendable. The impact of knights on history is complex, with both positive and negative contributions, and perspectives from those who relied on them for protection and from those considered "infidels" by the Crusaders would provide a more complete picture.

7. **Crusades**: The next lecture will delve into the Crusades, where European knights sought to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim control, which had significant consequences for both Christianity and Islam.

1291. The Crusades were complex events that involved more than just conflicts between Christians and Muslims. They also saw Christians fighting against other Christian denominations, as evidenced by the Schism of 1054 between the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox churches. The Crusades led to significant violence, including the infamous sacking of Constantinople in 1204 by crusaders who had passed through the Byzantine Empire on their way to the Holy Land. Additionally, the Albigensian Crusade of 1209 targeted Cathars in Languedoc, resulting in widespread bloodshed.

The financing of the Crusades was a collective effort, with ordinary people and the wealthy contributing, as well as the Church itself, which had to raise funds through taxes and other means. The Third Crusade in 1189 even introduced an early form of income tax to fund the campaign.

The Crusades were deeply influenced by the belief that one's God was the only true God, leading to a justification for killing in the name of faith. This created a demonization of the 'other' and fostered a deep-seated fear between cultures. Despite the violence and conflict, there were positive outcomes, such as the transmission of Arabic translations of ancient Greek and Arab learning to the Western world, which greatly enriched European culture.

In conclusion, the Crusades were not only about military conquest but also about spreading Christian influence and spirituality. They left a calamitous legacy that has shaped intercultural relations for centuries. The next lecture will explore figures who sought to promote peace and spiritual understanding through pilgrimages to holy sites.

Checking The Other Side of History/46. Being a Pilgrim.txt
1. **The Pilgrimage Experience**: In the Middle Ages, undertaking a pilgrimage was a common way for individuals to fulfill religious obligations, seek spiritual renewal, or atone for sins. The journey often involved significant risks and hardships.
   
2. **Voyage to Jerusalem**: Traveling by ship to the Holy Land meant cramped, unsanitary, and potentially dangerous conditions. Passengers endured long, monotonous journeys with limited privacy, few amenities, and the constant threat of illness from unsanitary living conditions. The voyage was physically and mentally taxing.

3. **Upon Arrival**: Once in Jerusalem, pilgrims faced crowded and chaotic environments, especially during festivals like Christmas and Easter. They stood in long lines to visit holy sites, often competing with other pilgrims for access.

4. **Dangers and Challenges**: The journey could be life-threatening, as evidenced by historical events such as the 2006 Hajj tragedy. Women were particularly vulnerable to physical abuse or threats thereof, and privacy was scarce for all. The harsh conditions tested both mental and physical endurance but were seen as integral to the spiritual experience.

5. **Returning Home**: After the pilgrimage, individuals returned home with new experiences that could have a profound impact on their lives, potentially leading some to join religious orders.

6. **Spiritual Value**: Despite the hardships, the spiritual benefits of a pilgrimage were considered worth the sacrifice. It was a way to cleanse the soul and often left a lasting impression on the pilgrim's life.

7. **Conclusion and Next Lecture**: The lecture concludes by highlighting the significant personal costs of medieval pilgrimages but emphasizes their value in spiritual terms. In the next lecture, we will explore other forms of leisure and entertainment from the Middle Ages, acknowledging that even these could carry risks and implications for one's soul.

1. **Mystery Plays**: The term "mystery plays" for the dramatic performances in England during the Middle Ages might stem from their subject matter, which often included miracles or "mysteries." However, there's another genre specifically called "mystery plays," and "miracle plays" as well. Scholars suggest that the name could also refer to the craftspeople‚Äîorganized in guilds‚Äîwho were responsible for staging these plays, as they were a significant part of society, regulating trades and showcasing their work through performances.

2. **Cycle of Plays**: The most famous example of such plays is the cycle from York, which consisted of 48 plays covering stories from creation to the last judgment. These plays were performed annually at Corpus Christi, a feast celebrating the Eucharist, and were intended to reinforce faith among the community.

3. **Performance Format**: The plays were not performed on stages but rather in carts or wagons that moved through the streets, allowing performances to be witnessed by people across different neighborhoods. Actors interacted directly with the audience, which often included friends and neighbors of the performers, fostering a lively and communal atmosphere.

4. **Interactive and Raucous**: Despite their religious themes, these plays were not solemn events; they were social occasions that encouraged audience participation, featured banter between actors, and were surrounded by eating, drinking, and merrymaking.

5. **Social Significance**: The guilds, which organized the plays, were integral to medieval society, ensuring fair working conditions and business control for their members. The mystery plays thus served a unifying role within the community, involving a large number of people from different crafts.

6. **Historical Context**: The Middle Ages were not just a time of hardship and gloom. There were many forms of entertainment and distraction, and the mystery plays were an important cultural event that provided both religious edification and communal enjoyment.

In the final lecture of the course, we will reflect on the human experiences and interactions depicted in these plays and consider what connects us to our distant ancestors and how we have evolved from them up to today. The conclusion will likely explore the ways in which human activities and societal roles both link us across time and create divisions within societies.
