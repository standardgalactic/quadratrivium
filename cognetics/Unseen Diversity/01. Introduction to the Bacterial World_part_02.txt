We are multicellular.
That's how we got to be so large.
We are highly morphological.
We have shapes.
We have structures, and we appreciate shapes and structures in other organisms.
We are visually oriented.
We can see color.
We look around for other organisms that have morphologies, shapes, and colors.
We also look around for other organisms that have activity levels and types of activities that are identifiable in some way to us or interpretable.
Whether we're right or wrong about that, we're looking for other organisms that seem to be in our same world.
Therefore, we're wonderful at looking at birds and insects and mammals, other mammals.
We have a great deal of difficulty with things that are much tinier than ourselves.
We are terrestrial.
We live on land, not any old land.
We live on the surface of the land, and we tend to live in relatively temperate to tropical climates.
And that does not get acknowledged enough, I think.
Most of the world is aquatic.
Most of the world is oceans.
Most of the world is watery and deep.
And that's not our place on Earth.
We actually don't know much about the depths of the ocean, except in submersible submarines that some researchers have taken down to the depths,
except perhaps from dredgings that have been hauled up from the depths or nettings that have been hauled up.
But for the most part, we're terrestrial surface dwellers, very small part of the Earth's surface.
