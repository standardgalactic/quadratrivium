and and and really bringing a lot of antibiotics to market which made the whole 20th century
relatively good point to be getting bacterial infection if you are unfortunate enough to
do so because the chances are you would be cured of it with an antibiotic so it was all very good
news for medicine it's an interesting little side problem though with antibiotics and that is
this is not any old kind of competition going on it's a little bit like the kind of escalation
that goes on with weapons in warfare so just as quickly as organisms produce antibiotics of various
sorts and variations on those antibiotics just as quickly it seems to occur that other organisms
become resistant to those antibiotics it makes some sense if the competition for scarce nutrients
and soil is is that much of a competition it makes a lot of sense that you would be both
making antibiotics and making anti antibiotics and so that is the case and any environment in
which there are a lot of antibiotics already present is a great environment for organisms
to be antibiotic resistant makes a lot of sense sounds even a little bit circular but I'm going
to elaborate a little bit more on it in a bit because it's not just circular it's actually
a very important point about our own use of antibiotics before I go to that though recall
what I have said about horizontal transfer of DNA and how prolific bacteria are in this process
how promiscuous they are how DNA is exchanged from one to another across so-called species
boundaries so that the family tree of bacteria is just one interacting network of exchanges
by some depictions one type of DNA that gets exchanged and readily used especially if the
environment is full of antibiotics is the the genes that confer resistance to antibiotics okay
the genes that confer anti antibiotic activity maybe as a way to think about it
and again I'm going to make my my circular reasoning point again this is only the case
in environments that have antibiotics in them there's no particular advantage in having an
antibiotic or resistance to antibiotics in an environment that lacks antibiotics okay why am
I making that point well let me give you a short list of environments that are full of
antibiotics so you can see what the problem is soils have antibiotics but not all through them
they're very locally and specifically produced okay so even though soils are a marvelous place
to look for antibiotics I wouldn't look for huge quantities of them in a bucket of soil
I'd look at very localized areas where very specific microorganisms were competing with
very specific other microorganisms so very local very specific interactions with antibiotics
and therefore very local and very specific use of resistance to antibiotics makes a lot of sense
here comes some of the bad news though hospitals are a wonderful place to find antibiotic resistant
bacteria because hospitals are full of antibiotics and these antibiotic resistant bacteria really
aren't going to be found in many other places except for those where antibiotics are in heavy
use our own bodies when we are in the midst of a treatment with antibiotics for some disease are
also unfortunately good places to find bacteria that are hanging on to bits of DNA that confer
