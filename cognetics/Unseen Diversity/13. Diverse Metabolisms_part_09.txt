there's no remnant of any kind of dangerous form of oxygen left there it's a completely
benign oxygen attached to two hydrogens at this point the cell can use it or it can diffuse away
easily and we keep the assembly line moving we keep those electrons being used that's how come
we're using oxygen and that's what the sulfate reducers by the way are doing with their sulfate
they're using it at the end of an assembly line to nab up those extra electrons that we're not
being used otherwise and making a product that is then going to be whisked away we hope
now it turns out that this kind of oxygen using heterotrophy is extremely efficient it's a wonderful
way to get every last bit of energy possible out of a big sugar molecule so it turns out that the
bigger you get the more complicated you get the more you get completely dependent on that energy
so I'm going to bring us full circle to who we are we are we are enormous organisms multicellular
wonderfully complex with big brains by the way that use up an enormous amount of sugar and oxygen
and we cannot live more than six minutes without oxygen so it's obviously very essential it's thanks
to our original bacteria that we acquired two and a half billion years ago that can do this amazing
kind of metabolism that is so efficient that we're allowed to be as big as we are and why
it's not optional anymore for us there are plenty of tiny organisms for which this particular kind
of metabolism is optional in other words some days if they've got oxygen they'll do the assembly
line efficiently other days if there's no oxygen the assembly line will get a little backed up
and it doesn't make much of a difference they're tiny organisms and they're not doing a whole lot
but we have we now have an obligate relationship with the bacteria that we're carrying around
the mitochondria to do this particular kind of metabolism and to have an abundance of oxygen
so that concludes the the major part of this course and in in the next concluding lecture
I'd like to do a little recapping of some major topics and also maybe to introduce some ideas
for what I call future directions with this whole topic of bacteria and I also want to
especially remind you that a goal for me in this course and it's also a personal goal of my own
is to incorporate more and more of an understanding of bacteria in my own nature studies and
and I'm hoping that I've left you with some ideas about doing that as well
this ends lecture 13
you
