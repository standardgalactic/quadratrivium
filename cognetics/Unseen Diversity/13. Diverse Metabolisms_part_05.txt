h2s and water h2o now we've just completed a little sulfur cycle and that's one of the wonderful
things about these these little sulfur rich communities as they're handing sulfur around
to each other as though it were valuable because it is but the other thing to notice is that there's
a big oxygen right in the middle of sulfate so just as we're using oxygen for something that we
haven't described yet these sulfate reducers are using SO4 there they've got some oxygen in there
too so something is going on with oxygen with this type of metabolism something that needs
explaining and something that will be explained first though let me tell you about a different
type of autotrophy that can be observed here and then i'll then i'll go back to the whole oxygen
question which is is is somewhat complicated there's yet another type of metabolism going on
in in this microbial math that we've been describing we've had the cyanobacteria we've had the purple
sulfur bacteria the green sulfur bacteria we've had the sulfate reducing heterotrophs
and we have one final type of metabolism that can be highly visible in such an environment
we're back up onto the surface and we're looking at scums and slimes something cobwebby in some
cases almost as though a cobweb has been draped over things a little bit of white bacteria that can
sometimes be on the surface of the cyanobacteria some kind times can be on the surface of some
black sediment that's become exposed so look for it almost everywhere that you're looking as you're
looking around for these other bacteria in any kind of creamy or bright white color that looks
slimy or scummy or cobwebby what you're looking at there is a wonderful group of bacteria called the
sulfur oxidizers and what's really exciting about them is that these are among the chemo
autotrophs which i alluded to previously these are the organisms that can make their own sugar
using nothing more than the bonds in chemicals and it's an amazing thing to do because it means
they can live in total blackness and yet still make sugar and that has some interesting connotations
that i'm that i'm going to get to in just a moment but first let me describe what their
metabolism is and compare it and contrast it to the metabolisms that we've already been talking
about let's say that we work to compare and contrast them with purple sulfur bacteria so purple
sulfur bacteria are taking hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide using the energy of the sun
to make sugars and to release sulfur and sulfate uh as as wastes what sulfur oxidizers are doing
is they're taking hydrogen sulfide using the bonds that are holding together the hydrogen
sulfide because there are chemical bonds holding it together not many but there are some taking
those bonds that are holding the hydrogen sulfide together taking that energy from those bonds
taking carbon dioxide and amazingly making sugar it really is amazing amazingly making sugar
no sunlight needed whatsoever and as a waste product making sulfur and by the way that's why
they look so creamy white they actually store their sulfur waste for a while so you're actually
seeing the bright creamy white of what elemental sulfur can look like when it's being stored in
a tiny bacterium and that's that's what gives them their color absolutely no photosynthetic pigments
