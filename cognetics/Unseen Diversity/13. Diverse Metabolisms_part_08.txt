that have incorporated oxygen into their metabolism clearly we need oxygen if you try to hold your
breath and and not use any oxygen for six minutes you'll find yourself in some great
difficulties so clearly oxygen is doing something essential but what if you look at the simple
equation it does not seem to be doing much of anything so let me evoke an image for you
that might help to explain in a sort of a visual way why oxygen is so important to us
and then let me connect that up with us being such enormous anomalous organisms it's all
going to be connected up as is a sort of a conclusion to this lecture imagine an assembly line
because that actually is what metabolism ends up looking like we've been skipping over the
actual nitty gritty of each and every chemical reaction that has to occur but but but imagine
that those that set of chemical reactions has the look of an assembly line so that some
product is starting at the beginning and is being converted and converted and converted
and converted all the way down the length of the assembly line till we get some waste something
that's going to be taken away as a waste product okay and that's typical metabolism for any organism
in the exact reactions that are going on in that assembly line I'm not going to go into descriptions
about I'm going to say though that that assembly line is going to work most efficiently if we
keep it moving that's obvious that would be true for a factory assembly line too and in fact imagine
a factory assembly line in which something is going wrong and the assembly line is being stopped in
one place or another such that the product is not being moved along that's the kind of problem I'm
talking about and that finally the ultimate problem that can occur in an assembly line
is that whatever it is that's coming out the other end is not whisked away or taken away
efficiently and again if you want to imagine a factory assembly line imagine that it's whatever
product coming out the other end is not being boxed up and hauled away and you're getting a
pile and then you're getting a larger pile and then you're getting an enormous pile and by and by
you've actually stopped the progress of the assembly line so here at last is what's going on with
oxygen and what's going on with oxygen is that we have cleverly cleverly deep in our evolutionary
roots used it both to detoxify it and to keep our metabolism rolling along in the assembly line
okay watch what we do let's say that a major thing coming down the assembly line is electrons
and you just need to trust me on that because I'm not going to get into the chemical equations that
will you know completely clinch that but let's say it's a whole bunch of electrons coming down the
assembly line at the end I need to take away a certain number of electrons and what we essentially
do is we take some oxygen we take some hydrogen we take a few of those extra electrons that are
coming down the line and we tack it all together and make water remember water is H2O so I've just
got that oxygen I've got some extra electrons that I'm going to take away from the end of the assembly
line and I've got hydrogen and we're going to build myself an H2O I'm going to build myself a water
out of that what's wonderful about water it is completely untoxic in fact it's even beneficial
