few huge surprises um about one third of the human genome is viral one third of the human
genome is viral there are three billion bases three billion A's C's G's and T's about one billion
our viral DNA's and we're not sick of viruses we are not sick these this is normal human beings
that I'm talking about so when I say that the vast majority of viruses are not pathogens
that's what I'm talking about that's that's just an example from humans I could do the same thing
for fungal genomes I could do the same thing for plant genomes I could do the same thing for
protist or protozoan genomes I could do the same thing for bacterial genomes bacteria have viruses
too okay now what about the rest of our genome what about the rest of those two billion bases of
DNA about half of our genome half okay and by the way we're not going to leave much more for genes
here about half the genome is something called jumping genes also called transposons and these
are little segments of DNA again recognizable by computer programs so we're cruising along the A's
C's G's and T's and we come across these jumping genes and they also have their own particular
sequences that make them recognizable and they can jump in and out of place that's why they're
called jumping genes or transposons in and out of place and move around in our genome and some of
those look like they might be of viral origin so it may be that there are more than one third of
our genome is made up of viruses it depends on how we end up defining some of these jumping genes
so if we've got a third of the genome as viruses and a half of the genome was jumping genes
what does that leave us with it leaves us with less than 10 percent of the space being used for
our own genes so all those three billion bases and we're only using less than 10 percent of the
space for our own genes and we only have about 30,000 genes of our own that's far far fewer than the
number of viruses that we're carrying we're our load of of of DNA is mostly viruses and jumping
genes what does all that mean I don't know I mean this is one of the really exciting frontiers of
biology right now is trying to understand what it means that we're hauling around such a huge
lot of DNA that has nothing to do with actually coding for genes so here's a way to think about
viruses that are pathogens think of a continuum or a spectrum where the extreme left side of the
spectrum are beneficial organisms beneficial bacteria beneficial in this case viruses okay
think of the middle of the spectrum as being an area for benign relationships could be benign
bacteria could be benign viruses and it'll be viruses in this case and then think of the extreme
right side of the spectrum as being organisms that are in disharmony and out of synchrony or
viruses that are in disharmony or out of synchrony these will be our pathogenic viruses or our
pathogenic bacteria so this spectrum works for bacteria and it works for viruses okay now over
on the left side where we have the beneficial viruses and the benign viruses the ones that
we're hauling around with us I would like to go so far as to say they are us that's who we are just
as we are a load of bacteria we are also a load of viruses and most of our viruses are benign
there are even some that are being discovered to be beneficial so it's a whole new frontier of
virology is understanding our viruses that we're hauling around with us and then way over on the
