right hand side are a few pathogens that are out of synchrony and disharmony is with us
and one of the reasons that viruses have become described as almost one and the same as pathogens
so that typically when you say virus to a person they'll think immediately pathogen has to do with
the way we study viruses or the way they have been traditionally studied and just for a moment I
want to take you back to Koch's postulate this is from several lectures ago I was talking about
the history of microbiology and I said one of the real achievements in the late 19th century
was that Dr. Koch of Germany came up with a set of procedures for determining whether or not
a bacterium is pathogenic and those procedures proceeded through looking for the bacteria in
the disease tissue getting the bacteria out onto a petri dish then getting the bacteria back into
an experimental organism to see if the disease was caused by the bacteria etc and in the important
thing about Koch's postulate the important thing about that procedure was that it was possible to
get the answer no it was possible to come out the end of that procedure and say no I was mistaken
that bacterium is not pathogenic contrast that with the way viruses have been traditionally
studied we're moving away from this now but this is the tradition of a viral study viruses are
much much tinier than bacteria viruses cannot be readily seen except with an electron microscope
which is not a typical thing for a laboratory to have so mostly we look for what viruses do
they actually look quite interesting under the microscope the ones that have a protein coat
look quite interesting but we don't typically look for them or look at them instead we look for what
they do now the problem is that they don't do much they do not do much at all so there's been a
long tradition of looking for destruction and pathogenicity for example if we were looking for
viruses we would spread a whole bunch of bacteria onto a plate we would add on viruses and we would
look for all the places where the viruses destroyed the bacteria if we were looking for viruses and
plants we might apply viruses in some way to a growing plant and then look for all the places
where the leaves were discolored or distorted or where something had gone wrong with the growth of
that plant so the definition of virus became conflated with a definition for pathogenicity
in fact it was almost impossible to talk about viruses without talking about destruction because
we didn't really have any good streamline methodologies for asking a question are you pathogenic the
answer was essentially always yes by these sorts of methods for for for describing them
um when we finally got um the genome projects underway and were able to analyze genomes
the big surprise was that we're full of viruses with no pathogenicity whatsoever and I would say
this is the new age of virology then um we don't necessarily have to be limited to looking for
viruses that are doing something destructive we can simply look through genomes and get an
idea of what viruses were carrying and and then make some some good guesses and maybe come up
with some other experimental methods for talking about um what they're doing and whether any of
them are beneficial they're at the very least benign so so where do viruses come from well
lots of people have done lots of good thinking about the evolution of viruses and I'll try to
