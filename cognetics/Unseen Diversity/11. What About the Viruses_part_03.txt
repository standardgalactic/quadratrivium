bit further and let me tell you why that's the answer I usually give I want to make sure you
know that they're not organisms they are absolutely not organisms uh unto themselves they are not
bacteria not fungi animals plants not anything that has cells not anything that has any kind
of an existence as an organism what they are is their information their DNA and or they are
RNA and that and or reflects that some of them are pretty complicated they can go from being
DNA to RNA and RNA back to DNA again some of them are exclusively DNA some of them are exclusively
RNA DNA and RNA are our information molecules DNA makes up our genomes the genomes of all
organisms it's the information that gives us the the the the genes that that then produce
our proteins or or code for our proteins that that that make all of us up think of DNA is a
string of A's C's G's and T's RNA is very similar to DNA and in this context it's similar enough
that I'm not going to belabor that too much except that it too is a string happens to use a slightly
different set of letters so think of it as a string of A's C's G's and U's so closely related
to DNA it's a way for information to be passed around from the DNA and that's all viruses are
there are little sequences of DNA and RNA now some of them have a little protective protein
coat around that DNA and around that RNA but that little protective protein coat is by no means
like a cell it's not a covering for an organism in the way that a cell is it's it's
really just a simple coat that under some circumstances can protect a virus that is
moving from one organism to another most viruses probably don't have protein coats most viruses
are probably nothing more than a snippet of DNA or RNA where is the snippet of DNA or RNA
in our own genomes and that's hard to visualize but let me see if I can take you through the
process of analyzing the genome and what it might be like to discover a virus in a genome
let's say that we have a brand new genome let's say it's the human genome let's say that we are
back when that genome was first being completed and we have are now taking the strings of A's
C's G's and T's and we are running them through computer programs that are going to read every
single one of those letters and try to analyze where the genes are and where all the things that
are not genes are in our genome so we're starting at the beginning of one of the the sections of
the genome and we're saying oh look here's a gene for hemoglobin here's a gene that's going to
code for the protein that will make the the oxygen carrying pigment in our in our red blood cells
and then we'll move along a little bit through the A's C's G's and T's and we'll say oh look
here's the gene for actin here's the gene that will code for the protein that will make the
one of the proteins that will be used in our muscles and then we'll move along the string
the A's C's G's and T's and suddenly our computer program will say oh here's a virus right in the
middle of our genome not a gene it's a virus it's just a section of our own genome and it has
all of the qualities of being a virus now I can't tell you exactly what those qualities are
it's complicated but it's recognizable you can recognize viruses and genomes here's the really
huge surprise that came out of the human genome project one of the many huge surprises quite a
