antibiotic resistance they have no reason to do so otherwise and they don't and in fact there's even
there are some detrimental aspects to hanging on to bits of DNA that are not useful so bacteria
that are not in the presence of antibiotics often lose their antibiotic resistance it's good
it's fine but as long as there are antibiotics around there that is enough incentive to hang
on to that DNA and that resistance petri dishes in laboratories in which scientists are studying
antibiotics are wonderful places to find antibiotic resistant bacteria deliberately this is how it
gets studied you take a petri dish of bacteria and there are antibiotics on it and you find out
just how powerful that can be all of the bacteria that were not resistant die and you don't have
them anymore all of the bacteria that had any little bit of resistance to that antibiotic stay
alive it's one of the most powerful things you can do in the laboratory to see just how strong a
selection it is for those bacteria that can withstand the antibiotic it's a great demonstration of that
and then finally the additional bit of bad news another place where more and more nowadays we can
find massive amounts of antibiotics in use is an industrial scale animal stockyards where animals
are being kept for intensive feeding before slaughter beef cattle and other sorts of animals
that we typically use for food are being given antibiotics prophylactically to protect them
presumably from whatever could occur to them under such crowded conditions whatever diseases might come
up in those weeks when they're being fattened up in stockyards under terrible conditions before
they they head into a slaughterhouse I say terrible conditions because often very crowded and often
being fed large amounts of food that that their digestive systems are not accustomed to and that's
a really unfortunate thing because it also therefore turns out to be a great place to isolate
resistant bacteria to antibiotics and that really is in a nutshell the root of the problem that we're
encountering more and more with antibiotics it's not about soils and for the most part it's not
about our own individual bodies under treatment with antibiotics appropriate treatment but there's
more and more trouble coming out of these animal stockyards and there of course is always perennial
trouble in hospitals as a challenge in hospitals because they must use the antibiotics and they
must be vigilant about how they handle that so I'll say more about that when I get to the lecture
on pathogens because I think it's important and it's that kind of misuse what I think is a misuse
of antibiotics that I think is is at the root of some of the peculiar exotic pathogens that
we're encountering more and more in places where they really should be unexpected so so more about
that misuse of antibiotics in the next lecture meanwhile I want to talk about collaborations
in the soil it's a little bit of the flip side of the coid on what's going on in soil but also
some of the same bacteria that are collaborating are also producing some antibiotics so it's a
complicated community there's it's not an either or thing and I also want to use the word collaboration
cautiously it's got lots of human connotations it maybe it implies something nice and friendly and
thoughtful and and it's none of that I mean it's nothing but a metaphor for the sort of
