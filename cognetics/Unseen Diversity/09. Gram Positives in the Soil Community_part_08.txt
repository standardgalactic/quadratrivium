eaten by a carnivore what I want to point out is when a carnivore eats a carnivore or when a
carnivore eats a herbivore it has a one-to-one correspondence with its food it is essentially
the same thing as its food the same proportion of protein the same proportion of carbohydrates the
same proportion of all the other nutrients and so incorporating that herbivore or incorporating
that carnivore is really not much of a problem and I can't evoke many bacteria into that process
at least not in a major way that step at the bottom though that step in which we go from the
10,000 plants to the 1,000 herbivores is an enormous step because there is no herbivore
that is in a one-to-one correspondence in respect to the structure and in components of its body
with with plants plants are strikingly different from herbivores and so I will say that all
herbivores are a sort of specialist on whatever part or type of plant they are eating some herbivores
just specialize in plant sap some herbivores such as termites specialize in the wood part of plants
which is really a remarkable diet and which has no resemblance whatsoever to the termite itself
there's no one-to-one correspondence between wood and the termite some herbivores specialized just
in grass such as cattle and in other grass eating organisms like that there's no one-to-one
correspondence between grass and cattle other herbivores are eating leaves and other parts of
plants it's a huge problem and bacteria are the mediators that allow that step that essential
step in that pyramid of food interactions to occur at all what they essentially do is convert
plant material of various sorts whether it's just the sap or just the wood or just the leaves or
just the stems or just the blades of grass or just the roots whatever part of the plant is being
eaten and convert it and supplement it into sufficient balanced nutrients that can sustain
a herbivore there is no herbivore that is not having some assistance from the microbial world
in turning that diet into something usable now for the most part i'm talking about bacteria in
the digestive system bacteria by the way which we don't have as humans we're omnivores so we're
selectively taking food from different parts of the spectrum of nutrients and essentially by
gathering and putting together different foods are getting a rough one-to-one correspondence and
therefore are a little less dependent on bacteria for a massive supplement of our diet i'm talking
about real plant specialists who have an exclusive diet just of leaves just of grass just of wood
really extraordinary diets or just of plant sap be a little bit analogous to when you go into a
grocery store you're loading up your grocery cart with some source of protein some carbohydrates
some source of fats or lipids variety of fruits and vegetables we're talking about going into the
grocery store if you were a plant sap eater and that was all you ate going straight to the maple
syrup aisle loading up your cart with maple syrup and heading out it sounds really efficient but
you can't do it unless you've got backup from the microbial world so any organism that has that
specialized a diet and i will say it's all of the herbivores it's all of that second tier of the
pyramid are entirely reliant on on a microbial um interaction in order to supplement their diet
