Unseen Diversity, Lecture 13. Diverse Metabolisms
In this lecture I continue to tell you about diverse bacterial metabolisms. Previous lecture
was mostly about the type of photosynthesis or photoautotrophy as done by cyanobacteria.
Now at this point I would like to talk about a particular community, one of many that I could
have chosen, but one that I've decided to focus in on a little bit, that displays at least five
types of metabolisms, each of which I will explain and try to put into context, and that I think
might be accessible to many people who might choose to go out and examine such an environment
themselves first hand. It is a sulfur rich environment, for example it could be a sulfur spring,
it could be the estuary where salt water and fresh water are coming together along a shoreline,
it could be low tide sand flats or mud flats along a shoreline, and there are a number of other
sulfur rich environments as well, and in fact all you need to do to know that you are in a sulfur
rich environment is to smell the sulfur, and what you're essentially smelling there is a gaseous
form of sulfur H2S hydrogen sulfide. So what I want to do is take us to an imaginary ideal mud flat,
ideal in that it's going to be relatively easy for us to see all five of our metabolisms in one
little spot, in reality you would be going to your sulfide or hydrogen sulfide rich environment
where you can smell some sulfur and maybe doing a little more careful searching around and analyzing,
realizing that you might not see all the types of metabolisms all in one tidy little place,
so this is an ideal mud flat, but let's take it as an example and smell the hydrogen sulfide
and realize at the beginning that that's a poisonous gas, you're smelling a poisonous gas,
a gas that is as toxic to you and to your metabolism as cyanide is, and the difference
between hydrogen sulfide and cyanide is that we are sensitive to extremely tiny amounts of hydrogen
sulfide so that the amount you're smelling is just scarce parts per million in the air, not enough
in an open space to do any harm to you, but it is useful to realize that it's a highly reactive gas
and therefore toxic and able to get itself involved in our own metabolism in a way that
if you were in a confined space with hydrogen sulfide it would certainly be a poisonous gas for
you and that's the basics of this entire community that I'm going to describe to you
because sometimes extremely active gases go hand in hand with toxicity in large quantities,
but in small quantities that extreme reactivity just means that they're wonderful gases for
use in metabolism, so I next want to talk about hydrogen sulfide in an entirely positive way,
it's what these organisms are using to do what they do for the most part, a lot of this metabolism
is based on using hydrogen sulfide which I will point out as often as I can, so let's say we're
at our ideal mud flat, one of the things that makes it ideal by the way is it's not at a public
beach or in a section of a public beach where people are trumping all over it,
secluded is good and a place where the waves are not chopping at it is good and a place where the
tide goes way way out and the water gets very very shallow and very very still is good, so again
you're choosing carefully and there should be a little bit of a smell of sulfur in a nice way in
the air and the first thing you might be fortunate enough to see is the felt like mats of cyanobacteria,
the cyanose we were talking about in the previous lecture and I say felt like in the sense of if
you were to take some dryer lint and kind of mat it together in your hands you would make a sort of
felt and that's really the consistency of these mats. Now what color are they going to be? Probably
blackish to brownish because these cyanose are out in the blazing sun for the most part and
are going to be using their camouflage colors or their sunglasses colors to protect their
major photosynthetic pigment which is chlorophyll, but they are going to be on the surface,
these are our surface photosynthesizers and you may also be lucky enough to see little bubbles
of oxygen in amongst the felt like texture of this mat of cyanobacteria and that is their waste
product, that bubbling oxygen is their field mark, one of their waste products, the one that
essentially was the greatest pollution event ever to have occurred on earth, all of the oxygen that
has been accumulating from the activities of cyanobacteria photosynthesis. One of the nice
things about seeing cyanobacteria in this context is if you put your ear very very close to that
felt like mat with the bubbling oxygen it sounds like champagne effervescing so it's one of the
auditory field marks of bacteria as well and actually hear the bubbles being formed especially
if you are in an area where the tide is coming back in and is about to recover
an area of mats that has been temporarily high and dry. Now underneath that layer of cyanobacteria
we'll scrape it away very very gently just a millimeter or two down don't scrape too much just
a little brush of your hand sometimes is sufficient if we're lucky we're going to see a beautiful
pinkish purple scum of another type of bacterium now sometimes there are circumstances where this
pinkish purple scum will be up on the surface it'll be the first thing that you see those are
those are situations in which you ought to be smelling quite a bit of sulfide in the air
that's that that would be a situation where sulfide was especially abundant for some reason
but ordinarily you're going to gently move aside that layer of cyanobacteria and right
beneath will be the most beautiful purple and pink scum let me tell you what these bacteria are
they are purple sulfur bacteria they are of the proteobacteria they are photosynthesizers or photo
autotrophs and let me briefly remind you what the equation was for the cyanobacteria so I can
contrast it with the purple sulfur bacteria because these are two major kinds of photosynthesis or
photo autotrophy recall that the cyanobacteria were taking water and carbon dioxide and using
the energy of the sun to make sugar and oxygen as a waste product what the purple sulfur bacteria are
doing is taking hydrogen sulfide instead of h2o which is water hydrogen sulfide plus carbon dioxide
with the energy of the sun making sugar and now what's their waste product their waste product
is sulfur so think about h2o and h2s the starting compounds of those two types of photosynthesis
on one hand we're starting with an oxygen rich compound that's h2o or water on the other hand
we're starting with a sulfur rich compound that's h2s the starting compound for the purple
sulfurs so we're getting two different waste products out the the other end what's interesting
about the two waste products is they both got their challenges on one hand oxygen is toxic on the
other hand it diffuses away so as soon as it's released it's gone it's gone into the atmosphere
and it's and it's gone away from from the organism that has just produced it the problem with sulfur
is that it lingers on as a solid and fortunately it can be used by other organisms but there are
some interesting issues that can come up with those organisms that must temporarily store sulfur
as a waste product because it's not necessarily a convenient thing to be storing but nonetheless we
have organisms that end up storing that waste product it does not necessarily readily diffuse
away so that summarizes the second major type of bacterial metabolism it's the hydrogen sulfide
using photo autotrophy that the purple sulfurs are doing by the way where's their chlorophyll
they have chlorophyll but they have much more of a purple or pink pigment that obscures your view
of their chlorophyll and gives them a predominantly purple or pink color but but trust me they have
chlorophyll there all photosynthesizers have green chlorophyll somewhere in their cells these just
happen to have predominantly other pigments that you can see and there's a really interesting
reason for that that i'm going to get into in just a couple of minutes but next let's gently
brush away that pink purple scum layer and get down to a delicate dark green film which is our
third layer down and and this is if we're lucky if if this film it is visible then then we then
we'll get to talk about it um this is an ideal mudflat it might not be present in in whatever
mudflat you're looking at if we see it if we see that dark green layer below the purple layer
we are looking at green sulfur bacteria and they are doing approximately the same equation that i
just described for the purple sulfur bacteria that is they're taking hydrogen sulfide carbon
dioxide using the light of the sun to make sugar in in giving off a sulfur waste product
so let me explain a little bit further what's going on with that pigmentation with those
three layers in particular it's something that you can see actually in a different section of
the beach perhaps and so it's it's this is a good analogy and this is if you're trying to describe
this or think about this it might be okay to turn away from the microbial mat for just a minute
and to look over at an area where you can see big seaweeds seaweeds or big algae or
big plant like photosynthesizers huge uh multicellular things maybe clinging to the rocks maybe
clinging to some some bit of debris um take a look at those and if you can find a rock that has
lots of bright green seaweed around the top followed by lots of brownish seaweeds a little
bit further down followed by more reddish brown seaweeds even further down and then imagine that
rock which presumably is high and dry because you're at low tide imagine that rock covered by some
amount of water such that light can get down to the top layers of the rock more easily than down
to the next layers down the sides and and and even less easily down to the depths where the rock
is is is attached to the bottom what you're seeing is a zonation of seaweeds with different pigments
that are taking advantage of the different wavelengths of light that can get down through
the water turns out that blue wavelengths of light get more easily down into the depths of the water
than red wavelengths of light and and i'll just use blue and red as the example we could actually
take the entire color spectrum and talk about what each wavelength does in respect to getting
through water but blue and red are a good compare and contrast so that the seaweeds that are up
highest on the rock the bright green ones are receiving um more of a full spectrum of light
and are doing more like what land plants do um that they're bright green they've got their chlorophylls
displayed and they're doing a kind of photosynthesis that they can take full advantage of the spectrum
of light that's coming in the seaweeds that are in the lower zones along the edge of the rock
must use accessory pigments in brownish and yellowish and reddish colors to take up whatever
wavelengths of light they can manage to get um and to pass that light on to their to their other
metabolizing molecules uh turns out that red wavelengths of light don't get very deep into
the water you know this if you've ever had a red bathing suit and and gone deep into the water and
notice that the red color fades away um red color seems to disappear or if you've ever been in some
sort of submersible um vessel where you've been um looking at your clothing in the light of of of
deep water um then you might notice that the red seemed to disappear so this is a challenge for
seaweeds and it's a challenge for the purple and green sulfur bacteria and so it's why these
different layers whether we're talking about seaweeds or talking about these these layers of
bacteria are so different they're actually taking advantage of whatever they can get of the light
that is descending down through these depths and the lower you go um the more you lose some of the
crucial wavelengths of light and the more you've got to make up for it with some extra pigments
now the next layer of bacteria is represented by black often black or very dark sediments with
a strong sulfury smell that lie just below the layer of green sulfurs and this is the layer where
a group of heterotrophs called the sulfate reducers reside and they have some very prominent
field marks but first let me linger on that word heterotrophy they're heterotrophs just like us
that is they are food eaters just like us they do not generate their own food but they have a couple
of interesting differences so i'm going to compare our metabolism with their metabolism so that you
can get a feel for for for what the difference what the primary difference is here's what we're
doing we're taking in sugar and we're taking in oxygen and by the way sugar represents all food
so i don't mean that our diet consists entirely of sugar i'm using sugar as a representational
food molecule you could be taking in steak you could be taking in corn on the cob you could
be taking in all sorts of things but sugar is is going to represent all possible foods
we're taking in sugar we are taking in oxygen with every single breath we take we are then
processing that sugar and breaking it down into its smallest component parts
and we are giving out as waste products water and carbon dioxide now i'm going to review that
again in a moment but let me tell you what we get out of that when we break down the sugar
we are releasing the energy in the chemical bonds that was holding together that sugar and
if we're doing this right we are taking that energy and incorporating it into other chemical
bonds that we will be able to use ourselves for all sorts of things so we're essentially
taking chemical energy from our food that's our process of metabolism that's what it means to be
a heterotroph now let me dissect this just a little bit more so that you can see why the
particular waste products that we have make some sense for us we're taking sugar and i'll remind
you that it is C6H12O6 so hear the C's hear the H's and hear the O's there okay then inexplicably
oxygen okay and i will explain that eventually but right now it should seem a little strange to
you what are we doing with that oxygen why do we need to take in oxygen i mean the sugar makes
sense it's rich with carbons and rich with hydrogens it's terribly useful it's full of
wonderful bonds what's going on with the oxygen okay so we're going to take that C6H12O6
with the oxygen we're going to take it in through a complicated set of reactions that i won't go
into we're going to carefully take that sugar apart and we're going to end up with the C's
and the H's and the O's all kind of rearranged into much much smaller molecules and that's how
we get the H2O and that's how we get the CO2 we're down to pretty much the smallest molecules that
we can conveniently make out of those much larger food molecules that we started with
that's what we're doing that's what lots and lots and lots of bacteria are doing that's what
fungi are doing that's what animals in general are doing so that's a really universal sort of
activity that that is a type of heterotrophy here's what the sulfate reducers are doing
remember i said the sulfate reducers are just like us except they've got another little thing
going on they're taking sugar and where are they getting that sugar by the way well guess what they're
they're just underneath three layers of photosynthesizers that are making sugar in abundance
and making it in excess so it's actually very convenient for them to be right underneath this
wonderful source of food making that is the activity just over their heads so they're taking
sugar and they're taking sulfate SO4 sulfate instead of oxygen and they're processing that sugar
and in the end they're making hydrogen sulfide as a waste product hydrogen sulfide which is
what you smelled when you first approached this microbial mat so their waste product is the smell
of a microbial mat and is the smell of an estuary and is the smell of any kind of sulfurous smell
on the air they're the ones that are making the hydrogen sulfide and can you see this a little
cycle there because we had sulfur and sulfate as well as the waste products of the purple and green
sulfur bacteria that are just over the heads of these sulfate reducers and these sulfate reducers
are now taking that sulfate taking that sugar and they're ending up with hydrogen sulfide gaseous
hydrogen sulfide as a waste instead of water notice the the parallel between hydrogen sulfide
h2s and water h2o now we've just completed a little sulfur cycle and that's one of the wonderful
things about these these little sulfur rich communities as they're handing sulfur around
to each other as though it were valuable because it is but the other thing to notice is that there's
a big oxygen right in the middle of sulfate so just as we're using oxygen for something that we
haven't described yet these sulfate reducers are using SO4 there they've got some oxygen in there
too so something is going on with oxygen with this type of metabolism something that needs
explaining and something that will be explained first though let me tell you about a different
type of autotrophy that can be observed here and then i'll then i'll go back to the whole oxygen
question which is is is somewhat complicated there's yet another type of metabolism going on
in in this microbial math that we've been describing we've had the cyanobacteria we've had the purple
sulfur bacteria the green sulfur bacteria we've had the sulfate reducing heterotrophs
and we have one final type of metabolism that can be highly visible in such an environment
we're back up onto the surface and we're looking at scums and slimes something cobwebby in some
cases almost as though a cobweb has been draped over things a little bit of white bacteria that can
sometimes be on the surface of the cyanobacteria some kind times can be on the surface of some
black sediment that's become exposed so look for it almost everywhere that you're looking as you're
looking around for these other bacteria in any kind of creamy or bright white color that looks
slimy or scummy or cobwebby what you're looking at there is a wonderful group of bacteria called the
sulfur oxidizers and what's really exciting about them is that these are among the chemo
autotrophs which i alluded to previously these are the organisms that can make their own sugar
using nothing more than the bonds in chemicals and it's an amazing thing to do because it means
they can live in total blackness and yet still make sugar and that has some interesting connotations
that i'm that i'm going to get to in just a moment but first let me describe what their
metabolism is and compare it and contrast it to the metabolisms that we've already been talking
about let's say that we work to compare and contrast them with purple sulfur bacteria so purple
sulfur bacteria are taking hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide using the energy of the sun
to make sugars and to release sulfur and sulfate uh as as wastes what sulfur oxidizers are doing
is they're taking hydrogen sulfide using the bonds that are holding together the hydrogen
sulfide because there are chemical bonds holding it together not many but there are some taking
those bonds that are holding the hydrogen sulfide together taking that energy from those bonds
taking carbon dioxide and amazingly making sugar it really is amazing amazingly making sugar
no sunlight needed whatsoever and as a waste product making sulfur and by the way that's why
they look so creamy white they actually store their sulfur waste for a while so you're actually
seeing the bright creamy white of what elemental sulfur can look like when it's being stored in
a tiny bacterium and that's that's what gives them their color absolutely no photosynthetic pigments
now it's true they're they're out on the surface as though they were photosynthesizers
but most of the chemo autotrophs including these sulfur oxidizers live in total blackness
out of sight of us out of out of access so these are some of the more accessible ones the ones that
we can get a chance to look at the vast majority of them are deep under the oceans and deep in
sediments one really really famous group of chemo autotrophs is in the pacific rift vent
zone where I previously described an amazing community of organisms all depending on these
particular types of bacteria with this really unusual metabolism it really surprised scientists
who start for the first time when they went down in a research submersible to find out what was in
these specific rift zones to their enormous surprise it was a whole community of large invertebrates
including gigantic worms and enormous but white crabs and and and shrimp and and all sorts of
enormous clams and what could possibly be supporting this community when it's so far down in the ocean
we're so far below the photic zone where most sugars are being produced the answer turns out to be
chemo autotrophs by the trillions you know in any given community or any given part of a community
and all sorts of interesting connotations for what these invertebrates are like first of all
they tend to be without color so it's a ghostly looking community the very pale clams very pale
crustaceans very pale worms with one really striking exception really startling exception
that is many many of them have bright red hemoglobin just like our hemoglobin just like
our bright red molecule that carries oxygen around in our bloodstream but these invertebrates are
using this hemoglobin for a very different reason turns out many of them are in intimate symbiosis
with chemo autotrophs so they've taken these valuable bacteria that can make sugar in darkness
and taken them up into their own tissues and are cultivating them as little food factories it makes
an enormous amount of sense but there's something about this reaction that is damaged by presence
of oxygen oxygen is is is not a good addition to this particular reaction that these bacteria
are trying to carry out and so the purpose of the hemoglobin is to keep oxygen away from the
reactions that these bacteria are trying to do so it means this community is just a whole
different ecology that has been fascinating biologists for the last you know 20 or 30 years
and there's more and more to find out about these intimate relationships between the chemo
autotrophs and the invertebrates of this community now there's another venue that's very exciting
where these chemo autotrophs are being evoked as as as something worth studying and that is in the
whole emerging field of searching for life on other planets and moons of other planets for
example the moons of Jupiter that are being explored right now and that turn out to have
all sorts of interesting properties one of the things that that exobiologists or or astrobiologists
have been thinking very hard about is what sorts of organism should we be looking for when we're
looking for life on other planets now of course there's the whole school of thought that it will
be something like et from the movie and it will be somehow shaped like us and perhaps we'll be
capable of sending out radio waves that we could pick up somehow but there's another whole school
of thought one that I tend to favor and that is we should be looking at some sort of bacterial
like activity and the whole chemo autotrophic type of metabolism really helps us through a
situation where you have a planet that might be icy cold on its surface but molten in its
interior and there must be some place between icy cold and molten that is of some reasonable
temperature where there might be liquid water and yet you're far below the photic zone you're
deep inside of the planet presumably what could possibly be living down there well it's why chemo
autotrophs are so interesting to these planetary biologists or astrobiologists they're a fascinating
type of metabolism that makes possible some scenarios that they enjoy thinking about it's
it's still a very much of an ongoing subject but but but you will find them often in reference to
thinking about how we ought to be thinking about the possibilities of extraterrestrial life
by the way I I'm going to finish this lecture by coming back to ourselves I began this set
of lectures for this course with talking about how anomalous we are how enormous we are how
multicellular we are how terrestrial we are and that was all presented as is why the our particular
point of view is is is challenging for really understanding the bacteria and seeing the bacteria
but now I want to come around again and talk about how all of that is actually due to bacteria our
enormous size our multicellularity our terrestrial way of life all of that that that is that is a
part of us and is a part of the problem with our point of view sometimes is is is due to bacteria
it's thanks to bacteria so I want to go back briefly to the timeline that I've been talking
about through this entire course the four billion time four billion year timeline I want to go back
to that point at two and a half billion years ago where I said all sorts of exciting symbiosis
were occurring and where complex larger cells were evolving that would eventually come into the
lineages that would be plants and animals and fungi and protus including ourselves in those
lineages and one of the symbiosis that occurred is that bacteria who could take food and oxygen
and metabolize it very efficiently and produce as waste products carbon dioxide and water
which is just what we do those bacteria came on board as symbionts and became our mitochondria
became our specialized cell structures called mitochondria that are where our metabolism
occurs so our metabolism the food the oxygen the production of carbon dioxide and water
is entirely due to our mitochondria which are symbiotic bacteria from way back they still have
vestiges of their DNA from when they were free living organisms and by the way they were free
living bacteria of the proteobacteria so we're carrying around proteobacteria with us that
still have little remnants of their genome that's how come we get to metabolize the way we do
but there's a little more I promise to say something about what was going on with oxygen
because on one hand I've been talking about it as a toxic molecule which it is but on the other
hand I've been acknowledging as I should that it's absolutely essential for those heterotrophs
that have incorporated oxygen into their metabolism clearly we need oxygen if you try to hold your
breath and and not use any oxygen for six minutes you'll find yourself in some great
difficulties so clearly oxygen is doing something essential but what if you look at the simple
equation it does not seem to be doing much of anything so let me evoke an image for you
that might help to explain in a sort of a visual way why oxygen is so important to us
and then let me connect that up with us being such enormous anomalous organisms it's all
going to be connected up as is a sort of a conclusion to this lecture imagine an assembly line
because that actually is what metabolism ends up looking like we've been skipping over the
actual nitty gritty of each and every chemical reaction that has to occur but but but imagine
that those that set of chemical reactions has the look of an assembly line so that some
product is starting at the beginning and is being converted and converted and converted
and converted all the way down the length of the assembly line till we get some waste something
that's going to be taken away as a waste product okay and that's typical metabolism for any organism
in the exact reactions that are going on in that assembly line I'm not going to go into descriptions
about I'm going to say though that that assembly line is going to work most efficiently if we
keep it moving that's obvious that would be true for a factory assembly line too and in fact imagine
a factory assembly line in which something is going wrong and the assembly line is being stopped in
one place or another such that the product is not being moved along that's the kind of problem I'm
talking about and that finally the ultimate problem that can occur in an assembly line
is that whatever it is that's coming out the other end is not whisked away or taken away
efficiently and again if you want to imagine a factory assembly line imagine that it's whatever
product coming out the other end is not being boxed up and hauled away and you're getting a
pile and then you're getting a larger pile and then you're getting an enormous pile and by and by
you've actually stopped the progress of the assembly line so here at last is what's going on with
oxygen and what's going on with oxygen is that we have cleverly cleverly deep in our evolutionary
roots used it both to detoxify it and to keep our metabolism rolling along in the assembly line
okay watch what we do let's say that a major thing coming down the assembly line is electrons
and you just need to trust me on that because I'm not going to get into the chemical equations that
will you know completely clinch that but let's say it's a whole bunch of electrons coming down the
assembly line at the end I need to take away a certain number of electrons and what we essentially
do is we take some oxygen we take some hydrogen we take a few of those extra electrons that are
coming down the line and we tack it all together and make water remember water is H2O so I've just
got that oxygen I've got some extra electrons that I'm going to take away from the end of the assembly
line and I've got hydrogen and we're going to build myself an H2O I'm going to build myself a water
out of that what's wonderful about water it is completely untoxic in fact it's even beneficial
there's no remnant of any kind of dangerous form of oxygen left there it's a completely
benign oxygen attached to two hydrogens at this point the cell can use it or it can diffuse away
easily and we keep the assembly line moving we keep those electrons being used that's how come
we're using oxygen and that's what the sulfate reducers by the way are doing with their sulfate
they're using it at the end of an assembly line to nab up those extra electrons that we're not
being used otherwise and making a product that is then going to be whisked away we hope
now it turns out that this kind of oxygen using heterotrophy is extremely efficient it's a wonderful
way to get every last bit of energy possible out of a big sugar molecule so it turns out that the
bigger you get the more complicated you get the more you get completely dependent on that energy
so I'm going to bring us full circle to who we are we are we are enormous organisms multicellular
wonderfully complex with big brains by the way that use up an enormous amount of sugar and oxygen
and we cannot live more than six minutes without oxygen so it's obviously very essential it's thanks
to our original bacteria that we acquired two and a half billion years ago that can do this amazing
kind of metabolism that is so efficient that we're allowed to be as big as we are and why
it's not optional anymore for us there are plenty of tiny organisms for which this particular kind
of metabolism is optional in other words some days if they've got oxygen they'll do the assembly
line efficiently other days if there's no oxygen the assembly line will get a little backed up
and it doesn't make much of a difference they're tiny organisms and they're not doing a whole lot
but we have we now have an obligate relationship with the bacteria that we're carrying around
the mitochondria to do this particular kind of metabolism and to have an abundance of oxygen
so that concludes the the major part of this course and in in the next concluding lecture
I'd like to do a little recapping of some major topics and also maybe to introduce some ideas
for what I call future directions with this whole topic of bacteria and I also want to
especially remind you that a goal for me in this course and it's also a personal goal of my own
is to incorporate more and more of an understanding of bacteria in my own nature studies and
and I'm hoping that I've left you with some ideas about doing that as well
this ends lecture 13
