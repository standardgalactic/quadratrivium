they don't look like much of anything they look like little tiny punctuation points but they can
have enough bacterial properties that they were mistaken for bacteria but then i said that they
were really doing their own version of certain metabolisms their own kind of heterotrophy
their own kind of autotrophy and for now think of autotrophy as making their own food and a lot
of that has to do with using methane now methane is something that we usually associate with maybe
a methane burning lamp or stove perhaps or methane in the context of something that might explode if
it were misused in in some way it doesn't seem very close to anything nutritious and so the
surprising thing and the interesting thing about the methanogens is it's very much the foundation
of nutrition in their particular little world deep in the swamp or deep underneath a pond that has
black or brown muck they are making methane some of the other organisms in their their community
are then using that methane for their own metabolism and yet other organisms are supplying
some of the raw materials for making methane so we have a little cycle of the sort that we simply
don't have up on the surface we don't see much of anything going on with methane up on the surface
we have to dig down to find this little community it's very much a microbial community in the center
piece of it is very much the archaea that make methane they're the only microorganisms that can
make methane so let's say you wanted to get a look at some of these i would look for their field
mark methane is their field mark so you can if you're driving past a landfill where there's been a
huge garbage dump at one point but they've covered it over with with with some kind of topping of
land and in usually grass you will probably see vent pipes everywhere those are vent pipes that
are channeling the methane from the methanogens out of the landfill and out into the open air
if they did not do that there would be a collection of methane pockets of methane underneath the landfill
and it happens to be extremely flammable and if it's confined it's explosive so it's actually
dangerous to allow it to accumulate down there and ordinarily methane is immediately used by
another member of the methane community but in a landfill there's sometimes some fairly unusual
situations going on due to what being a landfill and so to prevent any excess methane from from
occurring it's vented out so i would say that's your first field mark going past the landfill and
noticing that there are vent pipes everywhere that's to handle the the methanogens sometimes
though those vent pipes are even set on fire to burn off the methane although that's a less common
practice nowadays if you're canoeing in a pond where you know that the the the muds beneath or the
sediments beneath are are deep and and and they're very finely particles you can stick your canoe
paddle or a long stick down and twist it around a little bit and up will come bubbles and those
will be bubbles of methane you can even go about trying to collect methane in such environments
there have been all sorts of methods suggested for it but you're essentially putting down some sort
of a container filled with water and as you stir the muds beneath the gas will displace the water
