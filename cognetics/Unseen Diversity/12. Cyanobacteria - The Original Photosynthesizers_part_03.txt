I hope you'll agree with me on that.
By the way, carbon dioxide is CO2, and water is H2O.
So can you hear the two O's in there?
CO2 and H2O.
Hold on to those two O's in your mind.
Also think about the C of the CO2 and the H of the H2O.
Now what we're going to do is something absolutely, absolutely remarkable.
We are going to use the energy of the sun to turn those two un-nutricious molecules into something extraordinarily nutritious, sugar.
And that's the whole thing of what photosynthesis is about.
We're taking those two starting molecules.
We're taking an enormous amount of sunlight and energy, therefore.
And we're making sugar, and I am going to give you the formula for sugar, but I just want you to hear the C's and H's and O's.
That's really what I want you to hear.
Sugar is C6H12O6.
Hear the C's, hear the H's.
Here are a few O's.
There are extra O's that we don't need.
There are extra oxygens that we don't need.
Where do they go?
That's the oxygen that is the waste product of photosynthesis.
So there you have it, the entire equation.
Carbon dioxide plus water with the help of the sun.
An enormous amount of energy makes sugar an oxygen as a waste product.
And that oxygen, by the way, is a toxic waste product.
And it's hard to believe because it's such an important part of our own metabolism.
But I'm going to address that a little bit later.
I'm going to show you exactly where oxygen fits into our own metabolism so that you can see that even for us it's toxic.
But we have a controlled, very specialized use for it.
And it has turned into something essential for our own metabolism.
