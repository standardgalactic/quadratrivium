I'm a naturalist.
I consider myself to be an amateur naturalist.
I enjoy a walk in the woods in which I identify as many different things as I can, and I include bacteria, and I would like for you to consider including bacteria as a dimension to your nature studies as well.
I think it is also important to place bacteria into the context of other microorganisms as well as organisms as a whole.
That's another goal for this course.
And finally, I'd like to put pathogens into their correct context.
In fact, I have an entire lecture just on pathogens, but I will be alluding to them throughout because I think it's the pathogens of all the bacteria that tend to be getting the most press.
Some of it is not flattering to them.
It makes them sound as though they are the majority of bacteria, which they are not.
And I think it's an important aspect of this series of lectures to get them into their context amongst all bacteria.
Now, the first challenge is that we have our own particular human point of view, and it does not get acknowledged enough, I think, in nature studies.
We are actually anomalous compared to most organisms on earth in a number of different ways, and that has an effect on the way that we look at things.
So what I want to do is something a little strange for the beginning of a series of lectures on bacteria.
I want to talk about ourselves as humans and why it is that we have a particularly challenging task to understand bacteria.
First of all, it's our size.
We are enormous.
We are among the larger of organisms on earth.
A vast majority of organisms are microscopic.
A vast majority of organisms are in fact bacteria, tiny, invisible bacteria, invisible to our eyes.
So our own size is anomalous.
We are enormous.
We are also multicellular, which is unusual.
Again, the vast majority of organisms are single cells.
