we're starting with a sulfur rich compound that's h2s the starting compound for the purple
sulfurs so we're getting two different waste products out the the other end what's interesting
about the two waste products is they both got their challenges on one hand oxygen is toxic on the
other hand it diffuses away so as soon as it's released it's gone it's gone into the atmosphere
and it's and it's gone away from from the organism that has just produced it the problem with sulfur
is that it lingers on as a solid and fortunately it can be used by other organisms but there are
some interesting issues that can come up with those organisms that must temporarily store sulfur
as a waste product because it's not necessarily a convenient thing to be storing but nonetheless we
have organisms that end up storing that waste product it does not necessarily readily diffuse
away so that summarizes the second major type of bacterial metabolism it's the hydrogen sulfide
using photo autotrophy that the purple sulfurs are doing by the way where's their chlorophyll
they have chlorophyll but they have much more of a purple or pink pigment that obscures your view
of their chlorophyll and gives them a predominantly purple or pink color but but trust me they have
chlorophyll there all photosynthesizers have green chlorophyll somewhere in their cells these just
happen to have predominantly other pigments that you can see and there's a really interesting
reason for that that i'm going to get into in just a couple of minutes but next let's gently
brush away that pink purple scum layer and get down to a delicate dark green film which is our
third layer down and and this is if we're lucky if if this film it is visible then then we then
we'll get to talk about it um this is an ideal mudflat it might not be present in in whatever
mudflat you're looking at if we see it if we see that dark green layer below the purple layer
we are looking at green sulfur bacteria and they are doing approximately the same equation that i
just described for the purple sulfur bacteria that is they're taking hydrogen sulfide carbon
dioxide using the light of the sun to make sugar in in giving off a sulfur waste product
so let me explain a little bit further what's going on with that pigmentation with those
three layers in particular it's something that you can see actually in a different section of
the beach perhaps and so it's it's this is a good analogy and this is if you're trying to describe
this or think about this it might be okay to turn away from the microbial mat for just a minute
and to look over at an area where you can see big seaweeds seaweeds or big algae or
big plant like photosynthesizers huge uh multicellular things maybe clinging to the rocks maybe
clinging to some some bit of debris um take a look at those and if you can find a rock that has
lots of bright green seaweed around the top followed by lots of brownish seaweeds a little
bit further down followed by more reddish brown seaweeds even further down and then imagine that
rock which presumably is high and dry because you're at low tide imagine that rock covered by some
amount of water such that light can get down to the top layers of the rock more easily than down
to the next layers down the sides and and and even less easily down to the depths where the rock
