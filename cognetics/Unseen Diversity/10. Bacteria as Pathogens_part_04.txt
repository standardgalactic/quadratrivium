And sometimes things are not juxtaposed such that bacteria don't get into the ear passages.
And so that's why parents spend a great deal of time at doctor's offices with children suffering from ear aches.
And that passes too.
You don't have ear aches for your entire life.
And eventually that's something that you get by.
Respiratory infections.
Not pleasant.
It's not good to get bacteria in your lungs.
It's not good to be coughing up mucus of all sorts.
But that too passes.
These are for the most part curable.
There's an exception.
And let me linger for a moment on pneumonia.
If you are coughing up and feeling great pain in your chest and suspect that you have pneumonia,
which can be caused by a number of different organisms, including bacteria, it should be treated.
That's a good example of something that is potentially fatal.
People, you hear of people dying of pneumonia.
And in fact, before the age of antibiotics, people would die of pneumonia, die of bacterial pneumonia.
So I don't make light of that.
But I would say that most of the respiratory infections that bacteria typically are involved with
are few and far between unpleasant and curable.
So I guess that's the good news.
Now, what's the big exception to all of that?
Well, if you are a patient in the hospital and you are already compromised in some other way,
for example, having just had surgery, having perhaps received some drugs that compromise your immune system,
having perhaps had a transplant of some sort, having some other very serious bacterial or viral infection
that has altered your immune responses, then yes, you might be in some much greater trouble
from some of these relatively simple bacteria.
