summarize a little bit about what that thinking has been although there are no really sound conclusions
yet about viruses they're that mysterious and I think that that we're at a point where they're
more mysterious than they are not mysterious especially with with the new results from from
genome projects and discovering that we have such a load of viruses ourselves um let me start by
saying that I think the word virus as used by the software industry is actually a pretty good
metaphor when when the software industry first began to talk about computer viruses
you know invading a computer disrupting programs shutting down computers essentially
you know something invasive something pathogenic to computers I I thought that was a pretty good
metaphor that that appealed to me I don't always approve of of using biological metaphors outside
of biology but in this case I approved of it I think it's a pretty good metaphor for what the
pathogenic viruses are doing um that is what's happening with it with a software virus is a
little bit of information a little bit of coded information is somehow getting into your computer
perhaps through an internet um connection of some sort perhaps by some other method perhaps it was
there to begin with in some form or another so that little bit of information is somehow
run amok in your computer in your computer and doing some damage that that's what pathogenic
viruses are doing they're just a little bit of information and in some cases cases a little
bit of renegade information a little bit of you know seriously dysfunctional information
run amok in your cells those those are the pathogens what we are missing what we're lacking
is a good metaphor for the benign and beneficial viruses I I hope that will be coming someday I
hope that we'll get to a greater understanding of benign and beneficial viruses such that we'll
have a nice metaphor that people can use readily and we can get away from a pathogenic kind of view
of them but but that's the beginning of what I want to say about where they might be coming from
they might be little renegade bits of our own DNA that is um if you were to try to place them
on the family tree of all organisms and recall the big fan shaped family tree that I've been
talking about throughout this course with predominantly bacterial and archaeal branches
but with some branches off usually to the right side the way I think of about it um of fungi
and protists and plants and animals if I were to try to place the viruses on that family tree I would
maybe take a different color of pen and make them as tiny tiny little branches off of every
single major branch of organisms because I think the viruses are coming from the organisms themselves
they're just little bits of information from each and every organism on earth that is not completely
in sync especially the pathogenic ones with whatever the host is doing or are in sync and
and are just simply part of the DNA but not genes and not jumping genes but yet something else something
that that that is maybe a little more difficult to define we don't have the proper words to describe
them really so they are us they are all of the organisms they're they're bits of information
that that are are not completely compatible with all of the rest and yet surprisingly
compatible considering the number that we have with us so that's one way to think about it
