than interfering with other reactions but but that doesn't completely explain what's going on
there are lots of other ways to detoxify oxygen there are lots of ways to keep it away from
reactions here's what else might be going on that glowing fish on the beach represents a whole
population of bacteria that have just lost their host they were the digestive system bacteria for
that host and now it's dead they would love perhaps to attract another host and perhaps a glowing
carcass is a good way especially at night to get another fish to eat at least parts of this
decaying animal and the bacteria are right back again into their next host so one possibility
is this is part of a cycle that is somewhat advantageous to the bacteria and that they're not
for long perhaps outside of a host but are quickly going to be part of a cycle that gets them right
back inside of the next host digestive system but there's even something better than that
many many many organisms in the deep sea below the photic zone are bioluminescent and we know
very little about them some get hauled up in dredges some get hauled up in nets some get spotted
going by fleetingly so that you can barely identify what they are when when when researchers are
down in research submarines so there's still an awful lot that we don't know but for the few that
have been studied many of them are in symbiosis with bioluminescent bacteria so that they actually
have a relationship with specialized organs for culturing those bacteria and for making those
bacteria part of their usual signaling system and behavior that they do with those lights
um and it it it calls to mind a question um when i think about a symbiosis like this a bioluminescent
symbiosis between fish and bacteria such that the fish have a whole set of behaviors and morphologies
around this they've got special compartments they signal their mates with these bacteria
what is it that defines a fish i mean if you were to to describe that fish in an ichthyology book
or in a manual to fish or a field guide to fish you would certainly describe special structures
that we're giving off light that would be a major criterion you would certainly describe
particular behaviors using light to attract mates or to attract prey or to startle predators
and what if all these were bacterial then then what's the fish and that that's sort of a rhetorical
question but but you know what's the fish what becomes the fish in a symbiosis in which you've
got such important aspects of it um that are bacteria are responsible for so there's a whole
range of bioluminescent activities all the way from simple oxygen detoxification through just
attracting a place to be next um in from a decayed fish to a fish that will be the next host
to a real full-blown symbiosis with elaborate behaviors and elaborate structures and you
find alpha proteo bioluminescent bacteria along that entire range so that's the third charismatic
example of of proteobacteria final example is um one that i really love and one that i would love
to know more about it's an ongoing project for me and maybe an ongoing project for you if you get
inspired by this it's a group of proteobacteria from the deltas so they're delta proteos and they
are the mixo bacteria my x o b a c t e r i a and these are the bacteria for you if you already
