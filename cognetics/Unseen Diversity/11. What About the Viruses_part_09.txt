help our immune systems to respond appropriately so if i were to sum up viral pathogenicity
based on the 25 viral cards in my deck of pathogens let's say they tend to have protein
coats and in fact the picture on the cover of the of the card is usually a picture of a protein coat
they tend to have this ability to shuffle around their dna and therefore to fool our immune systems
and to fool the medical researchers who are trying to develop vaccines for them and they
tend to be in a relatively new relationship with us often a new relationship having previously been
in some other animal for example i mentioned some farm animals or it could be some other primate
now let me give you a few examples from the the the deck of cards to conclude this
quite a few viruses can be controlled with vaccinations or once you have had your
uh your interaction with those viruses your own immune system um leaves you with a resistance to
any further problems with those viruses that's the great news so think of measles think of mumps
think of rabies think of hepatitis in all of its forms and think of polio all of course horrific
consequences if you have a bad encounter with those viruses but the good news is that we are in an
age of vaccinations and you can be vaccinated against these and you also can can get your own
immunity against these so that's the wonderful news here here's the bad news it's extremely
difficult for reasons i just described to vaccinate against the flu it's also impossible so far to
vaccinate against hiv because hiv is one of these viruses that shuffles itself up and is
very difficult for our immune system to get a hold of the other problem problem with hiv is
it also tends to get deep inside of our own cells um where it can hide out and the immune system is
is not available to to control it when it's inside of ourselves and then ironically the common cold
which is one of our milder viral infections um but which is wonderful at coming up with new versions
of itself so that there are hundreds and hundreds of common cold viruses around and the problem is
that when you get a particular version of the common cold you then build up an immunity against
that and will probably not get that particular common cold virus again but there are hundreds more
waiting in the wings and so over the course of your life let's say that you live for a hundred years
you probably will continue to get one or two colds per year of one sort or another because
there are that many different cold viruses and it's why those two cannot be easily vaccinated
against you'd essentially have to have a cocktail of hundreds and hundreds of of of complex parts of
a vaccine in order to to come up with a with a comprehensive and probably one that wouldn't work
anyway vaccine against cold viruses so that concludes this um pair of lectures on pathogenicity
and uh we're going on to um some organisms that have absolutely not any pathogenicity associated
with them at all and that is in the next lecture on cyanobacteria
this ends lecture 11
