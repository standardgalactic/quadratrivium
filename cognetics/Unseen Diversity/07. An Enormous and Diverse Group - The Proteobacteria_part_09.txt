enjoy lichens and tiny fungi and slime molds even um in your walks in the woods if you enjoy
looking at a rotting log and looking at it very very closely and finding that it's wonderfully
full of the most exquisite tiny tiny gardens of fungi and lichens and even slime molds and and
slime molds are an entity unto themselves they're fascinating but if you want to look them up they're
often in fungal field guides so they're often incorporated into into a study of fungi and if
you would already enjoyed looking at these tiny little communities of of organisms on logs then
look a little harder because there is a whole group of delta proteos the mixo bacteria that make
structures that are enormous by bacterial standards enormous half a millimeter to a millimeter high
now granted a millimeter is not very tall but but by bacterial standards it's a skyscraper so think
of a tiny structure maybe a millimeter high an exquisite little structure with a little stock
and maybe little branches and maybe in yellows and oranges and tan colors and those are structures
made by mixo bacteria which are doing something absolutely amazing they live in the soil and
they swarm around looking for whatever detritus or debris might be in the soil that they can digest
but if food is used up they will band together and hoist into the air these amazing little
structures made of thousands of them all together concerted effort to make these tiny structures
about a millimeter high and once they've lifted these structures up off the forest floor up off
the surface of the log any sort of rainstorm or windstorm will blow them easily to some other
location where they will again go back to a single celled existence in the soil but presumably in a
new area with a new start and perhaps with with new nutrients so when I say this is a project for me
maybe a project for you I love looking very very closely at a rotting log it's one of a favorite
thing for me to do and I don't know enough about slime molds and mixo bacteria but it's a project
for me to learn more about them and to try to understand their position and it's easy enough
to make the first forays into that by by looking at some pictures of the kind of structures that
I'm talking about and noticing the beautiful colors of them and then bringing a hand lens along next
time you're walking in the woods so that you can examine things very closely the next lecture will
be about another large group of bacteria the gram positives and I will remind you in that lecture
that it was Dr. Hans Christian Graham who stumbled upon them when he developed his gram stain
this ends lecture seven
