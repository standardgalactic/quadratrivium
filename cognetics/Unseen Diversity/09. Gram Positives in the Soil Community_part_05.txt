activities that seem to go pretty well when more than one organism is involved with them
um and we call it collaboration here here's how it goes let's say that um a feather falls to the
forest floor and organisms presumably are going to go to work to decompose that feather down to
its basic nutrients there could be one microorganism that has as its particular task to break down that
feather from the very beginning to the very end but it turns out there isn't it turns out
much much more the case that there are a set of microorganisms that each take a turn at one
particular aspect you could say they're specializing in one aspect of that decomposition and what they're
doing is is is waiting in fact some scientists have called it watchful waiting another metaphor
another you know human centered sort of metaphor but maybe a useful one here watchful waiting for
a particular event in the process of decomposition that they can participate in and let me see if
I can give you one complete example of this let's say that something has fallen to the forest floor
and it is full of protein um let's say it's part of a dead animal okay so think of protein as a
nutrient with lots of nitrogen in it that would be useful for almost any organism but who goes to
work and attacks at first will be a group of bacteria called the ammoni fires and those
ammoni fires are doing what the word suggests they are making ammonia ammonia and fire the fire
ending means making so making ammonia and that ammonia is but one step in the entire process
that is going to break down that that bit of protein that bit of dead animal completely but
let me give you an example of where you may have smelled the field mark of an amount modifying
bacterium if you've ever had a cat litter box that maybe was an extra need of changing or have ever
been by a chicken house that was in need of cleaning out you may have smelled a little
whiff of ammonia and those are the ammonifying bacteria at work taking whatever protein was in
the cat feces or in the chicken feces and and taking it to the next step in that process of
making ammonia you're less likely to smell it out in the woods because even though I'm using a soil
example because you're not going to get concentrated feces out there such that that ammonia would be
something that you could detect with your nose but there's your field mark of the first step
of breaking down or decomposing something with protein in it the next step is done by at least
two types of bacteria both of which will call the nitrifiers I'm not naming names here because I
think it's going to be enough to get some processes named and it's not always important to get every
last genus and species for things but the nitrifiers and what they are doing is the first set of them
is taking that ammonia and making nitrite and the second set of them is taking that nitrite
and making nitrate and let me pause there and tell you exactly where you can catch a glimpse of this
okay good so first it seems a little arcane how are you going to see or smell nitrite and nitrate
if you maintain an aquarium of fish and those fish of course are defecating into the water
then you need to have some sort of a system to make sure that the feces of the fish are cleaned
out on a regular basis otherwise you're going to have some serious problems and affect a lot of
