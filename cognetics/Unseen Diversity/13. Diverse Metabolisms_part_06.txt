now it's true they're they're out on the surface as though they were photosynthesizers
but most of the chemo autotrophs including these sulfur oxidizers live in total blackness
out of sight of us out of out of access so these are some of the more accessible ones the ones that
we can get a chance to look at the vast majority of them are deep under the oceans and deep in
sediments one really really famous group of chemo autotrophs is in the pacific rift vent
zone where I previously described an amazing community of organisms all depending on these
particular types of bacteria with this really unusual metabolism it really surprised scientists
who start for the first time when they went down in a research submersible to find out what was in
these specific rift zones to their enormous surprise it was a whole community of large invertebrates
including gigantic worms and enormous but white crabs and and and shrimp and and all sorts of
enormous clams and what could possibly be supporting this community when it's so far down in the ocean
we're so far below the photic zone where most sugars are being produced the answer turns out to be
chemo autotrophs by the trillions you know in any given community or any given part of a community
and all sorts of interesting connotations for what these invertebrates are like first of all
they tend to be without color so it's a ghostly looking community the very pale clams very pale
crustaceans very pale worms with one really striking exception really startling exception
that is many many of them have bright red hemoglobin just like our hemoglobin just like
our bright red molecule that carries oxygen around in our bloodstream but these invertebrates are
using this hemoglobin for a very different reason turns out many of them are in intimate symbiosis
with chemo autotrophs so they've taken these valuable bacteria that can make sugar in darkness
and taken them up into their own tissues and are cultivating them as little food factories it makes
an enormous amount of sense but there's something about this reaction that is damaged by presence
of oxygen oxygen is is is not a good addition to this particular reaction that these bacteria
are trying to carry out and so the purpose of the hemoglobin is to keep oxygen away from the
reactions that these bacteria are trying to do so it means this community is just a whole
different ecology that has been fascinating biologists for the last you know 20 or 30 years
and there's more and more to find out about these intimate relationships between the chemo
autotrophs and the invertebrates of this community now there's another venue that's very exciting
where these chemo autotrophs are being evoked as as as something worth studying and that is in the
whole emerging field of searching for life on other planets and moons of other planets for
example the moons of Jupiter that are being explored right now and that turn out to have
all sorts of interesting properties one of the things that that exobiologists or or astrobiologists
have been thinking very hard about is what sorts of organism should we be looking for when we're
looking for life on other planets now of course there's the whole school of thought that it will
be something like et from the movie and it will be somehow shaped like us and perhaps we'll be
