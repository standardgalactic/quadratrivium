at work in there it's one of my favorite field marks and it's one that you can confidently use
your nose for knowing that garden soil and compost is is not going to have any sort of pathogen that
you could accidentally get into your nose you're simply smelling this the smell of good earth that
you smell in the springtime or just after a rainstorm that's actinobacteria. What else are
they doing for competition they're making antibiotics fungi are making antibiotics
and actinobacteria are making antibiotics of all sorts and they're making them against each other
so that the other thing that actinobacteria and fungi do when they first encounter a bit of debris
that they're about to go through a decomposition process with is they begin to put out antibiotics
into the immediate environment for the purpose of preventing other microbes from encroaching
and it works well and you can actually see this in action on petri dishes and in fact some of the
early 19th century microbiologists Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur observed this they didn't know
quite what they were looking at at the point or they hadn't quite put it all together but when
they had colonies growing on petri dishes on nutrient media if those colonies got too close
together sometimes they would encroach upon each other sometimes they would grow up until
they were touching each other but sometimes they wouldn't sometimes they would leave zones around
themselves sort of a no man's land or a no microbes land where nothing could grow and
we're certainly no competing bacterium from the adjacent colony could grow and those were bacteria
and in some case fungi growing on plates who are producing antibiotics so it's one of the
easiest ways to get hold of some antibiotics is to get some actinobacteria or fungi growing
it was Alexander Fleming who first put together thoroughly and completely a story about penicillin
which comes from the fungus penicillium and I'm going to digress here a little bit about that
fungus most of these lectures only mentioned fungi and passing but this is a pretty important
fungus it was the it's a soil fungus commonly isolated from soils it also was a fungus that
makes certain cheeses more delicious such as blue cheeses and some of the white fuzzy surface
cheeses like camembert and breeze but it's also a fungus that produces penicillin the antibiotic
and it's doing it in competition with other soil microbes in its in its normal place in the soil
and it was Alexander Fleming who put it all together and realized that the colonies growing
on his plate that were avoiding the penicillin mold were in fact avoiding an important antibiotic
and this was the beginning of the antibiotic age in the early 20th century this continued
throughout the 20th century once people realized that this was going on in the soil and that the
soil was a rich source of antibiotics soil microbiology became an important subfield
of microbiology and I don't think it would have become such an important subfield if it had not
been for the great interest in finding new antibiotics and a researcher named Selman
voxman w a k s m a n was one of the real forerunners throughout the 20th century for examining
soil microbes very closely both actinobacteria and fungi and isolating antibiotics from them
