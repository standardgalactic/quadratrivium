now there are a couple of additional things that i need to say so that we don't
give bacteria all of the credit for this there are a great many fungi that also assist with this
so it's the microbial world in its extended definition in this case it's not just the bacteria
as members of the microbial world that also includes some fungi but the point is there's
no herbivore there's no animal herbivore that's doing it on its own and this even extends to those
predators that specialize in particular animal parts and i'll give you an example think about
mosquitoes what are they eating well the female mosquito has a diet of blood and that's a pretty
specific diet for that female mosquito the male mosquito by the way is is a plant sap eater so he's
got a pretty specific diet too they've got symbionts in them they have bacterial symbionts that make
that really specialized diet possible so this is something that also extends to the higher echelons
of that pyramid that we just constructed but my my most important point is that there's nothing
that that leaves the base of that pyramid without the help of microbes um and it's in it's a way to
conclude this lecture that has been about gram positives of the soil because i would argue that
from the point of view of those gram positives it's the soil it's the inside of an organism it's
back out to the soil again and it's all one continuum as far as they're concerned it's a microbial world
as far as they're concerned and they're just facilitating via what they might see from their
point of view as a fermentation bat which is a way to describe what what cattle look like
enormous fermentation like that bodies absolutely filled with microbes digesting grass and extremely
unlikely diet for an animal that size and yet they're doing it successfully on these four stumpy
legs fermentation bats on the legs and uh from the microbial point of view it's just all one
continuum of nutrients in one place or another so that concludes this lecture on the gram positives
and next comes the uh long promised lecture on pathogens um and i will also include in that lecture
a little something to try to help fit the viruses into their proper place um the viruses are really
a big enough topic that they require their uh would require an entire set of lectures just on
themselves and are not really completely on topic for this course but i'm going to try to fit them
into the pathogens um in the next lecture
this ends lecture nine
