and you can eventually get a container with some methane gas in it which i will say again it is
flammable so it's something to be careful of another source of methane is your own intestines
you will sometimes release an ordinary flatulence methane along with other interesting gases and
i'll say that methane is is odorless but it is flammable so you're releasing in some cases a
flammable gas and another major place where you can detect methanogens in action is in sewers
and it's why sewer workers often wear methane detectors and it's why sewer workers sometimes
get hurt in explosions in sewers because there are methanogens down there again in the deep
muck that you're likely to have in a sewer producing methane if that methane gets collected
anywhere and if there's a spark maybe from electricity or some other source there could
be an explosion right there so that means that methane detectors are a way to also detect
the natural signs of methanogens and i will suggest something that i've tried myself
i happen to work at a college that owns some methane detectors for that exact reason
i've gotten permission to borrow those methane detectors they're relatively easy to use
pretty simple actually they make a little clicking sound in the presence of methane
and it's great fun to go out to a swamp and dig up some sediments and and see if you can get the
methane detector to to click in response to to the methane being released so that that's worth
trying and i will point out that you may be surprised at how many places of work have methane
detectors for that reason and it might be worth you know asking around and seeing whether you
can you can get the loan of one so to conclude this lecture this has been about extremophiles
and there's been a focus mostly on archaea only the halophiles and only the methanogens or excuse
me the only the archaea are halophiles and methanogens and many archaea are hyper and thermophiles
and these are accessible surprisingly accessible in spite of their extremophili or maybe it's
because they're extremophiles that they're so accessible that when you go looking for them
you don't see anything else obscuring your view and there are their field marks right there
in the next lecture i want to introduce a group of bacteria called the proteobacteria
and in this case i will be dealing with well probably thousands and thousands of of species
that we know and yet probably more thousands that we do not um have identified yet and so
i will have to be very selective as to which ones i tell you about and i will focus in particular
on ones that i think are assess accessible and that have particularly interesting stories with them
