He was very aware of guild secrets, trade secrets, and actually treated his methods in that particular
way, which the Royal Society members found very irritating, by the way, because they
were interested in telling each other how they were managing to get their particular
experiments done.
And Van Lewenhoek was treating this as though it were some sort of proprietary guild secret
that he was developing and using.
I wanted to read some quotes from one of the famous letters of Van Lewenhoek.
Remember his publications were in the form of letters.
This is letter number 39.
It is a description from him of the bacteria between teeth.
And this is one of the earliest descriptions known that can be interpreted in this way
as being of bacteria.
Here's the quotation, and this was translated from the Dutch.
I then most always saw with great wonder that in said matter were many very little animicules,
very prettily moving.
That I think, and I think historians of science who have poured through his letters think is
one of perhaps even the first description of bacteria.
Now there's more to the quotation that suggests that he was looking at something tiny enough
and of the right shape to say that these were bacteria.
And we also note that the scrapings between teeth that have not been recently cleaned
are a wonderful place to get some samples of bacteria for the microscope to this day.
So taking a toothpick and scraping a bit of plaque from between the teeth produces a very
nice little sample, very much of the sort that Van Lewenhoek would have seen.
Here's something else he says about the scrapings between teeth.
And by the way, it was not only his own teeth, but he would go around deliberately to different
people, presumably his neighbors in Delft, and get scrapings from their teeth and has
vivid descriptions of what the scrapings were like from teeth of people who rarely cleaned
