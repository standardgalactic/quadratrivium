let me tell you an alternative point of view though because this is important I don't want
to make it sound as though we're all settled in on where viruses come from it's it's it's complicated
there is another major hypothesis about this that suggests there's something really baseline
about them and if we go way down to the roots of that big family tree way down to the origin
of life somewhere around four billion years ago maybe we will find something going on and this
will be of course theoretical something that will extrapolate because we're not going to literally
find this but maybe we'll we will find that there was something going on with viruses at that time
they're very simple they're just DNA they're just RNA perhaps they are something vestigial from those
origins of life that are not well understood at all and then maybe somehow got incorporated into
all other organisms it's not clear but but you can see there are two major ways of thinking
about them on the family tree either you put them way down at the base and then you get them
eventually distributed throughout the family tree or you start them at each node along the family
tree and you say viruses are happening right now we're getting new viruses as we speak they're
evolving from organisms right now from their DNA now remember the pathogen cards that I used in the
last lecture turns out that some of those cards or are for viruses and I took those out of the deck
because I wanted to get a better picture of what it is that causes some viruses to under rare
circumstances be pathogenic and I found 25 approximately 25 viral cards in the deck and
what I want to say first of all is that unlike bacteria which can be arranged in a nice way
on the family tree and unlike any of the other organisms that can be it's very difficult to
take a group of viruses is as different as the different pathogens are and to come up with a
coherent taxonomy for them that that somehow manages to take all of their characteristics
in into consideration that is we're still relatively new at classifying viruses I'm not
saying that there aren't classification methods and I'll give you a little hint about what those
methods are like but I will say that I suspect that this is going to be a developing area of
virology that more and more will be done to try to get this into a more consistent classification
system right now viruses get defined by whether they are predominantly of DNA or predominantly of RNA
or whether they are going back and forth between those two information molecules and that makes some
sense although I will say that there are plenty of DNA viruses that probably don't have much to do
with each other there's no classification that really should lump them all together but that's
that's one of the ways of looking at them right now many of the pathogens also do an additional
thing they can make a little protein coat for themselves such that they could become protected
if they were to temporarily leave their host now they don't do anything inside of the protein
coat but think of it as a little protective particle which and here's the unfortunate part
could be transferred readily around and that's how viruses get transferred around usually when
they're inside these little little coats so viruses can also be classified according to
the shapes and structures of their their protein coats some of which are quite beautiful and
