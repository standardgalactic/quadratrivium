turn out to be a good place to find resistant bacteria one of the ironies and there's not
too much to be done about that in a practical way probably. Here's an analogy that might work
because I keep saying that this works only if there are antibiotics present. It's like packing
properly for a vacation if you have a vacation in the Bahamas you do not want to stuff your suitcase
with skis and snowshoes in winter jackets you want to put the correct things into your suitcase
however if your plane turns around and heads to the north pole then perhaps what you've packed that
I just mentioned would be just fine. It's the same way with bacteria they're tiny little cells
they tend to be very streamlined they carry genes that are useful in a particular environment they
don't carry excess baggage they don't carry stuff in in an effective way that they don't need it's
not that there's any kind of deliberate decision by them it's just those bacteria that are packed
down with extra genes don't survive as well don't replicate as well don't compete as well
and they essentially get left behind while other more streamlined bacteria surge forward and do
much better. So bacteria don't go hauling around antibiotic resistant genes in environments that
don't have antibiotics that's why the solution to resistance may be not as complicated as it might
seem and I want to present the solution in the context of of one particular environment where
some really horrific pathogens seem to be emerging and that's the super strains of E. coli and the
super strains of Staphylococcus aureus that I mentioned at the end of the previous lecture
as being highly invasive and exceptionally resistant to a host of antibiotics and therefore very
difficult to control and often with with with lethal or very damaging results to patients
and and here's the unfortunate news they seem to be coming out of a prophylactic use of antibiotics
in cattle and other animal feedlots where animals are being fattened up for slaughter
and then the goal of course for them to go into our food supply and the reason antibiotics are
being used prophylactically that is ahead of any need for them without any particular symptoms being
shown by the animals nonetheless the antibiotics are being given is because the cattle are being
kept in and other animals are being kept in relatively crowded conditions such that if one
animal should fall sick that sickness could pass quickly through the entire herd the animals are
being fed large quantities of a relatively unnatural diet their normal diet should be grass
they should be grazing and they should be digesting that grass with the help of their
normal microorganisms of their digestive system however they're being fed vast quantities of
corn and other nutrients that are the the design of which this diet is designed to to increase the
the the weight of these animals over a relatively short time and that also disrupts their normal
microbiota allowing pathogens maybe to more easily get a space in and on the cattle and and as a
result we have animals that are exceptionally full of antibiotic resistant bacteria it's a wonderful
place for resistance to to to occur makes a lot of sense and an additional problem is that animals
need to look healthy to be walking on their own four feet they have a sort of you know air of health
about them as they head toward the slaughter otherwise they're not allowed to go further into the
