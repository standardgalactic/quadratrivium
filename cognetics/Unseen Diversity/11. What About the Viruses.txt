Unseen Diversity, Lecture 11. What about the viruses?
This next lecture will be in two parts. In the first part, I would like to address further
aspects of antibiotic resistance in bacteria that are particularly disturbing and maybe
controllable and maybe something that should be considered important in dealing with some
of the more serious pathogens that seem to be coming up lately in the news and certainly in
a serious way in hospitals. The second part of this lecture will be my attempt to put the viruses
into perspective with all of the rest of this. It will certainly not be a complete lecture on
viruses. There are entire courses called virology and the viruses are complicated enough and
important enough to warrant their own course. However, it will be part of a lecture in which
I will try to put them into perspective compared to the bacteria and compared especially to pathogens.
So, beginning with antibiotic resistance, bacteria can produce antibiotics, bacteria can also produce
antibiotics or chemicals that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics and it makes a great
deal of sense. Much of this activity is going on in the soil and you might recall from my lecture
on gram positive bacteria of the soil that there's a great deal of competition between bacteria and
between fungi and bacteria and between fungi to get at limited resources and antibiotics is one
of the ways that that competition occurs. So, antibiotics have a long history of being involved
in soil bacteriology and of course they have a long history of being used very effectively by
humans to treat bacterial infections. Here's where the problem comes in. It's very easy for bacteria
to pass around to each other the genes that allow them to be resistant to antibiotics
and these genes are most likely to be passed around and held on to and that's an important
point held on to by the bacteria that receive them if there are antibiotics present in the
environment. Now, in a previous lecture I gave you a short list of environments where antibiotics
are present. They're present in soils in local areas where bacteria are competing and fungi
are competing so that makes a lot of sense. Antibiotics may be present temporarily in us
when we're being treated by a doctor for a bacterial infection and those are circumstances
in which our bacteria are going to be most likely to be holding on to genes that get passed to them
that pertain to antibiotic resistance so it's a not only are we being treated for antibiotics but
we're also for a time period temporarily increasing the transfer of resistant genes. On a petri dish
in a laboratory where antibiotics are being studied and resistance is being studied it's very easy
to select a group of bacteria that have passed around those resistant genes and who are surviving
on a petri dish that you've deliberately laced with antibiotics such that all of the other bacteria
who are not successful in picking up those resistant genes are now dead. So that's a really dramatic
example of how important it is when there are antibiotics in the environment to have those
resistant genes. Hospitals are another location where you find a great deal of antibiotics in use
of necessity nothing that can be done about that except that it's also unfortunately a wonderful
place for bacteria to pass around and hold on to those genes for resistance so hospitals
turn out to be a good place to find resistant bacteria one of the ironies and there's not
too much to be done about that in a practical way probably. Here's an analogy that might work
because I keep saying that this works only if there are antibiotics present. It's like packing
properly for a vacation if you have a vacation in the Bahamas you do not want to stuff your suitcase
with skis and snowshoes in winter jackets you want to put the correct things into your suitcase
however if your plane turns around and heads to the north pole then perhaps what you've packed that
I just mentioned would be just fine. It's the same way with bacteria they're tiny little cells
they tend to be very streamlined they carry genes that are useful in a particular environment they
don't carry excess baggage they don't carry stuff in in an effective way that they don't need it's
not that there's any kind of deliberate decision by them it's just those bacteria that are packed
down with extra genes don't survive as well don't replicate as well don't compete as well
and they essentially get left behind while other more streamlined bacteria surge forward and do
much better. So bacteria don't go hauling around antibiotic resistant genes in environments that
don't have antibiotics that's why the solution to resistance may be not as complicated as it might
seem and I want to present the solution in the context of of one particular environment where
some really horrific pathogens seem to be emerging and that's the super strains of E. coli and the
super strains of Staphylococcus aureus that I mentioned at the end of the previous lecture
as being highly invasive and exceptionally resistant to a host of antibiotics and therefore very
difficult to control and often with with with lethal or very damaging results to patients
and and here's the unfortunate news they seem to be coming out of a prophylactic use of antibiotics
in cattle and other animal feedlots where animals are being fattened up for slaughter
and then the goal of course for them to go into our food supply and the reason antibiotics are
being used prophylactically that is ahead of any need for them without any particular symptoms being
shown by the animals nonetheless the antibiotics are being given is because the cattle are being
kept in and other animals are being kept in relatively crowded conditions such that if one
animal should fall sick that sickness could pass quickly through the entire herd the animals are
being fed large quantities of a relatively unnatural diet their normal diet should be grass
they should be grazing and they should be digesting that grass with the help of their
normal microorganisms of their digestive system however they're being fed vast quantities of
corn and other nutrients that are the the design of which this diet is designed to to increase the
the the weight of these animals over a relatively short time and that also disrupts their normal
microbiota allowing pathogens maybe to more easily get a space in and on the cattle and and as a
result we have animals that are exceptionally full of antibiotic resistant bacteria it's a wonderful
place for resistance to to to occur makes a lot of sense and an additional problem is that animals
need to look healthy to be walking on their own four feet they have a sort of you know air of health
about them as they head toward the slaughter otherwise they're not allowed to go further into the
process that is be killed and used for meat and that's of great concern to people who are running
cattle feedlot so there needs to be sort of an air of healthiness around these animals and again
that's why these antibiotics are being used ahead of need prophylactically in vast quantities
now when the animals defecate and urinate out go those antibiotics in some cases
into the manure into the urine sometimes they end up in big holding lagoons sometimes they end up in
local water supplies or being used on fields to fertilize vegetables so it's why the problem
sometimes can extend beyond meat and into our supply of commercially grown vegetables as well
so back to the super strains of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus unfortunately it's why these
are coming up in our food supply and I think for the most part it can be traced back to this use
of antibiotics I think it's controllable that happens to be my opinion and I guess I would
suggest that there may be a time in years to come when this is sufficiently recognized
that we won't be having super strains of bacteria coming out of cattle feedlots and coming out of
our vegetable supply meanwhile though you might consider eating locally and eating organically
as much as possible and being maybe cautious about certain commercially grown aspects of our food
supply the next section of this lecture pertains to viruses and I will say that when I was planning
this course from the beginning it was my intent to not take much time away from the bacteria
themselves bacteria are a huge topic unto themselves and I needed pretty much all the time in this
course to to talk about them and to get a really thorough background in place so that I could
talk in more detail about certain aspects of them so I've really only mentioned other organisms
in their context with bacteria I have not done justice to the fungi which are a fascinating
group of their own right I've only talked about fungi in respect to bacteria I've not done much
with animals except that they are hosts of bacteria not done much with plants and protists
and I've not done much with viruses but I want to linger a bit on the viruses for the the conclusion
of this lecture or for the second part of this lecture because I think there are some prevalent
misunderstandings about them around pathogenicity to the point where people often equate pathogenic
bacteria with pathogenic viruses they're all under the umbrella of pathogenic and sometimes mix up
the two get confused about exactly whether they're talking about a viral disease or a bacterial
disease and it actually makes a huge difference so I want to linger on this a little bit and
put the viruses into their context what are they well this is going to be a little bit
unsatisfying it's unsatisfying to me too but they are genetic entities and I think the reason
that that's not a satisfying definition but a definition we're stuck with for the time being
is because terminology scientific terminology has not caught up with the science of viruses
we're we're still lingering with terminology that that began to be put into place back when we first
were understanding what viruses were and it was really the early part of the 20th century um
but we we we're still understanding things and learning new things about viruses so I would say
that to call them a genetic entity is is not terribly helpful but let me develop it a little
bit further and let me tell you why that's the answer I usually give I want to make sure you
know that they're not organisms they are absolutely not organisms uh unto themselves they are not
bacteria not fungi animals plants not anything that has cells not anything that has any kind
of an existence as an organism what they are is their information their DNA and or they are
RNA and that and or reflects that some of them are pretty complicated they can go from being
DNA to RNA and RNA back to DNA again some of them are exclusively DNA some of them are exclusively
RNA DNA and RNA are our information molecules DNA makes up our genomes the genomes of all
organisms it's the information that gives us the the the the genes that that then produce
our proteins or or code for our proteins that that that make all of us up think of DNA is a
string of A's C's G's and T's RNA is very similar to DNA and in this context it's similar enough
that I'm not going to belabor that too much except that it too is a string happens to use a slightly
different set of letters so think of it as a string of A's C's G's and U's so closely related
to DNA it's a way for information to be passed around from the DNA and that's all viruses are
there are little sequences of DNA and RNA now some of them have a little protective protein
coat around that DNA and around that RNA but that little protective protein coat is by no means
like a cell it's not a covering for an organism in the way that a cell is it's it's
really just a simple coat that under some circumstances can protect a virus that is
moving from one organism to another most viruses probably don't have protein coats most viruses
are probably nothing more than a snippet of DNA or RNA where is the snippet of DNA or RNA
in our own genomes and that's hard to visualize but let me see if I can take you through the
process of analyzing the genome and what it might be like to discover a virus in a genome
let's say that we have a brand new genome let's say it's the human genome let's say that we are
back when that genome was first being completed and we have are now taking the strings of A's
C's G's and T's and we are running them through computer programs that are going to read every
single one of those letters and try to analyze where the genes are and where all the things that
are not genes are in our genome so we're starting at the beginning of one of the the sections of
the genome and we're saying oh look here's a gene for hemoglobin here's a gene that's going to
code for the protein that will make the the oxygen carrying pigment in our in our red blood cells
and then we'll move along a little bit through the A's C's G's and T's and we'll say oh look
here's the gene for actin here's the gene that will code for the protein that will make the
one of the proteins that will be used in our muscles and then we'll move along the string
the A's C's G's and T's and suddenly our computer program will say oh here's a virus right in the
middle of our genome not a gene it's a virus it's just a section of our own genome and it has
all of the qualities of being a virus now I can't tell you exactly what those qualities are
it's complicated but it's recognizable you can recognize viruses and genomes here's the really
huge surprise that came out of the human genome project one of the many huge surprises quite a
few huge surprises um about one third of the human genome is viral one third of the human
genome is viral there are three billion bases three billion A's C's G's and T's about one billion
our viral DNA's and we're not sick of viruses we are not sick these this is normal human beings
that I'm talking about so when I say that the vast majority of viruses are not pathogens
that's what I'm talking about that's that's just an example from humans I could do the same thing
for fungal genomes I could do the same thing for plant genomes I could do the same thing for
protist or protozoan genomes I could do the same thing for bacterial genomes bacteria have viruses
too okay now what about the rest of our genome what about the rest of those two billion bases of
DNA about half of our genome half okay and by the way we're not going to leave much more for genes
here about half the genome is something called jumping genes also called transposons and these
are little segments of DNA again recognizable by computer programs so we're cruising along the A's
C's G's and T's and we come across these jumping genes and they also have their own particular
sequences that make them recognizable and they can jump in and out of place that's why they're
called jumping genes or transposons in and out of place and move around in our genome and some of
those look like they might be of viral origin so it may be that there are more than one third of
our genome is made up of viruses it depends on how we end up defining some of these jumping genes
so if we've got a third of the genome as viruses and a half of the genome was jumping genes
what does that leave us with it leaves us with less than 10 percent of the space being used for
our own genes so all those three billion bases and we're only using less than 10 percent of the
space for our own genes and we only have about 30,000 genes of our own that's far far fewer than the
number of viruses that we're carrying we're our load of of of DNA is mostly viruses and jumping
genes what does all that mean I don't know I mean this is one of the really exciting frontiers of
biology right now is trying to understand what it means that we're hauling around such a huge
lot of DNA that has nothing to do with actually coding for genes so here's a way to think about
viruses that are pathogens think of a continuum or a spectrum where the extreme left side of the
spectrum are beneficial organisms beneficial bacteria beneficial in this case viruses okay
think of the middle of the spectrum as being an area for benign relationships could be benign
bacteria could be benign viruses and it'll be viruses in this case and then think of the extreme
right side of the spectrum as being organisms that are in disharmony and out of synchrony or
viruses that are in disharmony or out of synchrony these will be our pathogenic viruses or our
pathogenic bacteria so this spectrum works for bacteria and it works for viruses okay now over
on the left side where we have the beneficial viruses and the benign viruses the ones that
we're hauling around with us I would like to go so far as to say they are us that's who we are just
as we are a load of bacteria we are also a load of viruses and most of our viruses are benign
there are even some that are being discovered to be beneficial so it's a whole new frontier of
virology is understanding our viruses that we're hauling around with us and then way over on the
right hand side are a few pathogens that are out of synchrony and disharmony is with us
and one of the reasons that viruses have become described as almost one and the same as pathogens
so that typically when you say virus to a person they'll think immediately pathogen has to do with
the way we study viruses or the way they have been traditionally studied and just for a moment I
want to take you back to Koch's postulate this is from several lectures ago I was talking about
the history of microbiology and I said one of the real achievements in the late 19th century
was that Dr. Koch of Germany came up with a set of procedures for determining whether or not
a bacterium is pathogenic and those procedures proceeded through looking for the bacteria in
the disease tissue getting the bacteria out onto a petri dish then getting the bacteria back into
an experimental organism to see if the disease was caused by the bacteria etc and in the important
thing about Koch's postulate the important thing about that procedure was that it was possible to
get the answer no it was possible to come out the end of that procedure and say no I was mistaken
that bacterium is not pathogenic contrast that with the way viruses have been traditionally
studied we're moving away from this now but this is the tradition of a viral study viruses are
much much tinier than bacteria viruses cannot be readily seen except with an electron microscope
which is not a typical thing for a laboratory to have so mostly we look for what viruses do
they actually look quite interesting under the microscope the ones that have a protein coat
look quite interesting but we don't typically look for them or look at them instead we look for what
they do now the problem is that they don't do much they do not do much at all so there's been a
long tradition of looking for destruction and pathogenicity for example if we were looking for
viruses we would spread a whole bunch of bacteria onto a plate we would add on viruses and we would
look for all the places where the viruses destroyed the bacteria if we were looking for viruses and
plants we might apply viruses in some way to a growing plant and then look for all the places
where the leaves were discolored or distorted or where something had gone wrong with the growth of
that plant so the definition of virus became conflated with a definition for pathogenicity
in fact it was almost impossible to talk about viruses without talking about destruction because
we didn't really have any good streamline methodologies for asking a question are you pathogenic the
answer was essentially always yes by these sorts of methods for for for describing them
um when we finally got um the genome projects underway and were able to analyze genomes
the big surprise was that we're full of viruses with no pathogenicity whatsoever and I would say
this is the new age of virology then um we don't necessarily have to be limited to looking for
viruses that are doing something destructive we can simply look through genomes and get an
idea of what viruses were carrying and and then make some some good guesses and maybe come up
with some other experimental methods for talking about um what they're doing and whether any of
them are beneficial they're at the very least benign so so where do viruses come from well
lots of people have done lots of good thinking about the evolution of viruses and I'll try to
summarize a little bit about what that thinking has been although there are no really sound conclusions
yet about viruses they're that mysterious and I think that that we're at a point where they're
more mysterious than they are not mysterious especially with with the new results from from
genome projects and discovering that we have such a load of viruses ourselves um let me start by
saying that I think the word virus as used by the software industry is actually a pretty good
metaphor when when the software industry first began to talk about computer viruses
you know invading a computer disrupting programs shutting down computers essentially
you know something invasive something pathogenic to computers I I thought that was a pretty good
metaphor that that appealed to me I don't always approve of of using biological metaphors outside
of biology but in this case I approved of it I think it's a pretty good metaphor for what the
pathogenic viruses are doing um that is what's happening with it with a software virus is a
little bit of information a little bit of coded information is somehow getting into your computer
perhaps through an internet um connection of some sort perhaps by some other method perhaps it was
there to begin with in some form or another so that little bit of information is somehow
run amok in your computer in your computer and doing some damage that that's what pathogenic
viruses are doing they're just a little bit of information and in some cases cases a little
bit of renegade information a little bit of you know seriously dysfunctional information
run amok in your cells those those are the pathogens what we are missing what we're lacking
is a good metaphor for the benign and beneficial viruses I I hope that will be coming someday I
hope that we'll get to a greater understanding of benign and beneficial viruses such that we'll
have a nice metaphor that people can use readily and we can get away from a pathogenic kind of view
of them but but that's the beginning of what I want to say about where they might be coming from
they might be little renegade bits of our own DNA that is um if you were to try to place them
on the family tree of all organisms and recall the big fan shaped family tree that I've been
talking about throughout this course with predominantly bacterial and archaeal branches
but with some branches off usually to the right side the way I think of about it um of fungi
and protists and plants and animals if I were to try to place the viruses on that family tree I would
maybe take a different color of pen and make them as tiny tiny little branches off of every
single major branch of organisms because I think the viruses are coming from the organisms themselves
they're just little bits of information from each and every organism on earth that is not completely
in sync especially the pathogenic ones with whatever the host is doing or are in sync and
and are just simply part of the DNA but not genes and not jumping genes but yet something else something
that that that is maybe a little more difficult to define we don't have the proper words to describe
them really so they are us they are all of the organisms they're they're bits of information
that that are are not completely compatible with all of the rest and yet surprisingly
compatible considering the number that we have with us so that's one way to think about it
let me tell you an alternative point of view though because this is important I don't want
to make it sound as though we're all settled in on where viruses come from it's it's it's complicated
there is another major hypothesis about this that suggests there's something really baseline
about them and if we go way down to the roots of that big family tree way down to the origin
of life somewhere around four billion years ago maybe we will find something going on and this
will be of course theoretical something that will extrapolate because we're not going to literally
find this but maybe we'll we will find that there was something going on with viruses at that time
they're very simple they're just DNA they're just RNA perhaps they are something vestigial from those
origins of life that are not well understood at all and then maybe somehow got incorporated into
all other organisms it's not clear but but you can see there are two major ways of thinking
about them on the family tree either you put them way down at the base and then you get them
eventually distributed throughout the family tree or you start them at each node along the family
tree and you say viruses are happening right now we're getting new viruses as we speak they're
evolving from organisms right now from their DNA now remember the pathogen cards that I used in the
last lecture turns out that some of those cards or are for viruses and I took those out of the deck
because I wanted to get a better picture of what it is that causes some viruses to under rare
circumstances be pathogenic and I found 25 approximately 25 viral cards in the deck and
what I want to say first of all is that unlike bacteria which can be arranged in a nice way
on the family tree and unlike any of the other organisms that can be it's very difficult to
take a group of viruses is as different as the different pathogens are and to come up with a
coherent taxonomy for them that that somehow manages to take all of their characteristics
in into consideration that is we're still relatively new at classifying viruses I'm not
saying that there aren't classification methods and I'll give you a little hint about what those
methods are like but I will say that I suspect that this is going to be a developing area of
virology that more and more will be done to try to get this into a more consistent classification
system right now viruses get defined by whether they are predominantly of DNA or predominantly of RNA
or whether they are going back and forth between those two information molecules and that makes some
sense although I will say that there are plenty of DNA viruses that probably don't have much to do
with each other there's no classification that really should lump them all together but that's
that's one of the ways of looking at them right now many of the pathogens also do an additional
thing they can make a little protein coat for themselves such that they could become protected
if they were to temporarily leave their host now they don't do anything inside of the protein
coat but think of it as a little protective particle which and here's the unfortunate part
could be transferred readily around and that's how viruses get transferred around usually when
they're inside these little little coats so viruses can also be classified according to
the shapes and structures of their their protein coats some of which are quite beautiful and
really interesting geometric shapes well worth looking at under the electron microscope which
again is not the kind of microscope that is typically in a microbiology lab but well worth
looking at pictures of viruses that can make coats so the combination of all of that along with some
really specific sequence information the exact sequence of the ac's g's and t's gives us our
viral classification which is inadequate at this time okay that's what I want to say about it so I
don't have a good thing to say about classification except for that here's another characteristic
of viruses that confounds things a little bit in a very intriguing way they are amazingly
promiscuous with their DNA I'm using that word again I use that also with bacteria with
horizontal transfer I'm using it with viruses too they readily shuffle their DNA around rearrange it
recombine it and that includes rearranging it and recombining it and shuffling it around
with the viral DNA of other organisms now this of course requires that that that different
organisms be in close contact and that we're talking about the kind of viruses that tend to be
pathogens the kind that are likely to be passed from or from animal to animal a really good example
is what seems to happen with flu viruses every single year that is some new bizarre chimeric
combination of viral DNA maybe coming from ducks maybe coming from pigs maybe coming from some
other farm animals get shuffled and recombined now these were potential pathogens to begin with
because these this viral DNA needed to get into contact with with other viral DNA but when it did
it did not hesitate in many cases to become integrated and to rearrange itself it's almost
as if you took two books cut up the pages of one book cut up the pages of another book got those
two books together and just re-tape the books into one big book with with pages from from from each
all in different orders now this presents a problem it means that it can be very difficult
to nail down exactly who a virus is that can be a problem for researchers who are trying to
make an educated guess about what sorts of flu viruses might be coming up in the next flu season
it can also be a problem for our immune systems which for the most part do a great job at controlling
potentially pathogenic viruses for for the most part they can recognize viruses and can immediately
put into action the set of of immune system activities that that i'm not going to elaborate on
but it can essentially control those viruses it makes it much more difficult if the virus is
constantly shuffling and recombining itself and acquiring pieces from other animals and
essentially making a new little version of itself every single season and essentially the immune
system has a great difficulty keeping up with that furthermore it's difficult for medical researchers
to then come up with an appropriate vaccination that we can all get if we're if we're able to
at the approach of the flu season and to to guarantee because i don't think there is any
guarantee for this that that vaccine will be effective for that particular flu that that's
coming around so that that's one of the characteristics of pathogens when there are
viral pathogens is this amazing shuffling and recombination of their genomes that can really
outsmart the the immune system and outsmart the medical researchers that are trying to
help our immune systems to respond appropriately so if i were to sum up viral pathogenicity
based on the 25 viral cards in my deck of pathogens let's say they tend to have protein
coats and in fact the picture on the cover of the of the card is usually a picture of a protein coat
they tend to have this ability to shuffle around their dna and therefore to fool our immune systems
and to fool the medical researchers who are trying to develop vaccines for them and they
tend to be in a relatively new relationship with us often a new relationship having previously been
in some other animal for example i mentioned some farm animals or it could be some other primate
now let me give you a few examples from the the the deck of cards to conclude this
quite a few viruses can be controlled with vaccinations or once you have had your
uh your interaction with those viruses your own immune system um leaves you with a resistance to
any further problems with those viruses that's the great news so think of measles think of mumps
think of rabies think of hepatitis in all of its forms and think of polio all of course horrific
consequences if you have a bad encounter with those viruses but the good news is that we are in an
age of vaccinations and you can be vaccinated against these and you also can can get your own
immunity against these so that's the wonderful news here here's the bad news it's extremely
difficult for reasons i just described to vaccinate against the flu it's also impossible so far to
vaccinate against hiv because hiv is one of these viruses that shuffles itself up and is
very difficult for our immune system to get a hold of the other problem problem with hiv is
it also tends to get deep inside of our own cells um where it can hide out and the immune system is
is not available to to control it when it's inside of ourselves and then ironically the common cold
which is one of our milder viral infections um but which is wonderful at coming up with new versions
of itself so that there are hundreds and hundreds of common cold viruses around and the problem is
that when you get a particular version of the common cold you then build up an immunity against
that and will probably not get that particular common cold virus again but there are hundreds more
waiting in the wings and so over the course of your life let's say that you live for a hundred years
you probably will continue to get one or two colds per year of one sort or another because
there are that many different cold viruses and it's why those two cannot be easily vaccinated
against you'd essentially have to have a cocktail of hundreds and hundreds of of of complex parts of
a vaccine in order to to come up with a with a comprehensive and probably one that wouldn't work
anyway vaccine against cold viruses so that concludes this um pair of lectures on pathogenicity
and uh we're going on to um some organisms that have absolutely not any pathogenicity associated
with them at all and that is in the next lecture on cyanobacteria
this ends lecture 11
