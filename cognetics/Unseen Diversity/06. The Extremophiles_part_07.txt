or steaming around the world taking water samples every few miles looking at all of the DNA
in those water samples not necessarily taking out every single bacterium and not necessarily
bringing them into the lab and not getting them onto petri plates but just getting the DNA out of
them and sequencing that DNA and looking through those DNA sequences and guess what
lots and lots and lots of genes for rhodopsin so it's very suggestive that open ocean bacteria
are also supplementing their regular metabolism with little solar powered pumps the jury's
still a little bit out on exactly how that's happening and how frequently it's happening
right at this point it's just been noticed that an awful lot of rhodopsin is is being produced
out on the open ocean so maybe this is not such an uncommon phenomenon maybe it's a fairly typical
way for bacteria to supplement ordinary food consumption so those are halo files and they've
got a little story with them so they're worth talking about and they're worth seeking out
even if you're not in an area where there are salt works or salt turns you may be able to see
them in piles of road salt you can also by the way go to a gourmet shop and purchase salt that has
been processed pretty directly from a salt turn type environment in which may still have a pinkish
tint to it especially if it's being sold as something very special and very natural and very
organic and if it's got a little pinkish tint to it those are probably halo philic bacteria or the
remains of halo philic bacteria which of course are not pathogens they just are on the salt and are
part of it being very natural and and organic so that that's yet another place where you could
catch a little glimpse of those and and have an opportunity to explain that the pink is the
rhodopsin of the solar powered pumps and for another example of extremophiles that are archaea
that have field marks and habitats that are interpretable and identifiable here's a favorite
of mine the methanogens and you can perhaps tell by their name that they are doing something with
methane methanogen means generating methane making methane and here's another example of a parallel
universe here's another example of a whole group of microbes living out of sight out of reach really
out of our perception it's very difficult for us to even conceive of what it's like to live where
they're living and yet conveniently enough not all that far away from us here are organisms that are
living deep in sediments in ponds and in swamps in any place where there's some kind of black or
brown muck that is the sort of thing that that suggests that larger organisms can't live there
but don't think of it as an area where no organisms are living at all that's where the methanogens
and all of their accompanying bacteria are living so let me see if i can explain what a little bit
of their life looks like and allude a little bit to some of the strange metabolisms that are going
down there but really then focus on the methane part of the story because that's the part of the
story that will allow you to to catch a glimpse of them in a previous lecture i said that the archaea
have many bacteria like properties and they can certainly look like bacteria that is to say
