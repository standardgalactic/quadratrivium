bacteria which can be seen sometimes in the wake of a boat both in temperate and tropical waters.
Sometimes you see a beautiful display of dinoflagellates out the back of a cruise ship going
through tropical waters for example and those are not bacteria and there are certain fish that
are bioluminescent so I start by disclaimers I'm telling you all the things that these are not so
that when you do see them you know what you're seeing okay so it's none of the above so bioluminescence
you're beginning to conclude I hope is pretty widespread and it is pretty widespread but again
the question comes up what are bacteria doing with this you can imagine why a firefly might be
blinking its lights off and on it's signaling to a mate there might be some reasons for certain
fish to be bioluminescent but what does a little bacterium need with giving off light and it is a
single bacterium giving off enough light to make a difference so let me see if I can explain this
a little bit the first thing to realize is that actually many many many chemical reactions give
off a certain amount of light but usually indetectably so usually nothing that you would remark on
nothing that would be worth remarking on but photons being given off by a reaction is not
all that unusual photons being the little incremental units of light so light being given
off by reactions is not unusual so as far as having a reaction giving off light that's not
what's interesting it's giving off a quantity of light a rather large quantity of light such
that if you had a whole group of these bacteria together they would actually glow one single
bacterium you wouldn't see but a whole group of them you would see glowing faintly in the dark
and why might they be doing that well here's how you might go about looking for them many of them
are marine and many of them are the normal digestive system bacteria of fish and other
ocean animals and when those fish die and begin to decay the bacteria begin to to participate
in that decay and can cause the entire fish to glow faintly in the light so where might you see
these you might be walking along a beach at night in a place where lights are not going to interfere
with your night vision and you might see a dead fish on the beach and you might see a faint faint
glow from that dead fish or you might have a bucket of shrimp that has gone past its prime
that is on its way to being used for bait and again it might be a pitch dark night because
it's got to be dark for you to see this and there might be just faintest eerie glow in that bucket
of of shrimp past its prime so those are bioluminescent bacteria that can glow in the dark from the
alpha proteose but there's more to the story because it this is a this is a reaction that
takes a fair amount of energy and it takes a fair amount of oxygen so why waste energy doing
something like this what could possibly be going on one of the things that might be going on is
that oxygen for the most part in the wrong place is harmful to many many chemical reactions so it
could be as simple as an oxygen detoxification mechanism and that's one hypothesis for how
this might have come about in some bacteria it's a way to take oxygen away just like the use of
hemoglobin in a previous example and to let that oxygen be occupied with something else rather than
