So I call it good news and bad news.
Here's some good news.
There was lots of speculation after the completion of the human genome project as to what some
of the consequences would be.
Lots of really fun speculation, including the beginning of a new field of bioethics considering
what it would mean to know your entire genome and what it would mean to know what genes
you had and what it would mean to know where particular traits, including disease traits,
were coming from, maybe even to be able to figure out what you would die of or what you
had a high probability of dying from.
So fascinating things to think about, but I think one of the most interesting and powerful
consequences of the completion of the human genome project was that suddenly, rather suddenly,
all of those sequences, those machines that were doing the sequencing, all those tens
of thousands of sequences and the humans that operated them, tens of thousands of humans
operating those sequences, felt idle, temporarily idle, because it was done, the genome was
done, and the analysis was just beginning, but as far as the cranking out of the actual
sequence, it was done, except that nothing's ever done, nobody just closes the door on
those sequences and says, well, that was done.
No, instead, they turn to other things that they might sequence, and it turns out that
it's very easy and quick to sequence a complete bacterium.
It's actually fairly difficult to sequence something as complicated as a human, and that
took a while, and those projects tend to take a while, but it's very easy to take a new
bacterium that you just isolated from a cave or the deep sea or the poles or pretty much
any place on earth, bring it back to the laboratory, have it sequenced relatively cheaply, because
the other great consequence of the human genome project was the technology developed to the
point where sequencing became cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, have it sequenced very,
very quickly, and as a result, one of the really growing aspects of sequencing is the
sequencing of bacterial and archaeal genome, so if you go to the government database of
sequences, which is NCBI, which is a public database where you can get any sequence of
any organism you want, you certainly can find the human genome sequences, and there's more
than one at this point, but you can find hundreds and hundreds of bacterial and archaeal sequences,
and it's being that particular part of the database is being updated every single day,
so that people who want to keep up with that need to look at it all the time, they need
to monitor it constantly, and it's thanks to that that we have such a rich understanding
now, and it's getting even richer by the day of what the bacterial and archaeal parts of
the family tree look like, so if I were to choose one really wonderful consequence of
the human genome project, besides a greater understanding of our own selves, it would
be a much, much greater understanding, a very exciting understanding of bacteria and archaea.
In the next lecture, I would like to elaborate more on those extreme bacteria that I alluded
to that are called the hyperthermophiles, the ones that are growing at near-boiling
temperatures and the ones that might be lineages dating back, probably not directly, but almost
directly from a time that is around when we call the origin of life.
