and we are giving out as waste products water and carbon dioxide now i'm going to review that
again in a moment but let me tell you what we get out of that when we break down the sugar
we are releasing the energy in the chemical bonds that was holding together that sugar and
if we're doing this right we are taking that energy and incorporating it into other chemical
bonds that we will be able to use ourselves for all sorts of things so we're essentially
taking chemical energy from our food that's our process of metabolism that's what it means to be
a heterotroph now let me dissect this just a little bit more so that you can see why the
particular waste products that we have make some sense for us we're taking sugar and i'll remind
you that it is C6H12O6 so hear the C's hear the H's and hear the O's there okay then inexplicably
oxygen okay and i will explain that eventually but right now it should seem a little strange to
you what are we doing with that oxygen why do we need to take in oxygen i mean the sugar makes
sense it's rich with carbons and rich with hydrogens it's terribly useful it's full of
wonderful bonds what's going on with the oxygen okay so we're going to take that C6H12O6
with the oxygen we're going to take it in through a complicated set of reactions that i won't go
into we're going to carefully take that sugar apart and we're going to end up with the C's
and the H's and the O's all kind of rearranged into much much smaller molecules and that's how
we get the H2O and that's how we get the CO2 we're down to pretty much the smallest molecules that
we can conveniently make out of those much larger food molecules that we started with
that's what we're doing that's what lots and lots and lots of bacteria are doing that's what
fungi are doing that's what animals in general are doing so that's a really universal sort of
activity that that is a type of heterotrophy here's what the sulfate reducers are doing
remember i said the sulfate reducers are just like us except they've got another little thing
going on they're taking sugar and where are they getting that sugar by the way well guess what they're
they're just underneath three layers of photosynthesizers that are making sugar in abundance
and making it in excess so it's actually very convenient for them to be right underneath this
wonderful source of food making that is the activity just over their heads so they're taking
sugar and they're taking sulfate SO4 sulfate instead of oxygen and they're processing that sugar
and in the end they're making hydrogen sulfide as a waste product hydrogen sulfide which is
what you smelled when you first approached this microbial mat so their waste product is the smell
of a microbial mat and is the smell of an estuary and is the smell of any kind of sulfurous smell
on the air they're the ones that are making the hydrogen sulfide and can you see this a little
cycle there because we had sulfur and sulfate as well as the waste products of the purple and green
sulfur bacteria that are just over the heads of these sulfate reducers and these sulfate reducers
are now taking that sulfate taking that sugar and they're ending up with hydrogen sulfide gaseous
hydrogen sulfide as a waste instead of water notice the the parallel between hydrogen sulfide
