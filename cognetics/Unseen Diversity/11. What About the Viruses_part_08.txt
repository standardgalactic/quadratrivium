really interesting geometric shapes well worth looking at under the electron microscope which
again is not the kind of microscope that is typically in a microbiology lab but well worth
looking at pictures of viruses that can make coats so the combination of all of that along with some
really specific sequence information the exact sequence of the ac's g's and t's gives us our
viral classification which is inadequate at this time okay that's what I want to say about it so I
don't have a good thing to say about classification except for that here's another characteristic
of viruses that confounds things a little bit in a very intriguing way they are amazingly
promiscuous with their DNA I'm using that word again I use that also with bacteria with
horizontal transfer I'm using it with viruses too they readily shuffle their DNA around rearrange it
recombine it and that includes rearranging it and recombining it and shuffling it around
with the viral DNA of other organisms now this of course requires that that that different
organisms be in close contact and that we're talking about the kind of viruses that tend to be
pathogens the kind that are likely to be passed from or from animal to animal a really good example
is what seems to happen with flu viruses every single year that is some new bizarre chimeric
combination of viral DNA maybe coming from ducks maybe coming from pigs maybe coming from some
other farm animals get shuffled and recombined now these were potential pathogens to begin with
because these this viral DNA needed to get into contact with with other viral DNA but when it did
it did not hesitate in many cases to become integrated and to rearrange itself it's almost
as if you took two books cut up the pages of one book cut up the pages of another book got those
two books together and just re-tape the books into one big book with with pages from from from each
all in different orders now this presents a problem it means that it can be very difficult
to nail down exactly who a virus is that can be a problem for researchers who are trying to
make an educated guess about what sorts of flu viruses might be coming up in the next flu season
it can also be a problem for our immune systems which for the most part do a great job at controlling
potentially pathogenic viruses for for the most part they can recognize viruses and can immediately
put into action the set of of immune system activities that that i'm not going to elaborate on
but it can essentially control those viruses it makes it much more difficult if the virus is
constantly shuffling and recombining itself and acquiring pieces from other animals and
essentially making a new little version of itself every single season and essentially the immune
system has a great difficulty keeping up with that furthermore it's difficult for medical researchers
to then come up with an appropriate vaccination that we can all get if we're if we're able to
at the approach of the flu season and to to guarantee because i don't think there is any
guarantee for this that that vaccine will be effective for that particular flu that that's
coming around so that that's one of the characteristics of pathogens when there are
viral pathogens is this amazing shuffling and recombination of their genomes that can really
outsmart the the immune system and outsmart the medical researchers that are trying to
