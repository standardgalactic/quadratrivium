Unseen Diversity, Lecture 9, Gram positives in the soil community.
This lecture continues the theme of gram positives. In the previous lecture we talked about
gram positive bacteria for the most part of our bodies and of our foods and our drinks,
all of the foods and drinks that make cuisine so much fun, so interesting. And this continues
along with the gram positives, these are the gram positives that are in the soil community.
And I would contend that this is one of the extreme environments that is inaccessible to us except
perhaps through our imaginations. We don't get too far down into the soil before we run into
some difficulties and yet there's an entire community of organisms down there. Here's what
the Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson said about a handful of garden soil. He said,
if I pick up a handful of garden soil, I'm picking up 10 billion bacteria,
handful of garden soil, 10 billion bacteria and perhaps thousands of species, thousands of
different species. No matter how you define species, whether it's a real species or it's a type or
variety, thousands of species. And this is yet another ongoing area of research,
another frontier of microbiology. We know very, very little about these thousands of species.
Right now there are sequencing projects in which scientists are doing just that,
taking up metaphorical handfuls of soil and sorting through all of the bacteria and taking
all of those sequences and analyzing them and trying to understand better just how complicated
the soil community is. Now, I would say that this little microcosm of soil or large microcosm is
off limits to us as off limits as the deep sea, as the rainforest canopy. We might be able to get
up there and catch a glimpse. We might be able to go down in a submersible and catch a little glimpse,
but I think we're only catching glimpses of the soil community as well. And as best you can,
try imagining being part of that soil community. Try imagining yourself as a gliding bacterium
capable of gliding over a moist film surface that is covering every particle of sand, every
particle of clay and every bit of debris that comprises rich soil. So imagine gliding through
that surface and here are some of the things you're going to see. You're going to see enormous
boulders of sand maybe made of quartz, sparkly white quartz, maybe smaller boulders of other
sorts of minerals and then the fine particles of clay you'll be gliding past those. And then here
and there you're going to see debris of something that has fallen to the forest floor and is in
some process of decomposition. Imagine a feather that has dropped from a bird and that feather is
in the process of being decomposed or a leaf that has fallen or a bit of bark or the feces or urine
of some organism and here it has fallen and is temporarily identifiable as part of the soil
construct and is on its way to being mere chemicals incorporated in other organisms.
And imagine this is a sort of fractal like network where it's like going through a cave system
going past structures of all sizes and into tiny crevices and the bacteria that are living in there
many many gram positives that are doing in a simplified way one of two things.
They are either competing with each other for nutrients which are going to be few and far
between which are going to be temporary which are going to be in some places scarce and in some
cases they're collaborating. So that's two different things that they're doing and two different things
that I'll address in this lecture. So we have soil microorganisms, soil bacteria that are competing
for those scarce nutrients, bit of a bird feather, a little flake of a leaf, little drop of urine
from some organism and then we surprisingly perhaps have organisms that are also collaborating
around those same scarce nutrients. It's almost like two different strategies both of which
work out just fine both of which are prevalent throughout soils and both of which make soils
actually very very interesting places. So let's start with competition and we'll start with the
actinobacteria that I mentioned in the previous lecture as being one of the two big groups of
gram positives and we have some of those on our skin and we have some of those in our fermented
foods and there are also actinobacteria all through the soil and here's where they really come into
their own with their thread like shape. They are shaped like tiny threads and when they are in the
vicinity of a nutrient that they can break down when they are in the vicinity of say for example
a little flake of a leaf that they're going to decompose a little further they surround it with
their threads and essentially take possession of it. The thread like habit is about encompassing
and in keeping away other microorganisms temporarily by making a little net like
structure around that bit of nutrient so that's a way to envision them. So again if you're gliding
through the soil community here and there you may see little bits of decomposing debris and
actinobacteria have taken it over and surrounded it by their tiny threads. Now if you dig through
soil looking for such tiny threads you will see some threads and I need to clear up what those are
you will be seeing threads of fungi. Fungi have larger cells they too make threads and they too
have that same strategy so here's our first example of competition we have tiny thread makers and
big thread makers the actinobacteria versus the fungi and it's a competition that extends further
than just simply making threads to encompass bits of decomposing food it extends much further than
that but that's the first glimpse of it and I will say that if you go into your compost heap or go
into your garden and take a nice trowel full of fresh soil and see faint white threads tiny white
threads in it know that you're seeing fungi. The actinobacteria are an order of magnitude
tinier and can only be visualized under a microscope but I'll also add that it can be
difficult to make a preparation directly from soil for the microscope for the purpose of seeing
actinobacteria. So instead for a field mark for the actinobacteria smell the soil that smell that we
associate with soil that smell of good rich soil or good rich compost is the smell of G osman
G E O S M I N the G part means earth the osman part means odor so it's the odor of the earth or the
smell of the earth is the etymology of that word and it happens to be the product of actinobacteria
so you're essentially smelling the field mark of of good soil and therefore of actinobacteria
at work in there it's one of my favorite field marks and it's one that you can confidently use
your nose for knowing that garden soil and compost is is not going to have any sort of pathogen that
you could accidentally get into your nose you're simply smelling this the smell of good earth that
you smell in the springtime or just after a rainstorm that's actinobacteria. What else are
they doing for competition they're making antibiotics fungi are making antibiotics
and actinobacteria are making antibiotics of all sorts and they're making them against each other
so that the other thing that actinobacteria and fungi do when they first encounter a bit of debris
that they're about to go through a decomposition process with is they begin to put out antibiotics
into the immediate environment for the purpose of preventing other microbes from encroaching
and it works well and you can actually see this in action on petri dishes and in fact some of the
early 19th century microbiologists Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur observed this they didn't know
quite what they were looking at at the point or they hadn't quite put it all together but when
they had colonies growing on petri dishes on nutrient media if those colonies got too close
together sometimes they would encroach upon each other sometimes they would grow up until
they were touching each other but sometimes they wouldn't sometimes they would leave zones around
themselves sort of a no man's land or a no microbes land where nothing could grow and
we're certainly no competing bacterium from the adjacent colony could grow and those were bacteria
and in some case fungi growing on plates who are producing antibiotics so it's one of the
easiest ways to get hold of some antibiotics is to get some actinobacteria or fungi growing
it was Alexander Fleming who first put together thoroughly and completely a story about penicillin
which comes from the fungus penicillium and I'm going to digress here a little bit about that
fungus most of these lectures only mentioned fungi and passing but this is a pretty important
fungus it was the it's a soil fungus commonly isolated from soils it also was a fungus that
makes certain cheeses more delicious such as blue cheeses and some of the white fuzzy surface
cheeses like camembert and breeze but it's also a fungus that produces penicillin the antibiotic
and it's doing it in competition with other soil microbes in its in its normal place in the soil
and it was Alexander Fleming who put it all together and realized that the colonies growing
on his plate that were avoiding the penicillin mold were in fact avoiding an important antibiotic
and this was the beginning of the antibiotic age in the early 20th century this continued
throughout the 20th century once people realized that this was going on in the soil and that the
soil was a rich source of antibiotics soil microbiology became an important subfield
of microbiology and I don't think it would have become such an important subfield if it had not
been for the great interest in finding new antibiotics and a researcher named Selman
voxman w a k s m a n was one of the real forerunners throughout the 20th century for examining
soil microbes very closely both actinobacteria and fungi and isolating antibiotics from them
and and and really bringing a lot of antibiotics to market which made the whole 20th century
relatively good point to be getting bacterial infection if you are unfortunate enough to
do so because the chances are you would be cured of it with an antibiotic so it was all very good
news for medicine it's an interesting little side problem though with antibiotics and that is
this is not any old kind of competition going on it's a little bit like the kind of escalation
that goes on with weapons in warfare so just as quickly as organisms produce antibiotics of various
sorts and variations on those antibiotics just as quickly it seems to occur that other organisms
become resistant to those antibiotics it makes some sense if the competition for scarce nutrients
and soil is is that much of a competition it makes a lot of sense that you would be both
making antibiotics and making anti antibiotics and so that is the case and any environment in
which there are a lot of antibiotics already present is a great environment for organisms
to be antibiotic resistant makes a lot of sense sounds even a little bit circular but I'm going
to elaborate a little bit more on it in a bit because it's not just circular it's actually
a very important point about our own use of antibiotics before I go to that though recall
what I have said about horizontal transfer of DNA and how prolific bacteria are in this process
how promiscuous they are how DNA is exchanged from one to another across so-called species
boundaries so that the family tree of bacteria is just one interacting network of exchanges
by some depictions one type of DNA that gets exchanged and readily used especially if the
environment is full of antibiotics is the the genes that confer resistance to antibiotics okay
the genes that confer anti antibiotic activity maybe as a way to think about it
and again I'm going to make my my circular reasoning point again this is only the case
in environments that have antibiotics in them there's no particular advantage in having an
antibiotic or resistance to antibiotics in an environment that lacks antibiotics okay why am
I making that point well let me give you a short list of environments that are full of
antibiotics so you can see what the problem is soils have antibiotics but not all through them
they're very locally and specifically produced okay so even though soils are a marvelous place
to look for antibiotics I wouldn't look for huge quantities of them in a bucket of soil
I'd look at very localized areas where very specific microorganisms were competing with
very specific other microorganisms so very local very specific interactions with antibiotics
and therefore very local and very specific use of resistance to antibiotics makes a lot of sense
here comes some of the bad news though hospitals are a wonderful place to find antibiotic resistant
bacteria because hospitals are full of antibiotics and these antibiotic resistant bacteria really
aren't going to be found in many other places except for those where antibiotics are in heavy
use our own bodies when we are in the midst of a treatment with antibiotics for some disease are
also unfortunately good places to find bacteria that are hanging on to bits of DNA that confer
antibiotic resistance they have no reason to do so otherwise and they don't and in fact there's even
there are some detrimental aspects to hanging on to bits of DNA that are not useful so bacteria
that are not in the presence of antibiotics often lose their antibiotic resistance it's good
it's fine but as long as there are antibiotics around there that is enough incentive to hang
on to that DNA and that resistance petri dishes in laboratories in which scientists are studying
antibiotics are wonderful places to find antibiotic resistant bacteria deliberately this is how it
gets studied you take a petri dish of bacteria and there are antibiotics on it and you find out
just how powerful that can be all of the bacteria that were not resistant die and you don't have
them anymore all of the bacteria that had any little bit of resistance to that antibiotic stay
alive it's one of the most powerful things you can do in the laboratory to see just how strong a
selection it is for those bacteria that can withstand the antibiotic it's a great demonstration of that
and then finally the additional bit of bad news another place where more and more nowadays we can
find massive amounts of antibiotics in use is an industrial scale animal stockyards where animals
are being kept for intensive feeding before slaughter beef cattle and other sorts of animals
that we typically use for food are being given antibiotics prophylactically to protect them
presumably from whatever could occur to them under such crowded conditions whatever diseases might come
up in those weeks when they're being fattened up in stockyards under terrible conditions before
they they head into a slaughterhouse I say terrible conditions because often very crowded and often
being fed large amounts of food that that their digestive systems are not accustomed to and that's
a really unfortunate thing because it also therefore turns out to be a great place to isolate
resistant bacteria to antibiotics and that really is in a nutshell the root of the problem that we're
encountering more and more with antibiotics it's not about soils and for the most part it's not
about our own individual bodies under treatment with antibiotics appropriate treatment but there's
more and more trouble coming out of these animal stockyards and there of course is always perennial
trouble in hospitals as a challenge in hospitals because they must use the antibiotics and they
must be vigilant about how they handle that so I'll say more about that when I get to the lecture
on pathogens because I think it's important and it's that kind of misuse what I think is a misuse
of antibiotics that I think is is at the root of some of the peculiar exotic pathogens that
we're encountering more and more in places where they really should be unexpected so so more about
that misuse of antibiotics in the next lecture meanwhile I want to talk about collaborations
in the soil it's a little bit of the flip side of the coid on what's going on in soil but also
some of the same bacteria that are collaborating are also producing some antibiotics so it's a
complicated community there's it's not an either or thing and I also want to use the word collaboration
cautiously it's got lots of human connotations it maybe it implies something nice and friendly and
thoughtful and and it's none of that I mean it's nothing but a metaphor for the sort of
activities that seem to go pretty well when more than one organism is involved with them
um and we call it collaboration here here's how it goes let's say that um a feather falls to the
forest floor and organisms presumably are going to go to work to decompose that feather down to
its basic nutrients there could be one microorganism that has as its particular task to break down that
feather from the very beginning to the very end but it turns out there isn't it turns out
much much more the case that there are a set of microorganisms that each take a turn at one
particular aspect you could say they're specializing in one aspect of that decomposition and what they're
doing is is is waiting in fact some scientists have called it watchful waiting another metaphor
another you know human centered sort of metaphor but maybe a useful one here watchful waiting for
a particular event in the process of decomposition that they can participate in and let me see if
I can give you one complete example of this let's say that something has fallen to the forest floor
and it is full of protein um let's say it's part of a dead animal okay so think of protein as a
nutrient with lots of nitrogen in it that would be useful for almost any organism but who goes to
work and attacks at first will be a group of bacteria called the ammoni fires and those
ammoni fires are doing what the word suggests they are making ammonia ammonia and fire the fire
ending means making so making ammonia and that ammonia is but one step in the entire process
that is going to break down that that bit of protein that bit of dead animal completely but
let me give you an example of where you may have smelled the field mark of an amount modifying
bacterium if you've ever had a cat litter box that maybe was an extra need of changing or have ever
been by a chicken house that was in need of cleaning out you may have smelled a little
whiff of ammonia and those are the ammonifying bacteria at work taking whatever protein was in
the cat feces or in the chicken feces and and taking it to the next step in that process of
making ammonia you're less likely to smell it out in the woods because even though I'm using a soil
example because you're not going to get concentrated feces out there such that that ammonia would be
something that you could detect with your nose but there's your field mark of the first step
of breaking down or decomposing something with protein in it the next step is done by at least
two types of bacteria both of which will call the nitrifiers I'm not naming names here because I
think it's going to be enough to get some processes named and it's not always important to get every
last genus and species for things but the nitrifiers and what they are doing is the first set of them
is taking that ammonia and making nitrite and the second set of them is taking that nitrite
and making nitrate and let me pause there and tell you exactly where you can catch a glimpse of this
okay good so first it seems a little arcane how are you going to see or smell nitrite and nitrate
if you maintain an aquarium of fish and those fish of course are defecating into the water
then you need to have some sort of a system to make sure that the feces of the fish are cleaned
out on a regular basis otherwise you're going to have some serious problems and affect a lot of
aquarium water testing kits are all about testing levels of ammonia and nitrate and nitrite and
you're essentially testing how your nitrifying bacteria are doing because many natural aquarium
filters that get set up by people who are serious hobbyists and want to really keep their water
in a pristine condition are set up with nitrifying bacteria who do very well with taking ammonia
from the fish the waste of the fish and taking it straight to nitrate and beyond there are
additional steps that we will get to and when you are doing those aquarium tests you're simply
monitoring their process you're saying how are you guys doing with a nitrite how are you doing
with a nitrate I hope the levels are down and they typically aren't a good aquarium so you've
seen if you've done anything at all with freshwater aquariums you've seen nitrifiers in action and
you've actually tested them so the next step is to take that nitrate and to turn it into nitrogen
gas which will then diffuse away from the soil of the forest or from the aquarium or from the water
or wherever it is turn it back into nitrogen gas and there are bacteria called the denitrifiers
that do that and they are doing something quite amazing that I'm going to try to fit into a
subsequent lecture that that addresses some more issues of bacterial metabolism for the
for the moment let me just leave you with sort of a tantalizing image and maybe a bit of foreshadowing
about these denitrifiers that are taking nitrate from nitrate to gaseous nitrogen
they're essentially breathing nitrate just as we breathe oxygen so as part of our normal
metabolism we take in oxygen we use it in a particular way that I want to elaborate on
right this moment and then we breathe out some waste products including carbon dioxide and water
vapor what these denitrifiers are doing is taking in nitrate and using it in the same way that we
use oxygen and then releasing waste products one of which is nitrogen gas okay so completely analogous
there are compatriots in our in the in the microbial world they just happen to be using a different
oxygen rich molecule for part of their metabolism than we are so their final waste product is
nitrogen gas out that goes into the atmosphere and the one thing I want you to recall is we talked
about nitrogen fixers in a previous lecture the example was rhizobium it was an alpha proteobacterium
I also said that some cyanobacteria which are coming up in their own lecture can fix nitrogen
as well as quite a number of other bacteria it's it's a it's a fairly common bacterial function
although exclusively a bacterial function and so what we've essentially just done is a complete
nitrogen cycle because if I could just remind you those nitrogen fixers are going to take
nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and send it right around again to something like ammonia
which can then be incorporated into to organism so we've just completed an entire nitrogen cycle
and it's one of the many many cycles that are going on in soil it's one of many many collaborations
of specialists that are occurring in soil to break down whatever tumbles onto that soil
now I did not mention anything about tiny soil animals or soil fungi not to mention
larger animals that might be scavenging certainly if a large animal falls to the ground in the soil
there might be some larger animals in turn that come to scavenge it up so I am simplifying this
a little bit obviously there's going to be a great deal of competition for any large amount
of nutrients but I do want to emphasize a couple of things some of the processes in the nitrogen
cycle are really only done by bacteria and so there are parts of this cycle that would grind
to a stop if we had no bacteria there are some parts that would go along just fine we have animals
eating animals and passing a lung protein all the time bypassing this cycle and and there's not a
problem with that but there are some parts of this cycle that are completely microbial and so
I like to say that for most of the biochemical cycles for most of the the cycles of nutrients
in the soil you need bacteria obligately and at least some parts of it and nitrogen cycle is a
great example of that so there is an interesting continuum with decomposition it continues all
the way into the bodies of organisms that are eating decomposing material and there are challenges
for organisms that are eating materials that have not even yet yet begun to decompose such as parts
of plants and I want to to set up this problem in a particular way I want to take an image from a
typical ecology book and try to describe it to you and then present the problem and how it is
that bacteria solve the problem and I will also say that this is a problem that's not always
acknowledged especially since ecology has traditionally focused on larger organisms
interactions between plants and animals and this is all about interactions between
plants and animals and I'm going to stick in a bacterial component to this that is my goal
so here's a typical diagram that you find often in ecology textbooks which is which is quite useful
it's a pyramid that becomes very skinny on top because it represents at its base all of the plants
in a particular community and let's say just to put some numbers on this so we can visualize
numbers let's say there are 10 000 plants in a particular community and I have a box
at the bottom of my pyramid that represents those 10 000 plants the next level of my pyramid
has 1000 herbivores 1000 plant eaters it is 10 percent it represents 10 percent of the previous
level what I'm saying is there are 10 percent fewer of those herbivores than there were of plants
so a large plant community can support a herbivore community that might be leaf munching insects for
example or leaf munching cattle or leaf munching deer it can support 10 percent fewer of those
now the next level up are the carnivores and if my numbers so far are 10 000 plants 1000
herbivores my number at my next level that represents the carnivores that might eat those
herbivores is 100 and if I go yet up another level to those carnivores that might be eating
other carnivores and there won't be very many of those that number will be 10 so each level
has decreased to 10 percent of the previous level and that's a typical pyramid that's depicted in
ecology textbooks as being really fundamental to the chain of food use throughout an ecological
community from plants to herbivores to carnivores and yet to more carnivores who might be eating
carnivores for example a snake that that is being eaten by a hawk for example would be a carnivore
eaten by a carnivore what I want to point out is when a carnivore eats a carnivore or when a
carnivore eats a herbivore it has a one-to-one correspondence with its food it is essentially
the same thing as its food the same proportion of protein the same proportion of carbohydrates the
same proportion of all the other nutrients and so incorporating that herbivore or incorporating
that carnivore is really not much of a problem and I can't evoke many bacteria into that process
at least not in a major way that step at the bottom though that step in which we go from the
10,000 plants to the 1,000 herbivores is an enormous step because there is no herbivore
that is in a one-to-one correspondence in respect to the structure and in components of its body
with with plants plants are strikingly different from herbivores and so I will say that all
herbivores are a sort of specialist on whatever part or type of plant they are eating some herbivores
just specialize in plant sap some herbivores such as termites specialize in the wood part of plants
which is really a remarkable diet and which has no resemblance whatsoever to the termite itself
there's no one-to-one correspondence between wood and the termite some herbivores specialized just
in grass such as cattle and in other grass eating organisms like that there's no one-to-one
correspondence between grass and cattle other herbivores are eating leaves and other parts of
plants it's a huge problem and bacteria are the mediators that allow that step that essential
step in that pyramid of food interactions to occur at all what they essentially do is convert
plant material of various sorts whether it's just the sap or just the wood or just the leaves or
just the stems or just the blades of grass or just the roots whatever part of the plant is being
eaten and convert it and supplement it into sufficient balanced nutrients that can sustain
a herbivore there is no herbivore that is not having some assistance from the microbial world
in turning that diet into something usable now for the most part i'm talking about bacteria in
the digestive system bacteria by the way which we don't have as humans we're omnivores so we're
selectively taking food from different parts of the spectrum of nutrients and essentially by
gathering and putting together different foods are getting a rough one-to-one correspondence and
therefore are a little less dependent on bacteria for a massive supplement of our diet i'm talking
about real plant specialists who have an exclusive diet just of leaves just of grass just of wood
really extraordinary diets or just of plant sap be a little bit analogous to when you go into a
grocery store you're loading up your grocery cart with some source of protein some carbohydrates
some source of fats or lipids variety of fruits and vegetables we're talking about going into the
grocery store if you were a plant sap eater and that was all you ate going straight to the maple
syrup aisle loading up your cart with maple syrup and heading out it sounds really efficient but
you can't do it unless you've got backup from the microbial world so any organism that has that
specialized a diet and i will say it's all of the herbivores it's all of that second tier of the
pyramid are entirely reliant on on a microbial um interaction in order to supplement their diet
now there are a couple of additional things that i need to say so that we don't
give bacteria all of the credit for this there are a great many fungi that also assist with this
so it's the microbial world in its extended definition in this case it's not just the bacteria
as members of the microbial world that also includes some fungi but the point is there's
no herbivore there's no animal herbivore that's doing it on its own and this even extends to those
predators that specialize in particular animal parts and i'll give you an example think about
mosquitoes what are they eating well the female mosquito has a diet of blood and that's a pretty
specific diet for that female mosquito the male mosquito by the way is is a plant sap eater so he's
got a pretty specific diet too they've got symbionts in them they have bacterial symbionts that make
that really specialized diet possible so this is something that also extends to the higher echelons
of that pyramid that we just constructed but my my most important point is that there's nothing
that that leaves the base of that pyramid without the help of microbes um and it's in it's a way to
conclude this lecture that has been about gram positives of the soil because i would argue that
from the point of view of those gram positives it's the soil it's the inside of an organism it's
back out to the soil again and it's all one continuum as far as they're concerned it's a microbial world
as far as they're concerned and they're just facilitating via what they might see from their
point of view as a fermentation bat which is a way to describe what what cattle look like
enormous fermentation like that bodies absolutely filled with microbes digesting grass and extremely
unlikely diet for an animal that size and yet they're doing it successfully on these four stumpy
legs fermentation bats on the legs and uh from the microbial point of view it's just all one
continuum of nutrients in one place or another so that concludes this lecture on the gram positives
and next comes the uh long promised lecture on pathogens um and i will also include in that lecture
a little something to try to help fit the viruses into their proper place um the viruses are really
a big enough topic that they require their uh would require an entire set of lectures just on
themselves and are not really completely on topic for this course but i'm going to try to fit them
into the pathogens um in the next lecture
this ends lecture nine
