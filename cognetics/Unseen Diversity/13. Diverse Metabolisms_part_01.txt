you're choosing carefully and there should be a little bit of a smell of sulfur in a nice way in
the air and the first thing you might be fortunate enough to see is the felt like mats of cyanobacteria,
the cyanose we were talking about in the previous lecture and I say felt like in the sense of if
you were to take some dryer lint and kind of mat it together in your hands you would make a sort of
felt and that's really the consistency of these mats. Now what color are they going to be? Probably
blackish to brownish because these cyanose are out in the blazing sun for the most part and
are going to be using their camouflage colors or their sunglasses colors to protect their
major photosynthetic pigment which is chlorophyll, but they are going to be on the surface,
these are our surface photosynthesizers and you may also be lucky enough to see little bubbles
of oxygen in amongst the felt like texture of this mat of cyanobacteria and that is their waste
product, that bubbling oxygen is their field mark, one of their waste products, the one that
essentially was the greatest pollution event ever to have occurred on earth, all of the oxygen that
has been accumulating from the activities of cyanobacteria photosynthesis. One of the nice
things about seeing cyanobacteria in this context is if you put your ear very very close to that
felt like mat with the bubbling oxygen it sounds like champagne effervescing so it's one of the
auditory field marks of bacteria as well and actually hear the bubbles being formed especially
if you are in an area where the tide is coming back in and is about to recover
an area of mats that has been temporarily high and dry. Now underneath that layer of cyanobacteria
we'll scrape it away very very gently just a millimeter or two down don't scrape too much just
a little brush of your hand sometimes is sufficient if we're lucky we're going to see a beautiful
pinkish purple scum of another type of bacterium now sometimes there are circumstances where this
pinkish purple scum will be up on the surface it'll be the first thing that you see those are
those are situations in which you ought to be smelling quite a bit of sulfide in the air
that's that that would be a situation where sulfide was especially abundant for some reason
but ordinarily you're going to gently move aside that layer of cyanobacteria and right
beneath will be the most beautiful purple and pink scum let me tell you what these bacteria are
they are purple sulfur bacteria they are of the proteobacteria they are photosynthesizers or photo
autotrophs and let me briefly remind you what the equation was for the cyanobacteria so I can
contrast it with the purple sulfur bacteria because these are two major kinds of photosynthesis or
photo autotrophy recall that the cyanobacteria were taking water and carbon dioxide and using
the energy of the sun to make sugar and oxygen as a waste product what the purple sulfur bacteria are
doing is taking hydrogen sulfide instead of h2o which is water hydrogen sulfide plus carbon dioxide
with the energy of the sun making sugar and now what's their waste product their waste product
is sulfur so think about h2o and h2s the starting compounds of those two types of photosynthesis
on one hand we're starting with an oxygen rich compound that's h2o or water on the other hand
