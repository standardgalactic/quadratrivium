capable of sending out radio waves that we could pick up somehow but there's another whole school
of thought one that I tend to favor and that is we should be looking at some sort of bacterial
like activity and the whole chemo autotrophic type of metabolism really helps us through a
situation where you have a planet that might be icy cold on its surface but molten in its
interior and there must be some place between icy cold and molten that is of some reasonable
temperature where there might be liquid water and yet you're far below the photic zone you're
deep inside of the planet presumably what could possibly be living down there well it's why chemo
autotrophs are so interesting to these planetary biologists or astrobiologists they're a fascinating
type of metabolism that makes possible some scenarios that they enjoy thinking about it's
it's still a very much of an ongoing subject but but but you will find them often in reference to
thinking about how we ought to be thinking about the possibilities of extraterrestrial life
by the way I I'm going to finish this lecture by coming back to ourselves I began this set
of lectures for this course with talking about how anomalous we are how enormous we are how
multicellular we are how terrestrial we are and that was all presented as is why the our particular
point of view is is is challenging for really understanding the bacteria and seeing the bacteria
but now I want to come around again and talk about how all of that is actually due to bacteria our
enormous size our multicellularity our terrestrial way of life all of that that that is that is a
part of us and is a part of the problem with our point of view sometimes is is is due to bacteria
it's thanks to bacteria so I want to go back briefly to the timeline that I've been talking
about through this entire course the four billion time four billion year timeline I want to go back
to that point at two and a half billion years ago where I said all sorts of exciting symbiosis
were occurring and where complex larger cells were evolving that would eventually come into the
lineages that would be plants and animals and fungi and protus including ourselves in those
lineages and one of the symbiosis that occurred is that bacteria who could take food and oxygen
and metabolize it very efficiently and produce as waste products carbon dioxide and water
which is just what we do those bacteria came on board as symbionts and became our mitochondria
became our specialized cell structures called mitochondria that are where our metabolism
occurs so our metabolism the food the oxygen the production of carbon dioxide and water
is entirely due to our mitochondria which are symbiotic bacteria from way back they still have
vestiges of their DNA from when they were free living organisms and by the way they were free
living bacteria of the proteobacteria so we're carrying around proteobacteria with us that
still have little remnants of their genome that's how come we get to metabolize the way we do
but there's a little more I promise to say something about what was going on with oxygen
because on one hand I've been talking about it as a toxic molecule which it is but on the other
hand I've been acknowledging as I should that it's absolutely essential for those heterotrophs
