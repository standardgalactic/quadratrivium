On the other hand, by attempting to put myself more in the position of a bacterial point of view,
I think I can see the bacterial world a little more completely and a little more clearly.
And then I would even dare to use the word bacteriophilic, loving bacteria.
That word also came easily.
I've used quite a few words in this course with philic at the end,
like thermophilic and halophilic.
So that I stumbled upon bacteriophilic as well.
Loving bacteria, appreciating the bacterial load that you have,
appreciating that you are mostly bacteria, appreciating your mitochondria,
which originated as symbiotic bacteria in which you're providing you with enough energy
to be the enormous and complicated and energetic organism that you are.
So I would even go so far as saying bacteriophily might be the final and absolute goal for this course
and one that you might consider embracing yourself.
Thank you for listening to this course on bacteria.
Thank you for listening to these 14 lectures.
I enjoyed giving them.
I hope you enjoyed listening to them.
Even to an unseen audience, it's a pleasure to talk about bacteria
and the idea that I might be introducing even a small number of people to the world of bacteria
and doing so in a positive way has been a great pleasure for me.
So thank you for listening.
