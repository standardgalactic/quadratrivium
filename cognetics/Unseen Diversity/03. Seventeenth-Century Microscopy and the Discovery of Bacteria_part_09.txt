long, multi-part poems called The Essay on Man. And I want to close this lecture with
a four line quotation from that. See if you can hear him talking about science in this.
One of the amazing things about Alexander Pope is you can find just about everything in science
being discussed in this essay on man. So here's Alexander Pope to close this lecture. See through
this air, this ocean, and this earth, all matter quick and bursting into birth above how high
progressive life may go around how wide, how deep, extend below. That's Alexander Pope,
who certainly by that time had looked at things through a microscope, by the way. He was a
very well educated person and was fascinated with both of these things. And he was a very
fascinated with both things that could be seen through the telescope and things that could be
seen through the microscope. That concludes microscopy of the 17th century, completely
dominated by Van Luen Hook. And we are now going to skip all the way to the 19th century.
And that may seem peculiar to people who enjoy history of any sort. Why are we skipping the 18th
century? Lots of microscopy occurred in the 18th century. Lots of science occurred in the 18th
century. It was a fascinating time to be working in the field of science, as it always is. But the
real next bunch of innovations occurred in the later part of the 19th century for looking at an
understanding bacteria. There was a hiatus of lots of other different aspects of science being
developed, but it wasn't until the end of the 19th century that bacteriology or microbiology as a field
picked up once again in brand new things were being discovered. And so that's why we're going to fast
forward in the next lecture to the last part of the 19th century.
