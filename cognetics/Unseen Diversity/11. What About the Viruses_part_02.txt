process that is be killed and used for meat and that's of great concern to people who are running
cattle feedlot so there needs to be sort of an air of healthiness around these animals and again
that's why these antibiotics are being used ahead of need prophylactically in vast quantities
now when the animals defecate and urinate out go those antibiotics in some cases
into the manure into the urine sometimes they end up in big holding lagoons sometimes they end up in
local water supplies or being used on fields to fertilize vegetables so it's why the problem
sometimes can extend beyond meat and into our supply of commercially grown vegetables as well
so back to the super strains of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus unfortunately it's why these
are coming up in our food supply and I think for the most part it can be traced back to this use
of antibiotics I think it's controllable that happens to be my opinion and I guess I would
suggest that there may be a time in years to come when this is sufficiently recognized
that we won't be having super strains of bacteria coming out of cattle feedlots and coming out of
our vegetable supply meanwhile though you might consider eating locally and eating organically
as much as possible and being maybe cautious about certain commercially grown aspects of our food
supply the next section of this lecture pertains to viruses and I will say that when I was planning
this course from the beginning it was my intent to not take much time away from the bacteria
themselves bacteria are a huge topic unto themselves and I needed pretty much all the time in this
course to to talk about them and to get a really thorough background in place so that I could
talk in more detail about certain aspects of them so I've really only mentioned other organisms
in their context with bacteria I have not done justice to the fungi which are a fascinating
group of their own right I've only talked about fungi in respect to bacteria I've not done much
with animals except that they are hosts of bacteria not done much with plants and protists
and I've not done much with viruses but I want to linger a bit on the viruses for the the conclusion
of this lecture or for the second part of this lecture because I think there are some prevalent
misunderstandings about them around pathogenicity to the point where people often equate pathogenic
bacteria with pathogenic viruses they're all under the umbrella of pathogenic and sometimes mix up
the two get confused about exactly whether they're talking about a viral disease or a bacterial
disease and it actually makes a huge difference so I want to linger on this a little bit and
put the viruses into their context what are they well this is going to be a little bit
unsatisfying it's unsatisfying to me too but they are genetic entities and I think the reason
that that's not a satisfying definition but a definition we're stuck with for the time being
is because terminology scientific terminology has not caught up with the science of viruses
we're we're still lingering with terminology that that began to be put into place back when we first
were understanding what viruses were and it was really the early part of the 20th century um
but we we we're still understanding things and learning new things about viruses so I would say
that to call them a genetic entity is is not terribly helpful but let me develop it a little
