is is is attached to the bottom what you're seeing is a zonation of seaweeds with different pigments
that are taking advantage of the different wavelengths of light that can get down through
the water turns out that blue wavelengths of light get more easily down into the depths of the water
than red wavelengths of light and and i'll just use blue and red as the example we could actually
take the entire color spectrum and talk about what each wavelength does in respect to getting
through water but blue and red are a good compare and contrast so that the seaweeds that are up
highest on the rock the bright green ones are receiving um more of a full spectrum of light
and are doing more like what land plants do um that they're bright green they've got their chlorophylls
displayed and they're doing a kind of photosynthesis that they can take full advantage of the spectrum
of light that's coming in the seaweeds that are in the lower zones along the edge of the rock
must use accessory pigments in brownish and yellowish and reddish colors to take up whatever
wavelengths of light they can manage to get um and to pass that light on to their to their other
metabolizing molecules uh turns out that red wavelengths of light don't get very deep into
the water you know this if you've ever had a red bathing suit and and gone deep into the water and
notice that the red color fades away um red color seems to disappear or if you've ever been in some
sort of submersible um vessel where you've been um looking at your clothing in the light of of of
deep water um then you might notice that the red seemed to disappear so this is a challenge for
seaweeds and it's a challenge for the purple and green sulfur bacteria and so it's why these
different layers whether we're talking about seaweeds or talking about these these layers of
bacteria are so different they're actually taking advantage of whatever they can get of the light
that is descending down through these depths and the lower you go um the more you lose some of the
crucial wavelengths of light and the more you've got to make up for it with some extra pigments
now the next layer of bacteria is represented by black often black or very dark sediments with
a strong sulfury smell that lie just below the layer of green sulfurs and this is the layer where
a group of heterotrophs called the sulfate reducers reside and they have some very prominent
field marks but first let me linger on that word heterotrophy they're heterotrophs just like us
that is they are food eaters just like us they do not generate their own food but they have a couple
of interesting differences so i'm going to compare our metabolism with their metabolism so that you
can get a feel for for for what the difference what the primary difference is here's what we're
doing we're taking in sugar and we're taking in oxygen and by the way sugar represents all food
so i don't mean that our diet consists entirely of sugar i'm using sugar as a representational
food molecule you could be taking in steak you could be taking in corn on the cob you could
be taking in all sorts of things but sugar is is going to represent all possible foods
we're taking in sugar we are taking in oxygen with every single breath we take we are then
processing that sugar and breaking it down into its smallest component parts
