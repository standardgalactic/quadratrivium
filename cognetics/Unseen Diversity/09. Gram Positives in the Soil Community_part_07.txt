there might be some larger animals in turn that come to scavenge it up so I am simplifying this
a little bit obviously there's going to be a great deal of competition for any large amount
of nutrients but I do want to emphasize a couple of things some of the processes in the nitrogen
cycle are really only done by bacteria and so there are parts of this cycle that would grind
to a stop if we had no bacteria there are some parts that would go along just fine we have animals
eating animals and passing a lung protein all the time bypassing this cycle and and there's not a
problem with that but there are some parts of this cycle that are completely microbial and so
I like to say that for most of the biochemical cycles for most of the the cycles of nutrients
in the soil you need bacteria obligately and at least some parts of it and nitrogen cycle is a
great example of that so there is an interesting continuum with decomposition it continues all
the way into the bodies of organisms that are eating decomposing material and there are challenges
for organisms that are eating materials that have not even yet yet begun to decompose such as parts
of plants and I want to to set up this problem in a particular way I want to take an image from a
typical ecology book and try to describe it to you and then present the problem and how it is
that bacteria solve the problem and I will also say that this is a problem that's not always
acknowledged especially since ecology has traditionally focused on larger organisms
interactions between plants and animals and this is all about interactions between
plants and animals and I'm going to stick in a bacterial component to this that is my goal
so here's a typical diagram that you find often in ecology textbooks which is which is quite useful
it's a pyramid that becomes very skinny on top because it represents at its base all of the plants
in a particular community and let's say just to put some numbers on this so we can visualize
numbers let's say there are 10 000 plants in a particular community and I have a box
at the bottom of my pyramid that represents those 10 000 plants the next level of my pyramid
has 1000 herbivores 1000 plant eaters it is 10 percent it represents 10 percent of the previous
level what I'm saying is there are 10 percent fewer of those herbivores than there were of plants
so a large plant community can support a herbivore community that might be leaf munching insects for
example or leaf munching cattle or leaf munching deer it can support 10 percent fewer of those
now the next level up are the carnivores and if my numbers so far are 10 000 plants 1000
herbivores my number at my next level that represents the carnivores that might eat those
herbivores is 100 and if I go yet up another level to those carnivores that might be eating
other carnivores and there won't be very many of those that number will be 10 so each level
has decreased to 10 percent of the previous level and that's a typical pyramid that's depicted in
ecology textbooks as being really fundamental to the chain of food use throughout an ecological
community from plants to herbivores to carnivores and yet to more carnivores who might be eating
carnivores for example a snake that that is being eaten by a hawk for example would be a carnivore
