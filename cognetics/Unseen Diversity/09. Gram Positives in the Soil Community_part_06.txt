aquarium water testing kits are all about testing levels of ammonia and nitrate and nitrite and
you're essentially testing how your nitrifying bacteria are doing because many natural aquarium
filters that get set up by people who are serious hobbyists and want to really keep their water
in a pristine condition are set up with nitrifying bacteria who do very well with taking ammonia
from the fish the waste of the fish and taking it straight to nitrate and beyond there are
additional steps that we will get to and when you are doing those aquarium tests you're simply
monitoring their process you're saying how are you guys doing with a nitrite how are you doing
with a nitrate I hope the levels are down and they typically aren't a good aquarium so you've
seen if you've done anything at all with freshwater aquariums you've seen nitrifiers in action and
you've actually tested them so the next step is to take that nitrate and to turn it into nitrogen
gas which will then diffuse away from the soil of the forest or from the aquarium or from the water
or wherever it is turn it back into nitrogen gas and there are bacteria called the denitrifiers
that do that and they are doing something quite amazing that I'm going to try to fit into a
subsequent lecture that that addresses some more issues of bacterial metabolism for the
for the moment let me just leave you with sort of a tantalizing image and maybe a bit of foreshadowing
about these denitrifiers that are taking nitrate from nitrate to gaseous nitrogen
they're essentially breathing nitrate just as we breathe oxygen so as part of our normal
metabolism we take in oxygen we use it in a particular way that I want to elaborate on
right this moment and then we breathe out some waste products including carbon dioxide and water
vapor what these denitrifiers are doing is taking in nitrate and using it in the same way that we
use oxygen and then releasing waste products one of which is nitrogen gas okay so completely analogous
there are compatriots in our in the in the microbial world they just happen to be using a different
oxygen rich molecule for part of their metabolism than we are so their final waste product is
nitrogen gas out that goes into the atmosphere and the one thing I want you to recall is we talked
about nitrogen fixers in a previous lecture the example was rhizobium it was an alpha proteobacterium
I also said that some cyanobacteria which are coming up in their own lecture can fix nitrogen
as well as quite a number of other bacteria it's it's a it's a fairly common bacterial function
although exclusively a bacterial function and so what we've essentially just done is a complete
nitrogen cycle because if I could just remind you those nitrogen fixers are going to take
nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and send it right around again to something like ammonia
which can then be incorporated into to organism so we've just completed an entire nitrogen cycle
and it's one of the many many cycles that are going on in soil it's one of many many collaborations
of specialists that are occurring in soil to break down whatever tumbles onto that soil
now I did not mention anything about tiny soil animals or soil fungi not to mention
larger animals that might be scavenging certainly if a large animal falls to the ground in the soil
