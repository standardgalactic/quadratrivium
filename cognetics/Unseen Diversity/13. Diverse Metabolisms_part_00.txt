Unseen Diversity, Lecture 13. Diverse Metabolisms
In this lecture I continue to tell you about diverse bacterial metabolisms. Previous lecture
was mostly about the type of photosynthesis or photoautotrophy as done by cyanobacteria.
Now at this point I would like to talk about a particular community, one of many that I could
have chosen, but one that I've decided to focus in on a little bit, that displays at least five
types of metabolisms, each of which I will explain and try to put into context, and that I think
might be accessible to many people who might choose to go out and examine such an environment
themselves first hand. It is a sulfur rich environment, for example it could be a sulfur spring,
it could be the estuary where salt water and fresh water are coming together along a shoreline,
it could be low tide sand flats or mud flats along a shoreline, and there are a number of other
sulfur rich environments as well, and in fact all you need to do to know that you are in a sulfur
rich environment is to smell the sulfur, and what you're essentially smelling there is a gaseous
form of sulfur H2S hydrogen sulfide. So what I want to do is take us to an imaginary ideal mud flat,
ideal in that it's going to be relatively easy for us to see all five of our metabolisms in one
little spot, in reality you would be going to your sulfide or hydrogen sulfide rich environment
where you can smell some sulfur and maybe doing a little more careful searching around and analyzing,
realizing that you might not see all the types of metabolisms all in one tidy little place,
so this is an ideal mud flat, but let's take it as an example and smell the hydrogen sulfide
and realize at the beginning that that's a poisonous gas, you're smelling a poisonous gas,
a gas that is as toxic to you and to your metabolism as cyanide is, and the difference
between hydrogen sulfide and cyanide is that we are sensitive to extremely tiny amounts of hydrogen
sulfide so that the amount you're smelling is just scarce parts per million in the air, not enough
in an open space to do any harm to you, but it is useful to realize that it's a highly reactive gas
and therefore toxic and able to get itself involved in our own metabolism in a way that
if you were in a confined space with hydrogen sulfide it would certainly be a poisonous gas for
you and that's the basics of this entire community that I'm going to describe to you
because sometimes extremely active gases go hand in hand with toxicity in large quantities,
but in small quantities that extreme reactivity just means that they're wonderful gases for
use in metabolism, so I next want to talk about hydrogen sulfide in an entirely positive way,
it's what these organisms are using to do what they do for the most part, a lot of this metabolism
is based on using hydrogen sulfide which I will point out as often as I can, so let's say we're
at our ideal mud flat, one of the things that makes it ideal by the way is it's not at a public
beach or in a section of a public beach where people are trumping all over it,
secluded is good and a place where the waves are not chopping at it is good and a place where the
tide goes way way out and the water gets very very shallow and very very still is good, so again
