Recorded Books is pleased to present the Modern Scholars Series, where great professors teach you.
My name is George Wilson, and I'll be your host.
Today we begin a course entitled Unseen Diversity, the World of Bacteria.
Your professor is Betsy Dexter Dyer, a biology professor at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, where her courses include bacteriology, genetics, parasitology, and invertebrate evolution.
She earned her PhD in biology at Boston University in 1984.
Professor Dyer's research interests include DNA sequence analysis, cell evolution, symbiosis, and field microbiology.
She considers herself to be a curious naturalist and a generalist with lots more to learn.
She has written three books, including A Field Guide to Bacteria.
For more information on this course, please visit its webpage at www.modernscholar.com.
You can access this course by using the password 1121BDD.
Again, that's 1121BDD.
Once there, you'll have access to links to related sites, a seminar room to share your thoughts with other students, and yes, of course, a final exam.
And now we begin Unseen Diversity, the World of Bacteria, Lecture 1.
Introduction to the Bacterial World.
And now, Professor Dyer.
This series of lectures is about bacteria.
They are the most numerous of all organisms on Earth.
They are the most diverse of all organisms on Earth, and they are invisible to our eyes, and that poses a particular challenge if we are to understand them.
And it's a challenge that I enjoy dealing with and thinking about, and it will be an aspect particularly of this first lecture.
I have several goals and aspirations for this course on bacteria.
One of them is that I am hoping that you will come away from this, recognizing that bacteria are most of the biodiversity on Earth.
I would like to add a bacterial dimension to your nature studies, whatever they are.
I certainly have a bacterial dimension to my nature studies.
