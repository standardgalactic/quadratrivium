Now here's a really interesting thing that happened.
The Proteobacteria had gotten all sorted out into different subgroups, all based on their
behavior on Petri dishes, and their behavior with stains, and their behavior with various
nutrients that were added to Petri dishes, and other criteria of that sort, and microbiology
students for generations memorized those criteria, and I can remember in graduate school myself
when I was first starting to get interested in bacteria, taking the Proteobacteria very
seriously and learning a great deal of the classification by heart so that I could use
it, which is a typical thing for scientists if they're going into a particular field to
really try to understand something.
Then came the DNA sequences, and everything was completely disrupted so that groups that
we thought were good natural groups worth classifying together suddenly were in completely
separate places in the Proteobacterial section of the tree.
Proteobacteria occupy their own major branch of about 15 major branches on the family tree
of bacteria and archaea, and suddenly the Proteobacterial section of the family tree
was completely unlike what we would ever have suspected.
I think the major problem was that of necessity the Proteobacteria had been categorized by
their metabolism, and their metabolism is the taking up of nutrients, the processing
of nutrients, the output of wastes, all of the things associated with that, and some
of those metabolisms were pretty exotic so there was a thought that well this is the
criterion upon which we are going to group a certain number of these together around
doing this particular metabolism.
The big surprise was, well it didn't seem to matter what sort of metabolism they were
doing, the groups fell out in a completely different way.
Possibly some of that was due to the prevalence of horizontal transfer, which I mentioned a
few lectures back, horizontal transfer, that tendency for bacteria and archaea to exchange
their DNA promiscuously across whatever the species boundaries are, if there are even
real species boundaries among them, so that instead of getting a nice clean family tree
you get this anastomosing family tree.
So that could be part of it, and it could be that metabolism is just not the big divider
and classifier that we thought it was.
So guess what, here are the new classifications of the Proteobacteria, Alpha, Beta, Gamma,
Delta, and Epsilon, and I think that is one of the best indicators of just what an upheaval
that was, so much so that once those classifications had settled down, and they are pretty settled
at this moment, so we actually refer to Alpha Proteobacteria, Delta Proteobacteria, those
are in common parlance right now, but even then no microbiologist has stepped forward
