1. **Course Overview**: The course explores the historical development of the knowledge problem within science, from the 17th century to the present, with a focus on how scientists have addressed the challenges and uncertainties inherent in their pursuit of understanding.

2. **Historical Approach**: By examining this issue chronologically, we can observe how the knowledge problem has evolved over time, influenced by scientific discoveries and societal reactions to those discoveries.

3. **17th Century Foundations**: Early modern scientists like Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Gottfried Leibniz, and Isaac Newton were deeply concerned with developing reliable methods for obtaining knowledge, which reflects their engagement with the knowledge problem.

4. **18th Century Philosophical Responses**: The success of scientific methods prompted philosophers to develop theories of knowledge that could justify scientists' claims to have discovered new truths. This led to the emergence of rationalism and empiricism, which are central to modern Western philosophy.

5. **19th Century Scientific Maturation**: As scientific theories became more powerful and abstract, scientists themselves grappled with understanding what these theories represented in terms of knowledge.

6. **Philosophical Community's Role**: From the 1920s onward, philosophers took the lead in addressing the knowledge problem within science, while scientists focused more on empirical research and less on its philosophical underpinnings.

7. **Science Wars of the 1960s**: The tension between different interpretations of scientific rationality led to intense debates, highlighting the ongoing ambivalence about what it means to be rational in response to experience and how to reconcile this with rational action.

8. **Unresolved Ambivalence**: The course will delve into why the knowledge problem within science remains unresolved and what this implies for our understanding of scientific knowledge and the role of rationality in science.

Throughout the course, we will explore how the knowledge problem has shaped scientific practice and theory, and how it continues to influence contemporary discussions about the nature of scientific truth and the methods scientists use to discover it.

 In this segment, we discuss René Descartes' philosophical approach to knowledge and its influence on the scientific method. Descartes argued that humans are endowed with an innate "natural light" or intuition that allows us to recognize clear and distinct ideas—those that are true beyond doubt. He believed that through a combination of intuition (intuitus) and deduction (deductio), we could form hypotheses, which could then be used to understand the world systematically.

Descartes' approach emphasized reasoning over experimentation. He suggested that while experiments might be equivocal, the process of reasoning from clear and distinct ideas was a reliable path to knowledge. This method involves forming universal hypotheses and using deduction to derive particular observations from them, thereby validating the hypotheses as descriptions of reality.

However, Descartes' method raises questions about the origins of these universal premises. How do we know they are true? This issue becomes a point of contention throughout the history of science.

Additionally, there is an intellectual challenge in scientific reasoning that was well-known to Bacon, Descartes, and subsequent scientists like Galileo, Newton, and Leibniz: the problem of affirming the consequent. This logical fallacy occurs when a scientist infers the truth of a hypothesis because it correctly predicts an observed outcome, without considering alternative explanations for the observation.

Despite this logical flaw, which is inherent in the experimental predictions of science, the scientific method proceeds on the assumption that theories supported by experimental evidence are likely to be true, even though absolute certainty can never be achieved. This awareness of the potential fallacy at the heart of scientific prediction is a significant aspect of the "science wars" and the ongoing debate about the nature of scientific knowledge.

In summary, Descartes' philosophical method, which combines intuition with deduction to form hypotheses and interpret observations, sets the stage for the scientific method as we understand it today. However, this method is built upon a foundation that acknowledges the potential fallibility of its reasoning process due to the inherent limitations of experimental prediction.

 The lecture discusses the "knowledge problem" within science, which revolves around how scientists come to know and describe the natural world. This problem encompasses the nature of scientific theories, whether they describe reality or interpret experiences, and the assumptions that underpin these theories.

The lecture contrasts two approaches to understanding scientific knowledge:

1. **Archaeological Method**: This approach views scientists as uncovering facts about the natural world, similar to how archaeologists excavate artifacts. According to this view, nature is objective and exists independently of human perception or interpretation. Scientists use reason and experiments to "lift a corner of the veil" and reveal what is truly there. This method presupposes that there is an ultimate reality that can be discovered through scientific inquiry.

2. **Constructivist Approach**: In contrast, this approach suggests that scientists interpret or construe experiences. From this perspective, scientific theories are not just reflections of an objective reality but are social constructs shaped by cultural and historical contexts. This view holds that there are multiple possible interpretations of any given experience, and thus scientific knowledge is not absolute but is subject to change as our instruments and understanding evolve.

The lecture points out that while building a bridge, for example, one does not need to resolve the metaphysical question of whether knowledge is true or constructed, as long as the bridge functions effectively. However, when philosophers or scientists claim that their theories are universally true, they must make certain assumptions and justifications for those assumptions.

The lecture also previews an upcoming discussion about the debate between Newton and Leibniz over the nature of these foundational assumptions in scientific theory. The lecture concludes by emphasizing the contrasting views on scientific knowledge as either uncovering reality (the archaeological method) or construing experience (the constructivist approach). These differing views have significant implications for how we understand the role of human beings in the process of scientific discovery and the nature of scientific truth itself.

1. The debate between Newton and Leibniz was not just about mathematics or physics, but reflected different philosophies of nature. They were natural philosophers with broader interests, including theological and historical questions.

2. Isaac Newton spent a significant portion of his time on topics outside of mathematics and physics, such as biblical chronology, theology, and alchemy. His work in these areas is vast but less known in the history of science.

3. In his work "Principia," Newton presented gravity as the finger of God, suggesting that it was the divine force keeping the universe coherent and preventing matter from dispersing in infinite space. He also referred to the universe as a sensorium (sensory system) for God.

4. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had a different view of reality, considering it a network of relationships rather than a collection of material objects. He believed that understanding these relationships was key to comprehending the nature of things.

5. Both Newton and Leibniz were religious men, but their contrasting views on reality eventually contributed to a shift towards a more materialistic and deterministic view of the universe in the 18th century.

6. Christian Huygens, recognizing the predictive success of Newton's and Leibniz's theories, argued that this success was evidence that the theories corresponded to reality, even though logically one cannot affirm that from the outcome alone.

The exchange between Newton and Leibniz illustrates the interplay between scientific theories and philosophical beliefs about the nature of reality. It also shows how scientific advancements can have broader implications beyond their immediate domain, influencing the way we understand the universe and our place within it.

 The conversation revolves around the nature of truth and the criterion by which we can ascertain it, particularly in relation to knowledge of the unobservable, such as Plato's ideal world of forms or scientific claims like the heliocentric model of the solar system. This discussion is further contextualized by reference to the Protestant Reformation, which challenged the Catholic Church's authority as a criterion for truth and knowledge, leading Protestants to develop their own justifications for certainty in God's revealed Word.

The Protestant response initially involved the concept of an inner light or natural light, a divine gift that allows humans to perceive the truth of God's Word. Later, as the 17th century progressed, this notion was refined to suggest that certainty in religious matters need not be absolute but should be "certain enough" for faith and intellectual commitments.

This shift in understanding certainty is indicative of a broader trend in philosophy during this period, where thinkers like John Locke began to redefine the standards for knowledge and certainty. Locke, along with other philosophers of the time, argued that certainty could be practical and sufficient for our needs, rather than adhering to the stringent rationalist criteria of absolute logical certainty.

The lecture emphasizes the interplay between religious beliefs, philosophical thought, and the rise of modern science, highlighting that even though figures like Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Huygens, and Leibniz believed they were establishing certain knowledge, we now recognize that their understanding was subject to later corrections. This underscores the ongoing evolution of scientific knowledge and the provisional nature of even the most confident claims made by scientists at any given time. As we move into the 18th century, this tension between certainty and fallibility continues to shape the intellectual landscape.

 David Hume, a Scottish philosopher, famously argued that our understanding of causality is not based on logical necessity but rather on habit and experience. He posited that when we observe two events consistently following each other, we form the habit of expecting the same sequence to occur in the future. However, this expectation is not grounded in any necessary connection that we can perceive; it is merely a psychological tendency based on our past experiences.

Hume's skepticism about causality extended to the idea of empirical knowledge. He claimed that empiricists, who believe that all knowledge comes from experience, ultimately face a problem: we cannot have certain or demonstrative knowledge of the external world because there is no way to experientially confirm the necessary connections between our ideas and the actual events in the world.

Hume's radical skepticism—the idea that we can't know anything with absolute certainty about the world—was a significant challenge to the philosophy of his time, particularly as it pertained to scientific knowledge. His arguments suggested that while we can have probable knowledge based on experience and observation, we cannot claim universal necessary and certain knowledge about facts outside our own ideas and constructs, such as the rules of a game like chess.

Hume's work forced many philosophers, including Immanuel Kant, to reconsider how we can know anything about the natural world with certainty. Kant's subsequent philosophical work was an attempt to address the issues Hume raised and to provide a framework for understanding how scientific knowledge could still be considered certain within the bounds of our experience.

1. **Kant's Categories and Sensibility**: Immanuel Kant proposed that human cognition is structured around a set of innate categories and forms of sensibility (space and time). These are universal and necessary for us to have any experience or knowledge about the world. According to Kant, our sensory experiences are shaped by these forms, and our understanding organizes those experiences through these categories.

2. **Kant vs. Hume**: Kant's work was a response to David Hume's skepticism regarding causality and the nature of knowledge. Kant argued that while empirical content comes from experience, the forms and categories come from the mind itself. This resolution between intuition and conceptualization allowed for synthetic a priori judgments, which were central to his philosophy.

3. **Kant's Idealism**: Kant's idealism posits that while objects exist independently of our perception of them, our experience of these objects is shaped by the mind's structures. This means that we know the objects as they appear to us, not as they might be in themselves (noumena), which are beyond human cognition.

4. **Kant's Influence on Psychology**: Kant's ideas influenced later thinkers, including Carl Jung, who saw parallels between Kant's categories of the mind and the fundamental laws of association in psychology.

5. **Refutations and Developments**: While Kant's theory was influential, it faced refutations in the form of non-Euclidean geometries and historical perspectives on the development of nature and the human mind. His broader conception of an idealistic approach to knowledge and reality, however, continued to influence philosophical thought, including German idealism and its further developments like Karl Marx's materialism.

6. **Social and Cultural Impact**: The rise of natural philosophy as a source of knowledge had significant social and cultural impacts in 18th-century Europe. Science became a new authority on understanding the world, which shifted societal attitudes and expectations regarding knowledge and expertise.

7. **Kant's Legacy**: Despite subsequent philosophers critiquing or expanding upon his ideas, Kant's influence on philosophy, psychology, and beyond is undeniable. His work laid the groundwork for much of modern philosophical thought and continues to be a subject of study and debate.

 The anecdote about Napoleon and Pierre-Simon Laplace at a dinner where Laplace famously replied that he saw no need for God in his scientific hypotheses due to Celestial Mechanics reflects the broader 18th-century debate on the role of reason and science in society. This debate was influenced by the Enlightenment, which promoted the idea that science and reason could lead to social reform and human liberation.

Key figures like Turgot and Condorcet, who were involved in the French Revolution, believed that scientific knowledge would be a tool for improving society. They supported projects like the Encyclopédie, edited by Denis Diderot, which aimed to disseminate scientific and technical information among the populace, empowering them with knowledge to better their lives.

However, not everyone shared this view of reason as benevolent. Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that the proliferation of science and technology in the 18th century was detrimental to human well-being and that a return to a more natural state was necessary. He and other romantics like William Blake and Novalis believed that reason could lead to a dehumanized, mechanical existence and that emotions and intuition were equally important for a fulfilling life.

The French Revolution also sought to rationalize society by standardizing weights and measures, adopting a decimal system for the meter, gram, and time (with 10 hours divided into 100 minutes each containing 100 seconds). This effort to apply reason to everyday life was a significant outcome of the revolution, despite its political turmoil.

In summary, the 18th century saw a tension between those who believed in the power of reason and science to reform society and improve human conditions, and those who feared that such rationalization could lead to a loss of humanity's natural instincts and emotional richness. This dichotomy set the stage for ongoing debates about the balance between scientific progress and human values into the 19th century and beyond.

 In this discussion, we explored the nature of assumptions and axioms in scientific theories, particularly in geometry and physics. The example given was Euclidean geometry and its alternatives—non-Euclidean geometries—which were revolutionary because they showed that what was once considered self-evident about straight lines and the shortest distance between two points could be false depending on the context of the space in question.

We considered different views on the justification of assumptions:

1. Descartes' method of "feigned hypotheses," where one assumes working hypotheses and justifies them by their success in explaining phenomena.
2. Newton's view that some principles could be inferred from experience, although they are not direct generalizations of particular experiences but rather universal laws.
3. The role of assumptions as bridges between induction (observation and collection of data) and deduction (logical reasoning from established premises), acknowledging that these assumptions cannot be strictly deduced from empirical evidence.

We also touched on the historical context of 19th-century science, where scientists like Fourier made significant contributions to the development of new principles and methods that would shape the future of mathematics and physics. The lecture previewed a deeper exploration into how scientific assumptions are formed and validated, with a focus on the unfolding of Fourier's work in the next session.

In summary, the lecture emphasized the crucial role of foundational assumptions in scientific theories, the philosophical debate over their origin and justification, and their indispensable role in connecting empirical observations with theoretical predictions and explanations. It also highlighted the importance of historical context in understanding how certain assumptions came to be accepted as the basis for scientific investigation.

1. The concept of time in physics presents a challenge due to the one-way, or "arrow," of time as observed in the second law of thermodynamics. In contrast, evolutionary theory highlights the significance of time in the emergence of life and novelty.

2. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace independently conceived the theory of evolution by natural selection, with Darwin presenting his ideas first but delaying their publication for about 20 years. Wallace's essay on the same topic prompted Darwin to act, leading to a joint presentation in 1858.

3. The fossil record is not significant for understanding evolution; what matters is the concept that novelty emerges over time and that changes cannot be predicted as a matter of principle. This recognition of the historical nature of life on Earth fundamentally altered the perception of time in science.

4. The 19th century saw the rise of the discipline of history of science, recognizing that scientific knowledge is not just chronological but is intrinsically historical and evolves over time. This evolution is influenced by a collective of scientists who share assumptions and are engaged in a production process shaped by the self-active nature of the mind.

5. The historical approach to science raises questions about where scientific assumptions come from and how the mind's activity influences the assumptions that lead to scientific theories and knowledge claims. This highlights the interplay between human cognition, the collective nature of scientific inquiry, and the production of scientific knowledge.

 In the final part of the 19th century, there was a significant shift in the understanding of reason, its role, and its limitations. This period saw philosophers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche challenge traditional conceptions of reason, emphasizing that human existence is shaped by historical, cultural, and subjective perspectives. Nietzsche argued that reason was always perspectival and that our assumptions are not rational in themselves; they are historically and culturally conditioned.

Similarly, Charles Sanders Peirce, the founder of American pragmatism, highlighted the active role the mind plays in determining belief, offering a distinct view of what belief entails. This approach suggests that our reasoning is influenced by factors beyond conscious control, including the unconscious elements identified by Freud and Jung.

Psychologists like Wilhelm Wundt and William James drew attention to the selective nature of consciousness and perception, indicating that we do not process all sensory inputs but rather focus on specific aspects according to our previous experiences and expectations. This selectivity is a key concept in gestalt psychology, which has been re-examined in modern cognitive psychology.

In summary, by the end of the 19th century, there was a growing recognition that scientific knowledge and reasoning are not objective in the traditional sense. The assumptions underlying our scientific theories are themselves influenced by subjective factors, and the process of reasoning is complex, involving both conscious and unconscious influences. These insights would significantly impact the philosophy of science and the understanding of human cognition in the 20th century.

1. The history of scientific theories shows that what is accepted as established science can change significantly over time. For example, the worldview in 2000 was vastly different from that in 1900, which was different from the understanding before Descartes and Bacon.

2. The success of scientific theories does not necessarily prove that they mirror reality; rather, it suggests that these theories are highly effective for their practical applications. This effectiveness is often taken as evidence of their truth, but this assumption is not empirically supported.

3. J.B. Stallo, a German immigrant and later US ambassador to Italy, highlighted the metaphysical foundations underlying modern science in his book on the concepts of modern physics. He argued that scientific claims to knowledge are based on non-scientific assumptions, which cannot be validated solely through empirical evidence.

4. The persisting conflict in the science community revolves around whether scientific knowledge is simply a tool for understanding and predicting phenomena or if it provides true knowledge of reality. This ambivalence fuels the ongoing "science wars," where scientists and philosophers grapple with the nature of scientific knowledge.

5. The discussion is not about dismissing or undermining science but rather about understanding the nature of scientific claims and the assumptions upon which they are based. Science's practical utility and its ability to explain, predict, and control phenomena are widely acknowledged, but the claim that it provides direct knowledge of reality remains contentious.

1. **Atomic Facts**: In the context of atomic facts, the idea is that each fact exists independently and cannot be derived from another fact; they are the basic units of experience that reflect reality as it is. Logic aims to capture these atomic facts and their relationships in a logical framework, allowing for a precise description and understanding of the world.

2. **Logical Empiricism**: This philosophical approach, associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, holds that all meaningful statements can be reduced to logical propositions. Logic is considered the foundation of knowledge and truth, and thus, all scientific knowledge should be reducible to logical truths.

3. **Russell's Influence**: Russell's work aimed to reduce mathematics to logic, which was a central goal in the early 20th century as it sought to address questions about the nature of mathematical truth and knowledge. This project laid the groundwork for modern mathematical logic and influenced analytical philosophy.

4. **Analysis of Language**: Russell believed that many philosophical problems arise from ambiguous or poorly analyzed language. Therefore, he emphasized the importance of precise linguistic analysis to resolve these issues and arrive at clear, logical truths.

5. **Philosophical Implications**: The analytical philosophy of science that emerged from this approach posits that a logically perspicuous language could capture atomic facts about the world as perceived by our senses. This would allow for a scientific understanding that is not just about human experience but directly reflects the world and its workings.

6. **Logical Positivism**: The movement of logical positivism, which was influenced by Russell's ideas, further developed this approach to science and philosophy, emphasizing the empirical verification of scientific statements and the distinction between meaningful (verifiable) and meaningless (non-verifiable) propositions.

7. **Philosophical Knowledge**: The ultimate goal of this logical approach is to achieve true philosophical knowledge through deduction from atomic facts, ensuring that our understanding of the world is both precise and accurate.

In summary, the analytical tradition in philosophy, particularly as influenced by Russell, seeks to use logical analysis to ensure that philosophical claims are based on clear, verifiable observations about the world, thus grounding knowledge in empirical reality and logical consistency.

930s is discussing the philosophical movement of logical positivism, which originated from the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein in the early 1920s. This movement was characterized by its belief that scientific knowledge could be made up of pure observation sentences (raw data) and theory sentences (laws and explanations), with a set of rules to connect them. The goal was to establish scientific knowledge as deductive, universal, and necessary, fulfilling Plato's vision of knowledge about the world.

The logical positivists argued that for a theoretical claim to be meaningful, it must be verifiable through empirical observation—a principle similar to Bridgeman's operationalism. However, upon closer examination, it became apparent that this clean separation between theory and observation was not feasible. Theorist Carl Hempel noted the influence of theory on what we consider raw observations, suggesting that "theory ladenness" of observations means that the two cannot be kept entirely separate.

The final blow to logical positivism came from philosopher Willard van Orman Quine, who in his 1950 essay "Two Dogmas of Empiricism," argued against the distinction between analytic (logically true) and synthetic (about the world) statements. He suggested that this distinction was untenable, leading to the collapse of logical positivism as a viable framework for understanding scientific knowledge.

Despite its eventual failure, logical positivism held significant influence in the philosophy of science for several decades, partly due to the intellectual prestige of its adherents and a desire among scientists and philosophers to believe in an objective theory of scientific knowledge. By the 1960s, it was widely recognized that the issues with logical positivism had not been resolved, and the philosophy of science moved in new directions.

 The video discusses the philosophical debate between realists like Einstein and anti-realists or pragmatists like Niels Bohr, particularly in the context of quantum mechanics. It highlights the tension between two different interpretations of quantum theory in the early to mid 20th century:

1. **Heisenberg's Matrix Mechanics**: This is a purely empirical approach that does not attempt to explain the underlying mechanisms but rather correlates experimental results with mathematical equations.

2. **Schrodinger's Wave Mechanics**: This approach provides a more classical, deterministic framework for understanding quantum phenomena. It is based on wave equations that can be translated into Heisenberg's matrix mechanics.

The debate centers on whether quantum mechanics, as an inherently statistical and non-deterministic theory, can be considered a complete and final theory of matter and energy. Einstein, a realist, argued that a final theory must be deterministic and causal to be truly intelligible and predictive. He was skeptical of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.

Bohr, on the other hand, was satisfied with the predictive power of quantum mechanics as it stood and maintained that the probabilistic interpretation provided a coherent framework for understanding experience without needing a causal mechanism. He believed that as long as the theory made accurate predictions, it was sufficient.

This debate touches on fundamental questions about the nature of reality, the role of causality in understanding the world, and what constitutes intelligibility in scientific theories. The resolution of this debate has shaped modern physics and continues to influence discussions on the foundations of science and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

1. Fleck's monograph "Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache" (The Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact) argues that scientific knowledge is based on collective agreement within thought collectives, which operate under specific thought styles or sets of assumptions and principles.

2. According to Fleck, before any scientific question can be answered objectively, active associations (the assumptions and principles) must first be established. Once these are set, the passive relations (the empirical data and conclusions) can be deduced.

3. The process of science is not merely individual reasoning but a social endeavor where a community of scientists agrees upon how to observe, measure, and interpret natural phenomena.

4. Scientific knowledge is objective in that it is the same for everyone who follows the agreed-upon active associations, but the active associations themselves are not determined by logic alone.

5. A thought style becomes a stable part of science when a critical mass of scientists within a thought collective accepts and practices it.

6. Fleck's ideas prefigure Thomas Kuhn's later influential work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," which also emphasizes the role of paradigms (similar to thought styles) in shaping scientific research and understanding.

7. Both Fleck and Kuhn highlight that scientific knowledge is not static; it evolves as new theories are proposed, tested, and accepted by the broader scientific community, leading to shifts in thought styles or paradigms.

1. **Paradigms and Normal Science**: According to Kuhn's theory, a paradigm is an overarching framework or set of norms that guides scientists in their research. Scientists engaged in normal science are working within the established paradigm, confirming and refining it through empirical research. This is the majority of scientific work.

2. **Anomalies and Crises**: Over time, experiments and observations may yield anomalies that don't fit within the current paradigm. These inconsistencies can accumulate, eventually leading to a crisis if they cannot be resolved within the existing framework.

3. **Scientific Revolutions**: A scientific revolution occurs when the community of scientists adopts a new paradigm to resolve the anomalies and crises that the old paradigm could not explain. This new paradigm provides a different interpretation of the same data, effectively changing what scientists consider to be true or real in their field.

4. **The Role of Anomalies**: Anomalies are crucial in the process of scientific change because they signal the limitations of the current paradigm and motivate the search for a new one. They are not just random data points but are central to the process of paradigm shift.

5. **Incommensurability**: Kuhn initially suggested that old and new paradigms are incommensurable, meaning that scientists using different paradigms might not be able to communicate effectively. However, this concept has been refined to mean that while there are fundamental differences between frameworks, communication is still possible and necessary.

6. **Impact on Understanding Science**: Kuhn's work shifted the focus from a view of scientific knowledge as stable and cumulative to one that is dynamic and contextual. It showed that scientific progress is not just a matter of accumulating facts but involves shifts in perspective and interpretation.

7. **Further Development of Kuhn's Ideas**: While some aspects of Kuhn's theory, like the concept of incommensurability, have been refined or nuanced, his overall approach to understanding scientific change has had a profound impact on the philosophy and history of science, influencing how we view the nature of scientific knowledge and the process of scientific discovery.

1. **Kepler and Newton**: Johannes Kepler introduced the concept that planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun. Later, Isaac Newton explained this through his law of universal gravitation, which stated that every mass attracts every other mass with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

2. **The Copernican Principle**: The current understanding of planetary motion still follows the Copernican view, which places the sun at the center of the solar system. However, it's important to note that due to the movement of the solar system within the Milky Way and beyond, planets do not actually trace out perfect ellipses.

3. **The Big Bang Theory**: The Big Bang Theory has evolved over time with the inclusion of concepts like inflation theory and dark energy/dark matter. It's a mistake to say that the theory is flawed just because it has anomalies or has changed.

4. **Evolution by Natural Selection**: Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has also evolved, especially with the incorporation of genetic understanding from the DNA paradigm. The term "random mutation" now refers to what was previously understood as spontaneous variation.

5. **Microwave Background Radiation**: This cosmic background radiation was accidentally discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965 and is often cited as evidence for the Big Bang Theory.

6. **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**: These are hypothesized components of the universe that cannot be directly observed but are inferred from their gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. They were posited to explain observations that did not fit with our understanding of gravity alone.

7. **Cune's Agenda**: The speaker mentions Cune's agenda, which advocates for a structure for scientific revolutions. This agenda is supported by the analysis of how scientific theories evolve and change over time, incorporating new evidence and developing new concepts to explain phenomena.

In the next lecture, the speaker intends to explore the broader impact and responses to Cune's framework on the philosophy and practice of science.

1. **Textual Open-Endedness**: According to Derrida, the meaning of any text (written or spoken) is open-ended and not fixed. This means that a text can evoke multiple interpretations, and its meaning can be extended indefinitely through various associations. The author cannot dictate all possible meanings of their work.

2. **Interpretation Variety**: There is no universal set of rules to determine the validity of an interpretation before it is presented. Interpretations are influenced by historical and cultural contexts, such as Freudian or Marxist perspectives on a text like Moby Dick.

3. **Generalization of Text**: Derrida's theory extends beyond written texts to anything created by humans—objects like cars (corvette, Ferrari, SUV), architecture, etc., can all be "read" as texts with various meanings.

4. **Deconstruction**: This is a method developed by Derrida to uncover the layers of interpretation that are often obscured or closed off by authorities who wish to dictate a single meaning or interpretation. Deconstruction exposes these interpretive tools and the rhetorical strategies used to maintain them.

5. **Hermeneutics in Science**: Both Derrida and Foucault advocated for hermeneutics—interpretation rather than analysis—as a way to understand science not as an objective truth, but as an interpretation of human experience that is subject to change and reinterpretation as our perspectives on the world evolve.

6. **Social Construction of Scientific Knowledge**: The ideas of Derrida and Foucault paved the way for theories that assert scientific knowledge is socially constructed, meaning it is shaped by cultural, social, and historical factors, and thus not inherently objective or universal. This perspective will be further discussed in the next lecture within the context of the CUNION critique.

1. **Weber's Gravity Wave Detector**: The conversation was about a physicist named Joseph Weber, who claimed to have built a gravity wave detector based on his design from the 1980s and that he had detected gravity waves in 2004. Despite his claims, the scientific community was skeptical due to the lack of reproducibility and the sophisticated nature of his instruments.

2. **LIGO and Scientific Consensus**: Nicholas Wade Collins' book "Gravity's Shadow" details Weber's work alongside the development of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which was a massive project funded by NASA and the National Science Foundation to the tune of 360 million dollars. Despite the significant investment, LIGO had yet to detect gravity waves at the time Collins wrote his book. The scientific community's acceptance of LIGO, in contrast to skepticism towards Weber's work, highlights the role of consensus and community trust in validating scientific instruments and findings.

3. **Extrasensory Perception (ESP) Research**: The book also explores the dismissal of ESP research as pseudoscience, despite following a similar experimental methodology as mainstream science. This reflects a broader issue where experimental data is often interpreted through the lens of pre-existing theories, creating a circular argument where the theory informs what is considered data.

4. **Elementary Particle Physics**: In the history of elementary particle physics since World War II, Steven Pickering argues in "Constructing Quarks" that experimental data is inherently equivocal and that theory heavily influences how data is interpreted. The discovery of the top quark at Fermilab illustrates this point, as researchers used a theoretical framework to distinguish signal from noise.

5. **Thomas Hobbes' Criticism**: The criticism of Thomas Hobbes regarding Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke's use of the air pump in the 17th century is echoed here. It raises questions about the reliability of complex scientific instruments, like particle accelerators, and whether the results they produce truly represent natural phenomena or are artifacts of the instrumentation itself.

6. **Sociological Perspective on Science**: Bruno Latour's "Science in Action" from 1987 is mentioned as part of a broader sociological perspective that argues scientific knowledge is socially constructed. According to this view, it is the scientific community that determines the validity of knowledge claims through social consensus rather than direct comparison with nature as the ultimate arbiter of truth and knowledge.

7. **Upcoming Lecture**: The lecture will examine arguments defending the objectivity of scientific knowledge from those who argue that scientific knowledge is indeed socially constructed, reflecting a debate on the nature of science and its ability to produce objective, universal truths.

1. **Philosophy of Science and Model-Based Realism**: The discussion revolves around the idea that scientific theories should be understood as models, which are simulations or representations of experience. These models are tested against empirical evidence, and their utility is determined by their ability to mirror features of experience through their logical consequences. When a model's predictions no longer align with reality, it is discarded, and a new one is constructed. This approach is reminiscent of Claude Bernard's view on concepts and the importance of empirical validation.

2. **Kitcher and Gehr**: These philosophers argue that scientific theories are models that should be mapped onto the world, ensuring that their internal relationships reflect real-world phenomena. Their work suggests a nuanced understanding of objectivity in science, one that acknowledges the influence of human experience on the formation of scientific knowledge.

3. **Arthur Fine and the Natural Ontological Attitude (NOA)**: Arthur Fine, through his book "The Shaky Game," presents a defense of a critically defensible version of objectivity called NOA. He argues that Einstein's views were more nuanced than commonly perceived, emphasizing that scientists must take into account the limitations and contexts of their observations. NOA is an affirmation of common sense realism, which is validated by our continued existence, and it is checked against empirical evidence.

4. **Bas van Fraassen and Constructive Empiricism**: Bas van Fraassen suggests that scientific theories should be accepted as empirically adequate rather than as descriptions of reality in its entirety. This means that while we accept the explanatory power of theories, including those that involve unobservable entities like dark energy or dark matter, we do not make claims about their independent existence beyond their empirical effectiveness.

5. **Imre Lakatos and Falsificationism**: Imre Lakatos, influenced by his studies with Popper, believed in the objective nature of scientific knowledge but recognized the non-logical nature of the discovery process. He proposed that a scientific theory should be evaluated based on its ability to make novel predictions that were unanticipated at the time of formulation. After the fact, these predictions can be shown to have followed logically from the theories, although the path to their discovery was not necessarily deductive. Lakatos's work aimed to provide a rational reconstruction of scientific knowledge without implying that the process of discovery itself is logical or deductive.

In summary, these philosophers of science argue for a pragmatic and empirically grounded approach to understanding scientific theories as models that are continuously refined to better represent reality, while acknowledging the inherently human and fallible nature of the scientific endeavor. They emphasize the importance of empirical evidence and the provisional nature of scientific knowledge, advocating for a nuanced and sophisticated realism that is anchored in our observable world.

1. The science wars were a period of intense debate in the 1990s where scientists and intellectuals clashed over the role of science in society, particularly concerning issues of objectivity, truth, and the use of scientific knowledge to inform public policy.

2. Key figures in quantum mechanics, such as Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli, wrote about the interpretations and limitations of quantum theory in ways that resemble the writings of postmodernist thinkers like Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Lacan, and others, who used scientific language without a deep understanding of the science.

3. A notable example is Andrew Pickering's analysis in his book "The Mangle of Practice," which shows how scientists construct their theories through a complex interplay between social and material factors.

4. Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar, in their book "Laboratory Life: The Social Construction of Scientific Facts," provided an ethnographic account of scientific practice that emphasized the role of social and material factors in scientific knowledge production.

5. Paul Gross and Norman Levitt's book "Higher Superstition" argued against the postmodernist critique, defending the objectivity and value of science.

6. Physicist Alan Sokal's hoax with Jean Bricmont in their book "Fashionable Nonsense" demonstrated how postmodernists misused scientific concepts to lend credibility to arguments that had no basis in actual science.

7. The science wars subsided by the year 2000, with postmodernism losing its influence and becoming a vacuous term. However, this does not mean that the issues at hand have been resolved.

8. A more pressing concern for the future of science and technology in America is the declining number of young people majoring in natural sciences and engineering, which threatens the science and technology base of the country.

9. The science wars, although no longer referred to as such, have continued in a different form—moving from intellectual debates to legal challenges by the religious right, particularly against Darwinian evolution. This will be explored further in the next lecture.

10. The key takeaway from the science wars is the recognition that scientific knowledge is historically and socially dependent, and that the assumptions of the scientific community play a significant role in the formulation of theories. This insight has important implications for how scientific knowledge should be used in resolving public policy issues.

1. The discussion around intelligent design (ID) as a hypothesis is significant and has historical roots, dating back to ancient philosophers like Aristotle and being elaborated upon by Jewish and Islamic thinkers, and later adopted by Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas. These figures argued from the appearance of design in nature to the existence of a designer.

2. It's important to note that while ID has been recognized as an intelligent hypothesis for centuries, it is not considered a scientific hypothesis in the modern sense. The argument from design was once a legitimate philosophical position but is no longer accepted as a scientific explanation for the complexity and apparent purposeful design observed in nature.

3. The contemporary debate over evolutionary theory and intelligent design is not purely a scientific disagreement but also involves cultural, religious, and existential beliefs. For many with religious convictions, the randomness of natural selection challenges the meaning and value of human life, leading them to defend ID as a way to uphold their values.

4. The conflict between science and religion in this debate is often characterized by both sides adopting an "imperialistic" stance, where each claims exclusive access to truth. This clash can seem insurmountable through reason alone.

5. Science itself is not inherently imperialistic; however, the scientific community sometimes defends science as if it were the only route to truth, which can be a difficult and defensive position to maintain, especially when faced with critiques from post-modernists and others who question the objectivity of scientific knowledge.

6. A key point in this discussion is that no scientific theory can be considered an empirical fact. Theories in science, including evolutionary theory, are always subject to revision and cannot serve as immutable truths. They are tools for understanding and explaining phenomena within the natural world, not absolute facts.

1. **Atom Metaphor**: The atom metaphor as the best available model of matter is not definitive but a useful story about actualities that works in specifiable ways, and it's important to recognize that science provides truths within our society, but not the only ones.

2. **Science and Experience**: Scientists experience their actualities as real, almost like everyday experiences, but for outsiders, scientific knowledge is fallible and temporal. This duality does not inherently conflict with other aspects of life or with religious beliefs.

3. **Scientific Knowledge**: Scientific knowledge involves actualities and is subject to change and revision. It is not certain or absolute but probabilistic and conjectural, which means it should be used as a tool for understanding experience without being the ultimate authority on actions based on that knowledge.

4. **Science in Society**: In a democratic society, informed citizens can participate in science and technology policy disputes, understanding that scientific knowledge is fallible and that the final responsibility for decisions lies with the people, not with scientists.

5. **Role of Science in Policy Issues**: Scientists cannot offer certainty about future events or incorporate value judgments into their findings. Therefore, in addressing issues like global warming, stem cell research, and genetic engineering, science can provide knowledge about potential outcomes but cannot dictate how society should act on that knowledge.

6. **Decision Making**: Ultimately, decisions must be made by considering the best available scientific knowledge alongside values and ethical considerations, recognizing that action is non-rational and requires a blend of knowledge and judgment.
