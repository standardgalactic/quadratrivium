Lecture 5. Science vs. Philosophy in the 17th Century
I have referred several times to the association of modern science with the use of special instruments.
And especially we think of the telescope and the microscope when we think of early modern science.
And I contrasted the telescope and the microscope with the mechanical calculator also invented in the 17th century
and the slide rule which was invented in the 17th century.
In the case of the calculator and the slide rule, the results that you get can be checked if you're not sure that the machine is operating correctly
or if you're just interested in seeing that the machine is in fact operating correctly.
In the case of the telescope and the microscope that is not available to us.
I think I gave the example earlier that if you think you have seen moons orbiting around Jupiter
you can't fly out to Jupiter in order to check that those really are moons
and not little air bubbles in the lenses that are somehow causing you to think that you're seeing moons.
The problem here of course is how do you understand what an instrument that goes beyond what the senses can show you
how can you understand what that instrument is showing you?
How do you know that what it's showing you is revealing a hidden secret of nature
or in fact is not showing you machine noise that is to say some sort of artifact produced by the operation of the machine?
Consider for example X-rays.
When X-rays in 1896 X-rays were discovered and within a very short period of time
Thomas Edison for one had developed a commercial X-ray machine
so initially X-rays revealed hidden things in the sense of they could show you the bones in your body while you were still alive
but we knew skeletal anatomy very well so when we saw the bones of the hand for example
and the discoverer of X-rays made an X-ray of his wife's hand and you could see the hand and the wedding ring on it
we recognized that the X-rays were accurately depicting what was there
but as X-rays became increasingly sophisticated and the resolution got better
as we went from X-rays to CAT scanning equipment to MRIs and PET scanning equipment
we were being shown by the machine structures within the living body
and even structures within tissues that we could extract from dead bodies or sometimes living bodies
and they were showing us structures that we could not see
so when you increase the resolution of these machines people had to be specially trained
and told this shadow here represents an aneurysm
this shadow here is potentially a tumor
you could not see that on your own if you look at a chest X-ray and you have no training in radiology
you cannot see what is normal and what is abnormal
so the use by modern science of specialized instruments which typically requires specialized training
creates great opportunities for going beyond sense-based experience to discovering aspects of nature
that our senses could not reveal to us but they also pose among other things this problem that I have alluded to
I want to talk in this lecture about an instrument invented in the 17th century
that is less familiar to us than the telescope and the microscope
but the controversy surrounding its usage is deeply revealing of the kinds of reasoning
that the founders of modern science were employing
the instrument is the air pump
and especially the air pump as it was developed and used by the aristocratic Robert Boyle
the British aristocrat Robert Boyle in the middle of the 17th century
and his colleague assistant Robert Hook
one of the great and underappreciated scientific geniuses of the second half of the 17th century
a man who was intensely disliked by Isaac Newton but that is not reason enough for him to be famous
Hook had worked himself up from a working class background
and so Boyle could not really, given the class structure of British society, have Hook as his peer
but as a matter of fact Hook and Boyle worked together as peers
although Hook was employed initially as an assistant
and quickly became a colleague because he knew so much and in some cases knew so much more
than Boyle did in a number of areas of physics
but together what Hook and Boyle did was to take the air pump which they had not invented
the air pump had been invented earlier in the 17th century
what the air pump does in its sort of primitive form is to create a partial vacuum
well you want to create as good a vacuum as you can
and sometimes they thought they had created a perfect vacuum
but you want to create a partial vacuum at least and so that you can do experiments on air
now analogous to Galileo taking the telescope which he had not invented
and turning it to the sky and using the telescope to make discoveries that turned out to be epical
Boyle and Hook took the air pump which had been around
and used it to do a series of experiments on air
that established Boyle as a major figure in early modern science
he was one of the co-founders of the Royal Society
one of the things he discovered was the relationship between the pressure and the volume of a gas
and this was a source of considerable pride to him
and considered a significant achievement
of course once you create a partial vacuum you can do other kinds of experiments
for example if you evacuate a bell jar and you put inside the bell jar living creatures
then you discover as you remove the air that the living creatures start struggling for breath
if you continue then they will die
if before they die you let the air back in then they recover
and in fact Hook on the basis of these experiments that he particularly did on this
suggested that he thought that there was one particular component in the air
that was responsible for the vital principle that kept us alive
and in other experiments showed that without the air of course you Boyle and Hook
showed that without air you cannot have combustion
and speculated that this was the same thing
and of course 100 years later Lavoisier identified this as what we call oxygen
the element that we call oxygen
but Hook was quite clearly speculating that there was some part of the air
altogether a very interesting speculation because at that time air was thought to be an element
and not to have parts just as light was thought to be uniform
and it was a shock that Newton was able to decompose it as we talked about in an earlier lecture
so these experiments with air were considered wonderful
they were full of wonder and they revealed aspects of nature that were very powerful
and it was considered to be one of the many accumulating triumphs of early modern science
or modern science in the second half of the 17th century
Enter Thomas Hobbes who took exception to experimentalism generally
as a method of achieving knowledge
and exception to Boyle and Hook and their air pump specifically
just as an additional Philip
Hobbes also took exception to the Royal Society
and had serious criticisms of the society
which on two occasions at least he tried to join and he was rejected
but we'll have to talk about that as well
what did Hobbes have against the Royal Society
now Hobbes is quite an interesting figure here
as an outsider to early modern science
because although he tried very hard
Hobbes was not a natural philosopher and he was not a mathematician
he was primarily a philosopher and political philosopher
he's most famous for his book Leviathan
in which we have the version of the social contract theory associated with his name
which is that societies exist because in a primitive state of nature
a man lives in a state of war of all against all
that is the natural state of mankind
and we need societies to protect us from one another
and so Leviathan is an argument for a strong central government
a strong central authority
and as I said Hobbes' greatest fame today is probably as a political philosopher
Hobbes had a very long life
he said that he was born prematurely
when his mother in 1588 heard that the Spanish Armada had been cited in the English Channel
in fact that was the beginning of the attempt by Spain to invade and destroy Protestant England
on behalf of the Catholic Church, the Holy Roman Empire
the Spanish King was not at all pleased with the way England was behaving at the time
and the fleet subsequently was driven apart by storms and ruined and so was Spain
but at the time it was so frightening that his mother gave birth prematurely
he nevertheless managed to live 91 years
which in the 16th and 17th century was quite an accomplishment
until he was according to his earliest biographers about 40
there was nothing about Hobbes that would lead you to suspect
he would leave any impression whatsoever on posterity
but somewhere around the age of 40
when he had been living on his reputation as an Oxford graduate by being a tutor
and a kind of a family friend of the wealthy
at the age of about 40
Hobbes happened upon
well so the story goes
happened upon a copy of Euclid's Geometry
which he had never happened upon before
surprising since at that time Geometry was not being taught at Oxford on a regular basis
so that he looked into it and as the story goes
saw a theorem that seemed to him ridiculous
and he made some comment to that effect
I believe it was the theorem that says
that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle
and it seemed to Hobbes that you could inscribe different size angles in a semicircle
other than a right angle
it didn't have to be a right angle
and he was told no, no, no, no
if it's in Euclid that means it's got to be true
and if you work your way through the proof
then you will see that it has to be true
and Hobbes did that
and he was in a certain sense
overwhelmed by the discovery
that through the use of rigorous deductive reasoning
beginning with axioms, definitions, and postulates that were self-evident
and we talked about that whole concept of self-evidence before
you could force someone to recognize that a statement was true
that they had not thought was true
that there is a kind of compelling power to deductive reasoning
and so from then to the end of his life
Hobbes was a rationalist thinker
that is to say in the manner of Descartes and Spinoza and Leibniz
accepting the notion that it is only through deductive reasoning
that one can achieve knowledge
universal, necessary, and certain knowledge is possible
look at Euclidean geometry
and that is the benchmark that we must use
whenever we want to have knowledge of anything else
for example, knowledge of nature
so although he was critical of Descartes' meditations
the philosophical work by Descartes
in which Descartes tried to show how using deduction
one could guarantee the existence of the external world
and some knowledge of that
Descartes circulated that essay
to quite a number of prominent thinkers at the time
and when it was published, it was published with their responses
almost all of them quite sharply critical of it
but in many ways, Hobbes was very much a Cartesian
he was a Cartesian in his rationalism
in his deduction, in his siding with Plato's gods
on the issue of knowledge as being universal, necessary, and certain
and he was also a radical materialist
in the spirit of Descartes
but Descartes, it's not clear that he really meant it
but he was a prudent man
Descartes claimed that human beings alone in all of nature
that human beings had an immaterial mind slash soul
Hobbes took the view that there was only matter in reality
and that even the mind was matter
that reasoning was a species of calculation, for example
and I've referred earlier to the idea that
after the mechanical calculator was invented
a number of philosophers picked up on this metaphor
that reasoning was a form of calculation
Bacon, even before the mechanical calculator was invented
and his method thought that scientific reasoning
needed to be a species of calculation
and so Hobbes took the view that there was only matter in reality
and he was quite radical in this regard
but for our purposes, what we're interested in is
Hobbes' opposition to experimentalism
Baconian style of experimentalism
at least in spirit if not to the letter
because as we've discussed
you cannot really be a Baconian methodologically
and get anywhere in science
but in the spirit of Bacon
doing experiments in order to gain knowledge of nature
Hobbes said that's not possible
experimental experiments cannot reveal causes
experiments are always equivocal he said
because it is not obvious what the outcome of experiments means
take for example Boyle and his air pump
how do you know that the phenomena that he is describing
the relationships among pressure and volume
and in fact even with the combustion and the killing of birds
how do you know that these are facts of nature
as opposed to facts of the air pump
how do you know when the air pump is working correctly
now this was a brilliant insight on his part
because as a matter of fact
the air pump was a very finicky machine
it was very difficult to keep the seals properly sealed
it was very difficult
they were using kind of leather flaps
with various kinds of grease in order to make a seal
and the valves leaked, the seals leaked
and it was really difficult to keep the machine
operating properly for long
that was Hooke's job
Boyle was like the professor of physicians
in the pre-modern times
who stood by nice and clean
while a barber surgeon did the surgery and the dissection
and the professor just gave orders and instructions
Boyle was more like the elegant thinker and planner
it was up to Hooke to keep the machinery going
and as a matter of fact
Hooke made a very nice side income
working for craftsmen who manufactured telescopes and microscopes
for the wealthy
and they were also very difficult to use
and very finicky machines
and Hooke was a consultant to these craftsmen
and would be paid by them
when the people who bought them couldn't get them to work
and so he would go and help them and show them how to use
he was like a living instruction manual
so Hobbes said to Hooke and Boyle
how do you know the machine is working right now?
maybe the machine is working correctly
when you say oh it's not working
because we're not getting the results that we expect
Hobbes had a brilliant insight here
which is that complicated machines already embody theories
so how can they test the theories that were used
in order to build the machine?
the expectation of what the machine is going to show you
is already there
so how can you use that as a confirmation of the expectation?
so for Hobbes
the whole experimental orientation of modern science
was a mistake and of course in this he was very much like Descartes
I want to contrast here
and this gives us an opportunity to see something
that comes out very clearly
and that has not I think been as clear before
I want to contrast here
Hobbes as a theorist of knowledge
and Francis Bacon
Hobbes is actually revealing something to us
when we say that Hobbes was not himself a natural philosopher
he was not himself a scientist
he did have this hobby horse of mathematics
because he was sort of converted to rationalism through Euclid
he decided he had some innate knack in mathematics
and through the rest of his life he wrote a number of works in mathematics
which professional mathematics considered by and large nonsense
or so poorly reasoned that they didn't know what to make of it
even at the time that he died at the age of 91
he left behind I think the last manuscript he was working on
had to do with squaring the circle
for decades Hobbes insisted that you could square the circle
that mathematicians were wrong in dismissing this as a non-problem
not just a non-problem it's a misunderstanding
of fundamental mathematical concepts
to think that you can square the circle
get rid of the pernicious influence of Pi
and have a square that has the same area as a circle
so in spite of that he was not a mathematician
he was not a natural philosopher
but he was deeply involved as a critic of modern science
Hobbes formulated a theory of knowledge
a general theory of knowledge from a philosophical perspective
doesn't matter whether it's a good theory or not
but it was a general theory of knowledge
Descartes had a general theory of knowledge
when we move on in the next lecture
to John Locke the founder of empiricism
that's a theory of knowledge
Jung had a theory of knowledge that we'll be discussing
but Bacon did not have a theory of knowledge
and the reason why is deeply revealing of what's going on
or what we're trying to explore in this course
what's going on is that the founders of modern science
starting with Bacon thought that you could substitute method
for a theory of knowledge
that if you could only identify the right method
then you would be able to finesse Plato's battle
of the gods and the earth giants
you would finesse the philosophical problem of knowledge
which even in the 17th century they recognized
as having been going on for 2,000 years
without a definitive solution
and you could get knowledge of nature
without solving the big knowledge problem
the knowledge problem in philosophy
all you needed was to make sure that you had a method
that would guarantee knowledge of nature
and not be concerned with the wider problem
of knowledge in philosophy
in the next lecture we'll see
how philosophers responded to modern science
and the need for a theory of knowledge
but here this contrast between Hobbes and Bacon
is I think a very good one
Hobbes gives us a chance to see
what the difference is between Bacon
and his focus on method
and the empiricists of the late end of the 17th
and beginning of the 18th century
who had a theory of knowledge
which sounds like Bacon had preceded them
but Bacon was at best a proto-empiricist
and not an empiricist in terms of empiricism
it was a theory of knowledge in philosophy
what did Hobbes have against the royal society?
quite apart from the fact that they rejected him for membership
I suspect because the mathematical members of it
thought it was an embarrassment to have Hobbes
and his squaring the circle within the royal society
but Hobbes had some very good objections
to the royal society
one, he thought that because the royal society
was an exclusive group, self-selected
and the fact that experiments were done
for them by invitation only
that in effect these people were reinforcing their own prejudices
that they were announcing discoveries
because they were the kinds of things
that they were already committed to
that they constituted what Ludwig Fleck in the 1930s
we are going to see called a collective
of people who shared certain kinds of conceptual orientations
certain kind of training
here Hobbes says you have specialized interests
specialized equipment that requires specialized training to use
and specialized understanding
in order to make sense of
and then you decide that these are universal truths for all of nature
so that was one thing that he had against the royal society
that he saw that modern science produced knowledge
as a collective enterprise
as opposed to, for example, the lone philosophical thinker
the Descartes, the Spinoza, the Leibniz, the Hobbes
who seized the truth
in contrast to what Francis Bacon had written
borrowing an old Latin phrase
that truth is the daughter of time
that it's like studying nature is like building a brick wall
each scientist puts a brick in the wall
maybe two, three bricks if you're really important
and then the wall grows
but it's a collective construction
Hobbes preferred, so to speak, the more conservative view
of the individual genius who seized the truth
who grasped the truth on their own
but he was correct in recognizing
that although individuals are scientists
science is the product of a collective enterprise
scientific knowledge is the product of a collective enterprise
that's sort of the negative side of Hobbes
the positive side is the one that I pointed to before
the positive side is he's a philosopher
think of him as a philosopher
not merely a critic of natural science
his criticism of early natural philosophy
has to be seen in a positive and constructive sense
as the response of a philosopher
who was interested in what these people were doing
but who thought it was misguided
and the fact as he articulated what he thought was misguided
we get to see these aspects of early modern science
the commitment to experimentalism
the use of instruments, etc
the issue that Hobbes
caused to come back to the surface
in his opposition to the royal society
and to experimentalism
was the issue of the criterion
of knowledge in the platonic sense
that about which we cannot be wrong
that which corresponds to reality
that which is true because it corresponds to reality
this issue of the criterion of truth
the criterion of knowledge
how can we know that a statement about what we cannot experience
is true
Plato's statements about the ideal world of forms
or scientist's statements about what's really happening in nature
that the sun is really stationary
and we're the ones that are moving
when we cannot have a direct experience of that
and I have referred a couple of times
to the influence here of the Protestant Reformation
because the Protestant Reformation is a revolution
against the Catholic Church
as a criterion of truth, knowledge and authority
with respect to the revealed Word of God
the general intellectual issue is
well if you get rid of that criterion
and you still believe that the Bible is the revealed Word of God
what is your criterion?
how do we know that you the Protestants
know the truth about what God's word really means
you say the Catholic Church is wrong
what makes you right?
how can we standing in the middle
and hearing this dispute
decide that you have a case against them
this is very similar to the issue in astronomy
when we discussed Galileo arguing
that Ptolemy was wrong and Copernicus was right
well on the basis of what?
especially since neither Galileo nor Copernicus
could explain why the phenomena
that should have followed from a moving Earth
in fact did not follow
why birds did not get blown backwards in the sky
by the enormous winds generated by its axial rotation
or why stars didn't look displaced
all they could say was well they must be very, very far away
in order for them not to display any displacement
between December and June
so the Protestant Reformation
caused Protestant theologians to have to deal with this issue
of a criterion of truth and knowledge
with regard to God's revealed Word
and the answer initially turned out to be
as I've referred to in the case of Descartes
a secular version of this
was especially in Calvin
that each human being is born with a natural light
an inner light that God grants all human beings
and if you have faith
then this inner light illumines the truth of God's Word
with respect to God's Word
the secular version is that we all have an internal capacity
to see, to recognize the truth
that was one response
in the late 17th century
when Hobbes was just ending his life
and John Locke was beginning to ascend the stage
as we are going to discuss in the next lecture
the stage of history
the criterion issue took a different form
with respect to Protestant theology
justifying itself, giving a criterion
and that was to redefine certainty
oh yes, we know the truth of God's revealed Word
no means universal, necessary and certain knowledge
because you can't have a religion
based on probability and opinion
that's quite clear
and the redefinition
for example in the work of Joseph Glanville
who was both a theologian
and a founding member of the Royal Society
Glanville argued that certainty
and he was not alone in this
that certainty meant certain enough
as certain as we needed
in order to make faith commitments
in order to make intellectual commitments
that's what we're going to see in Locke
that certainty can't mean logical certainty
in the rationalist sense
so the point that I would like to
get across here is
and we've seen this several times in these lectures
there are all kinds of intersections
and mutual influences
among religion
the philosophy generally
the social context of the rise of modern science
and the evolution of modern science
if we ask ourselves
as we approach the end of the 17th century
the founding century of modern science
what did these people actually know
sticking to the definition
of universal, necessary and certain knowledge
the knowledge meaning that about which we cannot be wrong
we have to say
that Descartes, Galileo, Newton,
Huygens, Leibniz
didn't know anything
they didn't know any of the things
that they thought they knew
because we looking back can say
they were wronged about that
and yet they thought that they were generating knowledge
we need to keep that in mind
as we move on in the next lecture
to the 18th century
Thank you
