Lecture 8 â€“ Science, Society, and the Age of Reason
Who has knowledge?
Well obviously lots of people have knowledge in a common sense kind of way as Socrates
himself says in a number of dialogues when he went around looking to see who had knowledge
why all the craftspeople have knowledge more or less I mean people know certain people
know how to make shoes other people know how to make swords lots of people have knowledge
no no no no who has real knowledge who has knowledge that is universal necessary and
certain well craftsmen don't have that they have how to kind of knowledge but what we
want is the kind of knowledge that explains reality that is true because and must be true
that is based on deductive reasoning this is the way philosophers have formulated the
problem and for thousands of years philosophers have been pursuing knowledge knowledge of
what is true just good real and beautiful those are sort of the five super categories
that one finds in Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy the true the just the good the
beautiful and the real that's what we want to have knowledge of and the only thing that's
worth calling knowledge there is universal necessary and certain knowledge so that when
we say that X is good Y is beautiful Z is just we are making judgments that are true
with a capital T within that framework the only people who have knowledge that everyone
recognizes are mathematicians everybody from Plato on has acknowledged and even before
Plato the Pythagoreans that mathematical knowledge does have this character and of course it
is because mathematics uses deduction and that it is able to achieve the universality
the necessity and the certainty philosophers as Descartes pointed out in his discourse
on method well have actually achieved nothing they talk knowledge they are pursuing knowledge
but in fact they haven't actually got a body of knowledge Descartes writes approximately
1630 of that that you can point to and say okay here's the box of knowledge that has
been filled at least partially by the philosophers and so he's going to concentrate on on mathematics
and use mathematics as the basis for a physics that will be knowledge that is say a theory
of knowledge of nature that will be knowledge there is another group that has knowledge
the religious community has knowledge in Judaism Christianity and Islam there is the notion
that there we have knowledge and it comes from revelation through God's revealed word
so revelation was a source of what was believed to be knowledge what was accepted and defended
as knowledge and this was a battle that was fought in the high middle ages as to whether
philosophy and theology were competing for knowledge for the crown of knowledge and that's
a battle that that that became quite ugly at various times but in the end of philosophy
one in the sense that it be it was accepted that there what it was legitimate within the
Christian culture of Western Europe within the universities it was permitted to pursue
secular knowledge without denying religious knowledge religious knowledge was its own
type of knowledge and so and and philosophical knowledge was its own type of knowledge this
situation as I said still existed in the early 17th century when Descartes explicitly addressed
it and and focused on the specific question of knowledge of nature by the 18th century
what we have is a broad perception among the general public well the educated public of
course the the broad perception among the educated public that that there is now a new
community of people who possess knowledge it is secular knowledge of nature it is knowledge
that is powerful it is powerful intellectually and culturally because it shows that we can
have knowledge and the way you get it is not through revelation it's not through authority
it's not through dogma proclamations by central figures it is through the use of reason that
the use of reason is capable of generating this knowledge is a tremendously liberating
intellectual and cultural phenomenon plus there is the promise that it's going to give
us control over nature so that we can actually do things with science a promise that only
began to be realized in the 19th century there was not much you could do in fact almost nothing
you could do with scientific theories of the 17th and 18th century we get to the 19th century
you see we we get to do quite a lot and in fact quite a bit of the association of science
with improvement comes from the association of science with technology historically technology
leads science that is to say right through the 19th century major technological innovations
that had the greatest impact on society had nothing whatsoever to do with science were
not indebted at all to science you can cut it any way you want even the right brothers
where no one's going to call them scientists they were bicycle manufacturers who built a
flying machine after the fact the science of aerodynamics helped to improve the design
and construction of flying machines but a technology until the turn of the 20th century
leads science but culturally technology lags it is a fact about western culture that we
admire science vastly more than we admire technology what science represents explanation
and understanding somehow has more prestige in our in our culture right back from the
time of the ancient Greeks Plato and Aristotle had much less respect for Techni the Greek
name for making the kind of knowledge that's associated with how to with making then for
episteme epistemology the kind of knowledge that we have been talking about in this course
so in the 18th century what we want to look at a bit is the extent to which science and
broadly speaking Newtonianism had an impact on the culture of of Europe and on European
consciousness it was the living embodiment of reason to achieve progress so the epistemology
idea of progress becomes coupled with science as a reason driven activity and the transfer
to the culture level at the culture level for people who are who are not devoting themselves
to physics as a career they couldn't be a physicist as a career but I mean who made
that their primary activity in the way that people like say like like Robert Boyle and
Hook and and Newton did the people you saw meant by science doing things scientifically
meant doing things in a reasoned way in the way that the scientists do again appreciating
that the word scientists is an anachronism in this in this context that's very interesting
that that science scientific should have become a kind of buzzword appropriately translated
into the language of the day that a kind of buzzword that was broadly applied the idea
being that everything if you want to make progress if you want to achieve knowledge if you want
to be able to do things well then you've got to do it scientifically the idea of progress
is a renaissance idea in fact and it comes out of the very the underlying conceptualization
of the renaissance by the early humanists who launched what we call the renaissance
and in fact gave it its name renaissance means rebirth it's a renaissance a rebirth
of what a rebirth of the cultural excellence of ancient Greece and Rome after what was
perceived by them to have been the dark ages in which literature especially and philosophy
and language had declined to deplorable levels and so Petrarch the Italian poet after Dante
who who is considered to be the father of the humanist movement was the one who periodized
history in this way there was antiquity in which there were the glorious achievements
of Greece and Rome especially in literature in poetry in playwriting in history writing
in philosophy and then there were these miserable dark ages in which there was almost nothing
done that was worth reading or thinking about and now all of a sudden in at the end of the
13th century going into the 14th century setting aside the black plague we have the beginnings
of a rebirth of cultural excellence but as as Petrarch wrote where our job is not the
job of we humanists is not to to copy and to and to give a rebirth to Greece and Rome
as they were we're not supposed to just have our versions of Homer and Virgil what we're
supposed to do is he says like the way a bee takes pollen from the flower and it makes
honey out of it we need to digest the great classical works of antiquity and transform
them into greater works of modernity so the idea of progress the idea that we can be better
than people had been that we can produce things that are better than what had been produced
is actually built into the very concept of the Renaissance and it was a very controversial
idea because a more prevalent ideas of the at the time was that the world's running
downhill that the greatness was all in the past and as just as a person gets older they
lose the their power which peaks sometime in their early middle age so the earth is
getting older it's getting weaker people like bacon were were were fighting against this
notion of saying that on the contrary we the future can be much better than the past had
been and in the 15th and 16th centuries a popular form of court entertainment was was
called the battles of the ancients against the moderns that the debate but sometimes
it took a very entertaining and pictorial and dramatic forms of the spectacles of actual
battles between the ancients and the moderns who who is who has a more plausible argument
is life getting better or is life getting worse and in the 18th century the battle was over
there are no such debates anymore because apart from some people that will talk about
at the end of this lecture the the battle was won because of science as a reason driven
activity showed unequivocally that there could be progress even at the end of the 17th century
one could look back and say that people like Galileo and Newton had shown that we know
more than any human beings have ever known and now we have to extend this approach to
knowing and so we see a Newtonian scientific using these terms at now as kinds of buzzwords
in the 18th century to for example physiology studying human physiology scientifically studying
human social relationships sociology although the term occurs only in the 19th century but
one of the founding figures of sociology is the is the Frenchman Montesquieu who in who
wrote two books that argued that social relationships social institutions are determined by historical
and environmental factors that forms of government and forms of law are a reflection of environmental
that is a of physical factors so that you know like with you saying that the argue that
the ideas only observe certain laws they're not freely chosen Montesquieu was arguing
that people don't really freely invent their social institutions there are a reflection
of climate geography and history and other factors as well so a kind of scientific study
of social institutions as opposed to the idea that social institutions are somehow God given
and that they do not have a rational explanation of course the idea of applying reason to social
institutions is at the very heart of the American Revolution against the British this is America
was the first society that argued that we using our own reason can create a better form
of government than the British imposed on us we don't need history we don't need a king
we don't need religious institutions or political institutions of the past we are going to start
with a with a John Locke clean slate and we are going to invent a form of government using
reason no we hold these truths to be self evident that kind of language is a reflection of the
idea that we see reason being perceived as the means to to create a better society better
political institutions so in the area of of sociology in the area of physiology in the
area of psychology so scientific studies of the mind really begin in the 18th century
I mentioned you have several times now but apart from you there was a French by the name
of Kondiak who and who invented the term ideology meaning by at the time it got a new meaning
that we'll be discussing in later lectures ideologies was the study studying the logic
of ideas a theory of how ideas form in the mind in response to sensory inputs and how
ideas and relationships among ideas how they they follow certain lawful relationships very
similar a sounding theory to to you but there were others who were studying the mind by looking
by trying to figure out what patterns in the brain corresponded to mind activity so a scientific
study of the mind at the level of neuro physiology relating neuro physiology to behavior and
even to thought sensation and to thought Adam Smith in 1776 published the wealth of nations
a scientific economic theory that is a applying rational thinking to what seemed like an impossible
and possibly complex form of behavior economics political science as we call it political
economy as it was called in those days of the idea that decision making at the social
and political level can be done scientifically in particular the the Frenchman Torgaux and
Condorcet Torgaux was actually a minister to the Louis the 16th and and 10 years before
the French Revolution broke out and developed he was also a mathematician developed a theory
of probability to apply to decision making in the face of incomplete information that
how you could make rational decisions when you lack the information to deduce and we always
lack the information to deduce how to act in a particular context how can we use probability
theory to calculate given the various information available to us what policies what actions
will have the highest probability of giving us the outcome that we want actually Torgaux
advised the king that he needed to initiate radical reform within the government especially
making radical changes in the privileges of the aristocracy and the church otherwise
he saw no hope for for the monarchy and the result of this advice of course was he was
fired from his ministerial position and but the king lived long enough to die as the result
of the to be beheaded as a result of the revolution that that Torgaux that Torgaux had foreseen
had anticipated based on what his analysis of the of the French political situation in
the closing decades of the of the 18th century this idea that reason is the somehow universal
tool that must be applied to everything the every all all spheres of human activity in
order for them to work to progress the idea of progress is coupled to science which is
the embodiment of reason and therefore we need to be scientific that means we need to
use reason as the means to study anything whatsoever eventually this becomes applied
even to the study of God's revealed word so the critical approach to the study of the Bible
which which Spinoza already in the 17th century had started and had gotten him into deep trouble
but in the 19th century especially the climate was such that you could openly have sort of
research groups as applying scientific critical approaches to the study of biblical texts with
also highly controversial consequences so this notion of reason become being used in this way
responding to science that's what I'm getting at here what with this whole this whole phenomenon
cultural phenomenon that I'm trying to call attention to is is a response to the perception
that science is knowledge science is progressive the reason is because of reason and so modernity
what it means to be modern becomes associated with reason as used by people that we today call
scientists Kant wrote an essay called what is enlightenment that is a description of this mood
that we are living at the dawn of an enlightened era we don't yet live in an enlightened society
but the enlightenment is has begun what does it mean to be enlightened it means that we use reason
to dispel darkness the darkness of poverty and hate and crime and war and and physical misery
the of limited power to do in nature what we would like to do in terms of transportation
communication what then we will get that light to dispel the darkness through the use of reason
Thomas Paine of course famously used the title the age of reason as one of his political diatribes
in defense of the American initially in defense common sense of course was the one in defense of the
of the colonists rebellion against the king the age of reason captures this idea that I'm trying to get at
which is of course a response to science so you say that's very interesting how come European society
was so receptive to the rise of modern science it might well have been the case that science did what it did
and nobody paid much attention to it but in fact a great deal of attention was paid to it it's difficult here to decide
which is the effect in which is the cause did science cause this kind of 18th century response
or was it the case that Western culture in the 16th and 17th centuries inspired the rise of modern science
because the science was expressing was symptomatic of an aggressive secular focus a materialistic secular
a consumerist mentality if you will and when you see as I alluded to in an earlier lecture very briefly
how rich the 15th and 16th centuries were in technological innovation in the globalization of trade in that context
the voyages of discovery and creating global trade for Europeans and the European expansion and colonialists
the roots of colonialism and that led to a kind of euphoria at the wealth and the secularism
so the decline of religion as an institution which we see erupting violently at the end of the 18th century
with the French Revolution for example or in the American Revolution disenfranchising all churches
that the roots of that would seem to be in the 16th century you can find clear evidence of what you might call a longing for secular progress
materialistic progress that climate may be the one why did modern science arise in the 17th century
because there was in fact quite a good deal of support at a deeper level within the culture for that kind of knowledge
knowledge that abandoned the philosophical quest for knowledge which seemed sterile and the religious claims to knowledge
which after the Protestant Reformation seemed increasingly dubious and which were bloody in terms of the conflict release during the 30 years war
so that the 18th century response to science was not to something that dropped down out of the sky
but that science was a product of western culture in the Renaissance and post Renaissance period
and so we are now welcoming we respond that society welcomed science so to speak because it was a reflection of what society wanted
it's hard to tell which is the chicken and which is the egg here
traditionally we have depicted science as if it caused the 18th century response
I'm suggesting following what something that Nietzsche said about the four great philosophical errors
one of them is to get the causes and effects backwards to look at to claim that something is in effect when in fact it was the cause
it may be that the response to science was in an earlier phase of western culture causative of the very rise of modern science itself
so scientific knowledge and here we have a real irony in the 18th century what George Barclay had been afraid of
that Newtonian science would inspire atheistic materialistic determinism came true
because increasingly the case that people felt comfortable expressing atheistic beliefs
you can have an atheistic belief by atheistic opinions on the grounds of science justifying materialistic determinism with respect to nature
perhaps the most famous instance of this was Pierre Simon Laplace one of the greatest mathematical physicists of the turn of the 19th century
who wrote a multi-volume work on celestial mechanics showing that Newtonian physics predicted the stability of the solar system
there had been some concern that eventually the planets would spiral into the sun and that the solar system was not stable
Newton himself was worried about this and thought that maybe God had to intervene every now and then in order to straighten things out
and that Leibniz violently rejected that idea and their correspondence that we talked about in an earlier lecture
one of the major point that Leibniz makes is that God doesn't have to tinker with the universe
he's not like a clocksmith who has to have the clock brought back every couple of months to adjust it
when God makes something it works forever and Newton thought that God's got to intervene every now and then
because he wanted a providential deity that was actively involved in the universe
Laplace showed that Newtonian physics predicted the essentially eternal stability that all of the little wobbles that the planets have
cancel out over time it's called secular variation of the planetary orbits in astronomy astronomical terms
that they all cancel out and that the planets are going to stay this way forever
now when the book was finished Laplace was deeply involved in politics
he presented a copy to Napoleon supposedly and visiting British scientists claims that he was there when at a dinner
that Napoleon had for his intellectual followers and brought up the subject of Laplace's new book called Celestial Mechanics
and Napoleon doubtless had not had an opportunity to read the book from cover to cover
so he said to Laplace tell me Monsieur Laplace what is the place of God in your hypothesis
and Laplace's famous reply was sire I have no need for such a hypothesis
there is no need for God this became sort of the hallmark of the what you might think of the arrogance of the view
that science has displaced the need for reference to God and so with religion pushed aside philosophy perceived as sterile
the possesses of knowledge or science and in spite of the fact that scientific materialism is deterministic
science becomes a tool and a weapon in social reform which sounds ridiculous
what's the point of social reform if everything is deterministic
whatever is going to happen is going to happen but as a matter of fact the social reformers like Turgault and Condorcet
who was very heavily involved in the French Revolution even though it eventually killed him
turned against him that science and reason were in fact the means by which social reform was supposed to be implemented
and so we see for example one version of this the great French encyclopedia
movement very different from the British encyclopedia which is just filled with interesting facts
the French encyclopedia edited by Dennis Diderot who was a philosopher and novelist and playwright
just a very broad general intellectual
Diderot edited this politically inflammatory encyclopedia whose mission was to transfer technology to the people
power to the people through information to improve their own lives through understanding new kinds of machines and devices
and new ideas that would be liberating from tradition
so the encyclopedia was a very important manifestation of the idea that technical knowledge was a source of liberating social and economic power
out of the chaos of the French Revolution
there was a commitment which was untouched by all the craziness of the revolution and the enormous bloodletting of the revolution
and that was to rationalize to apply reason to weights and measures
to standardize the measurement of space, time and mass
the meter system
the gram system of weights, the meter system of length and the time
the revolution actually decided that a rational system of time is one in which there are 10 hours and 10 minutes
that everything should be units of 10 so the decimal system
you can find some 10 hour clocks if you go to museums that have clocks
that survived because after the revolution was overthrown they went back to 12 hour clocks
but the idea of 10 hour clocks, that's a much nicer way to divide things by 10 than by 12
which maybe an ancient Babylon made sense but we don't really see them as making a great deal of sense
now because of the focus in this course, of course I talk all the time about reason
it's not the case however that everything in the 18th century was perceived to be shaped by reason
on the contrary, there were strong reactions against this focus on reason
Rousseau rose to fame by arguing that science and technology in the middle of the 18th century
were making lives worse for people than better
that as a matter of fact we needed to return to something closer to the state of nature
to a society which reflected the natural state of human beings
he's famously said men are born free and everywhere live in chains
social chains of bondage, we've got to free them from those chains
science and technology are actually making the chains stronger
so Rousseau was an early romantic and so was a poet like William Blake
with his poems about Urizen for example
and the German poet Novalis, that was his pen name
whose central image was a blue flower
that is to say an unattainable kind of beauty
reason is not going to make us happy the romantic said
happiness is not the natural state of human condition
it is not what we should anticipate as justifying human existence
living heroically by feeling is better than living a calculated life according to reason
so there was in the 18th century
especially as the century came to a close
and people were actually acting on the basis of what they perceived to be reason driven science
that feeling instinct were powerful forces in human affairs
that were being steamroller by science and by reason
and so this is a very important counterpoint
and we'll pick up on this theme as we move now into the 19th century
