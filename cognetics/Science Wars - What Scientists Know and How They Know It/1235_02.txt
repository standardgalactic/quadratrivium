Lecture 2 – Competing Visions of the Scientific Method
Welcome back. In the last lecture, I blocked out the knowledge problem in science and described
how it can serve as a motivator for our search for the ultimate scientific instrument. How
scientists use reason in order to achieve what they claim to be knowledge of nature.
And by understanding that instrument better, we become better equipped to assess scientific
knowledge claims. In this lecture, I want to get started on the scientific revolution
and to make two points in this lecture. First, that the revolution is really best
seen as an evolution, not a revolution. And second, to begin to expose for you the centrality of
methodology to the thinking of the founders of modern science. And while it is commonly said
that there is such a thing as the scientific method by the end of this lecture and certainly
by the end of the next one, you will see that there really is not and never has been such a
method as the scientific method. That there is no one method that has been used by scientists
in order to move from data to theories. Let's begin with the concept of the scientific revolution.
And here I would like to paraphrase the art historian Walter Friedländer who writing in
another context said that every revolution becomes an evolution when you put the pieces together
properly. And certainly this is the case when it comes to modern science. The concept scientific
revolution, I should say the name scientific revolution, connotes some sort of radical
rupture with its precedents that somehow modern science emerged in the 17th century because
a couple of human beings suddenly saw the light as if modern science had dropped down out of the
skies. As a matter of fact, modern science inherited an enormous number of valuable ideas
and information from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Much more than is normally
acknowledged when one starts the story of modern science with the generation of bacon and Descartes
in the early 1600s. I want to talk first about the medieval legacy and I want to focus on four
ideas to begin with. First of all, the idea that the task of nature philosophy, that's what we
call science today, but the two are not exactly synonymous and we'll be talking some more about
that when I talk about Newton and Leibniz. But until the 19th century, what we call people we call
scientists were called natural philosophers. They were philosophers who studied nature as
opposed to philosophers who studied ethics, who studied the civil law, who studied metaphysics.
So the task of natural philosophy was identified back in the 12th century, the early 12th century.
The task of natural philosophy was to explain natural phenomena in terms of their causes.
That's what the task of natural philosophy is, to take natural phenomena
and to explain them in terms of their causes. Second idea, nature is a closed system.
What does that mean? It has two facets to it. Nature is a closed system in terms of explanation.
The fancy word for this is epistemologically from the Greek word episteme for knowledge.
So when it comes to explaining natural phenomena, you must only refer to other natural phenomena.
So now this is a clarification of the first idea. The task of natural philosophy is to explain
natural phenomena in terms exclusively of natural causes. This idea was first, to the best of my
knowledge, written down in the Latin West by an Englishman by the name of Adelaide of Bath,
who wrote a book called Natural Questions, early in the 12th century. And this de facto became one
of the founding principles of natural philosophy and was inherited by modern science and has
never been challenged. It is one of the most fundamental principles of natural science that
you must only use natural causes to explain natural phenomena. You may not refer to supernatural
causes in order to explain natural phenomena. The causes may be immaterial nowadays, there
might be energy fields, but they are not supernatural. All the causes, all explanation
must be within the framework of nature. The second facet of the notion that nature is a closed system
is that nature is closed, here's another 75 cent word, ontologically in terms of real things,
that the ultimately real things of nature can neither be created nor destroyed. Now the more
recent version of this principle is that conservation of matter, conservation of energy,
conservation of angular momentum, that scientists rely on certain constants because if everything
changed all the time you could not have a scientific theory. If the constants of nature
changed, if it were the case that those terms that enter into scientific equations as constants
changed over time, then one of two situations has to pertain. Either there's a pattern to the change
which does not change over time or you can't have science. So the principle, again the second idea
science inherited from the high middle ages is that nature is a closed system.
It is what it is. God created it this way and now it's running on its own. We'll see this concept
come up as a controversy between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz in the lecture after the next
one. So the third idea is the centrality of experience and experiment to natural philosophy
as opposed to a reliance on authority or revelation. That's the third idea that was formulated in the
wake of the study of nature in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries, the high middle ages, that natural
philosophers cannot simply quote ancient authorities. They must anchor their claims to knowledge in
experience and there was clearly the beginning of what we would call what we would recognize as an
experimental methodology. The fourth idea was recognizing that mathematics is peculiarly useful
to describe natural phenomena. Certainly in optics where already the Greeks had equations such as
the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection for reflections from a flat mirror,
from a plain mirror. But in music and in optics the ancient Greeks already had mathematical
equations but this was generalized to the description of motion in the high middle ages and the first
equations of motion were written at this time and a considerable amount of mathematical development
was just beginning before the Black Plague hit. I want to just leave that as one small package
of ideas, very fundamental ideas, not the only ones but the most fundamental ones I think that
were inherited by modern science. In the wake of the Black Plague the Renaissance was an extraordinarily
fertile seedbed for modern science. I stopped with mathematics, let me pick that up in the 15th
century and the 16th century. The use of mathematics to deal with reality was an extraordinarily
prominent feature of Renaissance life. Mathematical, it was central vanishing point perspective
which became the dominant form of artistic painting by the end of the 15th century,
was a mathematical trick if you like. That is to say there was a specific mathematical technique
that an artist had to learn and there were many handbooks written by artists for other artists
to teach them this mathematical technique so that they painted in this way that looked real.
That is to say that depicted the physically real on a two-dimensional surface you saw what looked
like the physically real world. Mathematical map making begins in the 16th century and mathematical
navigation and engineering drawing with exploded views for example of machine parts and the ability
to represent a three-dimensional machine on a two-dimensional surface so that quite complex
machines could now be designed and you could give those drawings to a craftsman who would be able to
replicate that machine because the drawings now had all the three-dimensional information that
that they needed. I want to talk a little bit about the year 1543 because the year 1543 was in
some sense a kind of a miracle year in that Copernicus's book on the revolution of the
heavenly spheres appeared in that year. Andreas Vesalius's revolutionary textbook in anatomy
on the structure of the human body appeared in that year and in that same year three treatises
by Archimedes were translated into Latin and they are particularly important because they
became the basis for Galileo's method of studying nature and we'll talk about that in in the next
lecture. The study of nature which we should not call science the study of nature in the 16th century
was in other words a very rich activity not just at the level of theoretical science but
as I've been indicating in applied science and mathematics and in technology there was a kind
of a boom in in deep mining and in great growth in the complexity of of machines and in technology
generally. So science did not drop down out of the sky science inherited a great deal of
of intellectual equipment so to speak and many of the ideas that were taken up by modern scientists
were inherited from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and that gave a particular character
and cast to the study of nature in the 17th century that we retroactively call modern science
but of course when it began it still was natural philosophy but it was a very distinctive kind
of natural philosophy and so I make the segue now to the two figures who are considered in some
sense the founding figures of modern science the transition from Renaissance style magical nature
philosophy to more to what we recognize as modern natural philosophy are Francis Bacon in England
and his slightly younger contemporary René Descartes in France. Bacon was the son of a prominent
courtier and he himself eventually rose under King James to the position of what we would call
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in England although he was then caught up in a scandal
because of political intrigues he was brought down and the last years of his life he had plenty
of time to write although he was he was spared prison and his fine of several million dollars was
was rescinded but he got the message and he kept out of politics. Bacon was not himself a scientist
but what Bacon was was a great social and educational reformer. Bacon had a vision that science and
technology would could be the basis of English prosperity and power if the British public
received the kind of education that would allow them all to participate in what we would call
technological innovation and if the government supported the study of science so that the
combination of scientific knowledge and a population knowledgeable in technology the word
engineering didn't apply at the time would it's quite a prescient vision in pursuit of this vision
Bacon in 1620 published a book called The New Organon. The New Organon plays off a word
organon which in in Aristotle's writings represents the name for Aristotle's collection
of logical works on deduction and induction which is a form of logical reasoning in which you go
from the particular to the general that induction deduction and persuasive arguments that are not
strictly speaking logical only but involve various techniques of persuasion that also take advantage
of emotionality so this collection of works was often called the organon which by the way means
instrument or tool which is why I talked about reason as being the ultimate instrument in science
so Bacon's book was here is a new instrument for getting knowledge of nature because when you get
knowledge of nature you will be able to control and master nature and we will be able to do
wonderful things that will improve the human condition that will make us more prosperous
that will make us healthier that will make us more powerful to do that however Bacon said
something astonishing you have to quiet the mind. Bacon said something which for a philosopher in
the western tradition was quite revolutionary here I'll use that term revolutionary he said
the mind is the problem experience is the solution what we need he says is a method in which the
natural philosopher controls their imagination their fantasy their speculative tendencies
and simply collects the facts subjects those facts to a kind of mechanical analysis until
relationships among those facts are discerned formulate a tentative hypothesis do an experiment
to test the hypothesis refine the hypothesis test it again go back and forth until you can
announce a law of nature he was a lawyer so for him the metaphor that there are laws of nature
came easily for Bacon in other words the scientific knowledge is a relatively mechanical
thing he said geniuses need not apply we don't need geniuses in science what we need are people
who have patience and perseverance collect facts analyze them in accordance with his method today
he would have loved artificial intelligence research for example the idea that there is a
calculation involved in going from experience to to scientific knowledge and in the end we will
wind up with laws of nature with knowledge of the essences of things so he was on the side of
Plato's gods that is to say side the object of science was reality but he was primarily concerned
with knowledge that was proven by its fruits knowledge that was proven by its practical
consequences that was primarily important but he believed as most scientists still do
that when a theory works practically then it must have some connection with the way things really
are so bacon identified four features of the mind that he called idols of the mind these are
altars metaphorically speaking at which men worship more or less unconsciously which is a
rather strange metaphor to worship unconsciously but the idols of the mind are fourfold first
there is the idol of the tribe that human nature we are by nature inclined to reason in ways which
are not correct for example we tend to be much more responsive to positive evidence than to
negative evidence hearing small numbers of part of confirming instances overwhelms hearing an equal
number of negative instances we tend to look for closure we tend to look for prettier patterns in
our experience than are actually there these are part of human nature this is why you need
bacon's method to control these built-in tendencies to see things in facts that are not really there
now the idols of the tribe are generic we're all infected by them the idols of the cave by contrast
are specific to each individual human being each of us has some hobby horse that we ride some of
us ride multiple hobby horses and we tend to see experience we tend to see evidence confirming or
disconfirming based on those prejudices that we personally possess the idols of the marketplace
are those prejudices that come through social interactions and in particular the interactions
that are mediated by language which is intrinsically equivocal leading to semantic arguments that are
irresolvable because people are talking past each other and to classifying things in ways
that make us think that they are more different than they are finally the idols of the of the theater
are those prejudices those ways of thinking that are erroneous that get in the way of correct
reasoning because that's what we were taught in school that's what we were taught at the
universities especially theories and systems of philosophy that are outmoded and that in fact
are not true so the idols of the tribe the idols of the cave the idols of the theater the idols of
the marketplace these four idols represent the idolatry of the mind that must be suppressed
if we want to achieve real knowledge of nature and that can be done if we follow a mechanical method
i'm using the word mechanical and acronistically here we use a method that is like a calculating
machine it's interesting that the first calculators were in fact being invented in France at the very
time that bacon was was writing the new published the new organ on now can science actually function
this way and the answer to that is clearly no because there is effectively an infinite amount
of facts to a number of facts to collect which ones are relevant which ones aren't if you approach
the facts without any hypothesis of relevance at all you would absolutely be overwhelmed so in fact
no scientist has ever been a strict baconian although lots of scientists have claimed to be
baconian and uh and when people talk about the baconian method they mean broadly speaking the
experimental method but not the method that bacon himself proposed because if you followed that you
would get nowhere and bacon himself got nowhere he was not a scientist he was a lawyer and social
reformer he was opposed to the use of mathematics overly much just the minimum amount required
in doing the analysis of facts but the idea that mathematics captured essential features of nature
was he thought a fundamental error one of those prejudices of the schools one of the idols of
the theater that needed to be avoided by by the natural philosopher and he did not really have
much of an intuition for good science as we would recognize it in retrospect for example
he knew about almost everybody who was doing work in science in in his time he Copernicus was long
dead he knew the Copernican theory but he did not subscribe to it he knew the work of William
Gilbert who had done a wonderfully empirical study of the magnet and like and static electricity
published in 1600 and he thought it was a wonderful example of experimentalism but he did not agree
with the theories that William Gilbert formulated on the basis of those experiments he knew about
the the work of Kepler and didn't seem to think much of that and and his personal physician was
William Harvey who who discovered the circulation of the blood pumped through the heart and he
thought that Harvey didn't know what he was talking about so his intuition on this matter was not
very good either and yet his image his reputation persists as the father of the modern experimental
method and when the Royal Society was founded in 1660 bacon was one of the founding figures
that those people look back on as having started the move towards what we recognize as as modern
science now let's shift to Descartes roughly contemporary Descartes French philosopher
who was determined to restore universal necessary and certain knowledge of nature to the status that
he believed it needed to have in contrast to the 16th century movement called skepticism or
academic skepticism which argued that that knowledge could only be particular contingent and probable
Descartes wrote a published a series of books the most famous being the discourse on method and
the rules for the direction of the mind which argued that experience is the problem the mind
is the solution just the inverse of bacon experience is the problem it is it misleads us
it is the mind that can see through the misleading information that the senses give us in experience
and correct them and reach truth about nature in order to do this it must use deduction so
bacon's method is strictly inductive bacon hated deduction he thought that was what was all what
that was what was wrong with classical philosophy the focus on deduction and the use of mathematics
as capturing essential features of nature which he identified with with mystical nature philosophy
Descartes claimed it is deduction that is gives us the only possibility of knowledge of nature
knowledge in the strict sense of universal necessary and certain knowledge and mathematics
is the key to expressing this knowledge he himself was a major contributor to modern mathematics
inventing something called analytic geometry which lets us essentially write algebraic equations of
geometric figures so that you can solve problems in geometry algebraically and that gives us
enormous power a single equation describes every possible circle for example just by changing the
values of the of the variables that are in the that are in the equation and for Descartes deduction
mathematics and he recognized that there was of course the serious problem logically speaking
of going from experience which is universally recognized to be particular sounds odd to put
it that way universally recognized to be particular I mean everybody recognized that experiences
is particular how do you overcome the particularity of experience in order to achieve universal
necessary and certain knowledge so Descartes believed that we were born with certain innate
ideas and also that we had an intuition we had a certain intuitive power to recognize truth now
in this Descartes was actually offering us and we see this very clearly in his in his more philosophical
work called the meditations a secular version of the Protestant reformer notion that every believer
has in them an inner light that allows them to see the correct interpretation of God's word
and this is why the Protestants insisted that every Protestant had to have their own Bible had to
study their own Bible because if they achieved the right level of faith they would see within
themselves every human being is given by God a natural light an inner light that illuminates
true understanding of God's word Descartes in the meditation in the discourse on method in the rules
for the direction of the mind in his major work principles of philosophy argues that we all have
a secular intuition that the mind has an intuitive power to recognize clear and distinct ideas that
are true and so combining deduction and intuition Descartes thought that we could form hypotheses
universal hypotheses from which the particulars of experience could be deduced and when you did that
then that validated the hypotheses as describing the way things were out there the way things were
in the world mathematics plays a central feature here not surprising the deduction part of Descartes
reasoning in science or natural philosophy is is a reflection of the use of mathematics
use of deduction in mathematics and the use of mathematics in the sciences for Descartes
experiment was secondary maybe even tertiary because experiments he thought were were quite
equivocal it was not always clear how to interpret the outcome of experiments so for Descartes
he was primarily concerned with the reasoning process with sitting in a nice quiet warm place
and thinking what hypotheses would allow me to deduce the phenomena that I'm trying to explain
Newton will make fun of this as a method of feigning hypotheses imagining hypotheses whereas
Newton's goal was to find the true causes of things Descartes for example in one place in
the principles of philosophy says that God could have used an infinite number of ways to create
the world there's no way we can figure that out so if we can find a way that is that works then
we'll take that to be the correct way and we'll take that to be the way that that it actually
happened now Descartes method is is critically dependent on believing that you can rely on
the universal hypotheses that you use as the basis for your deductions and of course that's
really quite controversial where do these universal premises come from and that will become a serious
point of contention in fact throughout the entire story of the search for this ultimate instrument
that scientists use I want to clarify an issue here that's going to come up in the next couple
of lectures and we might as well get it out on the table now because it takes a little thinking
about there is a serious intellectual problem that Bacon and Descartes were well aware of and in
fact so will Galileo and Newton and Leibniz and everybody else be aware of in attempting to argue
that a scientific theory is true because it makes correct experimental predictions in ancient logic
already and all of these people were masters of ancient logic because you had to study that in
order to get your university degree in fact you had to study Aristotle's logic right into the
middle of the 19th century at essentially all universities there is something that is there
is a form of reasoning that is called affirming the consequent now unfortunately some books
call it affirming the antecedent but it doesn't matter what you call it this is the way it works
let's suppose we know that the following sentence is true if my theory is true then it a logical
consequence of that theory is that x should turn red x does turn red therefore my theory is true
that form of reasoning is a deductive logical fallacy it does not follow because there could
be other reasons why x turns red if you said if a is true then b is true and a is true it does follow
that b is true but to say that if a is true then b is true and b is true does not tell you that a is
true but of course all of modern science is based on experimental prediction of this sort
so that means that built into modern science is a flaw so to speak built into modern science is
a kind of a fracture zone that precludes certainty we can never be certain because a theory works
that it is true and we will see in the course of these lectures that many theories that was
thought to be true because they worked were subsequently declared to be false Newtonian
mechanics being one example of those once we hit relativity theory so keep this in mind as we move
into the next lectures because we will talk about this with respect to Newton and Leibniz
but then this awareness sort of disappears as if it could be swept under the rug but this
the fact that that a deductively fallacious form of reasoning is fundamental to modern science
is a fundamental feature of the science wars as we will see in the lectures that come
