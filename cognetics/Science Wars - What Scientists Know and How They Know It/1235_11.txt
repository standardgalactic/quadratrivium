Lecture 11 Knowledge as a Product of the Active Mind
At the end of Lecture 9, I called attention to the question of where do our assumptions
come from?
Now, the spotlight focused on the pivotal role that assumptions play in scientific
reasoning, in claims to objective and deductive scientific knowledge as a result of, among
other things, Fourier's move and the rise of the discovery or invention of non-Euclidean
geometry.
The question is, when we look at a particular set of assumptions now, we can ask the question,
why these assumptions, where did these assumptions come from and what are their justification?
Now we're going to explore, in this lecture, we're going to explore that question in some
detail.
It has been essentially universally accepted that the senses transform the stimuli that
activate the senses.
Aristotle actually tried to get away with the theory that the senses are neutral conduits,
sort of like fiber optic channels, that convey what's out there into our minds without
transforming it.
But of course, at least in the modern period, the ancient Greeks also didn't buy this theory,
but certainly in the modern period, we have seen how the distinction between primary and
secondary sensations was recognized as a crucial element in studying nature, that the information
that our senses gave us was not revealing of what the underlying causes of experience
were, and that there was a discrepancy between our sensory experience of nature and what
nature was really like.
So the secondary sensations come from the way our eyes and ears and nose and brain are
wired, so to speak, to transform electromagnetic energy impinging on the retina.
And so we have to use reason to overcome the transformations that the senses make on our
sensory inputs in order to know what's really out there.
So our reason tells us that what's really out there is electromagnetic vibrations of
various frequencies that our eyes are sensitive to those electromagnetic waves that have a
wavelength between, roughly speaking, 7,000 angstroms and 3,500 angstroms.
And we see the 7,000 ones as red and the 3,500 angstrom ones as violet.
But there's no red apple out there.
The redness of that apple is the way our eyes respond to the apple.
If our eyes responded to different frequencies, we would see apples differently than we do
see them.
So we have to use reason to correct the influence of the senses on the way nature acts on us.
Okay?
But what happens if I ask the question, but what if reason has a transformative effect?
What if reason is self-active?
The senses are self-active.
They each have a nature.
Our eyes have a certain nature, so to speak.
They respond to certain wavelengths and to certain frequencies and certain situations
and certain relationships to one another, etc.
But what if reasoning has a self-active character?
Now, classically, from Plato on, the assumption was that reason is a timeless, neutral faculty.
That reason does not change what we reason about.
That reasoning is, that's what the whole point of logic is, that it has a timeless,
ahistorical character.
If reason itself has a self-active character, if reason has a nature, and especially if
that nature changes over time, then what happens to our ability to correct the transformative
effects of the senses?
What happens to our ability to have knowledge of nature, if what it means to reason about
nature carries with it the same kind of transformations of what we reason about, that the senses
have with what they respond to, sensorially, so to speak.
That's a really challenging question, and of course, that is exactly where we find ourselves
with Kant.
Kant said that the self-active character of the mind, this is an extreme response to
this question, that the self-active character of the mind is what constructs experience.
That experience is not an image of nature, as if the mind had some kind of a mirror inside
it, that a neural mirror, and that through the senses, in this mirror of the mind, our
self could look, and we see, and hear, and smell, and feel, and taste what's out there.
Kant says, oh no, experience is constructed by the mind, but in a universal necessary
and certain way, but there are other options than the Kantian option.
We notice, by the way, that Francis Bacon's methodology, back in the early 1600s, in the
New Organon of 1620, was explicitly designed to prevent the self-activity of mind from
distorting our reasoning about nature.
Bacon recognized that, as a matter of fact, human beings, the minds of human beings are
continually churning with all kinds of prejudices, and we talked a little bit about the idols
of the tribe, the idols of the cave, the idols of the marketplace, the idols of the theater.
All of those are kinds of self-activity of mind, and Bacon thought we could escape from
that if we imposed a rigorous methodology that was impersonal and objective, a kind of calculating,
you remember I called it, of experience in order to reason correctly towards knowledge
of nature.
In the 19th century, the situation is more complicated than that.
Now that we've got the examples of non-Euclidean geometry and Fourier's move, so to speak,
now that we've got the example of Kant's system of philosophy and his particular theory of
knowledge, the question of where these assumptions come from and whether the mind plays an active
role are raised all over again.
Fourier's move suggests that there is an invented character, or that there may be an
invented character to scientific theories, because they are not automatically assumed
to be corresponding to be pictures of the external reality.
They are descriptions of how nature behaves in our experience, but they don't have to
be taken as claiming a pictorial kind of correspondence, metaphorically speaking, a pictorial correspondence
to what's really out there.
So Fourier's move brings to the surface the possibility that instead of scientific knowledge
proceeding according to what I earlier called an archaeological methodology, in which scientists
are just revealing what's out there, they're telling it like it is, in favor of taking
a closer look at the idea that scientists construe experience, not the archaeological
model of scientific knowledge, but the construal model, that scientific theories are interpretations
of, well, you can have it interpretations of experience or interpretations of reality,
you're going to get into trouble with the latter, but you can use any phrase you want,
they have an interpretive quality and therefore are non-unique. There's more than one interpretation,
interpretations are pluralistic by definition.
A thinker who is very revealing in this regard is William Ewell. Ewell was a very prominent
figure in the scientific community of his time. He was not a great scientist, he was
a scientist, he may not even have been a scientist of the first rank, but he was very well thought
of as a mineralogist and had a whole theory of crystals and crystal structures and shapes,
and so he was a productive research scientist, but he was more famous as a sort of a political
figure within the science community. He was very actively involved in science education,
he eventually became the master of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, and
he exerted a considerable influence in the public image of science. He was very active
in the founding of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He gave a
famous series of lectures as part of this Bridgewater series of lectures on the relationship
between science and religion. He was a major spokesperson for science and he had a gift
with languages and he was asked to invent terms when scientists needed new names, so
he invented the terms anode and cathode for example, and he invented the term scientist.
Ewell invented the term scientist as a substitute for nature philosopher or natural philosopher
or for the French term savant, which also had been used sometimes in the 18th century,
had been used quite a lot for the term a person that we would consider a scientist, and by
the way of course it's a very revealing word, savant is someone who knows, it's a knower,
a savant is a knower. Scientists were called knowers, of course the Latin word science
also means knowing, but it would have applied much more broadly from the time of the ancients,
it's Greek version and in Latin all through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the word
science was used differently, it stood for pure philosophical knowledge and then in the
18th century became transformed, so the word scientist was invented by Ewell. Ewell had
a theory of science which speaks directly to the point that we have been considering.
For Ewell, scientific knowledge has a deductive structure and therefore the scientific knowledge
therefore it is universal, necessary and certain, subject to the assumptions that are used
in our reasoning. These assumptions according to Ewell are creatively invented by individual
scientists, he called the assumptions that we use for giving a deductive structure to
our scientific theories, he called those fundamental ideas, so fundamental ideas cannot be deduced
from experience, they are derived from experience in a process that Ewell called induction.
What Ewell did was he took the traditional term induction which means essentially forming
generalizations based on particular experiences and that kind of reasoning is probabilistic
only, it can never lead to certainty, remember I did that number with the swans and the crows
and so on, so Ewell took the term induction and he redefined it, he redefined it by saying
that there is a deeper level to induction at which the working scientist struggling to
explain some phenomenon suddenly sees in the mind's eye that by assuming X he or she can
then deduce the phenomenon in question from X together with the relevant empirical data
that they have collected and he called that induction, so for example when Kepler took
Tico Brahe's painstakingly collected data for the orbit of Mars night after night for
months, Brahe plotted the position of Mars in the night sky, he actually only covered
about a quarter of Mars orbit but when he painstakingly plotted those points when Kepler
took that data and he tried to fit that data to a path, what is the path, well it's supposed
to be a circle but it wouldn't fit the circle, he tried multiple different shapes and at
a certain point it occurred to him it's an ellipse, it's not a circle, it's not an
oval void, it's an ellipse, the planets move in elliptical orbits, it is quite clear that
logically speaking you cannot deduce an ellipse from the data that Tico Brahe had, there was
no question in Ewell's mind about that and I think in retrospect we agree with Ewell,
so for Ewell this was a fundamental idea that Kepler grasped, that's what it means to be
a scientific genius, now Bacon had said geniuses need not apply, what we need are people who
have the patience to grind through the experimental method, you will argue no no no you need geniuses
in science because they are the ones who come up with the fundamental ideas like Newton's
definitions of space, time, motion and matter and his laws of motion, then from those we
can deduce a tremendous number of equations and phenomena that in fact accurately describe
experiences, so science has this deductive character because scientists are able to somehow
see in relevant empirical data, this is, it's a creative kind of seeing, which assumptions,
that's what I've been calling them, which assumptions would allow them to form theories
that had a deductive logical structure, Ewell was frequently criticized as a Kantian but
he wasn't a Kantian because for him the fundamental ideas change over time, fundamental ideas are
historical as problems change because new experiences raise new kinds of problems so
scientists have to change the fundamental ideas, so for Ewell we could only understand the nature
of scientific knowledge in time historically and his major work is a large two-volume work called
the philosophy of the inductive sciences founded upon their history and he also wrote a massive
work called the history of the inductive sciences but for him inductive science doesn't mean what
it meant for Bacon because for him induction includes this completely non-logical creative
inventive moment which in fact results in fertile assumptions that he called fundamental ideas,
a contemporary of Ewell's and a sometimes friend and colleague was the astronomer John Herschel,
Herschel strongly disagreed with Ewell on his theory of scientific knowledge and Herschel published
a book which described scientific knowledge in what I will call neo-Baconian terms, Herschel
insisted that as a matter of fact scientific knowledge did describe nature as it really is
and it does proceed in the inductive experimental way as Bacon meant induction not as Ewell meant
induction and for Herschel was quite comfortable with the metaphor such as the following if you
think of a vast warehouse full of all kinds of stuff so that if you walked into it in the dark
you would you would be constantly tripping over stuff and you would be unable to get into it
someone puts on a light a dim light you begin to be able to see certain shapes but it's still a
very dim light and you can barely make out what's beyond say 10 feet away from you then someone
changes the bulb from 10 watts to 20 watts to 30 watts to 100 watts to 200 watts as you illuminate
as the as the light gets brighter you can see more and more you can see further and in more detail
for Herschel that's the way science worked it was experience now he recognized that Bacon's
methodology would not work as Bacon said it would but an updated version of experience correcting
experience could be the analog of putting in brighter and brighter bulbs so scientific knowledge
accumulates it grows in the manner that our inventory of what's in that warehouse would be
able to grow and our ability to thread our ways among all this stuff would be able would be enhanced
if the if the light were brighter you will of course rejected that meanwhile in France and
there's a kind of a to and throwing here that I like a French contemporary of you will and Herschel
was August Comte August Comte is famous as the founding figure of modern sociology as a science
and but what he really developed was a developmental theory of the mind Comte went further than you will
in identifying the self activity of the mind as a factor in our reasoning in effect he said that
the mind itself develops in time that the at there was a point in time when human beings
could only think animistically fetishistically monotheistically at a certain point in time
people some people at least had advanced where they could know they no longer needed to think
theologically at all in order to explain natural phenomena they thought metaphysically
and metaphysical thinking developed between the time of Plato and Aristotle until the 19th century
when some people some human beings had advanced to the next stage that of thinking
positivistically he introduced this term positive thinking meaning thinking based on facts
no wishful thinking no reference to metaphysical realities facts and their relationships that's
what science is about unfortunately he lapsed into inconsistencies by talking about necessary
relationships and necessity as a metaphysical notion but he was a very busy man and he never
revised anything he wrote he published a tremendous amount because he had theories and ideas that he
had to get out and this developmental theory of mind an evolutionary theory of mind in the sense that
the the metaphysical stage of thinking is not is not a an outgrowth it was not implicit in the
theological stage of thinking it is a really new way of thinking and and people in in the
metaphysical stage could not think positivistically so here we had an example in which in which
Akon said we are very fortunate people we scientists in the 19th century because we live at a time
when we can think positivistically and so we've got to get rid of traditional metaphysics and
recognize that scientific theories are about the correlations among facts we collect fact this is
very big onion and he admired bacon enormously we collect facts we find relationships between them
that have practical consequences and that's it a younger contemporary john stewart mill
took hershal's view against yule and against conch mill held that science really was induction
again an updated version of baconian induction but whereas hershal's update of bacon was rather
vague mill in a work called a system of logic worked out an extremely detailed theory of
induction with all kinds of cross-referenced experiments and new kinds of tests for analyzing
new techniques for analyzing data to discover correlations among the data and test those
correlations in order to discover the true causes of phenomena unlike comped he said i'm not just
interested in relations we must know the true causes if you don't know the true causes you
can't have necessary relations you can only have adventitious relations so mill strongly defended
a traditional notion of induction against yule's redefinition of induction and kept and you and
mill argued that kepler did find the ellipse in the data i think in retrospect we would say you
will won that battle but it was a major conflict if you look in a system of logic he's got a huge
footnote there arguing that that that the ellipse pops out of kepler's data today philosophers and
historians of science would be on yule's side that you that you cannot find universal forms you
can't find the ellipse in the data so yule was a central figure here in trying to show that an
ordinary role for mind in reasoning a self that the self activity of the mind is a fundamental
factor in in scientific reasoning and that that requires that we pay attention to the history
that the philosophy of science the theory of scientific knowledge can only be discovered
by watching science unfold historically and that of course is why i adopted the historical method
in this course it is only through watching these kinds of disputes and debates unfold in time
that you get a true sense of the nature of this problem that we're wrestling with the knowledge
problem in science the question of what scientists know and how they know what they know and what
the significance is of what they know now as i indicated in the lecture on the 18th century the
last lecture on the 18th century the nature of this course is such that we focus on reason
and we're talking about scientific reasoning but it is i think important to put reasoning in
in a broader cultural context it was not universally accepted in the 19th century as it was not
universally accepted in the 18th century that reason is the dominant factor in human affairs or
that reason is the dominant factor in developing a strategy for coping with life successfully
so i referred in the in the lecture on the on the 18th century the cultural impact of science
in the 18th century i referred to the romantics very briefly i referred to the defense of feeling
against reason and the defense of a heroic conception of human existence to a kind of
calculating conception of human existence which the romantics attributed to people who tried to do
things scientifically calculating what what to do as opposed to responding on the basis of
passion and i referred to such figures as Jean Jacques Rousseau for example and and his defense
of of sentiment of feeling and the whole question of living by feeling rather than living by reasoning
i referred to Goethe i don't think i mentioned Goethe in that lecture but Goethe would be another
example the sorrows of young Werther the in which the hero does not live happily ever ever after
with his lady love the german poet Novalis who was acquainted with Goethe and influenced by him
and his blue flower image the idea of an unattainable beauty a kind of a kind of flower that
could not be found and it's the only one that will give that will give a sense of fulfillment
in terms of pursuing the ultimately beautiful William Blake and in his poetry also stigmatizing
reason as deflecting human beings away from a passionate response to life and a faith-based
response to life and this theme continues in the 19th century with romantic poets and Novalis
in the in England and and France and Germany especially and then later in the United States
even somebody like Edgar Allen Poe in and a number of his poems but there are also new
philosophies in the 19th century that challenge the traditional conception of reason Kierkegaard
so in Kierkegaard the Danish philosopher famously rejected the idea that reason was capable of
allowing human beings to find the final fulfillment of the human condition which for him was in God
and so for for Kierkegaard the ethical stage of human existence which is the one which is dominated
by reason is incapable of giving people the background of challenging people to the highest
level of human existence which is to throw their lives into by an act of faith into that stage
in which they find the ultimate relationship that a human being can have which again for
Kierkegaard was a religious relationship with God Nietzsche attacked the traditional conception
of reason also arguing that that human beings needed to live by instinct and saying that reason
was always perspectival that all reasoning occurs within a certain framework of assumptions that
the that the assumptions themselves are not rational and therefore reasoning in a certain sense
is not rational quite ironic that the perspectival we always reason from a certain perspective well
from the point of view of this course what i've been talking about is we always reason
based on certain assumptions we use deductive reasoning always we require certain assumptions
and and in a way that is analogous to you will Nietzsche was saying that the assumptions that
we use are historically and culturally conditioned this is going to come back in the mid 20th century
as a major theme of of of western intellectual argument and debate and is a central theme
in the science wars of the 1960s 70s 80s and 90s a perspectival conception of really of reason
means that reason does not have the timeless neutral character that Plato attributed to it
so Nietzsche's perspectivalism is another way of saying that the mind plays a self active role
in this case that the mind chooses in response to social historical and cultural factors
that reasoners always reason in ways that require inputs that are not themselves rationally arrived
at and so he spoke of of the tyranny of reason that characterizes Plato's philosophy and another
figure of importance in this regard is charles sanders purse the american founder of the philosophy
called pragmatism that also gave the mind an active role in determining what it believed and had a
very distinct definition of belief that we'll treat briefly when we get to when we when we
talk about Dewey and American pragmatism and the theory of science associated with that
another strand of the challenge to reason in 19th century thought is the whole concept of the
unconscious which eventuates in the theories of Freud and Young in the early 20th century
that our consciousness is not under our control and so neither are the assumptions on the basis
of which we reason so you can use deduction induction of course but the premises the principles
that you assume are not under your conscious control and this is also reflected perhaps in a
more experimental sense in those 19th century psychologists especially the German Wilhelm
von and the American William James who called attention to the fact that even our perceptual
experience and certainly our consciousness of our perceptual experience has a selective
character we don't pay attention to everything in our environment we don't process we do not
consciously process all of the visual inputs the sensory inputs the olfactory inputs we pay
attention selectively and the structure of consciousness is such that it it is keyed to
selective attention this became one of the fundamental ideas in you will sense one of the
fundamental ideas of gestalt psychology gestalt a german term for form a school of psychology
very prominent in the first third of the 20th century fell out of favor because it conflicted
with behaviorism but now has returned in the form of cognitive psychology in an amended form
the gestalt psychologists argued that we what we saw and heard that perceptual experience is a
reflection of factors that are originary in the mind they are influenced by your previous
experience for example and what your expectations are so seeing is not neutral hearing is not
neutral reasoning is not neutral because it involves factors that are either not under our
conscious control or that or that we have tacitly accepted on the basis of what bacon would have
called idols of the marketplace so we have here at the at the end of the 19th century
we have a notion of scientific theories and scientific knowledge that is seriously considered
that seriously considers that scientific knowledge is not objective in the traditional sense that
is not it's that its object is not reality as philosophically conceived and that the assumptions
that we need in order to construct scientific knowledge are not themselves under rational
control how this plays out in late 19th century science will be the subject of the next lecture
