Lecture 45, Personality Traits and the Problem of Assessment
In this lecture I'm going to take on the vast and vexing subject of personality and the relationship
between psychology's study of personality and the understanding that we come to have of actual
identifiable persons. As noted in earlier lectures, the study of personality has a very long
history and attempted shortcuts to an understanding of personality have not been rare. Going back as
far as theophrastus we find texts in which facial expressions, postures and the like are used as
guides, again as shortcuts to understanding what really makes the person tick and how to identify at
a distance persons of a certain kind, persons who can be counted on to have certain traits, some
positive, some negative. Of course, phrenology much later on, Gaul's phrenology promised the same
kind of shortcut. If you carefully palpate the bumps of the head and you know what you're looking
for, you will understand what the underlying moral and intellectual qualities of the individual are.
You needn't really look much further. Lombroso famously identified criminal types because they have a
certain kind of face and facial expression. Darwin, you will recall, had his nose being looked at for
sustained periods of time by Captain Fitzroy, who was attempting to determine whether, given Darwin's
face, he was likely to make a good naturalist. And of course, during the long dreary history of the
witch hunts, any number of tests were put together that had as their objective and claimed success in
this regard, picking out witches from non-witches on the basis of certain characteristics that could
be disclosed if you use the right sort of test, the pricking test, the flotation test, the tear
test and the like. So, I say shortcuts to understanding what makes the individual person tick
are common in the history of ideas, though we don't find psychologists today in the field of
personality feeling people's heads or looking at their faces. They might be looking at their faces
because facial expressions do disclose certain emotions. But I say most of the workers in the
field of personality research and personality theory today adopt measures and employ tests that
seem to be far more sophisticated and much less laden with superstitious or nonsensical elements
than those found in the past. But of course, every age celebrates its own modernity and only the
fates know how the next century or 500 years from now what we're doing today will be viewed. It might
be viewed as just a phrenology by another name. And if we're not looking at noses any longer, we
might be looking at things that are no more revelatory regarding the actual nature of human
nature than somebody's noses. Well, what sorts of tests do we have to determine the underlying
personality structure? And that's a term of choice in the contemporary literature. The underlying
personality structure of an individual. What tests do we have that might distinguish between
normal and abnormal personalities between successful versus pathological personalities? How do we
determine whether a given personality warrants treatment or indeed institutionalization or some
medical or pharmacologic regimen? Can we rely merely on behavior or are there more hidden
sources of behavior that can that will be disclosed if we have the right testing instruments,
the right methods of assessment? And surely one of the growth industries in psychology for many,
many years has been personality assessment. I shouldn't want to bore you with a list of the
number of tests that are available and scales that are available. Newspapers feature these things.
They are psychologists who make a very, very good living and they have every right to it by
publishing scales for hardiness and preferences and find out what career is right for you and
like I'm reminded of a candid camera program that must go back 30 or 40 years in which I believe
it was Princeton students were talked into believing that they had gone through an elaborate
psychological testing procedure that would locate just the right vocations and professions for them.
And this was back in the 50s or early 60s and they all had crew cuts and came in with ties and
jackets on and they had taken these tests and they were now to meet the specialist who was
himself properly attired looking across the table and saying in very serious tones that on the basis
of the results he was prepared to advise the students as to what career they should pursue.
And with utter and even embarrassing credulity the students would sit there and discover that on
the basis of the test results what they really should be doing was going into farming. Now I recall
one student reporting that he was from Manhattan and to the best of his knowledge he had never
seen a farm but nonetheless and what was so interesting about the program is that these Ivy
League undergraduates were fully prepared to accept the validity of this kind of appraisal. So
there is to some extent the self-fulfilling prophecy when people are told that on the basis of
personality test interviews and the like they have been found to be such and such a kind of person.
We do seem to be rather tame when it comes to playing roles that others identify for us and when
those roles are identified by nothing less than quote the scientific method. Well I think our
tameness sometimes borders on other might I even say pathological passivity. Well that's the
downside the skeptical side which always should be brought to bear on claims that we've got a
magic bullet or a secret way of finding out what really makes you tick and the like. But the tests
are bound some of them have been in use for a considerable period of time. Some of them do
display high reliability and validity. Let me rehearse those terms one more time. By reliability
we mean that the test yields comparable results on repeated administrations over a period of time.
So if indeed personality is a relatively stable set of dispositions attitudes emotions and
perspectives that an individual carries with himself or herself over long long stretches of
time then a test that is presented as a test of personality should yield essentially the same
results when administered over long periods of time. Now validity is a rather different matter
when we talked about the validity of intelligence tests we had fairly specifiable real life
situations that those tests should should should predict performance in school grades class rank
teacher recommendations SAT scores grade point average in college earning advanced degrees
publications after receiving advanced degrees in the life. So you could do these correlations to
see whether IQ tests predict achievements of that kind throwing away the tests that don't and
there upon declaring the tests that do to be valid measures of intelligence because this is what
you would expect persons of high intelligence to be able to do. Well what is it you expect persons
of a given personality to be able to do that is what would the real life situation be that that
would tell you the test results were valid tests. Well presumably a person whose personality
characteristics fall in the normal range should be making the normal kinds of adjustments to the
regular situations one faces in life and also if the tests are valid you should be able to predict
how persons with a given personality structure are likely to respond to situations of an emotional
nature situations that create doubt or that otherwise might lead to indecision situations
that themselves are not highly structured situations that are rather charged in the interpersonal
sense or that might lead to disappointment and the like. You certainly would expect to be able to
predict how a given individual will respond emotionally to a situation that some people would
find mildly disappointing indeed but most people might find mildly disappointing. Do you get nothing
less than an outpouring of melancholia and depression a person who really can't recover from
this who exaggerates the importance of it everything is a tragedy. Do you have the sort of person
utterly unflappable but maybe utterly unflappable in a less than benign sense someone who just
doesn't care enough about anything someone incapable of investing his or her own emotions in a
situation and the like. So it will always be arguable whether indeed the reference behavior
validly establishes the validity of a test and ultimately of course the context of validation
is the clinic itself. If you have a test of personality that numbers among its claims the
ability to distinguish the normal from the pathological personality then surely people
whose conduct and overall approach to life have resulted in institutionalization should not score
normally on the test in question. So that's the typical way of determining the validity of
personality tests and and inventories. Now these tests come under two general headings. There are
so-called objective tests of personality and so-called projective tests of personality and I
don't want anyone misled by the use of the term objective in this context. It certainly can't mean
it mustn't mean that the tests are objective tests of personality in the sense that a ruler is an
objective measure of length measure of what is meant instead is that there are some personality
tests or inventories that can be objectively scored which is to say you do not rely on the
interpretation of someone judging the test result. You can machine score them because the tests
themselves consist of a number of questions or items that can be answered yes or no or can be
categorized on a scale of fits me best fits me least that sort of thing. This most accurately
describes my general attitude my general emotion my general behavior or least adequately does and
then you can end up with a numerical score. So objective here refers to objective methods of
scoring the questions themselves of course by the very nature of a personality inventory
are are going to be subject to rich and various interpretations by the people taking the test
and by the people making up the test. I should think the most frequently used quote objective
close quote test of personality would be the M M P I the mini the Minnesota multi phasic
personality inventory which runs on the order of 700 items and which has subscales for tendencies
toward hypochondriasis. Do you regard yourself generally as a well person or generally as a
sickly person do you frequently have headaches. Do you have reliable difficulties getting to sleep
and so forth. Now you might you might be saying to yourself well these things are all true of me
and indeed I've got a terrible infectious disease and that's why I've got fit full sleep and indigestion
and headaches all the time. But but what has to be done with tests of this kind where scores of
this kind are being generated as the person then of course has to be examined medically as well
to determine whether or not these judgments are based on actual measurable physiological
disturbances or rather our assessments of the person's attitudes about himself one who regards
oneself as sickly when one isn't do you see that sort of thing or when they really aren't clear
medical physiological signs that would go along with disturbances of this sort.
Now the projective tests which are which which yield scores by the way but but but require
interpretation I think a generally of much greater interest to people than something like the M M P I
although it is worth noting that we're absolute pushovers when it comes to these tests everybody
wants to sit down and take them and find out what it means and what reference group you match up with
best and what am I really like. I I think it's one of the signs of modernity that that we we look to
experts to tell us what we are really like when in earlier ages anybody presuming to say that would
probably be judged as impertinent if not if not bizarre. Well the projective tests the projective
tests are based on the following thesis or proposition the following theory as it were.
There is a tendency we recall this from Gestalt psychology there is a tendency for
recipients to impose organization and order on the external world where that kind of ordering
is possible at all. It seems to be a characteristic of perceptual systems and
recipients to create order and harmony and pattern to establish some kind of form some
Gestalt where the visual or indeed auditory the broad sensory environment admits of that.
Now what do we do in situations that are highly ambiguous that might lend themselves to any number
of reactions. Well again the tendency is to impose order and organization. Now if you take that as
a starting premise then you might ask this question. Suppose the external world's ambiguities are of
such a nature and the task facing the person given the test is one in which they have to impose not
a visual order but a kind of thematic or narrative order. What might you expect. Well one of the
things you might expect is that the person given a task like this will begin to order the ambiguous
world according to certain core emotions sentiments worries concerns ambiguities anxieties and the
like that is the individual will take troubles within himself and project them on to an ambiguous
situation. So the projective test is a test that allows the test taker to project on to a situation
that might be interpreted in a variety of ways to project on to that situation a given interpretation
and an interpretation which if it shows up over a range of tests like this now might be regarded
as disclosing a more or less stable a more or less fixed and defined personality structure.
One of the early projective tests and one that you can always spring at a party and attract
a crowd people enjoy this was developed by Herman Rorschach and it's referred to as the Rorschach
test or the ink block test and anyone who still uses fountain pens and has access to a bottle of
ink can just take a plain piece of paper and throw a few dabs of ink sort of randomly on the paper
fold the paper in half put the paper on a flat surface rub it in various different ways and
open it up and you will have something like a Rorschach ink block card and what are you likely
to see ah there's the question what are you likely to see of course the more popular one the one
that shows up in most of the textbooks is the one here I shall be disclosing the deepest aspects
of my own personality ah the one that that looks like the butterfly do you see or the butterfly
or the moth with open wings now now um it doesn't just look to me like a butterfly with open wings
when in fact you give this to a large representative sample the modal response the most frequently
occurring response as well it looks like a butterfly or a moth now there are a number of um of ink
block cards and what your Rorschach cards and and these are scorable one of the things you look for
is whether the person in addition to to sort of perceiving the large picture also is attentive to
more subtle aspects of the card in some instances you can't get the person out of the upper right
hand quadrant I mean this is somebody who I mean even even if he sees a moth when he now starts
discoursing on on on this item on the card there he is in the upper right hand corner and
it seems to me that that maybe that wing has begun to fray or unravel in fact I think there are sort
of dusty particles coming off that wing this might have been a moth that was burned but but it just
seems to be the right hand wing and of course the test uh administer is sitting there and and uh
not saying anything patience on a monument but of course is just pulling for this chap sooner or
later to get back to to the whole page so to speak now the person who's in that upper right hand
quadrant on the next card is going to be in the lower left hand corner this is somebody who's
who's slavish attention to detail so matches up with what we would call the compulsive or
obsessional personality or to use psychoanalytic terminology and you are free to smile or to
frown or to have a furrow furrowed brow the anal retentive personality are obviously arising
from traumatic episodes during the anal stage of psychosexual development uh the camera will notice
that i am speaking respectfully and there is no smile on my face when i say these things but i
say depending on the theory of personality to which you subscribe someone behaving that way
will fit one of one or another of a number of categories within a given personality theory
now another very frequently used test is called the t a t test it was developed by Henry Murray
for many years a prominent personality psychologist at Harvard t a t referring to
thematic a perception test the thematic a perception test the t a t test consists of a
number of graphic cards these are actual scenes but they're ambiguous scenes it's not quite clear
what's going on in the scene indeed nothing definite need be going on in the scene but the
person taking the test has this task a card is presented i'll give you a typical t a t card
there's a young woman on a chair sort of looking oh straight ahead or just a little bit to the to
the left or the right and bending over and perhaps saying something to her as a much older woman
and that's what the card looks like there's another t a t card where you see the silhouette of someone
in in a window and and and and it's done in such a way that you you really would be hard pressed
to tell whether this is someone sitting in a window or exiting through a window or entering
through a window ambiguous the card is ambiguous now when you sit to take a test like this you're
told first off that it's a test of imagination which in a way it is i mean i i don't know that
that would be scrupulously truthful you're obviously using this test for clinical and diagnostic
purposes but to some extent it surely is a test of imagination and your task if you were taking
the test you would be told this we i'd like you to look at these cards and from the material that
you see in the card i would like you to make up a story i'd like you to tell me what's going on now
what led up to what's going on now and what you think the outcome will be and will be all right
well let's say you've got the first let's say you've got the card where there's a young woman
sort of looking over there and there's an older woman bending down apparently saying something to her
and um they you've got a fellow sitting there looking at this and he he looks at the card and
he says um you want a story about this well um this is a brothel actually and the older woman
is the madam who who who runs this brothel and um she's identifying for this young woman the the
chap here who who is very very well well off and um and how she might make a really good
killing tonight if she if she plays her cards right uh what led up to this was that um well
actually um this girl comes from a long line of madams her mother was a madam her grandmother
was a madam and the like and so this is really a family form of work and in time when she gets
much older she's uh she's going to have a brothel of her own now look if someone were to tell a
story like that you might say well it's a tasteless story it's a bit i mean it's i i'm not quite sure
how much imagination went into this but you know let a thousand flowers bloom that's one story there
many many many other stories all right now same same chaps taking the test and you've got the card
with a silhouetted figure in a window now now what's what's going on here oh well this this
fellow is escaping from a brothel not well now at this point you begin to see that there is a theme
that seems to run across everything he says and sees in every context give him raw shark cards and
do you know the same sort of thing is coming out now with the t at cards as he goes across the
dozen cards there's a kind of thematic integrity that is preserved from card to card and in this
intentionally ludicrous example the theme that is preserved is one of of of wantonness
antisocial behavior sexual themes promiscuity and the like now at this point you don't get out of
net or start writing prescriptions or call in the constabulary but at this point when you
match this up with where that person is in life the employment history family relations and so
forth the test becomes one more way of seeing a little more clearly into what it might be at the
otherwise unobserved level that is impelling his behavior and shaping his perceptions in a variety
of situations maybe in all situations i mentioned another one of these projective tests the the
draw a person test which has been used very effectively with children particularly children
that show adjustment problems of one sort or another what do you say about the child who
when asked to draw a person draws a person but it's a person without ears or a person without a
mouth or a person whose body is intact but has no feet or no legs or no hands you see what you
might discover in some of these drawings is the child's sense of never being listened to or the
child's sense of not being able to speak out or the child's sense of not being able to get away
or the child's sense of not being able to hold on to anything tangible now again you you don't run
off half cocked with results of this kind this would have to be integrated with other material
that you have based on interviews with the child with the family with school officials and the like
but just in that draw a person test the child may actually reveal things i mentioned one more
there's a there's a house tree person test you you ask someone give me a drawing that includes a
house a tree and a person well realize you can put the person in the house you can put the person
walking away from the house walking toward the house the house might be totally occluded by the
tree the there may be a tree house with a person in it now again what what shows up thematically
what shows up thematically with the given individual is a sense of inclusion a sense of
exclusion a sense of isolation a sense of a community sense a sense of being heard or not
heard wanted or not wanted shunned or received that kind of thing and so across these tests
objective and projective plus interviews plus the facts of life the good family history and the
like what comes out of this is a set of a set of characteristics patterns something thematically
coherent that begins to take the shape of what many theorists and clinicians would call that
person's underlying personality structure sure now on what statistics are these studies based
well the the prevailing model in personality research is what sometimes called the individual
differences model that is to say what one does with the scores or the profiles what one does
with the results of these tests interviews and the like is match the individual up against some
group standard some some norm that is we understand jerry we understand jane we understand bill we
understand tom vis-a-vis their differences from some reference group which might be called the
the normal personality now this raises a very interesting question the question of course
is whether you find out anything about a person by inquiring into the difference between that
person and some other person that is do you find anything about a personality by examining
personality differences suppose i told you that jack and jill differed from each other by four
inches would you know anything about jack's height or jill's height the answer is no one might be one
inch in the other five inches one might be nine feet tall and the other might be nine feet five
inches tall now i don't want to to dismiss the individual differences approach but i do want
those in attendance to understand the profoundly significant difference between knowing how two
entities differ from each other and knowing something fundamental about each of those entities
there's a difference between knowing about a person and knowing about differences between
two people and of course this returns us to a distinction alluded to in an earlier lecture
and that is the distinction between a nomothetic approach to psychology and an idiographic approach
the nomothetic approach is an approach that seeks general laws statistically reliable generalizations
the idiographic approach understands the uniqueness of the given situation the uniqueness of the
battle of waterloo it understands that the battle of waterloo can't be related to some average
battle where you understand waterloo by seeing how it differs from the battle of australites
or the d-day invasion to understand the battle of waterloo is to understand the particular
non-replaceable entities that made it the battle it was to understand their motives their aspirations
to understand the battle plan the situation in europe at the time etc now the idiographic
approach acknowledges the the the idiosyncratic nature the uniqueness of events that really
qualify as psychological or social or historic or economic or moral and that you can't understand
any one of those events by relying on some nomothetic model that has as its objective
the identification of general laws or or or statistical laws so the question obtains whether
personality research involving group norms and tests administered to large samples and the like
really is the right way to go about understanding the person that's not an issue that i can settle
now on the matter of norms however we understand that uh there are categories of beings sometimes
we call them saints or heroes there are categories of beings who invariably find doing things that
the normal person doesn't do and indeed if they were given personality inventories and objective
and projective tests and the like there's a fairly good chance that their responses would be off scale
off chart we know their conduct in consequential settings is off scale and off chart it's not
clear that a theory of the normal personality knows quite what to do with saints and heroes
in much the sense that our theories of intelligence don't really quite know what to do with geniuses
and so the question that arises is whether the information we'd want most which is the
information that tells us something about exceptionality unique ways of solving problems
seeing the world and making it a better place whether whether that kind of question is ever
adequately addressed by procedures and measurements that simply rediscover that what is average is
average
