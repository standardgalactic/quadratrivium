Lecture 28 The Emotional Brain, The Limbic System
Toward the close of the 18th century in his essays on morals and legislation, Jeremy Bentham
made the famous claim, which I referred to in a previous lecture, that nature has placed
us under the governance of twin masters, pleasure and pain. And with that Jeremy Bentham proceeded
to develop a hedonistic and then later a utilitarian theory of morals, according to
which the business of life is the elimination of pain and suffering and the promotion of
happiness. It has long been regarded by our species that the emotional side of life certainly
is as important and is as central to our well-being and flourishing as the intellectual and cognitive
sides of life. We are after all not merely computational devices spitting out solutions
to arithmetic problems. We are creatures that feel and fear and love and get angry and get
happy and tell jokes and the like. And so if there is to be a developed neuropsychology,
a developed biological psychology, it must be a psychology that is able to explain and
account for the variety and intensity of emotions felt by all normal persons and indeed felt
by those with pathological conditions in which the emotional side of life takes on quite
unnatural and atypical patterns and characteristics. Within a Darwinian context, we would expect
certain primitive emotions to be present very, very early or far down or whatever metaphor
you like here in the phylogenetic series because after all, what every creature does
face is a challenge to survival itself. And the challenge to survival generally takes
the form of environmental events that are tissue damaging. I mean, after all, what is
it that challenges survival? It's the bared teeth of a predator. It's a falling object.
It's the lightning storm. It's the fierce wind. It's the welling waves that threaten
to drown us all. Now, a creature utterly incapable of pain, utterly incapable of anything matching
up with fear or anxiety or a very, very strong tendency to avoid something would be imperiled.
And so although we have every reason to avoid excessive anthropomorphic explanations, it
would seem to be nothing less than common sense to assume that among the species we
regard as advanced species, there really must be a fairly developed emotional side of psychological
life, at least enough by way of emotion in order for the animal to fear, to feel that
degree of fear or anxiety or unrest, that degree of discomfort that will get a tail
off a hot stove, much as we get our hand off a hot stove. Now, you can achieve some of these
things through the mere mediation of reflexes. There doesn't have to be an emotional overlay
to go along with it. But once you've burned your hand on a hot stove, you now have to
have some sort of trepidation when you see that flame coming up. And that trepidation,
then, is precisely the emotional state that spares you the need to redo the experiment
and risk burning the hand again. So although you can account for the initial avoidance
of a destructive stimulus in the language of reflexes, the learned avoidance of a destructive
stimulus presupposes some degree of unrest or anxiety or fear triggered by the environment
that once carried those punishing consequences. So we do have reason to look for aspects of
emotionality throughout much of the animal kingdom. Now, I wonder if I should pause at
this point, having referred to whatever metaphor you like, the phylogenetic series further
down, more advanced, and so forth. Some of this language, of course, is simply the language
of vanity. I think we have to understand that within an evolutionary context, we are
not more developed as human beings than, say, rats are as rats or cockroaches are. That
is to say, evolutionary theory is not to be understood as the cockroach, if he really
plays his cards right, over the long haul, subsequently becoming an Oxford dog. That
is, the cockroach is not some early stage on the way to becoming one of us. The cockroach
is a fully evolved representative of a certain species. And so it can be quite misleading
to refer to, quote, more developed, close quote, species than in comparison to, quote,
less developed. As far as referring to something being further down in the evolutionary series,
it's quite correct to remind ourselves from time to time that this up and down business
can be extremely misleading. The best way to view it is that nature uses what seems to
be a fairly economical set of rules to generate great, great variety, and that we can talk
about human beings being more or less developed as human beings, but we don't want to talk
about apes being less developed human beings. We don't want to talk about rhesus monkeys
having on average an IQ of such and such. It's applying a thermometer for the purpose
of weighing oranges. Good instrument, not right for the task. So if I do lapse into the language
of more developed or further down or further up, count it as a kind of perseverative habit
that might be token some frontal damage on my own part, but on closer examination I will
retreat from those locutions and I will plead some form of insanity defense if you play
a tape showing that I keep saying things like that. We do know, however, that the regions
of the brain quite fully developed in non-human species and quite fully developed at the level
of reptilia are regions of the brain which, in the human case, do mediate the emotional
life of human beings. That is to say old cortex, paleocortex, and subcortical mechanisms
that in human beings constitute what we call the limbic system appear, here I go, quite
early in the phylogenetic series or at least appear at the level of reptilia. Once you
start getting any kind of developed nervous system at all, you begin to see these structures
appearing with some prominence. And these structures are very, very prominent where
there is very little evidence, there is very little cerebral cortex at all. And this matches
up with the broad evolutionary account that I would be inclined to stand behind, namely
long before the development of those elaborated cortical hemispheres we associate with complex
rational processes. We do see the elaboration of brain mechanisms associated with emotionality,
particularly associated with aggressive behavior, behavior prompted by fear, behavior prompted
by behavior proceeding from rage, from self-defensive maneuvers, from behavior associated with sexual
intercourse procreative acts, behavior associated with care of the young nest building, protection
of litters and the like. So at that foundational level at which the survival of the individual
organism and the survival of the species is daily at risk, we see the elaboration of subcortical
mechanisms which in the human case are very closely associated with emotionality, procreative
sexuality and the like. So the old brain is there, the new brain, the neocortex is added
on to it and we get this of what was long thought to be the hierarchic nature of the
human nervous system with the great controlling, rationally serving cerebral cortex, telling
these nasty, naughty subcortical structures what to do so that the civilized human being
and the civilized human being is always understood as somebody eligible for membership in a London
men's club. You've got this highly developed cerebral cortex keeping that nasty Freudian
thing under control. That's what distinguishes us from the balance of the animal economy
and the way we go. Well of course as usual the true story doesn't match up very well
with the fairy tale. There is tremendous incessant cross talk between cortical and subcortical
structures. Subcortical structures have important influences on cortical dynamics. The subcortical
areas project fiber pathways to the cerebral cortex and can modulate its activity. The
cerebral cortex has descending pathways that control subcortical mechanisms. The right
model is a continuous feedback model. The wrong model is a hierarchic model. So those
given to bureaucratic theories of brain function are inevitably embarrassed by the actual facts.
I should say within an evolutionary context that some animals develop the need for bureaucratic
solutions to problems and this may be an object lesson for us all. One animal that comes to
mind, it's an animal that has to come to mind because he's never going to come to the front
door again, is deploticus rex. Now I shouldn't tell you much about deploticus rex. Let me
just say that deploticus rex got awfully large and in fact the distance between the head
and the tip of the tail of deploticus rex got so great that it was almost impossible
for any signal originating up in the head end to get the tail to do the sort of thing
a tail has to do if deploticus is going to save a tail. Well what did deploticus do to
correct this problem? Actually the correction had to come first and then you got deploticus.
Well deploticus I think invoked what is now the contemporary solution to such problems
which I would be inclined to call the bureaucratic solution. Deploticus developed an accessory
nervous system halfway down his back so you now had sort of the chief executive officer
and then you had this cadre of associate vice presidents or something. Characteristic
of bureaucracy however these two nervous systems didn't quite ever get integrated so the problem
of course is the head would tell the tail to do one thing and the accessory nervous system
might tell the tail to do something else and you had this conflicted tail and a conflicted
deploticus and to make a long story short deploticus is no longer with us. I do take
this to be an object lesson and I think that we should limit our development of accessory
nervous systems and other manifestations of bureaucratic zeal but that's a subject for
another time. This lecture will evolve into something in management training if I'm not
careful but I do think that extinct species tell us much about what we shouldn't be doing.
Now as far as the emotional brain is concerned let me pick up the story. Oh circa 1930s University
of Chicago research done by two pioneering figures in the brain sciences Clover and Heinrich
Clover and Paul Busey. The experimental animal is the rhesus monkey and the procedure involves
the removal the surgical removal the ablation of the temporal lobes on both sides so this
is going to be a bitemporal ablation in the rhesus monkey. Now the purposes that Clover
and Busey had for this research were quite different from what it was they actually found
and what this led to but I should say that rhesus monkeys particularly those caged by
research scientists tend to get very very cranky and very very aggressive. They've been
known to feed themselves on more than one finger in a laboratory community. They can
be extremely difficult to handle and indeed you might actually have to have professionally
trained handlers depending on the kind of research going on. I've never been forced
to live the life of a laboratory rhesus monkey I don't know what my emotional state would
be but I can tell you they can be extremely cantankerous. Once however the temporal lobes
on both sides were removed what Clover and Busey discovered is that the animals became
surprisingly tractable even placid. They showed a whole constellation of changes from the
preoperative condition but one of the surprising changes was this docility which is so atypical
of the species and particularly the species under the kinds of stress these laboratory
animals live under. Another characteristic they displayed was this if you put a circular
wheel in front of them with little food cups and you put different objects in the food
cups and bring these around a cup at a time some of the contents being food but also screws
or pieces of wood or pieces of rolled up paper and the like no matter how many times
you bring this around the animal reaches into the food cup takes the object puts the object
in his mouth and then only after chewing it a bit or masticating to some extent then determines
either to spit it out or if it's food to consume it but over and over again the animal retries
these same objects a condition which I won't go any further in defining but that Clover
and Busey referred to as hypermetamorphosis. It is as if the animal has to keep resampling
the actual shape and texture and contours of something over and over again in order
to satisfy the system that this is edible or non-edible. So you get this docility you
get this hypermetamorphosis and you also get an increase in sexuality there's much more
by way of sexual behavior copulatory behavior and the like you put this all together and
you get what is called the Clover Busey syndrome. Well what was interesting about the Clover
Busey syndrome is that there wasn't any reason given the clinical literature and other research
on non-human animals to suspect that the temporal cortex had much to do with this kind of thing
at all. Temporal cortex as traditionally understood contains a primary auditory area and there's
association cortex there but not this. Of course it soon became clear that the temporal
cortex per se was not what was causally involved in producing this syndrome rather in the actual
core of the temporal cortex that is to say if you imagine the cerebral cortex viewed
sideways as something like a boxing glove the thumb would be the temporal cortex and
as you move toward the center of the brain as you move immediately through the temporal
cortex to the core of the temporal cortex you begin to pick up the structures of the
limbic system and the limbic system is this primitive that is phylogenetically older system
that contains structures intimately associated with emotionality and alas memory. Emotionality
and memory. There's something quite gothic about the limbic system and in fact long before
we knew the functions of the limbic system the structures were named in such a way as
to preserve this gothic quality. There is in the limbic system the hippocampus the columns
of the fornix the isle of rile the amygdala the septum I mean you can almost hear the
Freudian psychologists of the world saying I told you so and they even have the right
names for this sort of thing so here we've got this limbic system this old primitive
part of our phylogenetic past and as you tickle it or stimulate it or cut parts of
it out all sorts of things happen at the level of emotionality and the clover buce syndrome
is just one of the things that comes about as a result of a bilateral extirpation of
temporal cortex but in fact if you spare temporal cortex and take out the medial limbic components
of it you get the syndrome so it wasn't temporal cortex per se but the limbic structures within
it. Now of course the question that comes to mind when clover and buce come up with findings
like this is are these generalizable is it because the limbic system constitutes the
instinctual basis of hypersexuality hypermetamorphosis docileity and the like or is there something
unique about laboratory animals in this regard is there something unique about the surgical
procedure what I would want the beginning student to understand in this area is that
the area produces results rather more complex than what you're likely to discover in the
introductory textbook. The introductory textbook does a good job in saying so and so did this
and found that the introductory textbook doesn't do quite as good a job in saying it's not clear
you'd get the same thing with animals brought up in the wild it's not entirely clear you'd get
the same thing if the animals had an entirely different conditioning history pre-operatively.
Many things that we are inclined to regard as instinctual plus or minus nothing do you see
always there from day one actually turn out to be highly responsive to environmental and
conditioning histories there's the classic research ages ago much criticized and indeed
subsequently qualified classic research of quo K U O on on the the predatory behavior of rodents
and cats and the like the question is this do cats instinctually track down rodents kill them
and eat them now people have observed since a time out of memory that cats will track down small
animals and birds and rodents and the like and will kill them and eat them now in quotes classic
study the laboratory arrangement was as follows kittens are born and they are born to mothers
that they then can see catch rodents but not kill them other members of litters are allowed to see
mothers catch rodents and kill them other members of litters you're forming experimental groups now
exposed to to these main experimental treatments do you see other members see the mothers catch
rodents kill them and eat them and what crow reported was this what these offspring do on
attaining adulthood depends less on some instinctual predatory behavior that culminates in eating the
the killed prey and depends much much more on what the adult model is seen doing by these
offspring as they grow up so what the offspring tend to do quote ha ha instinctually close quote
is what they've seen done now I say the story is more complicated even than that but it does
indicate that what very often what we take to be instinctual as in fated can't do anything about
this it's an instinct well look complex organisms are adaptive to be adaptive requires some degree
of plasticity some degree of plasticity means that although there might be very very strong
instinctual dispositions or tendencies the role of the environment and learning and shaping and
the like never should be underestimated and this is it's true when it comes to limbic system effects
of the clube abusive variety as when it comes to whether cats kill mice and eat them or just kill
them or don't do anything to them at all we have instances in which prey and predator are raised
together since infancy and form bonds of attachment that look very very much like friendship
so are there instincts yes and no depends on how you want to define it and how deterministic you
think instinct instinct is in its operation now if Bentham is right that nature has placed us
under the governance of twin masters and if the materialists are right in declaring that whatever
is operating at the psychological level is so because of something going on at the neurological
level then there ought to be regions of the brain which when activated give rise to pleasure
and other regions of the brain which when activated give rise to feelings of pain or suffering
are there pleasure and pain centers in the brain are there reward and punishment centers in the brain
research suggesting as much began with the work of James Olds back in the mid 1950s and
worked by Olds and by by Peter Milner Peter Milner now at um and for many years at at MIT
what Olds and Milner discovered was this suppose you take the standard conditioning setup as
Scinarian behaviorism has it but now the rat when pressing a bar instead of receiving a pellet of
food can actually deliver a mild electrical current to one or another region of the brain
what Olds discovered and what Olds and Milner discovered is that there are some regions of
the brain which when they can be stimulated by bar pressing behavior will give rise to virtually
insatiable bar pressing behavior the animal presses and presses and presses and presses
without pause or remission and in fact the food deprived animal given access to one
manipulantum which when pressed will deliver food and another manipulantum which when pressed
will deliver a shock to the brain chooses the latter will come very close to starving to death
but will continue to deliver a stimulus to that portion of the brain we now know which could
not have been known to Olds at the time but we know that the brain has certain opiate receptor
sites that brain chemicals include substances called neurokinns that their presence is reliably
associated with feelings of pleasure or fulfillment and and and that in fact in the in the brain
chemistry itself there are means by which one can the system can mediate experiences we do
associate with pleasure and pain with reward and punishment Olds and Milner proceeded to map
out the brain in terms of the frequency and the size of regions associated with reward and
punishment it's of some I would say it's a cause for optimism to say that there seems to be more
centers associated with pleasure than with pain that I hope matches up with the actual experiences
of all who come within the range of this lecture now whether or not we want to treat these centers
as causally involved for example in learning that comes about by reinforcement is is an open
question all of these experiments and findings really do lend themselves to a variety of interpretations
let me mention one complexity that that that gives us less less than complete satisfaction when we
when we try to account for reinforcement in terms of stimulating brain regions do you say
suppose you give animals access to a bar which which when depressed delivers a shock to the brain
or to another part of the brain or to another part of the brain now the traditional measure of
learning in an operant conditioning context is operant rate the the the the measure of preference
is the bar the animal presses most frequently well if you do some of these studies where the
quote reinforcer close quote is a stimulus delivered directly to the brain you discover
something interesting in a number of cases the area the animal will stimulate most frequently
is not the area the animal chooses to stimulate when given an opportunity to stimulate a variety of
areas that is the animal may prefer a bar that delivers a stimulus to an area that the animal
doesn't stimulate that frequently over a bar that the animal has pressed often repeatedly over
and over again to deliver repeated simulations to a given region the short script on this the
brief way of putting it is this rate of responding does not predict choice in these cases that is
the animal will not invariably choose to stimulate a region which the animal had stimulated most
frequently now the reason i mentioned this and i hope it doesn't clutter one's thinking about it
the reason i mentioned this is is that in the usual operant conditioning context where bar
pressing produces food and or avoidance of shock and the like ah the bar the animal presses most
frequently as the bar the animal comes to choose when given a range of options so there isn't a
perfect correspondence here there's quite imperfect correspondence between studies involving direct
stimulation of the brain as a reinforcer and studies involving reinforcement in the ordinary
in the ordinary context text now other regions of the brain notably the hypothalamus other regions
of sub cortex notably the hypothalamus are now thoroughly implicated in eating and drinking and
indeed in the satiation that comes about as a result of eating and drinking there are nuclei
within the hypothalamus which when stimulated electrically will cause the animal to undertake
eating and indeed the animal will keep eating as long as the stimulus is is applied to the
hypothalamus there are other hypothalamic nuclei which when destroyed render the animal
aphagic that's ph a g i see doesn't eat at all and in fact would starve to death if not weaned
and carefully handled and bottle fed and the like they can be brought back up to speed but the
post-operative condition is the aphagic condition so you get this you you can turn on the eating
and drinking behavior and turn off eating and drinking behavior with quite selective stimulation
or lesion studies in a very very specific region of the brain namely the hypothalamus
and as we take eating and drinking to be standard forms of reinforcement we would again say that
here at the subcortical level bentham's twin masters pleasure and pain now in the form of
consumatory behavior can can can be observed similarly with sexuality and with copulating
behavior with with procreative sexual activities regions of the limbic system can be stimulated
in experimental animals such that they will initiate copulatory behavior not necessarily
with members of the opposite sex perhaps even with a neutral object that is they will undertake
some kind of of copulatory behavior with almost anything that is available for the purpose or
even approximating the purpose now one might ask how this matches up with the human experience
well i should tell you although the ethical issues here are grand and large that indeed
some human patients have been subjected to experiments with their consent in which electrodes
are put in regions of the limbic system these are very small electrodes not much is destroyed
putting them in there little dental drill is used to create a hole and the shaft is sunk and now
regions of the limbic system want to be stimulated there were cases done at Tulane University many
years ago where the so-called inveterate homosexual the night of the open road underwent limbic
stimulation having been sent to the hospital by a court of course the this wouldn't even probably
wouldn't even be an offense today but under limbic stimulation and while watching heterosexual
pornographic movies a certain sexual pleasure is created by the stimulation of the limbic system
the subject watches the movies the subject subsequently wishes to try out the so-called
beneficial effects the staff procures someone who's willing to participate in the study someone we
in my childhood would have referred to as a woman of the night and the physician reports the results
of this study and says that in the circumstance the pet the patient behaved quote admirably close
quote scarcely an advert i would have chosen to account for any part of this but the short answer
to the question are studies of limbic system function and emotionality in animals enjoying any
degree of comparable data in the limited number of cases involving human patience the answer is
there is some degree of comparability as usual the story is much more complex than the textbooks
would indicate that's even with the ethical implications set aside thank you
