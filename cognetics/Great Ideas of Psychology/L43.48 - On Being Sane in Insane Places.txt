Lecture 43 On Being Same In Insane Places
Psychopathology, which these days is understood increasingly in genetic terms and biochemical
terms, offers yet another example of the powerful influence of context, not only on behavior
and judgment, but on judgment within settings that are quite professional settings. And there's
such great importance that attaches to this that it warrants separate attention within
a lecture, context and psychopathology. And the subtitle that I give for today's lecture
is taken from a very famous paper on this subject published many years ago by Stanford
University's David Rosenhan, Professor David Rosenhan, an article that he titled On Being
Same In Insane Places. And I'm going to talk about the research that Rosenhan did later
in this lecture.
Mental illness. Very interesting, isn't it? Recall Thomas Zaz's position that mental
illness as a term refers to a kind of myth, the myth of mental illness. The only forms
of illness that Zaz recognizes, the kinds of diseases he's prepared to recognize, are diseases
that invade tissues and organs. And there isn't some organ called mind which can be diseased
and suffer an illness. So what then do we mean by a mental illness? How do we define an illness
that we regard in non-physical terms, but mental terms? And we begin to answer that question
by raising another question. And that is, who has control of the labels? Who is it entrusted
with the task of determining that Smith is manic or manic depressive or melancholic or
that Jones is a witch? Because after all, that was yet another form of disturbance which
for 300 years received a therapeutic intervention that was absolutely lethal.
Well, self-reference turns out to be one basis upon which we ascribe terms like mentally
ill or neurotic or psychotic. This goes back to aspects of the attribution era, the fundamental
attribution era, and indeed back to the ultimate attribution era. It goes something like this.
We certainly know we're mentally healthy, don't we? I mean, we're all friends, we're
engaged in common cause, we take in the same movies, we tend to live in the same sort of
communities, we behave ourselves, tie and jacket, that sort of thing. Ah, well, since we know
we're all fine, we're all right, Jack, how about those outliers? How about those oddly
dressed or funny sounding or peculiarly behaving residents down the street? Well, for goodness
sake, they're balmy, they're absolutely out of it. There's something missing in the attic,
there's a screw loose. All these references are references not finally to an illness in
any received medical sense or even psychological sense, rather they are references to differences
between what we take to be the proper mode of conduct, perception and decorum, and what
some other individual or group is doing. Self-reference figures centrally in the definition of mental
illness. In many settings then, Smith is mentally disturbed to the extent that Smith
significantly differs from me. Now there's another source of definition for mental disease
or mental illness, and that is the law. The law defines the range over which our behavior
can function in the world. Those that fall beyond the ambit of what the law permits are
referred to as being outlaws, but then when it comes to the level of explanation we discover,
or we think we discover, that in some forms of outlaw type behavior, the actual cause is
a mental disturbance. But were the law to take no position on the conduct at all, were
there nothing within criminal or civil law to single out a certain bit of behavior as
warranting our concern, then of course the issue of whether this is a criminal act or
the product of mental illness would not arise. And so to some extent, what the official legal
language and perspective of a culture or society or an age takes to be permissible and normal,
helps the citizens in that age to find what is to be regarded as evidence of mental illness
or the criminally insane and the like. I will mention later in this lecture, for example,
homosexuality. Now homosexuality 25, 30 years ago in many jurisdictions was an offense punishable
by law. In yet other contexts it was a treatable form of mental illness. In most jurisdictions
it no longer has the character of a punishable unlawful act, and in the official diagnostic
and statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association it is no longer listed as a treatable
mental illness. Now we want to ask the question, what has happened in the last 30 years that
would cause those changes? Is it some medical or scientific discovery or is it a kind of
perspectival shift that really reflects the shifting standards, values and judgments of
the culture? So I get back to the question, who has control of the labels? And in the domain
of psychopathology, in contrast to the domain of physiological pathologies, the culture at
large seems to have possessory rights and disposatory powers where these labels are involved,
whether someone is going to be regarded as mentally ill or not. Nonetheless, whether
culture has a heavy part to play in all this, there is also the assumption of expertise
when it comes to assigning labels of this kind, and I want to say this in a way that is respectful
of the accomplishments, the long experience, the motivations, the assiduous study that all
figure in achieving standing as a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. These are persons
engaged in what in another age might be called God's work, no question about it, valiantly
trying to help people achieve some accommodation to the pressures of the world, some success
and happiness in life. That should be noted, and I hope it now is duly recorded, as I go
on to say that the assumption of expertise in these areas I think is quite easily and
effectively challenged. We certainly do not have in these areas the kind of expertise that
we would find in any of the developed sciences. We do not have the kind of expertise that
we find in any of the developed areas of medicine. This is one reason why in insanity defense
trials both sides can line up experts to plead entirely different cases, to make entirely
different diagnoses, to challenge each other, hip and thigh, all the experts on both sides
having the PhDs and MDs that you expect, the published papers, the years of clinical
experience, and it would take somebody entirely cynical, far more cynical than I am to say,
well they are simply guns for hire and they will say whatever they are paid to say. These
are people who would be earning substantial incomes without having to follow some party
line. Rather there are just such radically opposed perspectives on the very nature of
mental illness that in an utterly non-cynical way you can go out and have eminently credentialed
persons able and willing to plead either side of the instant case. And thus I think it is
warranted to say that what expertise refers to in the field of mental illness is an expert
knowledge of existing texts and perspectives rather than an expert knowledge of the mind
itself. That continues to be a quite elusive entity, whatever it turns out to be, so that
nonetheless, and we see this in other areas of compliance, obedience, social perception
and the like, the very credentials themselves will leave the unsuspecting to believe that
there is indeed expertise. And in this regard we will find throughout history this, what
one scholar has referred to as village credulity. That is to say when the bishop calls in the
witch-pricker who has long experience finding that place on the surface of the witch's body
where the devil's mark has rendered that surface insensitive and anesthetic and the
crowd, the jury and those in the court stand back and hear this expert testifying that
it was only when he finally reached the most hidden reaches of this now-shaved body that
indeed he did turn up that anesthetic spot and so there is proof positive of some complicity,
some pactum implicitum with dark forces and people now breathe a sigh of relief, thankful
and happy, that they are not going unjustly to have this witch executed but rather the
devil will be ridded from her by the very motive execution itself, hanging, burning
and the like. Now look, I don't want to put psychiatric diagnosis on a par with what
witch-prickers were doing, it's not indeed. Nonetheless, there's something about the modes
of interview, the psychiatric tests, the personality tests, the brain scans, the long
clinical experience that meld and merge with social perceptions and practices and cultural
values so that the outcome is not of the sort Jones has diabetes, the outcome is of a rather
more complex sort and these labels then are not so much the product of a scientific expertise
as the product of a set of agreements within a given professional community which the rest
of us are prepared to accept as a community of experts, so much then on this matter of
who has control of the labels. I'm not suggesting for a moment that some other group should
have control of the labels, what I am suggesting is that the groups now in control of the labels
enjoy a degree of authority and their utterances are accepted at a level of validity that I
don't think can be sustained by the actual facts of the matter. I don't mean this to be
a controversial statement and of course there's always much more to be said on a subject of
this sort but in this domain work is very much in progress.
Well should we invoke a medical model, should we bring back the medical model that was triumphant
throughout the 19th century and into much of the 20th century where without much by way of
evidence the argument was that a bona fide mental disease is just a manifestation of what is finally
a diseased brain and indeed I think there are very strong currents at the end of the 20th century
moving the discourse more and more toward a medical model and further and further away from a
social adjustment model, a cultural adjustment model and the like. If indeed there is a bona fide
mental illness it really is a form of neuropathology, something in the transmitter system, something
in frontal lobe function, something which diagnostic tools as they get better and better will quite
reliably pick up. John Hinckley for example did show this edematous cerebral cortex, the
sulky were somewhat swollen and as his defense attorney Mr. Fuller pointed out on an occasion in
which I was involved in a panel this is reliably correlated with schizophrenia. Now I think the
jury was mightily impressed in the Hinckley case by this swelling that was picked up on brain scans
but of course that swelling could also be produced by a variety of infectious diseases as I said
jocularly at the time to Mr. Fuller by mumps for example. But the point is that society at large
and the psychiatric community at large rest more easily when it can be shown that a particular
form of quote mental illness close quote is closely tied in with some observable change in the
physiological or biochemical aspects of the nervous system. Not only that but the success of
psychoactive agents, the success enjoyed within the domain of psychopharmacology in treating various
forms of psychopathology further illustrates to the satisfaction of many that these disturbances
are biochemical in the first instance. So it could very well be that the ultimate control of the
labels will be back in medicine but medicine now as medicine not medicine as in psychiatry,
clinical psychology, long experience, in-depth interviews, did you have trouble with your father
early in life etc etc etc. And on this point we might want to say that distinctions will be more
sharply drawn between what might be called psychopathology and what might be called problems of
adjustment and when we get to the level of problems of adjustment understand that that's a two way
street to say that Smith is having trouble adjusting to the expectations of the community or society
within which he lives. Maybe saying much more about the community and society in which Smith lives
than about Smith and indeed there may be some adjustments that we are never supposed to make do you
see. More on that later. On being sane and insane places what is it that David Rosenhand did? I
should tell you I think this article in fact if I'm not mistaken Professor Rosenhand said this on
one occasion I think this may be if not the most cited experiment in psychology then after Milgram
and one or two others it surely would be in the top five of cited studies. Well David Rosenhand has
for a long time been a distinguished professor of psychology at Stanford University and many years
ago he talked himself and some of his students and colleagues into a quite quite interesting
experiment that would have them getting admitted to the to a mental hospital and in order to get
admitted they showed up at different times and were in no way no apparent way related to each other
but they had to come in with certain sort of vague presenting symptoms they had to report certain
psychological disturbances they were having perhaps the occasional hallucinatory experience
and nightmarish events and a kind of nervousness a sense of suspiciousness a difficulty getting on
with people a restlessness and the like they came in with this didn't quite know what was getting
at them but they needed some kind of help and got admitted. Now the arrangement was this once
admitted they were to proceed to behave daily exactly as they would behave in life before the
period of admission so nothing they were doing once admitted in any way would alert or alarm a
clinical staff a medical or psychiatric community to the possibility that these were people in need
of any kind of psychiatric treatment at all their behavior became quite normal. Interestingly the
diagnosis on admission was entirely unresponsive to any behavior they displayed after admission there
was no change in the diagnosis do you see. In other words the diagnosis on admission turned out to be
a kind of typology these people now were this type that is a type requiring psychiatric treatment
subsequent behavior was largely ignored or irrelevant. They would have lengthy interviews with
members of the staff in which they responded correctly and entirely normally one person in the
group who happened to be an authority on the subject of depression. Notice that another patient
in the war who actually was a patient in the war being treated for depression was on a medical
regimen a pharmacologic regimen that this expert on the subject of depression regarded as the
wrong drug it was not the drug of choice and in fact undertook to have a quite lengthy discussion
on this subject with one of the attending psychiatrists who of course regarded the interlocutor
as a patient but nonetheless engage the interlocutor in this long discussion and chat pointing out
that he yes he had made a study of depression he didn't think he knew quite a bit about it he
thought that in this particular case the medicine prescribed wasn't right for that patient so here's
this long conversation going on might have been a conversation between colleagues and what's written
down on his chart once the conversation is over what's written down is that he suffers
grandiosity do you see so what he might have said for pay as a consultant or as part of a
convention address that this very psychiatrist might have been pleased and proud to attend
constituted grounds for having his own medication increase do you see because after all when
somebody who's a patient says things like this it can only mean one thing he's quite grandiose
well what is it like being sane in insane places what is it like being sane at all what is it
like being being classified as a type and namely as a type answering to the description
psychopathology of course what Rosen hand study made quite clear is that once one is diagnosed
as being an X one is going to be treated as being an X and it doesn't much matter how one
behaves what one says what the contents are of one's perceptions and cognitions what the
affective tone of daily life is like because the setting now has established that you are an X
and you will be an X forever more there was some great concern about whether these people
were ever going to be able to get themselves released that is to say one was not going to get
released merely on the grounds that one was no longer symptomatic because in fact from the moment
of their admission they cease to be symptomatic indeed had we been dealing with a scientifically
developed mode of expertise a scientifically developed mode of diagnosis treatment and the
like given the crowded nature of such facilities the minute these people went into the second
or third day of normal behavior probably somebody would have a sense that there was a
ruse going on what the question that I always found very interesting and and and not answered
by by by the research is what is it members of the staff were missing here should it not
have been starkly obvious going into this clinic that some number of people in the room were
quite normal just by way of a contrast effect now of course what what what David Rosenhand
would be fully prepared to say and has said is is that well of course the reason why nobody
noticed the stark contrast between the Stanford crowd and those who were there is that in fact
there wasn't a stark contrast between the Stanford crowd and those that were there and as has
been observed repeatedly both before this research and after large fractions of clinical
populations in mental hospitals only reveal themselves to be patients because of how they
are dressed and how they are addressed and how they are treated or not treated this is
not to say there are not bona fide instances of serious disturbances at the level of cognitive
life cognitive and emotional life warranting hospitalization and treatment it is to say
instead that for the longest time the populations thus classified included only a relatively
small a worrisomely small percentage of people who manifestly unequivocally needed institutionalization
and all of the treatments that go with conditions of so severe a nature now the diagnostic and
statistical manual the version of it that that was available when when I was a graduate student
a listed homosexuality among the treatable disorders the among the psychiatric disorders
regarding treatment requiring and warranting treatment and DSM for doesn't have that listed
now let me make it clear to all within the range of my voice that I have neither the training
nor the credentials nor for that matter an opinion about homosexuality these are the psychopathology
psychiatry clinical psychology and the like it is not a subject I've studied it's not one that I'd be
prepared to make a statement on either amateurish or expert I'm getting at a rather different
point the point I'm getting at is how how those who have control of the labels decide whether or not
to keep something labeled psychiatric disturbance warranting treatment well actually the way this
got out of the diagnostic and statistics manual and here I if I if I seem to be sounding skeptical
or cynical I hope I can be forgiven for the moment to some extent the answer to the question
how did it get out of DSM was by vote that is to say the American Psychiatric Association
essentially polled on this question decided that it it it should be removed and and so one
asks on what basis that decision was made well here the reasoning was rather truncated and on
some accounts rather tortuous it goes something like this I I hope I can recover the rationale
here it's not one that matches up well with the way I think about things so I I might get this
a bit contorted stay with me it goes something like this homosexuality is has been notoriously
refractory to psychiatric and psychological modes of therapy that is to say for generations
homosexuals entering a therapeutic venue for the purpose of being quote cured close quote have
rarely are enjoyed the kind of results that they sought well if you assume that psychiatry
and clinical psychology combined along with pharmacology and all sorts of social supports
and the power of law if all this operating over long periods of time at great cost of
patients in patients and in money and time and energy has achieved but negligible results
well then it mustn't be a disorder that is to say if it really were a bona fide disorder our
treatment modalities would be effective well I say I guess there is something to that logic
but but can you imagine the board of internal medicine or however the AMA
organises itself specialists in inter board certified internists in medicine having a
convention and saying look there's a condition that we've referred to as incurable cancer
with every treatment modality that we've applied has failed obviously if this really were a disease
our treatments would be effective and since our treatments have got gotten us absolutely
nowhere in these cases it mustn't be a disorder at all of course I mean the round of laughter
would be sustained and audible even even at a distance I say there is a tendency to be
jocular at the expense of serious hard working people dealing with vexatious matters and I
don't want to be I don't want to be droll at their expense there is something to the
proposition that if a particular and complex pattern of human behavior human sexuality
itself resists every imaginable therapeutic modality perhaps it was never right to classify
it as a disorder in the first instance all right that then raises the question how have
disorders been classified in the first instance and have you sworn off that not just where
homosexuality is concerned but where the full panoply of so called psychiatric or psychological
disturbances are involved now I mentioned in an earlier lecture one instance of a homosexual
in in New Orleans being sent to the Tulane Medical Center and and being a quote cured
close quote by direct stimulation of structures in the limbic system while the patient was
watching heterosexual sexual films this is a do we want to call this a research program
the investigator here the attending doctor was very very optimistic about the results
what you had was someone a rain for a homosexual act of a homosexual proposition to to a plain
close officer in a public place it resulted in his being brought before the judge the patient
are defendant in question had a record of this conduct this was in New Orleans Louisiana
at a time when a repeat offender on this charge would see a period of imprisonment fine and
imprisonment not a particularly long period of imprisonment a judge with all of the right liberal
decent reflexes recognized as he said at the time that to send such a person to a prison would
simply expose him to the sorts of assaults and the like that could only make the matter worse
but if the patient was willing to be sent to a psychiatric facility nice doctors concerned
about things so be it well of course sensible chap that he was he chose a hospital over over a
prison of course the be part of the story which apparently he wasn't clear on was that nothing
almost nothing was going to go on in in that psychiatric facility that was going to cure him
of homosexuality and so he was then told by by the the doctor who would do the brain stimulation
work that look the statistics here quite clear if the only way you get out of this hospital is the
medical staff saying that you're cured of your homosexuality the odds are very much against
you and you could be here you know essentially you could be here to planet earth suffers the
heat death but we are doing these studies and we've had some results success with animal
studies and the like would you like to try it answer is yes a little burr hole is drilled with
a dental drill electrodes are sunk you find the place in the limbic system which when
electrically stimulated gives rise to sexual excitement put a little pace there to keep that
electrode in place smith now watches these essentially pornographic heterosexual films while
stimulating this area of his brain discovers now that there's conditioning forming between heightened
sexuality and heterosexual sexuality graphically presented says he'd like to try this for real
the ever resourceful staff of this hospital then apparently searches high and low on the streets
of New Orleans till they find someone who's willing to shall we say participate in the study
and we discover at the end of the day that the patient quote performed admirably close quote
though that surely is not the adverb that I would assign to anybody associated with the entire project
now interestingly as Michelle Foucault points out in madness and civilization that this is just
an instance of cultural standards determining that someone must be treated and when those
standards are finally matched up with the the actual person who now is declared to be a certain type
all bets are off it's not a question of whether smith is actually mad it's a question of whether
smith has been labeled and one smith is labeled the treatment ensues the treatment is the treatment
of a label not a condition if the same chap brought in before a judge in New Orleans years ago
were brought in now that this whole scenario could not possibly have taken place he wouldn't
have been found in DSM so let the buyer beware
