Lecture 30 Psychopathology, The Medical Model
Having considered violence in the brain and its relationship to law and to adjudication,
we begin to see the extension of a materialistic perspective in psychology
into matters of broad social and daily life, broad social and daily contexts.
With respect to the disordered mind or the troubles of life, the vexations of life,
the question that arises within this materialistic psychology
is whether the right model is, at the end of the day, not the medical model after all,
the way we should view the problems of life and our own difficulties within it
would be essentially in medical terms.
And I say the materialistic perspective in psychology supports just that view,
that the way we ought to think of frustration, conflict, not just insanity in cases that extreme,
but the daily troubles of life, the problems of adjustment, the difficulties children have in the life
is in terms of brain mechanisms, and that once the brain mechanisms are understood
and we develop approaches to keeping those mechanisms in fine fettle,
many of life's frustrations and difficulties will go away.
On this perspective, let me say, there aren't really, there aren't actually psychological problems.
There are medical or physiological or biological problems,
which we happen to label psychologically because of our inveterate ignorances on these subjects.
That, I say, would be the radical, medical or biological or materialistic perspective on psychology.
It has much to support it and, of course, it has many adherents.
And the more that's learned about the brain, the more one recognizes that indeed alterations
in the madure interior of the brain, particularly in the transmitter pathways
and the transmitter substances of the brain, can have quite profound effects on emotion,
cognition, perception, attention, vigilance and the like.
Let me just mention some of these main transmitter substances and transmitter pathways
and some of the psychological aspects of them or psychological correlates of them.
I'll mention seven transmitter substances that have been looked at fairly closely in research contexts
and indeed in clinical contexts as well.
There is acetylcholine, which is an extremely important transmitter both in the peripheral nervous system
and within the brain itself.
It is known that if you inject animals with materials that actually block the formation of acetylcholine,
you can reduce and even eliminate memories for recently presented material.
So the presence of acetylcholine within the system is in certain contexts a necessary condition
for the storage of recently learned material and for the storage for the continued representation
of events in the external world.
For arousal and vigilance in order for the organism, and this includes human organisms,
to be able to sustain vigilant behavior, it is known that the transmitter norepinephrine is necessary
and again where it is blocked or reduced in its quality, where it's restricted in its formation,
you do find diminished vigilance, greater degrees of somnolence,
greater degrees of lassitude and the like.
Surely one of the most important of the transmitters from a psychological point of view is serotonin.
Serotonin has been very closely tied to aggression, changes in mood, changes in appetite.
Serotonin imbalances are reliably associated with depression and indeed serotonin has also been linked up
with premenstrual syndrome, which I mentioned in the previous lecture, has already been mounted
as one form of insanity defense, a kind of temporary diminished capacity as a result of these hormonal changes
and these hormonal changes are to a very considerable extent responsive to serotonin imbalances.
Dopamine of course is in the headlines regularly because of its close association with Parkinson's disease,
but it also seems to be a transmitter substance that will give environmental events their rewarding,
their pleasure producing qualities and where there is an attenuation in circulating dopamine,
the reinforcing power of traditional reinforcers is known to be diminished.
GABA, which is Gamma Aminobutyric Acid, GABA, is associated with the formation of epileptic seizures in the brain
and for certain Choreo-Athatoid, as they're called, Choreo-Athatoid, diseases of involuntary movement,
of which one example is Huntington's Chorea. Choreo-Athatoid movements are very tentacle-like movements,
if you see this sort of thing. It's not the shaking palsy, it's not the Marche Petipa of the Parkinson patient,
the small mincing steps and the tremors, rather it is a tentacle-like grasping pattern
and I say this has been associated with GABA.
If you tallied the greatest number of neurons that use a particular transmitter substance,
glutamate would probably be the substance that is used by most of the neurons in the body
and thus it is a substance capable of activating in a very, very general way neurons in the nervous system
and then finally, and this has been referred to in an earlier lecture, the endorphins which have pain attenuating consequences
in the presence of great stress and painful stimuli, the nervous system is able to generate an increase
in its endorphin concentration and this works as a way of controlling pain, diminishing pain and the like.
Neurokinns are a species of neurochemical that in fact has pain controlling properties.
Now, I mentioned just seven transmitter substances and some of their quite, quite gross properties.
Obviously, in the actual chemical balance within the cerebral circulation, any number of subtle changes
circulating transmitter substances can have profound effects on the organism's adaptive potential.
Just think of something that radically alters the animal's capacity to be attentive.
Think of something that radically alters the animal's capacity to be aroused, diminished arousal.
How will this work in a context in which procreative sexual activity is to take place?
Will the animal be responsive in that context?
How about contexts reliably associated with inducing fear?
Will proper fear responses be formed in an animal whose overall arousal level is diminished?
So each one of these transmitters has certain specific functions, but in harmonious relationship,
these neurochemical substances actually set the tone and pattern of brain activity in general
and therefore it's not unusual to find the literature in clinical psychology and psychiatry
paying careful and close attention to the known neurochemistry of patients suffering
from one or another form of psychological or psychiatric disturbance.
Now, this is work in progress and I should think that most people in neuropsychiatry today
would subscribe to the view that the main psychiatric categories are filled out by patients
who at least at some level either are suffering from neurochemical alterations
or indeed will respond to neurochemically active agents in the form of medicines, supplements and the like.
This perspective reached its first great, what I would call its first modern plateau in the 19th century.
By the middle of the 19th century, this is after the trial of Hadfield around the time of the famous McNaughton trial which is 1843.
In the 1840s, 50s and 60s, there was a spate of books generated in the field of medical psychology, psychology and law
psychiatric jurisprudence, medicine and jurisprudence and the like.
These being served up by quite experienced clinicians and scientists who had reached a settled position
that the disordered personality, the antisocial actor, the psychiatric patient, the person with severe mood alterations and the like.
In all these instances, you're looking at persons whose brains have undergone some sort of change
or are functioning abnormally. In the German speaking world, the authoritative text was written by Greasinger
and his textbook in medical psychology on page one declares that although controversy abounds,
one thing will be granted by all who have experience in such areas
and that is every psychiatric disturbance involves an organ of the body
and the organ of the body that's involved is the brain.
Greasinger has absolutely no doubt about it. When you look at insanity as a psychological phenomenon,
you're simply looking at the outward manifestation of a phenomenon that at its core is a neurological phenomenon.
Psychological disease is brain disease.
In the English speaking world, the most influential treatises were written by Maudsley and by Pritchard in England
and in the United States by Isaac Ray who probably had more to do
with transforming the neural perspective on insanity in America than any other writer did.
Ray was a frequent contributor to the American Journal of Insanity
and in fact Ray was very influential in affecting how major judges like Justice Shaw in Massachusetts
came to understand the concept of legal insanity
even in Shaw's instructions to the jury you can see him citing the works of Isaac Ray.
In the famous trial of McNaughton in England, Isaac Ray's work is cited
and Isaac Ray himself is a quite interesting chap.
He was married to Melville's daughter by the way and in that provincial New England context
there are all sorts of interesting patterns of relationship.
So I should say that by the 1880s it was a more or less settled position
and that is that psychiatric disturbances are simply neurological disturbances once removed so to speak.
The patient who has mood alterations of a significant nature
is a person whose brain is altering in its functions in a significant way.
Now of course there are forms of pathology, psychopathology and indeed antisocial behavior
that link up quite directly with conditions in the brain.
I should mention one that is always a headline grabber whatever it takes place
it doesn't take place all that often thank goodness.
But there is a condition known as temporal lobe focal epilepsy
and let me parse that complex high-tech statement if I can.
Temporal lobe remember if you view the cerebral cortex as a kind of boxing glove
the thumb of that boxing glove is the temporal lobe.
Now if you go into the medial core of the temporal lobe
where you're getting very close to the limbic system structures and the like
it has been discovered and it was discovered over 40 years ago
that every now and again a mass will form in a particular region of temporal cortex
a calcified mass very often what's called a calcified glioma
and where that small mass exists you will be able to record by EEG for example
epileptic type discharges from that region of temporal cortex
but what you do not get in such patients is the epileptic seizure activity
not that you get something entirely different
at least sometimes you get something entirely different
what you get is this the patient undertakes a complex series of actions
which might cover an entire day or a substantial fraction of the day
including violent aggressive assaultive behavior
that indeed has all of the marks of a homicidal attempt or a murderous attempt
patient suffering from this will engage in such behavior on repeated occasions
now it's not always as stark and criminal as an attempted murder
but it can be a quite destructive pattern of behavior
destruction of property attacks on persons and the like
shooting a number of people from a height at the University of Texas
and that particular person when post mortem was found to have a temporal lobe focal condition
now the brain surgeon who had so much to do with identifying this
was actually able to remove these calcified gliomas
and in removing the calcified gliomas the pattern of behavior just went away
there was never a recurrence
Wilder Penfield who was American born but spent almost his entire professional life in Canada
and indeed they've named a street after Penfield
he's one of the greatest neurosurgeons of the 20th century
but Penfield studied these patients and operated on these patients
and look at the picture now
you've got this miniscule space occupying lesion
a small calcified glioma
it happens to be in just the wrong sort of place
and what seems to be generated by it is a pattern of apparently voluntary behavior
of a quite criminal or antisocial nature
and the patient is totally oblivious of this thereafter
that is when the seizure state is over
and you confront the patient with what it was he just did
there's absolutely no recollection of having done any such thing
now surgically removing this
and understand now this is a temporal lobe focal epilepsy
focal as in a very narrow focalized area
that is displaying these discharge patterns do you see
so here's the temporal lobe focal epileptic
entirely amnesic to having done any such thing
and yet if you take a look at the behavior unfolding
it is clearly I mean to our perception
it's clearly a fully intended coordinated intelligible pattern of behavior
that has no good as it's as its as its aim
now in the face of something like that
can anyone doubt
but that even the most apparently organized and intended behaviors
might indeed be the result of disruptions in the nervous system
disruptions in the transmitter pathways
focalized space occupying lesions
that perhaps will never be uncovered
here we're trying this person for a grave offense
or we're engaged in a prolonged psychotherapeutic session
with somebody who has morbid delusions and morbid fears
and can't get on with people
terrible problems of adjustment
can't hold down a job
marriages falling apart
children won't even talk to him or talk to her
and there's someone sitting in the counseling room
and taking notes and asking about early childhood experiences
and how you actually did get on with your mother
and do you recall your toilet training being a particularly traumatic one
and all this going on meanwhile some would say
while in fact the source of the problem
might be something smaller than the pinky nail
indeed a tenth of the size
occupying a particularly unpropitious place in the central nervous system
and generating a whole series of mood disturbances
and incorrect perceptions
fluctuating affect
paranoid suspicions etc etc
well the medical model declares
that when all the facts are in
the answer to the question
why are life's vexations the way they are
will be served up in essentially medical, physiological, biochemical terms
think for example of certain forms of manic depressive psychosis
particularly the bipolar form
of both manic and depressive states
in which the depressive state
becomes trivially manageable
with lithium supplements
now we're talking about patients who
30 years ago would be institutionalized
because of their constant threats of suicide
and indeed very often numerous attempts at suicide
as a result of a deep morbid depression
persons whose depressions are so grave
as to render them inaccessible to therapy
you can't even ask whether the toilet training was traumatic and so forth
these are people who are simply so
involuted so turned in on themselves
sitting in the corner of a darkened room
tears running down the cheeks
my life means nothing
it's useless and I am worthless
and the reason no one loves me is I am utterly unlovable
and the sooner this ends the better
tragic tragic cases
the stuff of which gothic fiction is written
and you say to yourself
my lord what must be at the bottom of this
it must be a pattern of lifetime frustrations
going back to early childhood
will anyone ever understand this
and two weeks after the administration of lithium
you've got someone happy as a lark
someone who will now go down in legend and song
as one of life's great adjusters
so people take a look at this
experienced scientific people take a look at this and say
if here
why not everywhere
if this works so effectively in this one case
is there really anything
in the diagnostic and statistical manual
is there really any psychiatric category
that ultimately will not be dealt with
through just this means
now entire tracts have been written
in support of the proposition
that truth be told
there are no mental illnesses
that is there isn't any disease
that's a mental disease
because the mind isn't an organ
and diseases attack organs
the person whose name
I think is most frequently associated with that
perspective is a psychiatrist
by the name of Thomas Zaz
S-Z-A-S-Z
who's been writing on this subject
for over 30 years
who wrote a very influential and controversial book
many years ago titled aptly titled
given his perspective
the myth of mental illness
illness
I remember having doctors as
give a lecture at Georgetown
many many years ago
and one of the questions during the question answer period
one of our students raised the question
well I understand doctors as you're a psychiatrist
do you see patients
and he said yes I see patients
and the student quite politely asked
do you charge them
and he said yes I do charge them
he said but mind you I tell them this
if you understand
that I have a family to support
and mortgages and the like and bills to pay
then you realize how I really
can't devote my entire life
to sitting down and talking to people
nonetheless there do seem to be people
who are very interested in sitting down
and talking to me
now I've put together a fee structure
such that if you want to come in
on a regular basis and talk to me for an hour
I have to charge you this
of course there aren't any promises in advance
that anything good is going to happen
to you or me
except I'll be able to pay some bills
and apparently when we're all finished
you will have enjoyed I guess
or at some level been satisfied by
the hour that we engage in this colloquy
as long as both of us
understand that during this hour
I am not treating a disease
because you can't treat a disease
by talking to it
now I think he
I think the temptation
is to see in Dr. Zaz's
comments an attempt
at whimsy
but I think if you read the works of Dr. Zaz
you will understand that he's quite
sincere in taking that position
for there to be
a disease there has to be
some organ
or system some tissue
some palpable
mass of biological
stuff
within which one can discover
pathological processes
on that construal
there cannot be a mental
disease so if
in fact there are profound
quote psychological
closed quote disturbances
these must be manifestations
of a disease state taking place
where disease states take place
namely in bodies
so that the myth of mental illness
simply underscore Zaz's position
that there isn't
a mental illness
there are physical illnesses
and some physical illnesses may have
profound quote
psychological closed quote manifestations
but clear up the physical illness
and the psychological illness
goes with it
now the
support for a position like this
and may I just pause to say
that on most accounts
these would be
regarded as extreme positions
they seem to be radical positions
and indeed I think very often they are intended
to be radical positions
to get the debate going
to shock us out of a certain
habitual complacent attitude
tied very much to
to the terms
we choose to use do you see
if you just keep talking about
mental illness, mental illness
adjustment problems
problems of adapting oneself to the demands
of society the stress and pressures
of a complex culture
if you keep talking that way
before long the discourse now
leaves room only
for psychological, social
mental kinds of disturbances
it's good to have
Zaz's hat in the ring
and other persons scrupulously attached
to a medical model to say wait a minute
these disturbances
so-called disturbances
if they really are disturbances
of the kind warranting the term disease
let's understand something
there aren't any social diseases
there aren't any psychological diseases
there aren't any moral diseases
there are diseases in tissue
diseases in organs
and in organs systems
and the way you approach those is medically
now if instead
of actual disease
systems you're simply talking
about eccentric people
people who vary in their approach to life
well that's not a disease
that's simply the fact that
no two of us is quite alike
and we might have to develop a certain
tolerant attitude that is we might have
to widen the range
of conduct that is at once
off-putting
and at the same time liberated from the category
of disease
before you know it you'll be treating everybody
you don't like do you see
so it is an extreme position
and it will find support in a variety
of areas now I mentioned one area
temporal lobe focal epilepsy
and criminal assault of behavior
take out the calcified glioma
no recurrence of the condition
that's a fairly
convincing demonstration
that indeed you can get extremely organized
quote criminal
closed quote behavior
in someone who's absolutely oblivious to what they're doing
and indeed would never do such a thing
or at least never does such a thing
again once the neurological
problem is dealt with so there's one instance
here's another instance
studies of the heritability
of mental disease
and now I will get to the issue
of heritability toward the very end
of this series of lectures
but let me not be skeptical
at this point about the concept
of heritability when applied to
human psychological attributes
let me just summarize
without criticism the literature
I'm referring to here
the question is this
in fact the question was once posed
by a quite distinguished past president
of the American Psychological Association
Paul Neal
he said in one of his addresses
that he sometimes gives
his residence in clinical psychology
this question looks like
something of a trick question
do you see
but it's a question that gets to the heart of something
he asks this
suppose you could only
know one thing
about a person
there was only one fact you could know
and from that fact
you would want to have a better than chance
probability
of identifying that person
as a schizophrenic
what one fact
would indeed give you a better than chance
likelihood of identifying
someone as a schizophrenic
only one fact
and he says the clinical
residents never get the answer
and he says the answer is this
find someone with a schizophrenic
identical twin
that is of all the things you might know
about someone that would give you
a much better than chance likelihood
of correctly identifying them
as schizophrenic
they just came into the room
there they're sitting
you've got to know one thing about them
to recognize them as a schizophrenic
what would that be
Neal says the one thing that would give you
a better than chance probability
of making a correct diagnosis is
find someone who has
a schizophrenic identical twin
now studies of the heritability of schizophrenia
appear frequently in the literature
let me just say at this point
that heritability is a figure
it's an empirically obtained figure
that can vary from 0 to 1
if something has a heritability
of 1.0
it means that genetics
is contributing almost everything
to the variability that that characteristic
displays in a large representative sample
the variability
if in fact the heritability was 0
it means that the variability
displayed by that characteristic
in a large sample is attributable
primarily to environmental sources
of variation
well I say we'll get to the question of heritability
in a later lecture but let me just say
that studies of the heritability of schizophrenia
have turned up
heritabilities on the order of
0.6, 0.7
sometimes 0.8
in certain studies of identical twins
fraternal twins
identical twins reared apart
siblings
mother-daughter correlations
mother-son correlations
father-daughter, father-son
grandparents to grandchildren
you do these various patterns of correlation
what you're looking for is this
as you increase the degree of genetic relatedness
do you increase
the chances of the characteristic
in question appearing
so to say that the heritability
of schizophrenia is a fairly
robust heritability
is to say that the more
closely genetically related
a schizophrenic is
to someone else
the higher the likelihood that someone else
will be schizophrenic
now this is an area
charged not only with controversy
but with confusion
we'll pick it up in a later context
but again from the very fact
that certain mental illnesses reveal
a high heritability
which leads some to believe that there's a very very strong
genetic component
between genetics and brain chemistry
it follows
on the medical model
that so-called mental illness
is just a medical problem once removed
ultimately to be understood
at the level of genetics and biochemistry
that's one view
thank you
