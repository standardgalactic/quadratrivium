Lecture 5, Three Enduring Isms, Empiricism, Rationalism, Materialism
In this lecture, I want to cover, however, breathlessly, three leading isms that have
guided and animated psychological research and theory for centuries.
The isms are empiricism, rationalism, and materialism, and each of these terms lends
itself to a variety of interpretations and definitions, and I do want to be quite careful
to stay within the bounds that really honor the people who give these three traditions,
their intellectual and scientific foundations.
In the previous lecture, I noted that John Locke rigorously subscribed to an empiricistic
psychology, a psychology based on the proposition that the mind is furnished directly by experience,
that there isn't anything in there that's innate, and that everything we come to know,
all of the ideas that we might have in the course of a lifetime originate in elementary
sensations which are held together in Newtonian fashion to form simple ideas, and these are
held together in a kind of gravitational or associational way to form ever more complex
ideas.
Now, Locke was not what might be called a radical empiricist, because Locke recognized
that at least at the outset, the mind must have certain primitive resources just for
the purpose of functioning at all as a mental entity.
In fact, in his famous essay, he refers to a number of, quote, original acts of the mind,
and by original acts of the mind, he means those things that are at the foundation of
our very logical mode of thinking, the idea that up is not down, that a thing cannot simultaneously
be and not be the law of contradiction.
These things, Locke says, are not learned from experience.
They are more or less in place as a condition of their being mind at all.
So his empiricism is not of an absolutely radical nature.
He does say that with respect to the facts of the world, we know nothing about these
until experience provides this information.
But I say there is a subtext, a background mental life on which these experiences impinge.
Now following Locke, David Hume offers a rather more radical empiricism.
Hume is perhaps the most influential philosopher ever to have written in the English language.
In 1739, his treatise of human nature is published.
He says later on that it fell stillborn from the womb.
Not many people paid much attention to the treatise when it first came out.
Within a decade, he would put the contents of that work in a rather more accessible form.
And indeed, in this form, it became, Hume's philosophy became an extremely controversial
work.
It was viewed as atheistic, skeptical, opposed to traditional values, not to mention traditional
family values.
And I say, Hume's philosophy has been controversial and influential ever since.
Well, of course, one of the things that makes Hume's philosophy particularly, and his psychology
particularly controversial, is that he takes ideas which we regard to be at the very foundation,
not only of our scientific thinking, but what might be called our deepest religious thought,
and shows that these ideas are really products of essentially mental operations, such that
if the mental operations were different, the ideas would be radically different.
We can illustrate this with Hume's analysis of the concept of a cause.
Now we are all taught, certainly in the Judeo-Christian tradition, we are all taught that God is the
cause of all things.
Not only that, but all of science is grounded in the proposition that there are causal laws
that constitute the very glue of the universe, that every effect has a cause, that everything
that comes about or comes into being has some prior instrumental force that makes it possible.
So here we have both science and religion tied to inextricably bound to notions of causation,
and Hume wants to make clear what the idea of causation is all about.
How we ever arrive at a concept of causation.
Well, he says, if you examine the matter closely, you will discover that the concept
of cause is nothing but a certain habit of the mind that is brought about by what he
calls constant conjunction, that is any time two events are constantly conjoined, constantly
associated in time and in space.
It just happens to be one of the fixed habits of mental life to regard the earlier one as
the cause of the later one, so that the concept of causation itself now collapses into just
a habitual mode of thinking, just a habit of the mind.
In fact, he concludes this part of his treatise by saying that once you understand this, you
see that quote, anything may be the cause of anything.
Close quote.
Now what does he mean by anything may be the cause of anything?
Well presumably there could be an entirely accidental relationship such that some antecedent
event does take place, it's reliably followed by something else.
We will come to regard this sequence as a causal sequence, whether there's anything causal
in the sequence or not.
So here Hume, who later would be charged with being a skeptic regarding causation, he denied
that he was a skeptic, he was trying to elucidate the very concept of causation, here this very
cement of at once religious conviction and scientific thought is shown to be, well, if
a cement or rather porous event and utterly psychological from first to last.
What Hume does is he psychologizes what at once had been an authoritative philosophy and
authoritative metaphysics.
He shows that within the arena of mental life we construct a certain reality and that there
is no way of telling ever the extent to which that mentally constructed reality does or
does not reflect the actual facts of the external world.
So Hume is the quintessential psychological philosopher.
Now constant conjunction is a central part of his theory of causation and it relies very
heavily on what Hume comes to call the laws of association.
Of course these laws or principles have been in place for a very long time, they go back
to Aristotle and probably before Aristotle.
Hume wants to argue that we can actually reduce associative processes to lawfulness and he
offers as the basic laws of association, well, constant conjunction that is to say any two
events closely associated with each other in time will come to be associated in our
mental life, contiguity, any two events that are spatially close together that take place
contiguously tend to be associated with each other and there is also a tendency to associate
much more strongly those things that share a certain similarity.
So from contiguity and similarity and repetition the mind begins to form its stock set of ideas
and precepts and principles and reality then has to be distinguished from the mental construction
of reality and it's only the latter that we can ever know.
Now Hume's influence continues to this day.
One philosopher who was mightily influenced by Hume was David Hartley, influenced simultaneously
by Hume and by Isaac Newton and it was Hartley who took the principles of association and
attempted to construct, he's one of the first to do this, a quite systematic psychology based
on the proposition that the laws of association and Locke's attempt to fashion a Newtonian
psychology of mind could best be understood at the level of physiology.
That is the associative processes take place within what in the middle of the 18th century
when David Hartley was writing was taken to be the medullary substance that is today what
we would call the neural or neurophysiological substrates.
It was Hartley's idea following Newton that when a stimulus impinges on us it sets up
vibrational activity within the medullary substance.
You refer to these as vibrati uncles you see this 18th century terminology and that what
the associative processes are are just patterns of vibration being moved from one place in
the body to another place in the body such that in the future when a particular pattern
of vibration takes place any previous associations now will be similarly triggered and you will
get behavior or perception or thoughts that are closely associated in virtue of the fact
that the underlying biology is supporting this association.
Hartley's observations on man which runs a thousand pages is an extremely interesting
attempt in the 18th century in the middle of the 18th century to develop a systematic
empiricistic psychology empirical psychology along Newtonian lines with some debt now being
paid to the emerging science of physiology and neurophysiology this of course before
anybody knows the precise anatomy and functions of nerves and neurons and the like.
Well within a century we have an extremely well developed empiricistic psychology this
from John Stuart Mill himself deeply indebted to David Hume's philosophy and in fact ever
more psychological in his orientation than even David Hume was.
With John Stuart Mill we have what might be called a radical empiricism in that John
Stuart Mill defines even matter itself the material world itself as quote the permanent
possibility of sensation and I want to pause on this John Stuart Mill definition of matter
it's extremely subtle and it's extremely revealing.
Mill doesn't want to take anything as having real existence except in so far as it indeed
is the subject of a possible experience for anything to be is presumably to be perceivable
in this he's taking a page from from Bishop Barkley the famous Bishop Barkley who argued
that to be is to be perceived as per Kippy Barkley said well Hume without becoming a
Barkley and wants to preserve that special sense of reality being in principle observable
this is one of the salient features of an empiricistic psychology or philosophy it takes
reality to be experienced reality and that which falls beyond the very possibility of
experience can't be spoken of at all anything that has real existence is in principle the
subject of experience that's what empiricism is all about and an empiricistic psychology
then says and claims and affirms that whatever we take to be our mental life is ultimately
referable to a history of experience to ongoing and to past experiences.
Now what about these these original acts of the mind then that John Locke talked about
this this residual of an older philosophy what about the fact that we know there's no
number so large that you can't add one to it certainly nobody arrives at that by experience
no one's sitting here now or sitting in the car and counting four million nine hundred
and sixty three thousand eight hundred and twenty seven eight hundred and twenty eight
and so forth we all know that there's no number so large that you can't add one to
it doesn't this seem to be a kind of innate idea or native characteristic of the mind
doesn't empiricism falls short in accounting for the basic logical operations of the mind
aren't there things we've known all our lives as in up is not down a thing cannot simultaneously
be and not be well when John Stuart middle gets to questions like this he says what you
have to adopt here is the psychological method that is of course there are things we seem
to have known so long that our memory will never get back to a point where we didn't
know them and this will strike us as as proving the presence of innate ideas what we mean
by an innate idea is some an idea we've always had he said but there's another way of looking
at this suppose in fact you can establish that every new idea that's formed is formed
as a result of associative processes in experience well from the fact that you can prove that
newly formed ideas are the result of associative processes and learning by a process of inference
you can conclude that these ideas you seem to have had since a time out of memory were
themselves produced by associative processes but at a time when you did not have the verbal
fluency and the like to frame explanations for yourself now what's interesting about
John Stuart mills position here is that he's already advocating an experimental approach
to determining when ideas have their origins that if indeed you can go ahead and do an
experiment to show the conditions under which an idea is formed then you've already established
the conditions under which ideas of that kind ever were formed not in the laboratory but
in life but always as a result of repeated experience and by way of the laws of association
now this perspective on psychology has been a dominant perspective and indeed you can
trace the the lineage from Aristotle and and through the medieval period you can trace
it to John Locke David Hume Hartley John Stuart mill up into the 20th century and perhaps
most significantly to B.F. Skinner who is perhaps the leading 20th century figure in
what is called behavioristic psychology a psychology based on the proposition that the
determinants of behavior the determinants of perception the determinants of what we
might take to be our mental life a term behaviorists of course would resist are all to be found
in the external world all to be found in the environment as Skinner never tired of teaching
and writing the determinants of behavior are not to be looked for inside the organism but
outside the organism so a radically environmentalistic psychology is based on a radically empiricistic
philosophy and I say that lineage traces all the way back to the ancients and forward
to modern behaviorism that is the empiricistic tradition and an extremely influential one
well has rationalism nothing to say by way of rebuttal or reply and anyway what do we
mean by rationalism well rationalism like empiricism is at once a theory about how we
come to know anything and at the same time a position regarding how we should proceed
to learn things how we should proceed to discover the facts and truths of the world there are
empiricistic approaches and there are rationalistic approaches empiricism begins with the ancient
Greek word and prayer which just means observation in the ancient Greek world those physicians
who tied their medical practice solely to observations to what worked and what didn't
work what herbal remedies or music or exercise regimens and the like were successful refer
to themselves as empiricoi each one of them being an empiricos so all that meant was someone
who based his practices on observation empiricism as an official philosophical position as a
theory about the nature of reality declares that everything we can ever know for certain
is just what matches up with experience and beyond the range of experience there isn't
anything that could be known well I say with that as as one point of view how should we
understand rationalism well I think we should understand it this way the rationalist does
not deny that we learn many many things by way of experience what the rationalist claims
however is that if all we were were screens on which the environment projected itself
there would be no coherent knowledge at all that what we mean by knowledge is a rational
reconstruction of reality based on the isolated facts of experience as long as these isolated
facts are just out there as possible subjects of sensation there is no intelligibility to
the world moreover the rationalist wants to argue that when you come to what what what
are the greatest achievements of human mental life they have an undeniably rational character
think only of the achievement of abstract mathematics think only of the achievement of the advanced
sciences particularly astronomy and astrophysics and physics itself these are extraordinary
and ineliminably rational reconstructions they are rational bodies of knowledge and they
show the significant part of human mental life namely the rational power of the human
mind to take the facts of experience and from those facts to construct possible worlds to
construct ideas that not only may not match up with a given experience but may predict
experiences down the road do you see predicting what the world would be like under a set of
conditions now unforeseen so the rationalist wants to argue two things first that the informed
creative and constructing mind the mind in possession of an intelligible and transmittable
body of knowledge that tells us how the world actually works and indeed how it must work
that is a world a universe governed by laws describable by mathematical principles incorporated
into theories that are abstract and mathematical all this comes about as a result of the rational
power of mind and this is not something that could possibly come about from it from a being
restricted to associating sensory experiences so that's the very center of of rationalism
and it's also a program for how to proceed with one's inquiries you don't just to use
Sir Thomas Brown's expression in the 17th century you don't just stare about with a
gross rusticity do you see as the radical empiricists would have one rather you think and you think
deeply and logically and coherently to put together entire bodies of knowledge that have
a framework and an essential character well when Locke's essay appeared Leibniz one of
the great textbook rationalists had a criticism of Locke's essay on the human understanding
a collection of essays which Leibniz titled new essays on the understanding and I think
you get a sense of a very complete sense of rationalism with just this past passage Leibniz
has Locke saying although Locke never said this but he has Locke taking a position that
was quite famous in the medieval period and is expressed in Latin Nehill est in intellectu
quote known for where it Prius incensu nothing is in the intellect which was not first in
the senses that's the classic empiricist position anything that gets into the intellect begins
in the senses do you see well if you want to understand the rationalist reply to that
you can you can see it in Leibniz who replies Nisi intellectus ipsa except the intellect itself
there must be some rational mental framework on which experiences might impinge but then
those experiences are pulled together and integrated into a rational whole whole and
of course after Leibniz and at the very end of the enlightenment circa 1800 we have the
influential philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Kant again is one of the great textbook rationalists
and Kant wants to argue getting back to Hume's theory of causation. Kant wants to argue that
if the concept of cause is based on the experiences the constantly conjoined experiences first
this then that. Kant wants to make the observation that this depends both on time and space that
is for there to be constantly conjoined events for there to be contiguous events to be associated
there must be a temporal realm in which succession can take place and a spatial realm but neither
time nor space is given in experience you can't see time you can't feel time you can't
see space. So Kant argues that in fact the categories of time and space must be present
for there to be experience at all indeed he refers to time and space as pure intuitions
and Kant wants to go on to argue and he quite influential argued that as time and space are
the necessary preconditions for there to be any experience at all so there must be certain
categories of the understanding for there to be any ideas at all all of our ideas are
finally about quantity or quality or relational properties or following the logicians what
Kant calls modality a thing either actually is or possibly is or necessarily is but when
we say that something is what it is necessarily we can't possibly be referring to anything
in experience nothing that happens in experience is what it is necessarily so the category
of necessity must be something rationally brought about because it could not possibly
be brought about through experience when we say that that that it is necessarily the case
that a thing cannot simultaneously be and not be we're not making an inference based
on past experience we're not saying well there wasn't any time in the past where something
was and at the same time wasn't no we're insisting that this is an impossibility that it is necessarily
the case for example that a thing is itself necessarily there's no number so large that
you can't add one to it necessarily two plus two equals four now this property of necessity
the modal category of necessity is not something that comes about as a result of experience
and therefore it must reflect a feature of mind as a an engine as it were the framework
for rational coherent and intelligible thought this tradition culminates well I shouldn't
say culminates but it reaches a plateau in the 20th century in certain influential rationalistic
psychologies of the sort associated for example with Jean Piaget who studies the formation
of the child's concept of necessity the child's concept of universals later when we take up
the subject of cognitive psychology and cognitive development we will revisit Piaget's work
and we will see in Piaget's work an attempt to illustrate in studies of childhood just
that essentially Kantian nature of the rational mind the mind integrating and assimilating
experiences and assembling from these experiences a coherent whole we'll see this particularly
when Piaget studies the concepts of conservation and universals in children well this leaves
us with the third major tradition which I've called materialism by materialism I am not
referring to the buying habits of people in the fashionable suburbs and the like nor am
I referring to the famous materialistic social philosophy of Karl Marx I'm referring instead
to a metaphysical position and let me pause here to say something about what I what I mean
by metaphysics metaphysics refers to two central issues the issue of what has real
existence and the issue of how we can ever know anything now the subject the formal subject
that deals with that which has real existence is called ontology from the Greek on which
just means something and the subject it deals with our ability to know anything is referred
to as epistemology those two components the ontological and the epistemological flesh
out the domain of metaphysics now understood that way we can say that what materialism
asserts is this anything that is ontologically real is material that is anything that has
real existence is finally reducible to some aspect of matter or at least to some as we'd
say today to some aspect of matter energy thus there cannot be totally non physical immaterial
but nonetheless really existing entities so the materialist position is that if we have
a mental life if we do have rational powers if we have experiences and ideas and thoughts
and dreams and emotions and the like these are ultimately to be understood in terms of
the complex physical organization of the body and more particularly of the brain so what
we see in in the materialist tradition is a psychology that becomes ever more biological
then ever more physiological and ever more neuro physiological so that by the twentieth
century we are actually talking about psychology as a quote neuro cognitive science psychology
now being essentially ready for absorption by the developed and developing sciences of
physiology artificial intelligence computer science and the like well there's a wonderful
history to this too Hobbes wrote in his Leviathan that the essential nature of humanity is
as a mechanical body functioning according to mechanical principles by the middle of
the eighteenth century Julia Norfler de la Metrie would write an extremely controversial
book called man a machine la machine in which he says since all of the powers of the mind
since all of the faculties of the soul depend as they do on the proper organization of the
body he says quote the soul is surely an enlightened machine of course he had to run off to Prussia
for sanctuary haven't having written and said something like that but again the camel's
nose was in the tent La Metrie in the middle of the eighteenth century during the enlightenment
is is putting down the case for a materialistic psychology and insisting that at the end of
the day one will understand the human mind by understanding the human brain by eighteen
hundred Frans Joseph Gaul one of the great anatomists of his time is already in a position
to advance a new science which he calls phrenology and phrenology is based on the proposition
that every truly intellectual or moral or emotional aspect of our life matches up with
the functions of specific parts of the brain Gaul's phrenology would fall on hard times
but the essential notion that every definable psychological event or state has some brain
process behind it is with us to this day and what we get from all this then is a philosophy
of mind that insists mind and body are not distinct dualistically separated entities
but that in fact mental life is one of the expressions of our bodily life that indeed
what we call the mind and mental life is just the residual of a more ancient and even superstitious
and ignorant set of beliefs and that the more we find out about the brain brain physiology
neurochemistry and the like the less we will be talking about our mental life the less
we will regard mental life as distinguishable from corporeal or biological life and the
more we will appreciate that what we once thought were minds were actually brains in
operation well we'll examine all this in lectures to come those are the three great traditions
empiricism rationalism and materialism and they will be the subtexts and background ideas
for almost everything we find in contemporary psychology
