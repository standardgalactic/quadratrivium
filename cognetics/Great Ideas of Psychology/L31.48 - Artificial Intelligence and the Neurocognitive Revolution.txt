Lecture 31, Artificial Intelligence and a Neurocognitive Revolution
I want to press on with psychology in the materialist tradition, and I should say that
if there's a materialistic psychology that expresses itself with a kind of controlled
passion, it would be the psychology we associate with the field of artificial intelligence.
And let me explain what I mean by a materialism with a passion.
I'm not talking about the idea that we can put together devices that add up numbers faster
than we do.
That's been around for quite some time.
In fact, adding machines long before the age of computers could provide us with solutions
to arithmetic problems, both more accurate and arrived at more quickly than someone
can achieve sitting down with a pencil and a piece of paper.
No, I'm talking about what might be called the strong artificial intelligence thesis,
according to which machines in principle can do the sorts of things we do when we regard
ourselves as engaged in an intelligent form of behavior, and indeed an intelligent form
of life.
Not just a prodigious arithmetic performance, but something much closer to the mental life
actually lived by rational beings.
Now what makes this a materialistic psychology with a passion is this, suppose you could
achieve all this.
Well, of course, you know that an artificial intelligence device that's achieving all this
is a device.
Therefore, it's something just made up of material components.
And if something made up with material components can function in a manner indistinguishable
from the manner in which we function, then what argument would be left to suggest that
our functioning is anything different from what you get from a set of components behaving
in a certain way.
So this is a thesis worth one's attention, and indeed at a certain level, it is a philosophically
profound thesis.
Its roots are deep and the roots are branching.
In fact, it would take really a separate course of lectures to put together what has gone
on in the fields of engineering and mathematics and the like to yield the computational sciences
to yield computers themselves and computers that allegedly are engaged in rational or mental
or logical operations.
Probably one of the great impulses to research in this entire area was the Second World War
and particularly the need to develop modes of information transmission and reception
that could defeat the problems of a variety of languages being spoken, noise in the transmission
channels.
We needed a theory of information in order to quantify the performance of information
transmission systems.
Shannon and Weaver worked successfully to develop a theory of information which generated
the notion that all problems, no matter how complex, are reducible to a series of yes-no
or one-zero types of decisions, that the most basic decision context is the coin-flipping
one.
We now want a unit of information to express what is conveyed when it comes up either heads
or tails.
It turns out that the a priori probability of getting heads or tails, of course, is
.5.
Shannon and Weaver argued that when an event has a very, very high a priori probability,
when an event that's almost certain to happen happens, it doesn't inform us at all that
an event becomes ever more informative when its a priori probability is ever and ever
lower when we have a sort of, oh my goodness, I never would have dreamed that might have
happened.
Well, the coin-flipping situation then has an a priori probability of .5.
This would be the minimally informing event when heads comes up.
That's about as little a bit of information as you're likely to get.
Well, they put together a rough equation, not a rough equation, they put together a principled
equation where the information in an event is proportional to log base 2 of the reciprocal
of its a priori probability.
Now that's quite a mouthful, but let me just try to stretch it out for you.
If the minimum informing event is the coin-flipping event where heads or tails has an a priori
probability of .5, well now, log base 2 of 1 over .5 is log base 2 of 1 over .5 is log
base 2 of 2 and log base 2 of 2 is 1.
So the minimally informing event turns out on their notation to be the one-bit event,
the one binary digit and from that concept and that metric for information coupled with
developments in engineering science and computer science and the like, the ball was in play
and of course it's a game that's actively pursued now all over the world.
Well in addition to the information sciences, there were developments in the computational
sciences as well.
These very much supported by the war effort and made needful by the war effort.
One of these developments is based on code breaking that famously featured Alan Turing.
As many of you know, the German engineering experts had developed codes that came very,
very close to the ideal code, the ideal code is the unbreakable code.
It's the code that can only be decoded by one who is fully informed as to the workings
of the code itself.
One of their most famous productions was dubbed enigma and indeed it was as enigmatic
as you can imagine a code to be.
Alan Turing was one of these mathematical savants.
He was a person intended to live in the realm of numbers and in the realm of pure abstraction.
A man of certain eccentricities, a kind of transparent honesty and almost childlike honesty
and openness as a result of which he had a very troubled life.
He was a homosexual at a time in which this constituted grounds for being a social outcast.
His position within the academic and scientific world was constantly jeopardized by the possibility
of his homosexuality surfacing and becoming generally known.
He by the way, he took his own life at a tragically young age, a person whose career
in mathematics and in science could only be skyward in its trajectory.
Well Turing had much to do with breaking, in fact he had most to do with breaking the
enigma code, but he was developing ever more general heuristic and algorithmic approaches
to the solving of problems.
But indeed one of his great, great contributions was developing a general theory to determine
whether or not a problem is solvable.
And the general theory regards a problem as solvable when the problem is in principle
a computable problem.
So the question then becomes one of developing a technique to determine whether a given problem
is computable as it said today is Turing computable.
And you begin to see now how Turing will reflect on our own problem solving heuristics
to determine what it would be that a machine would have to do in order to establish whether
or not a problem is a solvable problem.
And once you try to do this very, very quickly you need devices that can scan the possible
computations very, very quickly and of course the computer is the device that does just
that.
And so we find Turing and company developing early versions of the computer and the early
versions of the computer are functioning in such a way to generate statements as to whether
or not a given problem is a computable problem, etc., etc.
Now Turing fully recognized the philosophical and psychological implications of his work.
He wrote a lengthy article in the Journal Mind which is an important journal in philosophy
in which he sketches out just what it is a device would have to do and an artificial
device would have to do, some kind of computer would have to do to qualify as intelligent.
That is on what basis would we ever satisfy ourselves that we were dealing with another
intelligent form of life.
Now let me recur to an earlier lecture in which I set forth the grounds on which Descartes
insisted that you would never be able to produce a machine that would be indistinguishable
from a rational being.
Remember that Descartes insisted there were three things such a device never would achieve.
It would never attain the idea of God and for a variety of reasons we won't address
that right now.
It would not be able to engage in genuinely abstract thought, abstract thought as contrasted
with thought about actual existing objects that you can point to and so forth, dealing
solely with abstractions and it would never engage creatively in language.
Now if you take Descartes' criteria you begin to see what it is that Turing is going to
require of an entity that will satisfy us that it is an intelligent entity.
First off it shouldn't matter what the thing looks like.
We do not regard our humanity as being fully and relevantly revealed merely in virtue of
the fact that we are bipeds or have hair on our heads or have an eye on each side of
the face.
These are physical characteristics but for goodness sake there are dummies in store windows
that have all of these characteristics and indeed you can generate cartoons and sketch
entities that look like this but nobody regards them as being human beings.
So it's not the physical appearance that's going to settle this.
Well Turing offers this as the right kind of test.
First behind curtains will be the candidate intelligent beings.
You will be able to look at them but you will be able to deliver questions to them.
You will take these to be the sorts of questions that would identify the respondent as relevantly
like yourself that is as relevantly intelligent.
Well if in fact the answers to the questions from what is behind each of those curtains
is relevantly similar to the answers provided by what is behind the other curtain and in
opening the other curtain you see that it's a fellow citizen then you really have no
grounds on which to reject whatever is behind yet the other curtain as a fellow citizen
which is to say any device that can pass this kind of test has passed the only test that
really counts namely the test the interrogatives we serve up to determine whether we're dealing
with fellow creatures.
So if I were to say Jerry do you think it's important to have a good breakfast in the
morning or did you get the same amount of sleep this week that you normally get or how
many miles do you think it is between New York City and Paris or what would you do in
the following situation and if time after time after time the answers I get back are
not invariably the same answer but they are generically similar to the answers that you
get from fellow intelligent human beings and now you open the curtain and find out that
what's behind the curtain as a computer on what grounds would you do deny at the status
of being intelligent intelligent in the relevant sense.
And so the view is then that what passes the Turing test passes the Turing test.
So something is successful as an artificial intelligence device.
It successfully passes the intelligence test when it passes this Turing test.
Well of course one of the things that we take great pride in is our ability to engage in
such a complex ventures as chess play and it shouldn't surprise anyone that the artificial
intelligence community very very early on attempted with success and increasing success
to put together programs that would allow a computational device to engage a chess player
and effectively engage chess player.
It was only about 15 years ago that chess playing programs became ranking chess players
which is to say the chess playing program was understood to be able to defeat let's
say all but the top 60 or 70 chess players in the UK.
Now critics at that point were inclined to say look the difference between being one
of the three or four top chess players in the UK and being the eighth best chess player
in the UK is a tremendous difference.
So for goodness sake don't take pride in having a program that weighs in at ranking number
50 you're still a million miles away.
Well then of course not too many years ago a program was put together that took on Kasparov.
Now this is not the 50th best player anywhere this is arguably one of the greatest living
chess players and of course the artificial intelligence community I think must have been
having all night parties after the first game when indeed Kasparov was found sort of reeling
and I think very very much taken by this performance.
Actually as the match went on the programs situation rapidly became hopeless and when
Kasparov was interviewed I think he was trying to be as gentle and genial as he could be
but he said that of course it did take a game to figure out what this thing was doing and
having figured out what this thing was doing that was just about it.
Now this is not to foreclose future possibilities by any means the question we're going to want
to ask at some point is suppose you developed a device that played chess as well as computational
devices now at the question would be two questions anyway first is it playing chess in the sense
in which chess is is play that that's a question that I will address in the course of this lecture
what does it mean for something to be playing chess and I don't mean to beg the question
by saying well it doesn't have a competitive desire or motive not not that sort of thing
but in fact is the is the software written for this is the program written for this capturing
just what is involved when masters play chess second I I would ask the question we should
ask the question whether chess playing which which itself involves a rather obvious quasi
computational strategic set of steps where each step has some predictable range of consequences
does this capture fully and realistically the situations in which as intelligent beings we find
ourselves and find ourselves having to muddle through which is to say is there any evidence to
suggest that the better you are as a chess player the better you are at the game of life and I
think the evidence there speaks for itself I could adduce as evidence and support of a skeptical
position no one less than Bobby Fisher I mean say what one will about about Bobby Fisher a great
great eccentric a great great chess player but I don't know that anyone would argue that Bobby
Fisher has succeeded preeminently and even what Bobby Fisher would call the game of life so so
it's not quite clear that the intelligence tapped by something like chess playing is the
intelligence that that indeed an AI system would have to be able to display in order to satisfy
the criteria that are indeed realistic criteria we might even ask in the Turing context whether it
means the same thing to pass a test as to take a test that is you might have a device that's
serving up the right sort of answers and at the same time not engaged in anything that that device
itself in any knowing sense would would recognize as taking a test when I get to John Searle's
Chinese room in the next lecture I will I will return to this to this general question now we do
know that that that we are not permitted to require that such machines look like us that after all is
simply an adventitious or fortuitous accidental feature of human intelligence namely that human
intelligence happens to be coming out of something that looks like us it happens to be tied to the
biochemistry and physiology of the brain I say the very program of artificial intelligence is built
on the proposition that you can get all the functions out without having precisely the same moving
parts or indeed any parts in common at all and there there is a thesis that stands behind that it
sometimes referred to as machine functionalism if you can get the machine functioning in a way
that is indistinguishable from intelligent kinds of functioning that's sufficient now AI's hard
program is indeed achieve the the agenda is satisfied so it's not necessary that the machine
look like us it doesn't have to sound like us it doesn't have to bleed if you stick it with a pin
but it does have to function the way we function which is to say it does have to turn in intelligent
solutions to problems we recognize as requiring intelligence now what what do we want to say
about chess playing and expert systems and the like as regards mimicking human intelligence
first a few words about expert systems one of the reasons one wants if one thinks one is ill
with a serious disorder one wants to consult a specialist is because one recognizes that
specialists will diagnose problems that might be overlooked by general practitioners and indeed
within the community of specialists some are recognized as such expert diagnosticians that
even other specialists will rely on their judgment this is exemplary of whole fields of human activity
that feature what is called expertise expert judgments in law expert judgments in medicine
architecture bridge building home construction and the like what is it that goes into expertise
and can this be mimicked now artificial in the artificial intelligence community has worked
hand in glove with specialists and professionals in a variety of fields to develop programs that
function like experts which is to say programs that as best as possible mimic or repeat or copy
the steps that leading experts go through and the experts are consulted and studied and interviewed
and examined their performances are very carefully quantized where possible you now put together
a general program that functions this way so that perhaps in a half century or two centuries or
for all we know in an hour and a half someone will come up with a general program that for example
provides expert judgments on cardiovascular disease constitutional law trade agreements
economic trends and forecasts and the like now what would one say if in fact such a general
program were available and indeed turned in a performance indistinguishable from what we get
from department heads at massachusetts general supreme court justices and the like again the AI
thesis the strong AI thesis is if you've got a device a program a powerful enough computer that
is functioning the way experts function then in fact you confer on it an expert intelligence
well my goodness here we have the possibility of machines not only doing what we do but doing
what we do at our very best and what nest of problems do we find lurking behind achievements
of this kind do I surprise you when I say that there are philosophy articles appearing all the
time in one place or another on the general question of for example whether such machines
would have rights now this might seem to be a frivolous question but it's a way of getting at
you see that the importance of a question like that is it allows you to see more deeply what the
artificial intelligence advocate might be getting at what what actually are the core assumptions
behind artificial intelligence one of the grounds on which we reserve rights to ourselves ask that
question for example American citizens 18 years old and older can vote in elections 14 year olds
cannot vote in elections two month olds cannot vote in elections now when we set a criterion an
age criterion for a certain civil right or civic right we do so on the basis of there being some
requisite degree of intelligence maturity perspective and the like so that the right can be properly
engaged and properly exercised well suppose you have a device that in touring fashion answers in an
intelligent way all sorts of questions about political processes the records of the two
candidates what's good for the community at large the kind of tax structure that would be fair
whether trickle down theory is the right sort of theory in and out now note I'm not talking about
some device that's programmed the way a tape recorder plays back an opera I'm talking about an
nth generation computer that indeed is a self programming device that as it were learns as a
result of its own programming outputs a very very flexible device now suppose that entity claimed
for itself certain immunities suppose for example it claimed an immunity against being destroyed
or being unplugged suppose it went further and in one of its outputs not entirely predictable from
the program that it began with it declared that it had all the competence necessary to cast a
vote could such a device be held responsible for example could it be held responsible for
passing along false information could it be charged with libelous utterances or slanderous
utterances could it be declared mentally unfit do you see it as possibly being institutionalized
which is different from being sent back to the shop for rewiring now we raise these questions in
order to gauge the sincerity and the reach of artificial intelligence talk artificial intelligence
promises and expectations the promises and expectations of the artificial intelligence
community let me give you the range of answers that one one gets without even naming the usual
suspects the usual suspects I think are fairly well known within philosophy of mind and neuro
cognitive science well of course the rather timid but I think ultimately defensible answer is
that's an empirical question let's just see where the work leads us to and you know all bets are
off as to how things might develop in this very quickly developing field the more interesting at
least to me the the more interesting members of the AI community are the ones who think that
that for all practical purposes the data are in that is artificial intelligence devices programs
of great great power and subtlety computers of extraordinary power now are on hand and and and
if they're not routinely defeating Kasparov they're they're going to routinely defeat the Kasparov
of the next century and that's as the expression goes you ain't seen nothing yet that is simply a
foretaste of what computer technology and computer science would have every reason to expect of
itself in the days ahead so that the answer to all these questions would be of course of course such
devices enter into finally enter into the political realities in which intelligent beings find
themselves the only thing such devices would be lacking is a biology that locates them within
the human community but understand that there are entities biologically human that indeed are
chronically vegetative or in such an advanced state of Alzheimer's disease or advanced senescence
there are post-stroke victims so destitute of rational intellectual power that it is based
on sentiment and love and solicitude and family feeling that we continue to include such beings
as much as possible in our own lives but we recognize that they are not entering into any
recognizably human form of life themselves so the AI specialist would say not heartlessly well look
we've already got devices and calling them devices is more or less to beg the question there are
already entities in place that respond with such originality such intellectual creativity such
problem-solving power as already to be superior to some specimens which are otherwise and biologically
human and therefore the grounds on which to deny them the status of intelligent beings
are merely prejudicial grounds grounds of vanity now that's that is a wonderfully strong thesis and
i think it's it's one that keeps us all honest particularly those of us who think that that this
entire idea is wayward and based on profound mistakes which will be the subject of of the
the next lecture now let me get back to today karts race cogitons for a moment again leaving
out the question of whether a properly programmed computer will ever attain to the idea of god
and also the question of of whether it engages in in abstract thought or thought of or thought of
any kind let me ask the question of whether a computational device like this can be said to
be engaged in something linguistic linguistic in Descartes sense of the creative use of language
and i offer this as as as a mild challenge which will become less mild in in the succeeding lecture
but in order for an entity to be engaged in something genuinely linguistic is for an entity to
be exchanging what might be called meaning symbols which is to say that to be engaged in a linguistic
activity is already to be in possession of various patterns of meaning and the question then would
be what the origin of this meaning is where does meaning come from is there anything in the interstices
of a device anything in an actual computer anything in diodes and transistors and printed circuits
constitutive of meaning qua meaning this will turn out to be a rather burning question
not only that we direct to the ai community but that we direct to each other when we understand
ourselves to be engaged not only in in a linguistic enterprise but a linguistic enterprise that has
truth as one of its objectives how do we arrive at notions of truth what is our language all about
where do the meanings come from and indeed when all is said and done are we finally dealing with
phenomena that are so inextricably cultural in nature that absent are developed and indeed absent
a developed idea of culture these very notions become simply unintelligible that's a matter for
another day the strong artificial intelligence thesis gives us a materialistic psychology very
much worth wrestling with and if you don't have at least one sleepless night over these possibilities
then i've been less than clear thank you
