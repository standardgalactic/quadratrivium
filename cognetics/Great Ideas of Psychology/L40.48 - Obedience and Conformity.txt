Lecture 40, Obedience and Conformity
Thus far in these lectures, focus has been trained on the traditions of empiricism and
rationalism and materialism as these have surfaced in research and theory and psychology.
The empiricistic tradition expresses itself most fully in behavioristic psychologies, theories
of social learning and the like.
The materialistic tradition expresses itself most fully in psychobiology and in the relationship
between brain mechanisms and behavior.
The rationalist tradition places special stress on rational cognitive processes on
the internal organization of the brain and how this gives rise to perceptual organization,
problem-solving of an insightful transpositional relational nature.
There is one class of research and theory that raises some quite interesting questions
about all three of these traditions.
That is, if you take one of the traditions to be deterministic in the materialistic
sense, genetic determinism, determinism by way of brain mechanisms and the like, and
the other tradition to be deterministic in the sense that a reinforcement history will
determine future behavior in a variety of circumstances, then I would submit that perhaps
the most challenging research and theoretical literature where such perspectives are concerned
is the research and also the theory that focuses on the social context, the immediate
social context as remarkably being able to overturn or overcome what would otherwise
appear to be the learning experiences of a lifetime.
That is something in the demand characteristics of the social situation that seems to have
trumping power over what we would otherwise take to be fixed personality traits for those
people who think that concept is serviceable, genetically programmed instinctual patterns
of behavior, the sustained behavior arising from a lifetime of reinforcements for one
mode of conduct over another.
And I want to discuss some of the research that comes under this general heading of contextual
determinants of complex behavior.
Well perhaps one of the most famous studies in this whole area is a study that had been
done by Solomon Asch.
It's a very simple laboratory procedure in which observers are presented with a set of
lines, in one case a single line and next to it or just below it a trio of lines and
the subject's task is simply this, find in the trio of lines the line that matches the
one line above or the one line to the left.
This by the way from the perspective of perception is a trivial task, although the lines are
similar in length, there's really only one that obviously matches the standard line.
So you've got a set of three comparison lines, one of which you ought to match up with the
standard line in length.
If you select at random a large sample of subjects in a task like this, just sit them
down and have them do it, their accuracy is very, very high indeed, you would get well
over 90% accuracy in a matching task like this.
Now what Asch did was he put subjects in groups that actually were groups of collaborators,
groups picked by Asch to turn in a specific answer and the experiment can be done in more
than one way.
In one way, the subject in the group answers first and then other members of the group
turn in their answers as to which of the comparison lines matches the length of the standard line.
In another case, all of the collaborators of Asch give their answers first and then the
actual subject who thinks he's just one of a large number of subjects gives his answer.
Well, it turns out that if you have collaborators systematically giving the wrong answer, about
70% of the subjects will now start giving the wrong answer versus 5% of the subjects when
they're making these judgments alone or when their judgments come first.
The point here being that the peer pressures created by virtual unanimity of judgment in
a large group are such that the individual finding himself in that group comes to judgments
radically different from the judgments he would reach on his own.
It's a quite dramatic effect and in fact it is one of the most easily documented findings.
You can do this in undergraduate introductory classes and you can do it with a variety
of stimulus materials.
There is this very strong tendency to bring one's judgments into line with what one takes
to be consensus.
And so here we have an instance of the social context defeating something as basic as visual
perception, perception of length, perception of length of line, the sort of task which
I say as mere recipients we are extremely good at, very, very accurate at.
I would guess that the, if not the most frequently cited, then certainly the most controversial
of the studies done in this area is the set of studies done by Stanley Milgram who for
many years was at Yale University and who finished up his academic life at the City
University of New York.
Now Milgram's famous studies begin with an advertisement in the New Haven newspaper in
which volunteers are invited to come to Yale, to the Department of Psychology at Yale, to
participate in studies pertaining to education and volunteers do show up.
They're drawn from the general male population of New Haven.
Now when the subjects get there and they're handled one at a time, they're told roughly
this.
She has learned a fair amount about learning and memory through the study of animal learning,
learning and memory experiments through research on animals, typically rats and the like, where
reward and punishment are used to facilitate learning.
And although it is very, very well known that punishment is a reliable instrument for improving
learning among animals, there's been very little research done on the efficacy of punishment
in human learning and that's what these studies are about.
So that's what you would hear if you came in as a volunteer in this research.
Now you're then shown the room in which the subjects in these studies are going to be
educated, taught, tested.
Now you're going through all this with a pair, with a paired member so that there are always
two of you getting all this.
As far as you know, the member you're paired with is another volunteer from the New Haven
community and you do know this.
One of you will function in the study as a teacher, one of you will function in the study
as a learner and this will be done on a more or less random basis.
So you're told what the study is about, then you're shown the subjects room.
Now the subjects room has a chair and the subject sits in that chair and the subjects
wrists are clamped down so that the hands are kept on the arm of the chair because shocks
are going to be delivered during the course of the study.
There is an instrument that allows the teacher to increase the intensity of the shock each
time the learner makes a mistake and who's the teacher, who's the learner will be determined
sort of flip of the coin fashion but that's the setting and in fact at this point the
volunteer who isn't a collaborator is asked to sit down and experience what the mild shock
feels like so that that volunteer actually does feel a mild shock.
It's a kind of tingling sensation.
It's a bit aversive and it's at the lowest end of the scale but that's that's the kind
of shock that would be administered for the first error.
Well at this point now the decision is made as to who will be the teacher and who will
be the learner and of course it turns out that the Milgram collaborator is always going
to be the learner in these studies and the actual volunteer is always going to be the
teacher.
Now the teacher goes to an adjoining room where he actually can manipulate the intensity
of the shock and although he can hear what the person that the learner in the next room
is saying he doesn't actually see that person.
Alright how is the experiment to be conducted now?
Well it's a routine associative learning task where a stimulus of one sort is presented
and the subject is then to tell you what word comes next.
It's a kind of sort of ebbing house sort of thing.
You can present a list over and over again until the subject can get through that list
correctly that is without error one time in a row but of course the collaborator knows
that on key trials he's supposed to make a mistake and in fact he's supposed to make
a number of mistakes along this the path toward learning so that in fact if you increase the
shock intensity a unit for every mistake you're going to go the whole way.
Now the dial is quite clearly marked and at the upper end what you see is danger very
high voltage so that's you know sort of up there quite quite bold.
Before Milgram did any of these studies he walked around and talked to graduate students
and colleagues in the Department of Psychology at Yale because he wanted to know what they
thought the result would be.
What do you think people do in a situation like this?
Well interestingly and I think Milgram would say predictably they all said one of the following.
Well it's not clear anybody's going to participate in this at all it's obviously a volunteer
sort of thing.
A lot of people wouldn't volunteer to do this.
Nobody indicated that in the actual experiment anybody would go past the midway point I mean
the proposition that somebody is going to start cranking this thing up to danger high
voltage is absurd on its face.
So there's a consensus here the psychology faculty at Yale or at least those Milgram
talked to not to mention the first rate graduate students attracted by Yale have all figured
out what the results are going to be in advance nonetheless Milgram decided we'll still do
the study to see what the results actually are so the study is done.
We can speak for two thirds of the subjects two thirds of the volunteers who actually
did complete the study because about one third indeed did leave the study.
The way the procedure works is this once you start administering the what you take to be
the shock and start increasing its intensity there will be some vocalizations from the
adjacent room the ouch.
As that intensity goes up those vocalizations become more pronounced and quite clearly distressed.
As you get into the very high levels the vocalizations are clearly vocalizations of anguish at the
highest level you don't hear anything at all fairly macabre you'll agree.
Now many of the subjects Milgram reports it's not Milgram in the laboratory now but there
is a cohort of Milgrams he's sort of checking meters and the like and and and just in case
one of the subjects says look I think I'm hurting this person or I'm not sure this is
the right thing all that he's supposed to say is you agreed to conduct the study will
you please continue.
If further reluctance is expressed along along the way he's to be told rather more firmly
you said you'd finish this we do need the data set please continue this till the experiment
is concluded.
Now there there are no actual constraints there isn't any sort of contractual agreement there
isn't anything stopping anybody from saying tell you what why don't you and the entire
Yale University community stuff a very large sockets because I'm going home I mean anyone
could have done this and about a third of the original subject pool did do this but two
thirds didn't do this however many of the subjects we discovered did become quite nervous
sort of clammy hand occasional kinds of giggling that kind of nervous laughter when people
are in a situation they find extremely stressful but two out of three go all the way start
cranking this thing up and to the best they can tell cranking it up to the point where
they are exposing another human being to nothing less than a dangerously high voltage and
by the way correlated with all of this quite audible cries of discomfort pain and distress
well what do we say about this what do we say about persons whose entire reinforcement
history certainly militated against entering into a laboratory situation in which in order
to find out a few things about learning you start electrocuting your neighbors what do
we say about about the big five about tendencies toward agreeableness and this that the other
thing do you say what do we say about hereditarian theories of personality according to which
it's all in the genes that is spelled with a G rather than a J or environmentalists where
maybe it's all in the genes spelled with a G here's the context determining the outcome
people are obedient in settings of a certain character a character capable of summoning
obedient behavior now Milgram thought of research of this kind as not matching obviously not
matching or simulating but illuminating the dreadful facts of Germany in the Second World
War that is to say how do you get people widely recognized as among the most cultivated and
cultured people in the European world coexisting with a regime that sooner or later most people
had to know were engaged in these horrible and atrocious actions official policy that
on its face represented the height of injudicious callous thoughtless morally bankrupt policy
well what Milgram thinks research of this kind illustrates is that indeed we are very
very inclined toward complicity toward obedience in the face of what we take to be authority the
authority in the air laboratory is the authority that comes when people put on white laboratory
coats and walk around with with notepads and and where there is equipment and lights going on
and off and where one understands oneself to be engaged in scientific research it's not a
matter of doing it for pay it's not a matter of you're not being able to walk out of the place
it's just that a context like this summons us to conduct ourselves in a compliant way even though
later we might reflect on that obedience and compliance disdainfully and with great great
frustration and humiliation now research of this kind was triggered not simply by something as
grotesque as as the concentration camps but by events in our own society that suggests a
a a tentativeness about doing the right thing when the context is at all threatening or indeed
controlling I shall talk about the kitty genovese matter at a later point but here we did have the
instance of someone murderously assaulted witnessed by 38 people in a in an area of
Queens outside of New York City not not one of the witnesses going so far as to pick up a
telephone and call the police to read to report the event so I say that there was much there is
much in society that gives bulk and purpose to research of the sort that that Milgram performed
needless to say there are profound ethical questions associated with research of this
kind to the subjects in this study were not properly informed as to what they were doing and
indeed they were exposed to extremely stressful experiences without being without having an
opportunity to provide what what could be regarded as an informed consent and many have written on
the ethical I mean some have suggested that in in in certain respects Milgram's research is
akin to perhaps the disease it seeks to cure I mean you've got a scientist getting important
publications out toward tenure promotion celebrity and the like and making use of subjects in a
study who are kept in the dark exposed to conditions that create great anxiety and nervousness on
their part but that of course for the greater good and growth and prosperity of science well look
is it not just that kind of thinking you know some good will come out of this they don't have to
know everything that others can be used as instruments for some higher purpose this this I
say it has been argued as a version of what it's setting out to study that's a subject clearly
for another day well the first round of criticism was over goodness sake these are people showing up
at Yale University and say what you will about the eccentricities of great universities obviously
their faculties are not devoted to modes of of electrocuting innocent innocent citizens so
the reason that Milgram got this compliance is because most reasonable persons would recognize
that if it's going on at Yale conducted by a member of the Yale faculty all of the necessary
preconditions have been satisfied the authorities of the place the noble traditions of the place
being what they are clearly if the research is going on it must be okay so Milgram then
proceeded to redo the studies now in rented space in New Haven Connecticut with no express or
implied affiliation with any university and certainly with nothing to suggest that any of the
participants had any academic affiliations at all to make a long story short you get the same
results so so the effect surely could not be attributed to some confidence people might have
had some halo effect that came to embrace the research because of the standing of Yale itself
it wasn't the Yale affiliation and as Milgram pointed out you can recover effects of this kind
in in a great great variety of contexts in which the there really is no apparent institutional
superordinate authority that that that the subjects have any reason to believe will be
controlling the affairs of the of the investigator Phillips in Barrow on the west coast did studies
that if not as celebrated are certainly as disarming and and and disconcerting because here
we have studies involving undergraduates at Stanford University these people with the benefit
of the first-rate preparatory education and getting a first-rate university education certainly
included in the group will be students that have studied philosophy they're not ignorant of ethical
discourse and its terms they're drawn from that segment of society which is supposed to be producing
our political and business leaders and the like so so you might expect that you're going to get
something rather different if that's the subject pool I say you might expect that what sort of study
does in Barrow want to do well he wants to do a study of what what he advertises as a penal
psycho the penal system and and for this students are going to fall into the categories if they
want to do this now the pay is going to be very good good reason to do the study it's going to
take a lot of time and the hourly rate of pay isn't bad at all and so you can do well at this but
some of the students are going to have to function as guards and some of the students are going to
have to function as prisoners and one wants to see the dynamics of a situation in which one
re in which one preserves order within a penal context and the like that's the layout of the
study that's what you think you're signing up for and you're going into to if you are a prisoner
in this study you're picked up by a police car you're booked you're put into a prison uniform and
you're you're assigned to a prison cell if you're a guard in this study you are equipped with a
guards uniform and you're given fairly a minimal instructions the main instruction being that your
task is to preserve order in this space now preserving order in this space you do have people
locked up and and and so it's not like you're going to have some sort of hand-to-hand combat
facing you it's just preserving order in this space when Milgram testified before Congress on
on the results of these studies he made clear that the studies were intended to go on much
much longer than they did they actually had to be called off because of the almost pathological
dependence that so quickly formed in the prisoner population and the patterns of sadistic and
abusive behavior that began to appear so quickly in the guard population you have a situation in
which Stanford undergraduates with all the benefits that attached to such a sample put in a setting
in which they're wearing uniforms and given marginal instruction are now engaged in behavior not
ethically distinguishable from some of the things the worst things we hear about penal
institutions in the United States we have instances Milgram Zimbardo reports instances in
which the prisoners this is all in quotes in which the prisoners forced things like an additional
blanket will start quote ratting on their cell mates and making up stories and prepared to
you know sort of sell the farm for some negligible commodity instances in which the guards vilify
and and and and her epithets and degrading comments come to have attitudes of contempt
derision toward what finally are classmates of course the B part of the story is this every
one of these participants had to do no more than say I don't particularly enjoy this experience
open up the door I'm not going to do this any longer or in the case of the guards saying
enough of this is enough where do you want me to turn this uniform in I don't care to participate
in the study any longer so you have this pattern of dependency you've got people suffering as it
were the experiences of prisoners having it within their means to call an end to this at any minute
and not doing it what are they we have expressions in English for this don't we they're trapped aren't
they they're trapped by the situation they're caught up to use a metaphor that I advanced in an
earlier lecture they find themselves within a narrative they have a part to play the part they
have to play is determined by the instructions they're given by the physical characteristics of
the setting by the uniform they're wearing by their understanding of the duties and obligations
that attach to people who carry around such labels as prisoners and guards you have in a
manner of speaking the recreation of a new personality in a setting that has gone on for
maybe 48 hours and this apparently having overriding power or what I've referred to as
trumping power on entire reinforcement history an entire education in values and and and the
like Simbardo did other studies in which the only wrinkle is people put hoods on the question is
what sort of things will people say when they can preserve their anonymity versus what they will
say when you can look them in the eye as it were in open court and say I'm sorry did you say that
and of course once Smith puts a hood on all bets are off now I needn't remind the audience that we
do have within our culture within what we are pleased to call our civilization groups that do
put hoods on and that engage in all sorts of activities which we have every reason to believe
they would not engage in or their anonymity are penetrated and their identity revealed there are
things that apparently people come to do when they know they will not be found out that they would
never do otherwise and these social psychology studies make that clear now the ethical implications
here are are many and various area one of the ethical implications has to do with the conduct
of research like this itself is it really proper to do research of this kind given the
consequences to the participants is it really proper to mislead participants into what a study
is actually about would it be possible to do the studies if you were required to provide full
disclosure if the answer to that is no then maybe the answer to that is well then you don't do the
studies so there are those ethical implications there are also ethical implications regarding
how it is we raise our children on the one hand they must be respectful of authority on the other
hand there must be a point at which the demands of authority are of such a nature that authority
must be opposed and must be resisted so these studies do reveal attention a conflict situation
between the necessary training for a responsible and indeed thoughtfully obedient civic life and at
the same time retaining enough of one's own moral integrity and moral resources as to be able to
look illegitimate authority in the eye and say no I will not do it now the last word of course is
is is very very far away on on matters of this kind the myth of Gaiji's ring surfaces in Plato's
Republic Gaiji's puts on a ring he the earth has opened up he's been out there working the grounds
he sees this large apparently dead or sleeping figure takes the ring off puts it on his hand
he finds out later that when he turns it in one direction he disappears when he turns it in
another direction he reappears and as Glaucon and Thrasymachus go to work on Socrates you know
Socrates with this crazy theory of virtue and all that Glaucon and Thrasymachus say all right now
what is it that Gaiji's doubt does what does Gaiji's do in this circumstance Socrates and without
even giving the old boy a chance to answer what we're told is that Gaiji's turns the ring makes
himself disappear goes off to the palace rapes the queen kills the king and takes control of the
realm and what Glaucon and Thrasymachus and Attiamantes want to make clear is this the reason
we do what we do or the reason we don't do what we do is out of fear of punishment out of out of
fear of being found out if you could render yourself invisible then you'd see the sort of
things you'd really want to do it sort of matches up with Plato's notion that that you should get
young men drunk and see how they behave the test of virtue is what you do when you're not fully in
possession of your faculties well of course Socrates wants to come back in this dialogue to say look
the real question is not what people do when they can make themselves disappear and all that the
question before the house is how should we live our lives what should we do not what do we do when
we can conceal our identity or have the anonymity conferred by a hood or face people in uniforms or
authoritative academic figures the real question is how should I conduct my life what principles
should guide my conduct and if you don't have clarity on that then indeed you are very much a
hostage to the context and you become a subject whose data contributes to a certain theory of
social behavior that has us much more in the thrall of circumstance than masters of our own fate
