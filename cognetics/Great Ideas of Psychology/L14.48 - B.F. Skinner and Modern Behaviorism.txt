Lecture 14 B. F. Skinner and Modern Behaviorism
In the previous lecture, I noted that John B. Watson's behaviorism succeeded chiefly
at the level of polemic and that indeed you could not develop a behavioral science of the
required sort using no more than Pavlovian conditioning techniques. The greatest behaviorist
in the history of the movement surely was B. F. Skinner who died in 1990 and who spent most
of his academic life at Harvard with a hiatus at the University of Minnesota during the 1940s.
B. Skinner started out in life wanting to be a writer in much the same way that William James
started out wanting to be a painter and I gather that William James was never quite satisfied
that his talents were up to the task in painting and Skinner would tell us years later that he
wasn't quite sure he'd ever be able to earn a living as a writer. Well fortunately for psychology,
if not for literature, he decided to go into psychology. He was a student of the philosophy
of science as well as the basic sciences and we know that he was considerably influenced by the
writings of Ernst Mach and I shan't spend much time on Mach. He was one of the great physicists
of the second half of the 19th century University of Vienna. You know when airplanes fly at multiples
of the speed of sound they fly at Mach numbers well that's the same Ernst Mach but Mach in
addition to being an accomplished physicist wrote influential in philosophy of science
and it was part of Mach's program and in this he was joined by any number of important figures
in the community of science. It was very much part of Mach's program to get philosophy and
metaphysics out of science. Science on Mach's account concerns itself with the observable world
and with a systematic treatment of what is observed in the external world. In fact famously
when addressing the question of what a scientific law is, Mach would write that a law is but a
systematic description of experience. So for Mach the grounding of every science is at the level
of observation and measurement. This of course mightily influenced not only B. F. Skinner but
an entire generation of scientists early in the in the 20th century. Skinner was committed to what
he repeatedly referred to as a descriptive science of behavior that is a non-theoretical
science of behavior something much more akin to a form of engineering than to a form of theoretical
physics. How to build behavior into a system and how to be able to predict and control that behavior
once you once you get it in there. The first development of Skinner's thought to reach the
public was in a 1938 book called behavior of organisms. It became something of a bible for
generations of behaviorists who who would refer to it as the B of O and of course the
enemies of behaviorism would often refer to it as just B O. But behavior of organisms was at once
a method of investigation, an argument for what the subject matter of psychology should be, a
statement as to what constitutes reliable data within a field like psychology and perhaps most
important of all in the final couple of chapters something of a declaration of independence
that is a declaration to the effect that a scientific psychology based on observable behavior
does not have to tie itself to physiology or chemistry or any other subject. It can prosecute
its own agenda thank you very much and it can do so with tools ready to hand. So this was a rallying
cry for for any number of psychologists at the time. Psychology even before Wundt was always
seeking scientific status and always seeking to define itself in ways that would allow one to
distinguish between it and medicine, it and physiology, it and ethology and here comes Skinner's
behavior of organisms and it's just up to the task. Now what about this dependence, this historic
dependence between psychology and physiology? Recall that Wundt wrote a physiological psychology.
Throughout the 19th century the people we would we would identify as as influential in the history
of psychology were inevitably tying psychological processes to brain processes very much as is
done today such that a developed and scientific psychology would essentially be a kind of functional
neuroanatomy how different events in different places in the brain give rise to thoughts or
dreams or emotions or or associations learning memory and the like. Now when Skinner gets to
this very question what is the nature of the relationship between a scientific psychology
and physiology he says well perhaps none in any case it isn't something a psychologist has to
worry about. The facts of behavior will survive any theoretical construction we impose on them.
He says from the perspective of a behavioral scientist who has studied the conditions that
establish behavior and maintain behavior and these are conditions in the environment from the
perspective of a behavioral scientist if you then were to open the zipper of the animal and look
inside and find that there was nothing inside at all you would still have the facts of behavior
do you see you would still know the relationship between events in the environment and systematic
alterations in the behavior of organisms nothing is added to that information by finding out that
there are nerves and blood vessels and the like and nothing would detract from those findings
just in case improbably and to our great surprise there wasn't anything inside at all this came
to be known then this species of behaviorism came to be known in both a positive and a negative
connotation as the psychology quote of the empty organism you'll sometimes hear behaviorism referred
to as the psychology of the empty organism that is not something that would have troubled Skinner
or any of his students and disciples whatever of course from the point of view of a descriptive
science of behavior you have a right to assume that the organism is empty what's added by
discovering that the organism is full or filled or filled out so here was the the declaration of
of independence this is not to say that psychologists have no business being interested in physiology
but it certainly is to say that you can develop a scientific behaviorism without waiting for the
physiologist to solve their problems you don't have to wait until we know everything about the brain
in order to figure out just what it is that determines the course of behavior that's a
separate subject amenable to experimental investigation and something that can be
conducted by psychologists without they're looking over their shoulder to see what the
people with the electrodes and scalpels are doing now a purely descriptive science of behavior is
is a science of behavior that has to be extremely lean in its terminology it can't make use of
theory terms as if they had some actual ontological standing so problems of definition have to be
solved for this discipline to get going what has to be avoided are mentalistic terms what have to
what must be avoided are those terms that presuppose an independent private mental life
that only the introspecting subject has access to and which you only find out about because that
subject tells you this is what has to be shunned and to shun this one adopts what are sometimes
called operational definitions that is you define your chief terms by reference to the actual
operations or methods you would use to realize or produce whatever it is that term is referring to
now let's take a motivational term hunger in casual discourse the way you explain why an animal
or anybody else is going over to the counter and ordering up something and scrawling it down is oh
well they must be hungry now of course when you say they must be hungry you're referring to some
internal state something that only they could know about for sure it's quite private you can't see
hunger or anything about it and this then turns out to be some sort of a theory term it's a kind
of murky mentalistic term well suppose you do want to study the relationship between
consumatory behavior like eating or drinking and and what hunger no you're going to study this
in relation to some other observable what would the other observable be ah by hunger i mean
hours of food deprivation now the interesting thing about defining hunger that way or even
eliminating the term entirely is from laboratory to laboratory nation to nation year to year hours
of food deprivation are hours of food deprivation whether the animal is in vladivostok or philadelphia
30 hours of food deprivation is 30 hours of food deprivation you don't have to ask whether the
animals are now equally hungry if you wanted to know whether animals were equally anything
you would look for an equality in their behavior again it's all out there not inside
skinner would constantly emphasize the claim and try to turn it into a fact and often with great
success that the determinants of behavior are to be found outside the organism not inside the
organism behavior is a response to events in the environment what an organism has to do is survive
in a real physical world it does this by behaving in response to the challenges presented by that
world a descriptive science of behavior doesn't have to address itself to what's going on inside
while all this is going on it simply has to record with accuracy and precision the relationship
between the environment and the behavior that is engaged by that environment fine operational
definitions are helpful in that they allow you to establish comparable laboratory procedures from
one laboratory to another and they also allow you to understand the meaning of terms as these are
used by different investigators so as long as investigators are reporting that animals have
been kept away from food or drink for 24 hours or 48 hours we don't have to raise questions about
how hungry does a mouse get after six o'clock at night or how much relief is there in that hunger
when when the mouse has breakfast etc etc etc operational definitions now of course some of
this would take on ludicrous proportions i mean you really did have to be one over to the ism to
stay with this all the way there were there were studies in the 1950s of the emotion of love in
which love was defined as the total number of hours out of a given 24-hour period that one was
physically proximate to the object of love and of course critics would point out that that
can only mean that prisoners and guards are desperately in love with each other because
they're constantly in each other's company not to mention the fact that that one very often finds
oneself associating with others in a purely habitual way everyone i should think hearing
this lecture would agree that if the question is a question about the authenticity and intensity
and abiding nature of love that any attempt to establish this by taking out a watch is likely
to disappoint all concerned and indeed probably offended least one of them nonetheless a descriptive
science is a descriptive science you don't use terms that that that resist description at the
level of public observation that's how it goes now in 1938 i don't think the world was quite
ready for scinarian behaviorism in fact the book almost went out of print we find skinner's
influence picking up in 1950 in fact the influence of scinarian behaviorism picks up chiefly as a
result of a of a book written by fred keller and w n schoenfeld principles of psychology book the
two of them were professors at colombia university fred keller had been bf skinner's roommate and
one of skinner's closest friends over the course of both of their very very long lifetimes fred
keller died i think in 1993 or four bf skinner died in 1990 and skinner's autobiography his three
volume autobiography fred keller has cited often well keller and schoenfeld decided both of them
committed behaviorists decided that the way to put behaviorism on the map is to arrange an entire
psychology curriculum around principles of behavior around behavioristic psychology and so
what they did at colombia in this book and in the curriculum was feature the usual courses in
psychology on perception and emotion and learning and memory but all of it cast in behavioristic
terms and all of these terms operationally defined and translatable into actual laboratory
manipulations now i don't want to say that keller and schoenfeld's book created or wedded
appetites for behaviors and what i do want to say is this it's a it's an interesting piece of
intellectual history 1938 comes along skinner serves up a book that in most of its major projections
does everything the keller and schoenfeld book does no takers 1950 keller and schoenfeld put
together this program at colombia and a book that goes with it and we now find copies of skinner's
behavior of organisms uh increasing in in popularity and found here and there and used in courses and
and all the books that skinner will write thereafter gobbled up almost immediately so the trivial
pursuits question is can anyone think of something that might have happened between 1938 say in 1950
that might have something to do with this uh popularity well i i might mention in passing
that there was one little historical event that took place during that interval i believe it's
called world war two now why would world war two have much to do with this
well the right side the virtuous side in world war two the allied powers as we say
stood for an egalitarian democratic form of life everybody gets a turn at the bat nobody
is any better than anybody else if you set the conditions up right give everybody an equal start
they will make something of their lives and who are we fighting we're fighting the blue meanies
who have attached themselves to nativistic instinctual theories of types the whole thing is
predetermined we want pure arian characters going around everyone should be blonde blue
etc etc etc the tension seemed very much to be a tension between that radically environmentalistic
hopeful progressive yes american way of doing things i i'm obviously i'm i'm i'm mimicking
some of the propaganda of the period which was effective to the extent that it also reached
certain deep truths at the same time time a progressive optimistic environmentalistic
hopeful the world is our oyster if you get the manipulations right you can engineer the kind
of society that anybody would want to live in versus this ancient gray gluing pre-formistic
deterministic typological psychology there are these types and those types of never the twain
well i should say that thanks in part to nazi propaganda by 1945 no one was in the mood for
instinct theories of psychology or genetic theories of psychology the right psychology is the right
minded psychology and that is an environmentalistic and optimistic psychology not tied to ancient
theories and ancient prejudices i don't want to harp on this i simply want to note that major
developments in the sciences taking psychology to be one of the sciences but but but in physics and
chemistry and biology cannot be understood entirely independently of the larger cultural
and social forces operating at a given time whether it's cavernic anism or the Ptolemaic
view of the universe or Newtonianism or the witch hunts or genetic psychology yay or nay
it is the culture that finally decides what it will focus on what it will approve of what it
will seek to limit and behaviorism came along at the right time certainly in our own national
history with the right kind of message skinner and and and his version of behaviorism surely
were beneficiaries of of that otherwise macabre and destructive event
well what's involved in skinner's behaviors and first off picking up with with studies that
had been done at the very end of the 19th century by thawndyke studies of cats inside cages with
little loops hanging down if the cat puts a paw through the loop and pulls on it the cage opens
up and the cat can run out and get a piece of fish and from studies of this kind thawndyke was
able to publish the first animal learning curves he he plots the amount of time it takes the cat
to get out of the cage as a function of the number of trials presents all this in a book called
animal intelligence which came out in 1898 and argues that this is a model of all behavior
behavior is determined by its consequences that behavior which gives rise this is thawndyke's
language now highly mentalistic language that behavior which gives rise to a satisfying state
of affairs tends to be repeated that behavior that gives rise to an unpleasant or painful
state of affairs tends never to be repeated and he refers to this as a law that covers
all behavior and he calls it the law of effect behavior is determined by its effects do you say
well this was all quite interesting skinner says thawndyke had the right idea in that he was looking
at the right kind of behavior he was looking at the behavior an animal uses to get through the
world and to secure what's necessary for survival that's what psychology should be studying not the
Pavlovian kind not with a dog locked in a frame powdered food in the mouth and saliva measured
what what does this represent do you see this this has nothing to do with that lush Darwinian
context in which creatures have to adapt themselves to the demand characteristics of the situation
no no in that later on the behavior that counts is musculoskeletal behavior so the behavior mediated
by the striate muscles the moving the grasping the running the reaching do you say so thawndyke
got the right kind of behavior problem of course is the laboratory setup is weird you know anyone
who's who's spent time in the company of cats knows that thawndyke probably picked the wrong
species and he certainly picked a hopeless form of behavior you could have kept a cat some cats
our dear Phoebe for many many years i can assure you you could keep her away from food for 48 hours
put her in a box with a fish outside she would size up i should think what you expected her to do
as she would proceed to nap so and then you've also got thawndyke running around the room trying
to catch the cat and like skin it doesn't want any of that what he develops for his own phd dissertation
and then refines over a course of years is the now famous skinner box first thing you want to do
is limit behavior so put the animal in an enclosure that is relatively confining you also want to limit
responses to those that are readily measured and quantified so you've got a little lever now
sticking out inside the of the box and there's the rat in the box the animal of choice is the white
rat i should point out that you only find this animal in psychology laboratory we the behaviorism
gave us the fullest description of the behavior of an organism you're likely to find only in
behavioral psychology departments um but but that's enough that's a story for another day
of course what a what a rat does inside a box is generally not what rats are doing at warps running
up ropes etc but i say that that that really is a another matter right there's the rat inside the
box has been deprived of food now what what what do you see the rat doing well he sort of sniffs
around the inside of the box trying to obviously trying to get out and like him here's this lever
sticking out now the animal may lean on it for balance or might sit on it and microswitch is
closed a little food magazine tray is turned and a pellet of food drops down into a little food well
just underneath the lever animal does some sort of a double take goes over to the food well lifts
up the pellet eats it and now you'll notice right away that there's a little less time spent sniffing
around the top corners of the cage and rather more time spent around that funny thing sticking out of
there generally within an hour you will have an animal pressing the bar in fact even leaning back
on the hornches and pressing away now this is the result of what skinner calls continuous
reinforcement that's where every bar press results in a reinforcer how about an operational
definition of a reinforcer do we want to use that tired old language that mentalistic language of
thawndike that something is reinforcing because it gives rise to a pleasurable state of affairs
does anybody know whether an animal whether a rat eating a pellet of food is in a pleasurable
state of affairs no skinner says here's an operational definition of a reinforcer a stimulus
is a reinforcer when it alters the probability of the behavior that produces it any stimulus that
significantly increases the likelihood of the behavior that brings it about is a positive
reinforcer and any behavior that significantly lowers the likelihood of of the behavior that
brings it about is a negative reinforcer so it's the animal's behavior that defines the
reinforcer it's not a psychologist trying to get into the mind of rodents it's the behavior itself
that determines whether something is rewarding or non rewarding better reinforcing or not
reinforcing well when skinner was out at minnesota and there was a war on and you couldn't get
government grants to play around with rats and pigeons and the like but he was working with
pigeons he tells us that they do eat very nearly their own weight in food young psychologists
can go broke trying to do studies like this so instead of delivering a a reinforcer per pack
skinner arranged to deliver a reinforcer for every other pack this would cut down the food costs by
50 percent of course what you discover when you do this is that the bird goes over to the key and now
goes well now you arrange the equipment so that you get a grain of food for every three packs
now this is an example of what's called partial reinforcement not every response is reinforced
but only some fraction of the responses this particular and generically these are referred to
as schedules of reinforcement this schedule of reinforcement would be designated fr3 a fixed
ratio three which is to say you get a reinforcer per three responses you now over a series of sessions
can stretch this out to you could have an fr20 an fr50 in fact you can add in a fixed interval
schedule so you not only have to get responses like that but within a particular window of time
and skinner was able to show that you can jack up response rates to unbelievable levels in fact
he had one pigeon whose pecking rate was made so fast that the bill actually started to burn
up you'd see smoke coming from the pigeons bill the most interesting of the schedules of reinforcement
turn out to be it turns out to be the variable ratio schedule and this will repay close attention
here's the situation the animal has started out on continuous reinforcement over two three four
five training sessions every response receives appellate you now build in a fixed ratio schedule
with a low fr value fr2 fr3 you have a couple of sessions like that and you start stretching out the
fr requirements so that the animal might have to emit 15 20 responses you now move to what is
a low variable ratio schedule now what that means is this let's say you move to a vr2 that means
over a long long run of trials every second response would receive a reinforcer but you
never know trial to trial which response will do you see that's determined randomly you now stretch
out the vr2 to a vr5 a vr10 a vr20 guess what happens virtually for the rest of that animal's
life you can disconnect the feeder put that animal in the test chamber and it will press the bar
odd infant item skinner refers to behavior shape that way you'll be interested in this
as gambling behavior he has a funny essay in which he talks about
blue haired ladies at slot machines in las vegas well what he wants to say about variable ratio
reinforcement is this that's the sort of schedule that will maintain stable rates of behavior
indefinitely since to use a mentalistic or introspective kind of language which a behaviorist
would condemn we can say this how does the animal or somebody at a slot machine know
when to stop pulling the lever the answer is never do you see it may pay off next time next
time next time because nothing in the acquisition of the behavior provides a cue as to what condition
must be satisfied for a reinforcer to be delivered if you take fixed ratio reinforcement you know this
every three gets it all right well now we disconnect the feeder and i go
whoops nothing happened nothing happened oh well i guess the game is over but suppose this has
now been converted into behavior shaped by variable ratio reinforcement well there's no telling
what what the contingency is that must be met in order for a reward to be given this is one of the
most powerful displays i think that behavioristic psychology was was able to produce the ability
to maintain behavior over long stretches of time in an animal that's virtually indefatigable in
responding notwithstanding the fact that a reinforcer has not been delivered for days or
weeks or even months this is a powerful illustration of how events in the environment
can impose extraordinary reliability on the behavior of organisms similarly avoidance conditioning
here's the paradigm animal is put in a box it has an electrified floor a light comes on
and 10 seconds after the light goes off the floor is electrified there's a little barrier
that the animal can jump over and and thereby get away from from the shock one or two trials
one or two of these trials maybe three of these trials you put the animal in the box and turn
the light on and he jumps over the barrier put him back in the box turn the light on he jumps
over the barrier and jumps over the barrier and will jump over the barrier till the day he dies
notwithstanding the fact that there have only been two maybe there was only one punishing stimulus
now again let's uh anthropomorphize for a minute what might the rat be saying the rat stands on
the floor a light comes on and 15 or 20 milliamps comes up through the pause and he's half a foot
off the ground next time the light comes on do you sit there and say gee i wonder if the
shock is going to come this time no no no you run and you keep doing it again a very powerful
illustration of how an event in the environment can get a controlling hold on behavior indefinitely
there are parents who can't figure out why an offspring ran away is there any physical
abuse in this family no do you do do you use corporal punishment no did you ever hit bill
oh look we had an argument once yeah i belted him but i'm it's the only time
do you see this is the classic example of avoidance conditioning you don't have to do it more than once
in order for the organism to behave in such a way as to avoid that environment
let's keep these things in mind
