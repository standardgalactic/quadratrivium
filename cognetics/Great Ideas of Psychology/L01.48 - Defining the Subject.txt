Section One, Foundations.
Lecture One, Defining the Subject.
This is the first of a series of lectures on the discipline of psychology, which was
ironically referred to by William James as that nasty little subject.
It's a subject of great variety and complexity, and even in the course of 48 lectures, it's
going to be very, very difficult to convey all of that richness, complexity and subtlety.
The right way to begin something like this, I guess, is to define the subject, but here
the standard texts are not particularly helpful.
Open up any one of them and what you're likely to discover is that psychology is the science
of behavior or a behavioral science.
It's the science of the mind and mental life.
As William James put it, the science of human and animal behavior, adaptive behavior and
the like.
These are standard stock textbook definitions which actually beg the question and don't answer
it, namely, what is it about psychology that is or could ever hope to be a science?
And indeed, what is it we have in mind when we refer to anybody of knowledge or systematic
study as scientific?
Most of us, I think, had our thinking corrupted on this subject very, very early on.
I recall in my own preparatory schooling that we were told what identifies something as
scientific as that it employs the scientific method.
And I must say, I probably spent about 25 years trying to find out just what that method
was.
There must be some method.
It was searched for high and low, but there didn't seem to be anything that united what
biologists do, to what chemists do, to what physicists do, to what theoretical physicists
and astrophysicists do, botanists, geneticists and the like.
A veritable riot of methods characterized these enterprises and yet all of them were
subsumed under the general heading, science.
Now, what obviously isn't enough to say, well, it's scientific if whoever is doing
it is wearing a white coat or it's scientific if whoever is doing it is careful in measuring
things.
If you go in to get a new pair of shoes, I guarantee you that the salesperson will use
a ruler and take precise measurements of the length of your foot.
We certainly wouldn't look down and thank this person for engaging in the noble pursuit
of science merely because there was an attempt at accuracy or precision.
Now, as with most of the issues that animate the House of Intellect, there are no final
answers to questions of the sort.
What is the signal characteristic of science?
What makes it different from everything else?
But historians and philosophers of science have devoted productive labor to this question
and have come up with some at least tentative positions on the subject that are worth considering.
One of the most influential, at least throughout most of the 1950s, one of the most influential
in its effects on psychology and the thinking of psychologists is a theory about science
that identifies science according to the nature of the explanations that it provides.
That is to say, an undertaking is taken to be a scientific undertaking when it can provide
what are called scientific explanations.
So now the question becomes not so much, is X a science, but does the activity X yield
a scientific explanation?
So we turn then to the issue of what it is that would make an explanation a scientific
explanation.
Now, I should think one of the leading writers and thinkers in this field, certainly through
the 1950s and early 60s, was the philosopher of science, Carl Hempel, very often identified
as the chief spokesman for or interpreter of what is sometimes and rather misleadingly
referred to as the nomological deductive model of scientific explanation.
Let me try to break that term down.
Hempel from the ancient Greek for the word law, which is namos, and what a nomological
deductive model of explanation is, is this.
You explain a phenomenon or an event of any kind by showing that it is an instance of
a universal law known to be true.
So let's take the standard example of someone dropping an object, taking a piece of chalk
and dropping it or dropping a shoe on the floor.
Here's an event now, and the question we ask is, how would you get a scientific explanation
of an event like that?
Now this is what the nomological deductive model of explanation argues for.
You explain an event like that by referring to Newton's universal law of gravitation.
The universal law of gravitation is this.
All objects, said Newton, he was quite young when he said this, by the way, all objects
attract each other with a force that's directly proportional to the product of their masses
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
Now if you take the shoe to be an object, and if you take planet earth to be an object,
each of them now has mass, and the shoe and planet earth will attract each other with
a force proportional to the product of the mass of the shoe times the mass of the earth,
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the shoe and the gravitational
center of the earth.
Now if that law is true, then the answer to the question, why did the shoe fall toward
the center of the earth, is, it had to.
That is, it did what it did, necessarily.
The right answer to the question then is not, things like shoes always fell when I dropped
them in the past, and therefore there's no exception, I dropped it this time and it fell.
Note, that's a generalization based on past experience, and that's not what the nomological
deductive model requires of a scientific explanation.
Not a generalization based on what happened in the past, but reference to a general or
universal law known to be true, such that this event had to happen the way it did, precisely
because this event is an instance of the class of events covered by the law.
Well now, if it really is the case that what renders an activity scientific is that it's
able to provide scientific explanations for the events it seeks to study, then of course
we seem doomed at the outset if we refer to psychology as a science, because the question
that naturally arises is, what universal law known to be true operates in the domain
of psychology?
Is there anything as unfailing in its influence as the universal law of gravitation when we
consider such things as human emotion, motivation, conscious states, life projects and plans,
infant-mother relationships, interpersonal influence, all the things that fill out the
panoply of psychological interests, concerns and studies.
There isn't a universal law to be found in the whole house.
And of course the same might be said with all due respects to other sciences.
The same can be said of biology, biochemistry, anatomy, physiology.
There are very very stable relationships that have been developed in these fields, but surely
nothing of the precision, reliability and unfailing nature of the laws in classical
physics.
Now Hempel of course quite understands that very very few scientific undertakings ever
culminated in a universal law of the reach and precision and reliability of the gravitation
law.
So Hempel made a distinction then between a full-fledged scientific explanation and
what he referred to as an explanation sketch.
Now the difference between a full-fledged scientific explanation and an explanation
sketch is just the difference between a universal law known to be true and a very reliable statistical
law.
In economics for example there is this frequent reference to the law of supply and demand.
Now the law of supply and demand is not on deviating the way the universal law of gravitation
is, but there is a quite systematic relationship between supply and demand.
So on the what might be called the Hempelian account or the Nomological Deductive account,
one can say that although economics does not have a universal law known to be true, there
are trends and tendencies that have been discovered by economists and these do allow reasonably
good predictions.
You don't have a full-fledged explanation in the Newtonian sense, but you've got a good
explanation sketch.
The question that arises then is how good a sketch is it?
Well the quality of the sketch increases as the reliability of the law increases.
The more reliable the general law, the statistical law, that is the greater your accuracy of
prediction, well the higher the quality of the sketch.
Now one requirement here of course is that the law has to be true and this for the obvious
reason that a false law explains nothing.
So now the question that surfaces is well for goodness sake how do you know that a universal
law is true?
And what would you be prepared to say just in case at some later time a law you took
to be universally true turned out to be not true?
And in fact the example I offered, the Newtonian law, the law of universal gravitation is one
of those.
Newton's laws are based on certain assumptions about the constancy of mass and the constancy
of momentum and the like which after Einstein we come to understand our assumptions no longer
warrant it so that in fact as an object approaches the velocity of light its mass increases,
its linear extent diminishes and therefore if the universal law of gravitation presupposes
that mass never changes at any velocity well at relativity velocities of course mass is
changing and the law would be wrong, not only that but the entire conception of reality
is quite different in an Einsteinian universe versus a Newtonian universe.
So I say suppose at some later time let's say after Einstein what you thought was a universal
law utterly true turns out to be not true.
Well read in a certain light what Hempel's philosophy of science would require you to
conclude is that all of the explanations you had offered on the basis of a law you now
know is not true were not simply wrong explanations but in fact they could not be scientific explanations
because a scientific explanation is based on a universal law known to be true.
This I submit is one problem with that model we would scarcely be inclined to say after
Einstein that whatever it was Newton was up to not only fail to take into account what
Einstein later discovered but therefore it wasn't scientific and I don't think Hempel
would want to make that argument either the argument instead would go something like this.
The Newtonian worldview is valid within a certain context the context of fair to midsize
objects are traveling at calculable velocities but it's only in the relatively rare context
of entities approaching the velocity of light that the nature of the game changes and that
you would have to make relativistic corrections so you wouldn't be dismissing Newton's achievement
from the pantheon of science you would say instead that the Newtonian worldview is bounded
by certain conditions that did that do obtain under ordinary circumstances but do not obtain
under those conditions that we refer to as relativistic or relativity conditions.
Now how does one set about to determine whether or not a law is true every time the Hempelian
model of explanation is offered it's not long before a student says well for goodness sake
what hubris what absolute arrogance how could you ever know that a law is true you might
always be mistaken after all our species is the species of fallible lists isn't it we
might always be wrong and to this the stock reply the Hempelian reply is this you've tested
this in every imaginable way you've submitted the law to experimental confirmations and
refutations and the like it has succeeded every test what could you ever mean by something
being true except that every attempt to falsify it has failed that is as of now the only basis
you have for ever declaring anything to be true is satisfied by these tests and so you
take these tests to be true and to satisfy the condition that the law be true.
Now this is one model and if we apply that model to the discipline of psychology the answer
to the question are the textbooks right is psychology a science of this or that is the
answer is and I want to state this firmly and dogmatically yes and no the answer to the
question is yes in some subsidiary fields of psychology as as you will see in subsequent
lectures in a field like sensory psychology visual information processing basic sensory
processes to some extent certain aspects of learning and memory in areas like this there
are quite reliable statistical laws that permit one to make fairly accurate predictions as
we move more in the direction of psychoanalytic theory theories of personality and the like
this degree of predictability fails and so the more realistic and lifelike and I should
say deeply interesting questions we confront in psychology the kinds of questions that
routinely get people interested in psychology are the less we are in possession of reliable
statistical laws or anything that would look like in the Hempelian sense now a scientific
explanation so as the ancient Greeks knew for every blessing conferred by the gods there
are two curses and the way that matches up with what I've said so far as this the more
interesting the psychological question the less precise we can be in answering it the
more precisely we can specify a general law in psychology by and large the less interesting
is the phenomenon at least most people would judge the phenomenon in question to be not
of the greatest the greatest degree of the greatest degree of interest now that gives
us one approach to the subject of psychology we should we should be aspiring to develop
general laws we should conduct experiments and gather data and make measurements and try
to render ever more precise our predictions ever more precise our measurements until finally
we are in possession of ever more general laws that will include such things as interpersonal
influence personality emotion love bonding all the things that fill out the pages of
such learned journals as Time Magazine and U.S. News and World Report and so forth well
there's a counter to this there's an argument to the effect that not only is this not a
worthwhile undertaking but it's an entirely misguided undertaking that is to say there's
an entirely different tradition what might be called a humanistic tradition that would
identify psychology as precisely the sort of subject not fit for scientific development
and for evolution into a scientific and systematic body of knowledge now let me rehearse some
of the arguments behind that view we might begin by asking what is it that makes an event
psychological in the first instance that is how would you distinguish between a shoe falling
toward the center of the earth and let's say Smith driving to work in the morning now
if you just stay at the level of folk psychology or folk wisdom which I shall argue throughout
this course is not a bad guide after all if you stay at the level of common sense the
difference between a shoe dropping toward the center of the earth and Smith driving
to the office in the morning is just the difference between something being obedient to the fixed
immutable laws of physics and something else having certain volitional powers certain autonomy
a certain freedom of action based on deliberated choice credential judgments the need to earn
a living the fact that the boss is going to complain if you're late happily discovering
that the car was filled with petrol the night before the highway isn't clogged and you think
you can get there in time to have a coffee and perhaps even a biscuit none of these things
has to be considered when it comes to shoes falling toward the center of the earth and
they always have to be considered when it comes to things like Smith going to work in
the morning or Napoleon losing in Belgium at the Battle of Waterloo or presidents giving
state of the Union addresses or the determination to move to a different neighborhood because
you think the school systems are better that is to say it has been argued that what makes
an event psychological in the first instance or for that matter social or historical or
economic is that the event only takes place through personal agency through the plans
and motives and aspirations the desires the reasonings and reflections of actual beings
who are free to do otherwise and who have to be understood in their own unique terms
it has been argued for example that events that are genuinely historical first off happen
one time only you can't do an experiment on Napoleon's losing in Belgium's it doesn't
happen often so you can't take repeated measures there can't be a general law that covers a
singular event or event moreover the persons who actually flesh out history create history
create autobiography create interpersonal relationships create now generically psychological
phenomena can't be substituted for you can't say well forget Napoleon will just put somebody
else in there who tends to keep his hand inside his jacket is rather short and has a three
cornered hat on you also know the difference between a motion picture that seeks to feature
Napoleon and what actually happened in Belgium in the first quarter of the 19th century now
the argument generally then is this for an event to be truly psychological in nature truly
social in nature or historical in nature it is not reducible to general laws it is not
a repeatable event it is unique in and of itself the participants cannot be substituted
for and ultimately the best explanation of events of that kind is by way of examining
the motives goals aspirations and perspectives of the participants to view all this within
the larger context of history or biography social life customary practices cultural values
and thus the scheme to try to find some universal law of gravitation here is is not only doomed
to fail it's the wrong project that in fact if you could reduce some significant human
enterprise to a general law it would have to be because that enterprise itself was in
some rigid sense determined the way physical events are and this would precisely strip
them of their psychological or historical or social attributes in the first instance
well what does this tell us then first I think when it comes to consequential questions we
should always answer them not with exclamation points or periods but with semicolons this is
part of the long debate it goes on even even as I stand before you there are agile wits
dealing with questions of this kind and I should say that this is not an area in which
there are right and wrong answers this is an area in which a variety of perspectives can
be defended with with more or less vigor and in more or less convincing fashion now at
least this far we see the possibility of two quite different psychologies a scientific
psychology or psychology aspiring to scientific status and occasionally reaching it that is
very much process-based the focus is not on the individual it's not on interpersonal relations
it's not on complex social phenomena it's not on the role of the person in history the
role of the person within culture it's not on that at all it's on such things as just
to cite a number of examples color vision reaction time as a function of the intensity
of a stimulus the number of times one must rehearse a list of things in order to be able
to commit it to memory accurately the extent to which changes in the biochemistry of the
nervous system alter mating practices or maternal behavior in non-human species the
effects of significant lesions in the brain on the ability to speak or to understand the
spoken word or to understand the written word the possibility that a small lesion somewhere
in the brain in this particular case I'd mentioned in the core of the temporal lobe of the brain
can find the victim performing very complex acts often destructive criminal acts involving assaults
and assassination attempts which that person is totally amnesic of at a later time yet the
behavior looked entirely purposive it involved planning it may have taken place over a long
period of time it's a bit of behavior that this person engages in with some regularity and when
that small space occupying mass is removed to use a high-tech term when the calcified glioma is
surgically removed there is never again a recurrence of activity of this kind and so we'd say here
we have evidence of something that certainly looks intentional looks planned looks to be the
product of goals motives aspirations and the like but seems instead to be determined by nothing
less than a tiny pinhead size calcification that just happens to be in the worst possible place
play now some have argued that evidence like this evidence from clinical neurology from studies of
non-human animals studies involving brain surgery and alterations in in the electrical and chemical
properties of the nervous system have made abundantly clear that you can get the widest range
of behavioral changes social interactions conduct within a social context you can achieve almost
any desired change by systematically altering the properties of the nervous system chemically
electrically surgically therefore why would anyone argue that at the end of the day psychology
will not be a deterministic nomological deductive type science in which you explain even the most
subtle complex and various features of human life by reference to the chemical physiological and
biophysical aspects of the body in general and the brain in particular we shall be weighing
arguments of that sort and returning frequently to the question of whether a deterministic model
is the right one for psychology or what might be called an autonomous model in which you
understand complex psychological phenomena only by assuming freedom on the part of the
participants to determine what their their their own goals are going to be and how they
will set about attaining them I should say in in this connection that it's entirely possible to
predict someone's behavior without at the same time adopting a deterministic perspective for
example if I I shall do an experiment right here I won't actually gather much data and I doubt
we'll be able to publish this one but let me try it I would just like those here who who are
female to raise their hand if the females in the room would just raise raise raise your hands
alright now I was able to predict with unfailing accuracy the number of hands that that would
go up in fact I could even identify the persons whose hands would go up nonetheless it would be
preposterous for me to say that because I could predict all that your actions were totally
determined and beyond the reach of your own free will your own desire your own willingness to
cooperate and collaborate I say this so that it becomes quite clear at the outset that even when
psychology can predict behavior that doesn't necessarily mean that the behavior thus predicted
is in fact rigidly determined the way shoes falling toward the center of the earth might be
an event that's and is indeed an event that is rigidly determined the reason I knew which hands
were going to go up is because we are part of a common culture we have a set of shared values we
have understandings that are based on the nuances of the language that we speak the rearing's that
we've had the attitudes that have been formed in the course of a lifetime and it's because each of
us can enter into the mental life of another empathically we say or sympathetically that of
course we very often can predict quite accurately what another is going to do when someone very
very close to you comes in sporting some new item just fetched from one of those very smart shops
and says well now how do you think this looks you know to a moral certainty that if you reply I
should say mediocre that the response to that is quite predictable if you say couldn't be more
stunning it'll go down in legend and song that's going to elicit yet another reply this is just
to say that life together becomes predictable because of these shared values this cultural immersion
in which all of us locate our lives predictability is not evidence for determinism though it is a
talking point for determinism and a deterministic psychology well anyway much of this becomes clear
as we proceed through the various topics in the course and we will see much evidence supporting
an essentially nomological deductive view on the nature of psychological research and explanation
and of course we'll see very much on on the other side which goes by several names it's
sometimes called hermeneutics in that what's required is a kind of interpretation sometimes
it's called a narrative approach you explain something by locating it within a story and
we'll be using these these terms selectively and also interchangeably and in lectures to come
