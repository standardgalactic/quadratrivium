Processing Overview for Conservative Tradition
============================
Checking Conservative Tradition/00. Professor Bio.txt
 Patrick N. Allott is an esteemed Professor of History at Emory University with a rich academic background. Born and raised in Central England, he completed his undergraduate studies with a BA in British and European History from the University of Oxford. He then crossed the Atlantic to earn his PhD in American History from the University of California, Berkeley. His scholarly journey further includes a postdoctoral stint at Harvard Divinity School and at the Princeton University Center for the Study of Religion.

Professor Allott is an accomplished author, having written five books and edited a sixth. His recent works include "The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities throughout American History" (2009), "Religion in America since 1945: A History" (2003), and "I'm the Teacher, You're the Student: A Semester in the University Classroom" (2004). These books offer deep insights into American history, religion, and the academic experience.

In addition to his authorship, Professor Allott has contributed numerous articles and reviews to both academic journals and popular publications like the New York Times Book Review. He has also produced four other courses for The Teaching Company, covering topics such as American Religious History, Victorian Britain, the History of the United States, Second Edition, co-taught with professors Alan Gelso and Gary Gallagher, and the American Identity.

To complement his lectures, Professor Allott has prepared a comprehensive course guidebook that comes with these lectures. This guidebook is designed to enhance the learning experience by providing listeners with a detailed outline of each lecture, a timeline for context, a glossary of terms, biographical notes on key figures, and a bibliography for further reading. It is recommended that students review these materials before or after each lecture to gain the most from the course.

Checking Conservative Tradition/01. What Is Conservatism.txt
 In this first lecture, Professor Ferguson introduces the concept of conservatism across Britain and America, highlighting the differences and similarities between the two nations' political ideologies. He emphasizes that while both countries have a conservative tradition, their interpretations and applications of conservatism are shaped by unique historical, cultural, and social factors.

Key points include:

1. Conservatism is a response to modernity, a defense of established institutions against revolutionary change.
2. Britain and America have politically diverged since 1776, leading to different conservative ideologies and symbols. For example, hunting in America is seen as a strength-building activity, while in Britain, it's associated with the old aristocracy and is not viewed favorably.
3. Religion plays a more significant role in American conservatism than in British conservatism, with the latter being more secularized.
4. Abortion is a highly contentious issue in American politics but is largely ignored in British political discourse.
5. Gun ownership and support for the National Health Service are typically conservative positions in America and Britain, respectively, illustrating the profound differences between the two nations' conservative movements.
6. The course will explore the works of influential figures like Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and practical politicians such as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, Benjamin Disraeli, Winston Churchill, and Margaret Thatcher.
7. Conservatism in Britain historically included sharp class distinctions that are now widely viewed as unacceptable. Similarly, American conservatism, particularly in its earlier history, included arguments against democracy and human equality, which supported the institution of slavery.
8. History is complex and often does not align with contemporary political beliefs. It's important to approach historical narratives critically and recognize that they may reflect ideology or mythology rather than pure fact.

Professor Ferguson concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding history in its own context, acknowledging its alien and different nature from our modern perspectives. This understanding allows us to appreciate the complexity of conservatism and the historical forces that have shaped it.

Checking Conservative Tradition/02. The Glorious Revolution And Its Heritage.txt
 Bolingbroke, a contemporary of Swift and a key figure in British politics during the early 18th century, held a deep distrust for both dissenters and the rising commercial class, which he saw as corrupting influences on British society. He believed that the traditional landed gentry were the true stewards of English political vessel, while the moneyed men, often associated with the Whig party, were mere passengers.

Bolingbroke feared that the Whigs' pursuit of personal enrichment and their influence over the government, including the use of bribes to create a compliant majority in Parliament, were leading Britain towards tyranny. He argued that one political party having undue influence over the government was detrimental to the national interest and could only end badly, as the monarchy might seize the opportunity to establish absolute power.

He also romanticized an idealized past, specifically a period of true English liberty before and after the Norman conquest, and briefly during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. This nostalgic view of a golden age was a common conservative theme, reflecting a belief that certain values and traditions were being lost or eroded by modern commercial interests.

Bolingbroke's ideas influenced later political movements, including the American Revolution, where similar concerns about monarchical tyranny and the corruption of power were central to the colonists' grievances against Britain. His thoughts on party politics and the dangers of a concentrated economic power also resonate with contemporary discussions on the role of money in politics and the balance between different societal interests.

Checking Conservative Tradition/03. Burke, Tradition, And The French Revolution.txt
1. **Edmund Burke's Relevance**: Burke's writings on the French Revolution became increasingly prescient as events unfolded, leading to a reassessment of his stance by those initially skeptical. His insights into the dangers of radical change and the importance of tradition were vindicated as the revolution turned violent and destabilizing.

2. **The French Revolution and War**: The revolution in France led to the king's deposition, the establishment of a republic, and eventually to war with the Austro-Hungarians. Britain, fearing the spread of revolutionary ideas, declared war on France in 1793, marking the beginning of near-continuous conflict that lasted until 1815.

3. **Burke's Perspective on War**: In a letter to Thomas Merry in 1794, Burke described the war against France as unprecedented, unlike any previous conflict due to its ideological nature and the revolutionary zeal of the French armies.

4. **Fear of Revolutionary Contagion**: The British government was alarmed by the potential for the French revolutionary contagion to spread to England, leading to repressive measures to prevent subversion. Burke himself feared the spread of revolutionary activism and the overthrow of societal order.

5. **Burke's Influence in 20th Century America**: Burke's fear of radical change resonated with American intellectuals after World War II, who saw parallels between the British fight against French Jacobinism and the American fight against communism. His work was thus reinterpreted to address new threats to Western civilization.

6. **Burke's Cautionary Principles**: Burke's distrust of democracy as an abstract principle and his support for government actions to suppress advocates of revolution are themes that have persisted in interpretations of his work, even as his supporters have adapted his ideas to the context of their own times.

7. **The Enduring Value of Burke's Ideas**: His emphasis on the fragility and wisdom of accumulated tradition continues to influence thinkers who value the preservation of established social structures and norms. Burke's caution against the dangers of unfettered democracy, equality, and revolution remains a significant aspect of his legacy.

Checking Conservative Tradition/04. Pitt And The Wars Of The French Revolution.txt
 William Pitt the Younger was a key figure in British politics during the French Revolutionary Wars and the early years of the Napoleonic Wars. His leadership was characterized by his efforts to maintain stability and order in Britain while preventing revolutionary ideas from taking hold at home. Pitt's government employed repressive measures, such as the Seditious Meetings and Treasonable Practices Act of 1795, to control political gatherings and suppress seditious activity. Concurrently, patriotic societies were encouraged to foster a sense of national unity and prepare for potential French invasions, which were successful in mobilizing the lower classes and reinforcing conservative values.

Despite some repression, Britain did not experience anything like the revolutionary terror seen in France. Political dissent was met with imprisonment rather than execution, reflecting a more measured approach to political opposition. Pitt also faced industrial unrest, which led to the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800, effectively outlawing trade unionism for several decades.

Henry Addington served as Prime Minister briefly during the peace of Amiens but was seen as a lightweight and was replaced by Pitt when hostilities with France resumed after Napoleon declared himself emperor. Tragically, Pitt died unexpectedly at age 46 shortly after the defeat at Austerlitz but following Nelson's victory at Trafalgar. His legacy includes having steered Britain through a turbulent period without falling into revolution and establishing a strong foundation for British foreign policy and military power.

Checking Conservative Tradition/05. The American Revolution.txt
 The United States Constitution was drafted in 1787 during a tumultuous period following the American Revolution, when there was fear that the nation might fragment or fall back into British control. The Constitutional Convention, which included prominent figures like George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, aimed to create a new system of government that would stabilize the young republic and address the deficiencies of the Articles of Confederation.

The founding fathers, many of whom had financial stakes in the success of the new government, crafted a document that was both an innovation and a continuation of their British heritage. The Constitution balanced democratic elements, like the House of Representatives with more insular components, such as the Senate and the judiciary, to protect against the perceived dangers of direct democracy and the "transient passions" of the electorate.

The Electoral College, the indirect election of senators, and life tenure for federal judges were all designed to provide a counterbalance to potential populist excesses. The founding fathers were not radical democrats; they valued virtue and order over direct democracy.

Despite their fear of unchecked democracy, the framers did include a Bill of Rights, drawing on British precedents with the same name, to protect individual liberties. This Bill of Rights was a set of the first ten amendments that were added to the Constitution to address the concerns of those who were wary of a strong central government.

The American revolutionaries also had to navigate and ultimately accept the institution of slavery, as seen in their compromises on representation and the slave trade. The Constitution thus represents a blend of revolutionary aspirations and conservative British influences, reflecting the complex political landscape and the priorities of its authors.

Checking Conservative Tradition/06. The Federalists.txt
 The early 19th century saw a shift in political allegiances among some of the most ambitious Federalists, with figures like John Quincy Adams joining the Republican Party after the election of Thomas Jefferson in 1809. The Federalists further discredited themselves with the Hartford Convention in 1812, where they discussed the possibility of secession due to their opposition to the War of 1812.

A key difference between the Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans was their stance on religion. While Jefferson advocated for a strict separation of church and state, many Federalists favored an Erastian tradition that supported a state church. This distinction reflects the varying approaches to religious liberty across different regions of the country.

One of Marshall's most significant contributions was his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by President John Adams in 1801. Marshall, a broad constructionist, played a pivotal role in expanding the authority of the federal government through a series of influential decisions. His tenure established the principle of judicial review with the landmark case Marbury v. Madison in 1803, which gave the Supreme Court the power to strike down laws it deemed unconstitutional, thereby enhancing its role and prestige within the United States.

Marshall's leadership solidified the Supreme Court as a crucial institution in the American political system, ensuring that it would have an enduring impact on national life, independent of direct electoral accountability. His legacy laid the foundation for the Supreme Court to become one of the most powerful and respected branches of government.

Checking Conservative Tradition/07. Conservatives In The American South.txt
1. **George Fitzhugh**: A brilliant autodidact from the 1850s, he was a critic of free labor and industrial capitalism, particularly in the North. He believed that slavery was a superior system to factory labor because it provided support from birth to death for slaves, who were viewed as part of the family rather than just workers.

2. **Fitzhugh's Arguments**: He argued that factory labor was more harsh and dehumanizing than plantation life, where slaves were cared for from infancy to old age. He also contended that most whites would benefit from slavery in much the same way as most blacks did.

3. **Pro-Slavery Writers**: Most pro-slavery advocates maintained a strict color line, insisting that whites should not be enslaved while blacks ought to be. Fitzhugh's work took this argument to an extreme by questioning the capacity of whites to live independently and suggesting that many would thrive under slavery.

4. **Education and Ideology**: Southern colleges like William and Mary and the University of South Carolina fostered a pro-slavery ideology among young Southerners, who were encouraged to see themselves as cavaliers in the tradition of royalist fighters from the English Civil War.

5. **Southern Conservatism**: This was characterized by a preference for minimal federal government intervention, low tariffs, states' rights, and the defense of slavery. The ideology was deeply entrenched in the Southern way of life and influenced the young men who would eventually fight and die for these beliefs during the Civil War.

In summary, Fitzhugh and other pro-slavery advocates presented a compelling argument that defended the institution of slavery by contrasting it favorably with factory labor conditions in the North. This ideology was not only intellectually sophisticated but also culturally embedded within Southern society and institutions, influencing the region's conservatism and contributing to the eventual division and conflict that led to the Civil War.

Checking Conservative Tradition/08. Northern Antebellum Conservatism.txt
1. **Conservative Mission in America**: After the American Revolution, a group of conservatives aimed to preserve and refine the best aspects of Western civilization within the young nation. They sought to create a civilized democracy rather than abandon Europe's cultural heritage.

2. **George Tickner**: An influential linguist and educator who studied at Goettingen, Tickner was dismayed by the lack of comparable resources in America upon his return. He worked to reform Harvard University's modern languages department and founded the Boston Public Library to make literature accessible to the masses.

3. **Edward Everett**: A Harvard professor who also studied at Goettingen, Everett was a polymath with expertise in philology. He influenced young Ralph Waldo Emerson and later became involved in politics, serving as governor of Massachusetts, a representative, a senator, and a presidential candidate. Despite his distaste for political campaigns, he found ambassadorial duties in England more to his liking. Back at Harvard, he faced the challenges of modernizing a university that was still very much a boys' academy.

4. **Differences Between Southern and Northern Conservatism**: The conservatism of the South centered on preserving the institution of slavery and the social hierarchy it supported. In contrast, Northern conservatives like Daniel Webster and Henry Clay focused on upholding the Union and advocating for a strong federal government within a capitalist economy. These differing visions contributed to the growing tensions that would lead to the American Civil War.

5. **Transition to Next Topic**: The lecture series now prepares to explore the American Civil War, having first examined the conservative movements in America and then shifting focus back to Britain to understand how British conservatism was evolving post-Napoleonic Wars. This historical context will be crucial in understanding the broader political landscape that led to one of America's most defining conflicts.

Checking Conservative Tradition/09. Opposing The Great Reform Act.txt
 The Great Reform Act of 1832 in Britain was a significant milestone in the country's political history, marking a shift towards more representative democracy. The act expanded the franchise by disenfranchising certain pockets of Tory voters and redistributing their influence to more populous areas. It also reduced the number of "rotten boroughs" where a single individual or family could control the electoral outcome despite very few actual residents, and it increased representation for larger towns that were more populated.

The passage of the Reform Act was fraught with controversy and social unrest. The House of Lords initially rejected the act, leading to widespread riots and public outcry. The threat of revolution and the fear of losing their privileged positions eventually persuaded many conservative peers to change their minds, and they eventually approved the act. King William IV, faced with the prospect of even more new Lords being created if he did not assent, reluctantly did so.

Despite its impact, the 1832 Reform Act did not create a full democracy in Britain. A significant majority of the male population still had no political representation, and the members of parliament were predominantly wealthy landowners who served without pay. The secret ballot, which would later become standard, was still controversial and not yet implemented. However, the act established a precedent for peaceful political reform, contrasting with the violent revolutions that characterized politics in neighboring France at the time. It set the stage for future reforms that gradually expanded suffrage and moved Britain towards the parliamentary democracy it is today.

Checking Conservative Tradition/10. Robert Peel And The Conservative Revival.txt
1. The repeal of the Corn Laws was made possible by the Great Famine in Ireland, where a potato blight led to mass starvation due to the country's reliance on the potato as a staple crop.
2. The Corn Laws were protectionist measures that protected British farmers by imposing high tariffs on imported grain. They were seen as beneficial for employment in agriculture, which was still the largest sector of the economy at the time.
3. In 1846, Prime Minister Robert Peel, a Conservative, saw the necessity of repealing the Corn Laws to alleviate the suffering in Ireland and to ensure the availability of cheap food. Despite opposition from many within his own party, Peel managed to secure enough votes by relying on Whig support and the efforts of the Duke of Wellington in the House of Lords.
4. The repeal caused a split within the Conservative Party, with a faction led by Lord Derby opposing Peel's decision. This political rift allowed the Whigs to strengthen their position, eventually transforming into the modern Liberal Party.
5. The abolition of the Corn Laws led Britain to embrace free trade more strongly than ever before, which coincided with the peak of British economic and imperial power in the latter half of the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialized, free trade became a less one-sided advantage for Britain, making it more vulnerable to competition from industrial rivals like Germany and America.
6. The historical interpretation of Britain's response to the famine is still debated, with some historians criticizing Britain's inadequate assistance during the crisis. Others argue that given the context, Britain did what it could to address the tragedy.
7. The Great Famine and the repeal of the Corn Laws led to significant social and economic changes in Britain and Ireland, including the mass migration of Irish people to other parts of the world, such as Canada, the United States, and Australia, shaping the Irish diaspora.

Checking Conservative Tradition/11. Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, Mill.txt
1. The British class system was able to adapt over time, absorbing industrial wealth into the aristocracy through intermarriage and other means, thus avoiding a revolutionary outcome like the Paris Commune.

2. The rise of socialism posed a significant threat to traditional capitalist interests, but conservative parties in Britain, including those led by figures like Margaret Thatcher, adapted by embracing capitalism as something worth conserving despite its transformative nature.

3. Conservatives had to address and refute parts of Marxist theory, particularly the notion that capitalism would inevitably make workers poorer. They succeeded in demonstrating that, at least in industrial societies, workers' standards of living improved over time.

4. The historical roots of American libertarian conservatism can be traced back to the ideas of Jefferson, John Stuart Mill, and Adam Smith, who were influential British economists and thinkers in the 18th and 19th centuries.

5. Britain's procedural adaptability and its ability to gradually incorporate significant social changes without revolutionary upheaval is a striking characteristic of its history, particularly in maintaining its class structure while allowing for economic evolution.

Checking Conservative Tradition/12. Conservatism And The American Civil War.txt
1. The romanticization of the Confederate cause, particularly after the Civil War, often involved glorifying those who had suffered and died for the South, attributing to them noble qualities similar to those Jesus had exhibited. This helped to establish a society that idealized the past and maintained a high degree of repression against African Americans.

2. The Ku Klux Klan, as an example, drew inspiration from romantic Scottish clans as popularized by Walter Scott's novels. The Klan saw themselves as embodying Christian chivalry, even though their actions were perceived as racial terrorism by others.

3. After the Civil War, advocates of the "New South" like Henry W. Grady sought to reconcile the memories of the Old South with the need for modernization. Grady, who had missed the opportunity to fight in the war, emphasized the importance of preserving Southern distinctiveness while moving forward.

4. By the late 1800s, Union and Confederate veterans began to view the Civil War through a sentimental and nostalgic lens, focusing on shared experiences and camaraderie rather than the revolutionary changes that had actually occurred.

5. The motivations behind secession in the South were largely conservative, aiming to maintain control and preserve the existing social order based on slavery. When the Confederacy was defeated, Southerners compensated for their loss by creating a society that idealized the past and maintained racial hierarchies.

6. Abraham Lincoln's approach to the Civil War was different from the Southern conservatives. He viewed the war as a crisis that threatened the unity of the nation. He invoked the founders and the Declaration of Independence, framing the Union as a sacred entity worth defending at all costs.

7. Lincoln's conception of democracy differed from that of his Federalist predecessors, who had viewed it as a threat to a virtuous republic. Lincoln saw democracy as an integral part of American life and honored those who fought and died for the Union as defenders of American democratic traditions and equality.

Checking Conservative Tradition/13. Industrialists, Mugwumps, Traditionalists.txt
 The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a fascination among wealthy Americans with European art and culture, leading to the acquisition of treasures from across the Atlantic. This phenomenon was part of a broader desire to connect with a longer, continuous civilization, reflecting a sense of belonging to an old tradition. Figures like J.P. Morgan, Frick, and Guggenheim built up substantial art collections during this time. Isabella Stewart Gardner, another prominent collector, amassed art and commissioned a Renaissance-style palace in Boston, Fenway Court, which she filled with artifacts and insisted be preserved after her death.

Henry James, the American novelist, also expressed his admiration for old Europe, preferring its cultural depth over the new world's rapid development. He was particularly critical of the emerging New York skyscrapers, which he saw as symbols of greed and capitalism, detracting from the historical significance of older structures like Trinity Church.

The traditionalists who valued the old European civilization and its cultural heritage found common ground with conservatives as a counterpoint to the new ideologies of capitalism and the emerging socialism. Both groups recognized the need to protect this shared cultural legacy against the challenges posed by these new social and economic movements.

Checking Conservative Tradition/14. Disraeli And Tory Imperialism.txt
1. **The Changing Nature of British Politics**: The British political landscape was evolving in the late 19th century with an increasing emphasis on democracy and public opinion, exemplified by the expansion of the electorate and new campaigning techniques.

2. **Benjamin Disraeli and the Empire**: Disraeli, who became Earl of Beaconsfield, began to view the British Empire as an asset rather than a burden. He saw it as a symbol of Britain's greatness and as an emotional and political force that could rally the nation. His conservative party capitalized on this idea of empire, which remained a core value for conservatives into the 1960s.

3. **The Congress of Berlin (1878)**: This international conference, orchestrated by Disraeli and Bismarck, aimed to stabilize the Ottoman Empire and define spheres of influence in Europe and the Middle East. It solidified Britain's position in the Mediterranean, particularly through control over Cyprus, and set the stage for future tensions, especially between Russia and Britain.

4. **Gladstone's Midlothian Campaign (1879)**: Gladstone recognized the importance of appealing directly to a wider electorate. His campaigning across various constituencies demonstrated his skill in political oratory and appealed to the moral and democratic sentiments of the time. This campaign paved the way for his return to power.

5. **The Legacy of Gladstone and Disraeli**: The rivalry between these two leaders shaped the ideological divide between the Liberals and Conservatives, reflecting different approaches to governance and foreign policy as Britain navigated its role as a democratic and imperial nation.

6. **Gladstone's Final Years**: Despite his moralistic stance on foreign policy, Gladstone found it challenging to implement such principles in practice. He led the opposition in the House of Lords until his death in 1886, remaining active and writing until the end of his life. His legacy included a transformative impact on British politics and the expansion of democratic participation.

Checking Conservative Tradition/15. The Rise Of Labour And The House Of Lords.txt
1. The political landscape of Britain at the turn of the 20th century featured a significant shift within the Conservative Party, moving away from the traditional landed gentry towards a more pragmatic and industrial capitalist approach under leaders like Balfour and Law. This was in contrast to the Liberal Party, which was still closely tied to the older aristocratic elements.

2. Sir Edward Carson, a Dublin Protestant MP and successful barrister, emerged as a powerful conservative figure, becoming a spokesperson for the Ulster Unionists who opposed Irish home rule. He threatened civil disobedience or even war if home rule were imposed on Ulster by the British government.

3. The issue of Irish home rule was a major point of contention, with the Conservative Party and the Ulster Unionists vehemently opposing it. The Home Rule Bill passed through the House of Commons multiple times but was vetoed by the House of Lords twice before the First World War postponed its implementation.

4. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led to a temporary halt in the Irish home rule legislation and a shift towards national unity, with the Conservatives gaining political capital as their ideology seemed better suited to handle the emergency.

5. Robert Blake, a historian, noted that the Liberal Party's principles of liberty, moral conscience, and constitutional propriety were at odds with the necessities of war, making the Conservative Party's approach more aligned with the needs of the time.

6. The question of the Anglo-Saxons' special destiny was another issue of concern for Conservatives before World War I, as they often emphasized the unique role and bond between Britain and the United States, which shared similar cultural and political values. This perspective would influence British and American Conservative thought, particularly in the context of global affairs and empire.

7. In the subsequent lecture, the impact of World War I on unresolved issues like Irish home rule and the way in which these questions were resolved both during and immediately after the war will be discussed, as well as the broader implications for British politics and the role of Conservatives within it.

Checking Conservative Tradition/16. The Idea Of Anglo-Saxon Supremacy.txt
 The video discusses the influence of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a U.S. Navy officer and historian, whose book "The Influence of Sea Power upon the History of the World" was instrumental in shaping the foreign policies and military strategies of several nations at the turn of the 20th century, including Britain, Germany, and Japan. Mahan's work emphasized the importance of naval power and strategic control of the seas, which became a cornerstone for imperial and economic dominance.

His ideas were particularly impactful in the case of Japan, which built a formidable navy after studying Mahan's theories and demonstrated its naval prowess at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 against Russia. At an international disarmament conference in The Hague before World War I, Mahan advocated for the development and possession of new weapons as a deterrent rather than relying on international agreements to outlaw them.

The video also touches upon Andrew Dixon White's admiration for Mahan's pragmatic approach to foreign policy and the resignation of U.S. Senator Elohu Root from the Senate following the passage of the 17th Amendment, which instituted the direct election of senators by the people. This change was seen as a departure from the conservative ideal of an unelected Senate that could serve as a check on democratic impulses.

Finally, the video reflects on the New Republic's critique of Elohu Root, which inadvertently praises his conservative approach to leadership—looking back at history and tradition while also facing forward towards the future of the people he leads. The video concludes by suggesting that a true conservative leader must be attuned to both the historical lessons of the past and the needs and aspirations of the present.

Checking Conservative Tradition/17. No Vote For Women.txt
1. The lecture discusses the evolution of gender roles and the impact of women gaining the right to vote, particularly focusing on changes in Britain and the United States after World War I.

2. The initial resistance to women's suffrage softened as women demonstrated their capability by taking over jobs previously held by men during the war. This shift was crucial for the suffrage movement, leading to constitutional amendments granting women the right to vote.

3. In 1920, the United States granted full suffrage rights to women through the 19th Amendment, with the conservative president Warren G. Harding being elected in the same year.

4. In Britain, partial suffrage was awarded to women over 30 who owned property in 1918, and full equality was achieved in 1928 with the Representation of the People Act. However, many women voted similarly to their male relatives, which disappointed some feminist leaders who had hoped for a more pronounced political shift.

5. The first woman to sit in the British parliament was Nancy Astor, an American-born aristocrat who inherited her husband's seat after he became a peer. She was known for her feud with Winston Churchill and her advocacy for appeasement in the 1930s.

6. Another significant female MP was the Duchess of Atholl, a former anti-suffragist who became a conservative member of parliament from 1923 to 1938. She resigned in protest against the Conservative government's appeasement policies towards Hitler. She supported the Spanish Republic and was an outspoken anti-communist.

7. The lecture reflects on the nature of political defeat, noting that those who once opposed women's suffrage were later overshadowed by the very cause they fought against, eventually becoming obsolete as their positions reversed.

Checking Conservative Tradition/18. American Conservatives After World War I.txt
1. H.L. Menken was a journalist, author, and founding editor of The American Mercury, a magazine that catered to urban, middle-class readers in the 1920s, alongside other magazines like The New Yorker.

2. Menken was known for his sharp wit, contrarian views, and scorn for Puritanism and rural life, often joking that Puritans were people who were terrified that someone somewhere is having some fun.

3. He was an outspoken critic of Wilsonian progressivism and the aspiring, strenuous character he associated with President Woodrow Wilson's politics. Menken also disliked Prohibition and the blend of puritanism and perfectionism that led to such policies.

4. Menken's famous moment came during the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925, where he supported Clarence Darrow against William Jennings Bryan, taking great pleasure in exposing the ignorance of fundamentalist views on evolution.

5. Despite his often unlikable attitudes and opinions, Menken's sharp tongue and love for paradox made him a figure many readers enjoyed despite his provocative stances.

6. The new humanists, agrarians, and H.L. Menken were all conservative voices reacting to the changes brought by the prosperous 1920s in America. The Great Depression would later shift the landscape of American conservatism.

7. Menken had a complex view of conscience, humorously describing it as "a mother-in-law whose visit never ends," reflecting his skepticism about the role of moral absolutes and his focus on human frailty.

Checking Conservative Tradition/19. Opposing The New Deal.txt
1. **American Opinion on Spanish Civil War**: The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) saw a stark division in American public opinion, with Catholic Americans largely supporting General Francisco Franco, who presented himself as the defender of the Catholic Church, and left-wing Americans sympathizing with the Republican side, which was fighting against fascist elements. This divide mirrored the broader ideological battle between the right and the left during the 1930s.

2. **Franco as George Washington**: Franco was compared to America's founding father, George Washington, by Catholics who saw him as a champion against secular radicalism in Spain.

3. **Abraham Lincoln Brigade**: Conversely, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade comprised American volunteers, including many communists, who fought for the Spanish Republic.

4. **American Isolationism**: The isolationist movement in the U.S. was strong during the 1930s, influenced by a distrust of European conflicts and a desire to avoid another global war like World War I. Charles Lindbergh was a prominent figure advocating for non-intervention and caution against entangling alliances.

5. **America First Committee**: This organization, with figures like Herbert Hoover and Robert Taft supporting it, argued for maintaining the principles outlined in George Washington's Farewell Address and avoiding involvement in European affairs.

6. **Roosevelt's Government**: Critics like Senator Robert Taft feared that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would use a potential war to expand federal power and control over private and commercial life in the United States.

7. **Isolationism as American Nationalism**: The isolationist movement was unique to the U.S., emphasizing a retreat from global entanglements and focusing on national interests rather than European conflicts.

8. **Pearl Harbor**: The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, ended the era of American isolationism, as the U.S. declared war on Japan. This was followed by Germany and Italy declaring war on the U.S., making America's involvement in World War II inevitable.

9. **Hitler's Mistake**: Had Adolf Hitler not declared war on the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the American public might have remained divided, and the course of World War II could have been very different. As it was, Hitler's declaration solidified U.S. participation in the global conflict.

Checking Conservative Tradition/20. The Tory Party From Bonar Law To Churchill.txt
1. Following Neville Chamberlain's resignation in May 1940 due to the UK's wartime situation, there was uncertainty over who would succeed him as Prime Minister. Establishment conservatives favored Lord Halifax over Winston Churchill, who had more left-leaning tendencies and was seen as less conciliatory towards Hitler.

2. Churchill became Prime Minister and was initially met with skepticism from mainstream Tories, who were critical of his style and perceived his associates as unsavory.

3. Churchill attempted to bridge the divide between conservatives and his own political inclinations by appointing Halifax and Chamberlain to senior positions in his government.

4. The tide turned for Churchill following the successful Battle of Britain, where the Royal Air Force defended against the German Luftwaffe and prevented an invasion of the UK. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the re-armament efforts that Churchill had previously advocated.

5. The successful evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk and Churchill's rousing speeches further solidified his leadership. He emphasized the contributions of a few Spitfire pilots to the safety of many and reaffirmed the UK's resolve to never surrender.

6. Although Churchill led the national coalition government, which included members from all major parties, he declined to take formal leadership of any single party to maintain national unity.

7. With Chamberlain's death in November 1940 and the continued success of Britain in the war, Churchill gradually won over the Conservative Party skeptics, solidifying his position as the leader of a nation at war.

Checking Conservative Tradition/21. The Reaction To Labour And Nationalization.txt
 The post-World War II period saw the Conservative Party under Winston Churchill's leadership emerge victorious in three successive elections from 1951 to 1955, capitalizing on the rising standards of living and distancing themselves from the socialist austerity of the late 1940s. Under Harold Macmillan, the Conservatives grappled with the question of Britain's future direction, considering the Empire, the Anglo-American relationship, and the potential of a united Europe. Macmillan attempted to lead Britain into the European Economic Community (EEC), but his efforts were thwarted by French President Charles de Gaulle.

The Conservatives' moral authority was severely compromised by the Profumo Affair in 1963, which involved a minister having an affair with a woman who also had a relationship with a Russian military attaché, raising potential security concerns. The scandal led to Macmillan's retirement and the unexpected succession of Alec Douglas-Hume, who became prime minister after renounishing his hereditary title to sit in the House of Commons.

Douglas-Hume's leadership was lackluster, and the Conservatives lost the 1964 election to Labour under Harold Wilson. The death of Churchill in 1965 marked the end of an era, and the Conservative Party found itself in disarray, struggling to maintain relevance in a rapidly changing political and social landscape. Despite this, Churchill's legacy as a conservative leader was cemented, and he remains one of the greatest British Conservatives of the 20th century, even though he was not always the party's favorite during his active years.

Checking Conservative Tradition/22. American Anticommunism And Mccarthyism.txt
1. **Whitaker Chambers**: In his essay, "The Greatest Trial," Chambers describes the Hiss case not just as a human tragedy but as a symbolic confrontation between two opposing worldviews or faiths: communism and Western civilization. He emphasizes that the trial was about more than the personal guilt of Alger Hiss and Whitaker Chambers; it represented a larger ideological conflict, with each man's conviction representing his respective belief system.

2. **The Role of Ex-Communists in Conservatism**: Many former communists, who had been disillusioned by the reality of communism compared to its ideals, turned to conservatism during the 1950s. These individuals brought a strong anti-communist stance to the conservative movement, often viewing communism as a mortal threat to Western civilization.

3. **James Burnham**: A prominent example of this shift was James Burnham, a former Trotskyist who became a leading strategist in America's Cold War foreign policy. As a philosophy professor at New York University, Burnham had been involved with communism in the 1930s but later became a staunch conservative intellectual with government connections.

4. **Other Ex-Communists**: Similar transformations occurred among other intellectuals who had once been part of the American left, including Max Eastman, Will Herberg, and John Dos Passos. They each recanted their communist beliefs after experiencing disillusionment and dedicated themselves to opposing communism and defending Western values.

5. **Conservative Views on Communism**: These ex-communists held the view that communism was an inherently destructive force opposed to the Christian foundations of the West. They believed that any attempt to coexist with or conciliate communism was akin to self-destruction and were staunchly opposed to policies like President Eisenhower's policy of mutual coexistence with the Soviet Union.

In summary, the influence of ex-communists on American conservatism in the 1950s was significant, as they brought a deep understanding of communist ideology and a strong warning against its incompatibility with Western values. They saw the Hiss case as a microcosm of the larger Cold War struggle between these two global forces.

Checking Conservative Tradition/23. American Traditionalists.txt
1. **Natural Law Influence**: The ideas of natural law, central to the work of Richard Weaver and Russell Kirk, also impacted journalist Walter Lippmann in the 1950s. Lippmann, a former idealistic socialist, became increasingly disenchanted with the manipulation of public opinion and the dangers of communism and Nazism. He saw natural law as a foundation for a stable and plural society.

2. **Lippmann's Views**: Lippmann argued that a large, pluralistic society requires a rational order transcending its competing interests, which he believed was provided by natural law. This common law is immutable and serves as a basis for coexistence and governance within diverse communities.

3. **Catholic Influence on American Thought**: The 1950s saw a significant influence of Catholic ideas in American society, with these concepts becoming more respectable as the American Catholic community became more integrated. This period also paved the way for the presidential candidacy of John F. Kennedy, who was the first Catholic to run for the office.

4. **Peter Virek**: A history professor and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, Peter Virek emerged as a conservative thinker who criticized McCarthyism. He believed Franklin Roosevelt had conserved capitalism through the New Deal and emphasized the role of Christianity in synthesizing various intellectual traditions.

5. **Christianity's Role**: Virek saw Christianity as vital for American society, not only because it addressed man's sinfulness and promoted moral and social justice but also because it preserved the best elements of Judaism, Greek love for beauty and intellect, Roman legalism, and Aristotelian/Thomist philosophy. He argued that Western creativity and greatness arose from a delicate balance between these elements.

In summary, the influence of natural law ideas was significant among conservative thinkers in post-World War II America, with figures like Walter Lippmann and Peter Virek drawing upon these principles to argue for a stable society grounded in rational, immutable laws that transcend individual interests. Their work helped integrate Catholic thought into broader American discourse and contributed to the evolution of a new conservative movement that respected the synthesizing role of Christianity in Western civilization.

Checking Conservative Tradition/24. Libertarianism.txt
 Ayn Rand was a Russian-American novelist, philosopher, and screenwriter who is best known for her two most influential works, "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged." Her philosophy, Objectivism, emphasizes reason, individualism, and moral rationalism. Rand advocated for the pursuit of one's own happiness as the highest moral purpose and believed in a society where individuals are free to trade with each other voluntarily, without coercion or force. She taught that justice is earning what one produces and no more, and that the initiation of force in any form is the great evil.

Rand's ideas had a significant impact on the conservative movement in the 1950s and 60s, attracting many followers who were influenced by her philosophy of Objectivism. However, she was also subject to criticism and parody from within and outside the conservative sphere. Whitaker Chambers, for example, criticized Rand's "shrillness" and "dogmatism," arguing that her portrayal of superhuman individuals in "Atlas Shrugged" was antithetical to true conservatism, which values community and tradition.

Tobias Wolff's novel "Old School" provides a fictional account of Rand's influence, highlighting the impossibility of living up to Objectivist ideals in everyday life. The narrative illustrates the contrast between the idealized world of Objectivism and the complexities of real human relationships.

Murray Rothbard, another influential libertarian intellectual, was initially an admirer of Rand but eventually developed his own distinct brand of libertarianism. He studied under Ludwig von Mises and became a critic of the growth of the military-industrial complex and the centralized state. Unlike some members of the Free Man, Rothbard believed that the Soviet Union was not a significant threat to the United States and resisted the expansion of the state's power. His work had a profound impact on the development of American libertarianism in the late 20th century.

In summary, Ayn Rand's Objectivism has been a significant force in American political and philosophical thought, influencing both conservative and libertarian ideologies, while also facing criticism for its extreme individualism and rejection of traditional values. Murray Rothbard's contributions to libertarian thought further solidified the place of these ideas within the broader intellectual landscape.

Checking Conservative Tradition/25. National Review And Barry Goldwater.txt
 The Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) was a conservative youth organization founded in the late 1950s and early 1960s, which played a significant role in the emergence of the New Right. The movement was influenced by anti-communist sentiment, libertarian ideas, and some religious conservatism, as reflected in their foundational document, the Sharon Statement. YAF members were active in the Goldwater campaign of 1964, which sought to bring a more conservative stance to the Republican Party.

The New Right was a complex coalition that balanced various themes, including anti-communism, libertarianism, and traditional values. The movement experienced internal tensions between its anti-communist wing, which supported the draft during the Vietnam War, and its libertarian wing, which viewed the draft as an unacceptable form of government coercion. Despite being larger than left-wing youth movements like SDS, YAF received less historical attention, with scholars often focusing more on the Port Huron Statement of SDS.

Barry Goldwater's presidential bid in 1964 was significant as it brought these conservative forces to the forefront of American politics. His acceptance speech highlighted the theme that extremism in defense of liberty is no vice, which his opponents used against him, portraying him as an extremist who could potentially start a nuclear war. Goldwater's campaign was marked by a rejection of certain political conventions, such as promising to end farm subsidies and discussing the potential elimination of social security in ways that were politically unpopular.

Lyndon B. Johnson capitalized on the national mourning for Kennedy and his own portrayal as the custodian of Kennedy's legacy to win the 1964 election against Goldwater in a landslide. The defeat, however, set the stage for a conservative takeover of the Republican Party, which would eventually lead to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. This marked the culmination of the seismic shift initiated by the early conservatives, who were determined to realign American politics towards a more conservative ideology.

Checking Conservative Tradition/26. Upheavals Of The 1960s.txt
 William F. Buckley Jr.'s campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1965, though unlikely to win, garnered significant attention and contributed to the mainstreaming of conservative thought, leading to the creation of his influential political discussion show "Firing Line." Buckley's wit and intellect made him a national figure, and his campaign is remembered as one of the most entertaining political books of the 1960s.

Ronald Reagan, a former movie star and president of the Screen Actors Guild, actively cooperated with Hollywood's anti-communist efforts during the McCarthy era. He transitioned to television in the 1950s and became a prominent conservative voice after delivering a notable speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater in 1964. His easy, folksy style helped present conservatism in an appealing light, warning against the dangers of overmighty government and totalitarianism.

Reagan's successful 1966 gubernatorial campaign in California, where he addressed concerns about radical student activism at institutions like Berkeley, demonstrated that taking a strong stance against unrest was politically effective. His leadership led to the deployment of the National Guard during the People's Park controversy. Reagan's handling of the situation at Berkeley and his appointment of S.I. Hayakawa as president of San Francisco State College further underscored the political capital gained from standing firm against student radicalism.

The experiences of both Reagan and Hayakawa highlighted the political benefits of confronting leftist activism, influencing the Republican Party's strategy in the 1970s to embrace a more active conservative stance in response to social and political upheaval. This shift solidified the role of activist conservatives within the party, setting the stage for future conservative politics and leaders.

Checking Conservative Tradition/27. The Neoconservatives.txt
 The lecture discusses the contributions of neo-conservatives to sociological theory and their advocacy for mediating structures as essential for a healthy society. These mediating structures, such as the family, religious institutions, social clubs, and local organizations, play a crucial role in shaping individuals' abilities to relate to wider society and foster a sense of community and responsibility.

Neo-conservatives of the 1970s, many of whom were Jews and Catholics, often found themselves defending traditional neighborhood identities against policies like busing, which they believed would disrupt community cohesion. They saw these mediating institutions as counterbalances to the state, preventing the overreach of government power and protecting individual freedoms.

The neo-conservative critique of the "wasp" culture, as articulated by Michael Novak in "The Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics," argued that ethnic groups had to adapt to dominant cultural norms, which often suppressed their unique identities and traditions. This adaptation was seen as a form of psychological ordeal for these groups.

Neo-conservatives like Irving Kristol emphasized the virtues promoted by capitalism, arguing that it was the most effective economic system for fostering individual responsibility, economic growth, and community-oriented small businesses. Kristol's "Two Cheers for Capitalism" reflected a recognition of capitalism's shortcomings but acknowledged its superiority in distributing power and encouraging virtues beneficial to social stability.

The neo-conservative movement's evolution culminated in the 1980s with an increasing endorsement of capitalism, not just for its economic efficiency, but also for its role in promoting the values and structures that neo-conservatives held dear. This reflected a broader shift in American political thought, where traditionalist and conservative ideals began to influence policy and public discourse.

Checking Conservative Tradition/28. The Neoconservatives And Foreign Policy.txt
 The period following the Vietnam War saw a shift in American foreign policy thinking, with a group of intellectuals known as neoconservatives emerging as influential voices. These neoconservatives, who had previously been liberal or left-leaning but grew disillusioned with the perceived weaknesses and failures of liberal foreign policy, argued that the Soviet Union was actively seeking global domination and was engaged in an arms race to achieve it.

In 1976, they founded the Committee on the Present Danger (CPD) to advocate for a tougher stance against the Soviet Union. The CPD's leaders, such as Paul Nitze and Richard Pipes, were respected due to their experience in Cold War policymaking, particularly in the SALT 1 treaty negotiations. They urged the United States not to sign the SALT 2 treaty, believing it would only strengthen the Soviet Union's position.

The Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the late 1970s confirmed the neoconservatives' views about the aggressive nature of Soviet policy. These events, along with President Carter's perceived failure to effectively respond to these crises, led many neoconservatives to switch their political allegiance to the Republican Party and support Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.

Reagan's campaign and subsequent presidency reflected many of the neoconservative views on foreign policy, emphasizing a strong stance against the Soviet Union and a commitment to military strength and strategic countermeasures aimed at containing and eventually reversing Soviet expansionism. The neoconservatives' influence would continue to shape American foreign policy throughout the Cold War and into the post-Cold War era.

Checking Conservative Tradition/29. Christian Conservatives And The New Right.txt
1. **Rise of the Christian Right in Conservative Politics**: In the late 1970s and early 1980s, evangelical Christians emerged as a powerful force within the conservative movement, seeking to influence politics based on their moral and religious values.

2. **Election of Ronald Reagan**: The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 gave conservatives control over the federal government, but Christian conservatives found it challenging to pass legislation reflecting their values due to opposition from within the Republican Party and the broader American political landscape that favors moderate candidates.

3. **Libertarian vs. Moral Values Tensions**: The libertarian wing of the conservative movement was more focused on limited government and personal freedom, which often conflicted with the Christian conservatives' desire for government intervention on moral issues like abortion.

4. **Operation Rescue**: In response to the lack of legislative progress, Randall Terry founded Operation Rescue in 1987, employing nonviolent civil disobedience tactics inspired by the Civil Rights Movement to protest against abortion clinics.

5. **Evangelical Scandals**: The late 1980s saw several high-profile evangelical leaders, such as Jim and Tammy Baker and Jimmy Swaggart, involved in scandals that undermined the credibility of the Christian right and raised questions about the movement's integrity.

6. **Christian Coalition**: Following the scandals, Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition took a different approach by focusing on grassroots mobilization and encouraging evangelicals to engage in local politics rather than relying solely on federal lobbying efforts.

7. **Moderation in Politicians**: The American political system tends to favor moderate candidates who can win elections, which often means that politicians avoid taking strong positions on divisive issues like abortion to maintain broader appeal.

8. **Evangelical Political Strategy**: The Christian Coalition's strategy focused on getting members involved in local government and school boards, aiming to influence policy at the grassroots level. This approach highlighted the challenge of balancing the desire for candidates with strong convictions with those who are electable.

In summary, while evangelical Christians played an increasingly influential role in conservative politics from the 1970s onwards, their ability to translate that influence into legislative victories was limited by internal divisions within conservatism, the broader political environment, and their own internal challenges, including high-profile scandals and the need to navigate between ideological purity and electability.

Checking Conservative Tradition/30. Margaret Thatcher's Counterrevolution.txt
 Margaret Thatcher, the UK's Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, was known for her strong leadership and conservative policies both domestically and on the international stage. Her approach to governance was characterized by deregulation, privatization, and a reduction in the power of trade unions, which significantly transformed the British economy. Thatcher also played a significant role in global politics, particularly in Europe. She advocated for a decentralized and democratic European Union, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the cultural and national identities of individual European countries within the EU framework.

In 1988, Thatcher delivered a notable speech at Bruges, Belgium, where she criticized the bureaucratic centralization of the EU while acknowledging the peace and co-operation brought by European unification. She emphasized the value of Europe's diversity and the importance of preserving national identities within a united Europe.

Thatcher's foreign policy was not without controversy. She drew attention for her remarks on the 300th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, which she connected to Britain's historical role in shaping European freedom and democracy. She also made a provocative comment regarding the French Revolution, which sparked debate but solidified her image as a defiant figure who was not afraid to challenge conventional diplomatic niceties.

In October 1984, Thatcher narrowly escaped death when an IRA bomb exploded at the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Conservative Party conference. Her swift and resolute response to the attack further cemented her reputation for strength and determination. The incident did not deter her from her political course, and she continued to lead the UK with resolve through the rest of the 1980s.

Thatcher's tenure was marked by both economic recovery and the exploitation of new resources from the North Sea, which provided additional financial stability for the UK. Her leadership style, coupled with the circumstances of her time in office, made her one of the most influential and iconic political figures of the 20th century.

Checking Conservative Tradition/31. Monarchs And Prime Ministers.txt
1. King George VI initially appeared as an inadequate figure with a severe stammer and was seen as an advocate for appeasement alongside Neville Chamberlain before WWII. However, he gained respect and admiration for his support of Winston Churchill during the war, especially after witnessing Churchill's leadership and eloquence, particularly during the Blitz.

2. Queen Elizabeth II, who succeeded her father George VI, was initially very popular following his death, but has faced periods of unpopularity, notably during the 1997 crisis following Princess Diana's death, which was depicted in the film "The Queen."

3. Despite occasional criticism and calls for a republic from some members of parliament like Dennis Skinner, the British monarchy remains strong and is expected to continue with Prince William as future king.

4. Journalist Jeremy Paxman, who once believed Britain should be a republic, after investigating the history of the royal family, acknowledged that monarchies can endure by appealing to non-logical aspects such as history, emotion, imagination, and mythology. He suggests that these elements are more significant than logic in maintaining stable societies, as evidenced by the relative stability and integrity of many European monarchies compared to some republics.

5. The persistence of monarchies like Britain's can be understood through the lens of Edmund Burke's ideas, emphasizing the importance of benefiting from inherited traditions over purely rational or logical considerations.

Checking Conservative Tradition/32. Reagan Triumphant.txt
1. Ronald Reagan's presidency (1981-1989) was marked by both significant achievements and notable disappointments in terms of advancing conservative ideas. While he was able to implement some conservative policies, such as tax cuts and military buildup, he also saw increased government spending and could not fully realize his vision for reducing federal power.

2. Reagan's attempt to nominate Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987 exemplified the intensity of opposition from liberals who feared Bork would overturn landmark decisions like Roe v. Wade and undermine civil rights progress. The Senate ultimately rejected Bork's nomination, a setback for Reagan's conservative agenda.

3. Robert Bork, a conservative legal scholar and judge, advocated for originalism in the judiciary, arguing that judges should interpret laws according to their intended meaning by the founders and precedent, rather than personal opinions or current sensibilities.

4. President Reagan demonstrated pragmatism as a politician, balancing his principles with political realities, which allowed him to maintain popular support throughout his two terms. This approach gave his administration a center-right orientation, blending conservative ideals with pragmatic policy decisions.

5. Reagan's presidency was subject to criticism from both sides of the political spectrum: conservatives felt he didn't go far enough on certain issues, while liberals criticized him for being too extreme. This duality reflects the difficulty of satisfying all factions within a politically diverse nation.

6. Historian Robert Collins characterized Reagan's approach as a balance between hard-shell conservatives and pragmatic moderates, which helped shape the administration's unique policy direction.

In summary, Ronald Reagan's presidency was a complex interplay of conservative ideals, political pragmatism, and the challenges of governing a nation with diverse and often conflicting interests. His legacy is one that reflects both the advancement of conservative principles and the necessity of compromise in the American political system.

Checking Conservative Tradition/33. The End Of The Cold War.txt
 The period following the end of the Cold War saw significant political developments that affected the trajectory of American politics and the conservative movement. Here's a summary of the key points mentioned:

- After Ronald Reagan's tenure, George H.W. Bush became president in 1989, having previously been Vice President under Reagan and known for his criticism of Reagan's economic policies during the 1980 primaries.
  
- Bush sought to present a moderate image early on, famously describing his administration as "kinder, gentler America." He was careful in his approach to the Soviet Union as it disintegrated, offering cooperation and aid rather than exploiting the situation.

- In 1992, George H.W. Bush faced a challenge from within his own party when Pat Buchanan, an advocate for protectionism and anti-immigrant policies, ran against him in the primaries. Buchanan's candidacy highlighted internal tensions within the Republican Party, which had been largely unified under Reagan.

- At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Buchanan delivered a keynote speech that was both a strong critique of the Democrats and an indirect jab at President Bush, despite calls for party unity. He credited Ronald Reagan with winning the Cold War and making Americans feel proud again.

- The election saw Ross Perot, a Texas businessman, enter and re-enter the race as an independent candidate, which ultimately may have contributed to President Bush's defeat by Bill Clinton.

- Despite the split among conservatives and the Democratic victory in the 1992 presidential election, the conservative movement remained strong. This was evidenced by the 1994 midterm elections, where Republicans won control of both houses of Congress for the first time since the 1950s, indicating the enduring influence of conservative ideas and policies in American politics.

Checking Conservative Tradition/34. Paleoconservatives And Theoconservatives.txt
 The passage discusses the evolution of conservative politics and alliances in America post-Cold War, particularly focusing on the relationship between udeo-Christian churches and Catholic institutions. It highlights a shared concern among conservatives about moral issues within the United States, such as abortion, homosexuality, and the spread of AIDS. The text emphasizes the growing collaboration between Protestants and Catholics, which was once unimaginable due to historical anti-Catholic sentiments.

Key developments that exemplified this newfound unity on the right included the anti-abortion movement Operation Rescue and the publication of "The End of Democracy," a symposium that argued the Supreme Court had overstepped its bounds by promoting an immoral agenda through its rulings, particularly on abortion. The symposium suggested that citizens might have to choose between their faith and their allegiance to America if the government continued to support such morally objectionable positions.

This ideological rift within conservatism was further highlighted by reactions from both secular conservatives like William Bennett, who advocated for working within the political system to effect change, and prominent neo-conservative Gertrude Himmelfarber, who argued that the Constitution should not be delegitimized over specific issues like slavery had not been in the past.

The passage underscores that the end of the Cold War revealed internal conflicts within the conservative movement, as the shared enemy of communism was no longer present, and different factions within conservatism had to navigate their ideological differences. This period saw a complex interplay between various conservative groups, each with its own interpretation of American values, morality, and the role of religion in public life.

Checking Conservative Tradition/35. Culture Wars.txt
1. The Dartmouth Review was a conservative student newspaper that played a significant role in the late 20th century as part of a broader movement of conservative student journals across American campuses, often with funding from conservative foundations like the Olin Foundation.

2. The editors and contributors of these journals, such as Dinesh D'Souza and Laura Ingraham, saw themselves as both philosophically conservative and temperamentally radical, aiming to challenge liberal dominance in academia.

3. A national debate erupted over proposed National History Standards commissioned by Lynn Chaney, the head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which many conservatives viewed as anti-American and heavily biased towards politically correct narratives.

4. The first draft of the standards was criticized by Lynn Chaney and others for its lack of focus on American achievements and positive references to historical figures like McCarthy and Harriet Tubman, and its negative portrayal of figures like John D. Rockefeller.

5. A revised second draft was less confrontational but still failed to meet the expectations of conservative critics who wanted a more celebratory curriculum that highlighted the achievements of white males and other historically marginalized success stories.

6. Lynn Chaney's book "Telling the Truth" reflects her perspective as a guardian of truth and common sense, while Gary Nash's memoir "History on Trial" defends the standards and argues for the inclusion of diverse American voices and experiences.

7. The controversy over the National History Standards highlights the ongoing debate about what history should teach us and the moral lessons it should convey, with different interpretations based on political and ideological perspectives.

Checking Conservative Tradition/36. Unresolved Paradoxes.txt
 Throughout these lectures, we have explored the multifaceted nature of conservatism as a political and social philosophy, particularly in the context of the English-speaking world, including Britain and the United States. We discussed the origins of conservative thought, tracing back to Edmund Burke's critique of the French Revolution and the Radical Enlightenment, and how his ideas laid the foundation for conservative ideology.

We examined key aspects of conservatism, such as its emphasis on tradition, hierarchy, authority, and a skepticism of utopian schemes that seek to radically restructure society. We also considered the role of religion in conservative thought, particularly Christianity, which often provides a moral framework for conservative values.

The course delved into the rise of conservatism in response to the industrial revolution and the challenges it posed to traditional ways of life. We saw how conservative thinkers like Orestes Brownson in America and Samuel Smiles in Britain responded by advocating for self-help and moral discipline as a means to adapt to societal changes while preserving core values.

We discussed the conservative response to socialism and communism, particularly the ideological competition during the Cold War. The conservative consensus in both the U.S. and Britain, characterized by a commitment to containment of Soviet expansion, was a defining feature of international politics from the end of World War II until the late 1980s.

The fall of the Soviet Union marked the end of an ideological rival and left conservatism as the dominant force in both countries. We considered the reasons for the resilience of conservatism, including the tendency for societies to become more conservative as they grow wealthier and as their populations age.

In conclusion, the lectures aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of how conservative ideas have shaped political discourse and policy-making in English-speaking nations, highlighting the adaptability and enduring influence of conservatism across different historical periods and contexts. Conservatism's emphasis on maintaining social order, preserving cultural heritage, and ensuring national security continues to inform contemporary debates and political decisions.
