30 minutes a day for the next year in the best college classrooms in the world.
The lecturers are university professors carefully selected by the teaching company and its customers
for intellectual distinction and teaching excellence.
The lectures on these tapes are titled The Self Under Siege Philosophy in the 20th Century.
The lecturer is Professor Rick Roderick of National University.
Rick Roderick, a native of Abilene, Texas, received his BA from the University of Texas
at Austin.
He did postgraduate work at Baylor University where he was the editor of the Baylor Philosophy
Journal before earning his doctorate at UT Austin.
Since 1977, Professor Roderick has taught philosophy at Baylor, the University of Texas,
Duke University and National University in Los Angeles.

Chapter 1, The Masters of Suspicion
The course that I'm about to present, philosophy at the end of the 20th century, The Self Under
Siege, has been a difficult course for me to develop over the years and it's been a
difficult subject matter for me because I have been trained in the classic tradition
of philosophy, studied ancient philosophy, I know many of the methods and have taken
all the required logic courses and so on.
I have also done a lot of work in continental philosophy as well.
It seems to me that the late 20th century presents us with one great and overriding problem
and that will be the focus of this course and I had second thoughts about even calling
it a course in philosophy because the most current philosophy, philosophical attempts
to understand both the self, society, our place in it and so on have been what I will
call deflationary.
I'll use for an example, I will just mention an article by the philosopher Richard Rarty
called The World Well Lost.
This is the up-shoot now remember of a tradition that's at least 2500 years old and now that
tradition is produced in tiny little articles, four or five page articles in journals that
are read by a number of people that's a small enough number that if they were all on a boat
and it sank they would have no readership and it could be a small boat.
It wouldn't need to be the leucotainia, it could be a raft perhaps but in any case Rarty
in one of these journals wrote an article called The World Well Lost and developed a
principle that I think has become widespread toward the end of the 20th century concerning
philosophy's role in informing us about our self or about the world.
The title itself indicates that the world well lost and Rarty's view is that any problem
that's been around for 2500 years and for which we still don't have a solution the right
response by the contemporary philosopher is I don't care.
And the charm of Rarty's answer is it's so American.
It's deeply rooted in our culture and it's in both the anti-intellectualism of our culture
in our fear of eggheads and so on.
And so in that sense it has a double significance I mean positively it means that the work of
intellectuals has always been separated off from the work of ordinary people.
In other words you have to be freed from the constraints of manual labor.
When I was a dishwasher I didn't have a lot of time to do this and when I was a union
organizer I didn't have a lot of time to do this.
Any time I was involved in manual labor I didn't really have the time to do this intellectual
work.
That separation that faithful separation between intellectual and manual labor has been with
philosophy throughout it's rather disappointing though to have that tradition the great tradition
of thinking in general be reduced to a comment like well gee I don't care we haven't figured
it out.
Similarly let me give you one more example of the profound results of recent contemporary
analytic philosophy.
The most widely accepted theory of truth is Tarski's theory of truth.
I won't do it justice here but I will I think give you an account that fairly summarizes
its main insight.
Tarski's theory of truth is that it goes something like this, Tarski says the senate
snow is white and he put snow and white in quotation marks is true if and only if snow
is white.
I don't expect anybody in the audience to gasp if you follow me.
This isn't a theory of truth this is the deflationary remark about how we use the word true.
It's just this is not the upshot of what we thought were the glowing and humanistic
accounts that I appreciate to this day developed by Socrates Aristotle all the way through
Aquinas and so on and in the late 20th century what we get in area after area are these what
I will call deflationary accounts.
On the upside these accounts don't pretend to know much I mean that's the upside for
me in other words they are not overly grand and I have no idea what other courses the
teaching company has been offering lately except through the catalog and I don't want
to undermine any of them but for example the a substantive attempt to defend God in an
intellectual setting where philosophical argument is key has been doomed for so long that that
won't be our central attention although we may mention that as we go by go through today.
Well why do I start with these rather snotty remarks if they are snotty I mean it may turn
out these deflationary things are all we do know that snow is white if and only if it's
white and that if we can't tell whether we're free or determined after 2000 something years
then the best attitude to take is I don't really give a damn I mean if that turns out
to be the right view we'll leave ourselves with that but there are some problems and
this is going to be the heart of the course about which a deflationary view is hard to
take and one is our view of ourselves as selves our own self-reflective view about what we
are as human beings what is our place in our society and our world and more importantly
maybe what is our place vis-a-vis our commitments our stations in life our roles as husbands
wives fathers and I guess today to be absolutely correct about everything significant others
significant other others dogs and cats whatever I mean you know just cover the whole gamut
here to try to be contemporary these are questions about which it's it's extremely
deflationary to go oh yes the self I haven't got one I mean that's that's disappointing in a
different kind of way I mean many of you say sentences that are true without having a theory
of truth I hope and I mean I routinely happens it happens in pool halls people say I can make
the eight and they make it you know that's that's true I mean we and yeah but you don't
then ask for a theory of truth very few of you have a theory of structural grammar or empirical
grammar but most of you don't say sentences like splogbub not you say sentences like it's
raining today and yet it would be kind of silly to ask you for a theory of grammar and again
the self is it is a different story with the self the human subject I'm not saying that you'll
tell your story whatever your story happens to be to just anyone but it's hard for me to imagine
and perhaps this difficulty in imagining it is just my difficulty in dealing with the world as it
is today it's difficult for me to imagine anyone taking that kind of cavalier attitude about
their view of themselves and I'd like to argue in a strong sense that every one of us has some
kind of theory of what we are as a person now by that I don't mean a really highly developed
theory like one in quantum mechanics or anything like that I may only mean the narrative story
something that connects our attempts to connect the various disconnected episodes in our lives
something that gives us a reason to think we're the same person today that we were yesterday in
some important sense if that sense only means that you've still got the same driver's license I
mean in some way we want to have a narrative about our lives about ourselves we want them to mean
something in short and I don't want to go off in this first lecture on a long exegetical set of
remarks on this new phrase which I'm afraid is going to be just a part of pop psychology the
politics of meaning I don't have any idea what they're talking about okay I don't know this isn't
what I'm what I'm not gonna something much more immediate and it may in fact have political
implications by that I mean it may mean that people can have refrigerators nice cars nice
homes nice children and nice degrees and you know nice friends and have absolutely no sense of who
the hell they are and be an utter despair in fact that condition on the account I'll be giving will
be structurally common this is not a like a slam on any people who are personally here in the
audience today or any people viewing me it's not a personal remark it's a structural condition
this and so therefore the title the self under siege and whether philosophy is the right discipline
to look at this problem or not is is unimportant to me because in looking at it myself I've been
guided more by the problem than by the discipline that I started out working in I mean when I look
at a college curriculum and see how it's divided and we've got curriculum committees that
re divide them like once a week or once a month and then once a year they I mean I don't give a
damn what studies this or who talks about it but that it's part of the ongoing conversation of our
species about itself you know who we are seems to me to be very important and even if it's taught
in the curriculum under the heading basket weaving it's an utterly crucially important topic in my
view the self under siege this is comes about I think in part that the sort of apocalyptic tone
to the lectures comes about in part because I really do believe that new factors new social
factors and others in the late 20th century have led to a kind of pressure on human beings on
selves not on as individuals not as individuals but on them anonymously in fact the systems I
have in mind are anonymous systems and I'd like to characterize a few of those and as I do so what
I'll be I'll be running through what I might call some of the pathologies of the 20th century and
and see if there's any way that a conversation rooted in philosophy in some sense at least could
help us find our way about in it the most obvious one in the late 20th century and I thought about
this in the hotel room this morning as I saw the arteries of the beltway running like human blood
through a body into the city and then I also thought about the following thing I think I
mentioned at the end of my last lecture on Nietzsche when I was discussing the postmodern
condition and that's what I would call the information overload and and I'll try to try to
make make this come alive with a different with an example from a different culture let's take
being a Tonkawa Indian in West Texas there they weren't a very well-known tribe but they are from
my home area so I'll mention them the Tonkawa Indians reservoirs for meaning the best cultural
anthropology work we have were rich but a limited array of roles stations things to be and so on
but they were rich and holistic in other words in that sense there was an array of things you could
choose to be there were a wide array you could choose not to be like chief you didn't exactly
choose to be that but among this array the decision paths were relatively simple relatively simple
and the information load you received in the load of information the number of images and so on
that you saw the number of things that actually touched your skin impinged upon your perceptual
apparatus that's quite limited compare that situation to the 19th century and already we have
human beings under a considerably more pressure because from the late 19th and into the early
20th century we many things come about that we don't think about philosophically but which shape
our reflection not only in philosophy but in everyday life I mean we walk into a bee Dalton's
as though there were always cheap paperbacks available to everyone but that's actually a
quite recent development in the history of the world we fill our universities with them as though
there there are some ancient treasure and television is some degraded form of the present and of
course that's idiocy those cheap books have only been around very recently in the history of the
thinking television now has been around for about you know almost a third of that time so it so
the point I'm driving at here is the incredible increase in information the amount and the
tons of information this city itself and I think I've said this before too this city itself
Washington DC is a good example I think if you took all the information collected in the history
of the world between the dawn of humanity earlier than the Dead Sea Scrolls back when oh I don't
know hell maybe Steven Spielberg did it in Jurassic Park back when dinosaurs put their tails in the
mud and whatever all the marks sensible marks left by beings of whatever kind I'm almost certain
that in the last eight years in Washington there's more information piled in four buildings than
the whole previous informational load of the history of the human species to give you an
example that may be more immediate think of the JFK assassination is our problem there lack of
complexity lack of information no no we know too damn much about it way too much there are too
many possible assassins too many secret plots too many too many movies too many books and under
this kind of complexity the self finds itself in a position where the array of choices of what
to believe or not to believe become bewildering utterly bewildering now this is about events like
you know the assassination and so on but you know the more important beliefs or beliefs about
ourselves become equally bewildering in the earlier phase of capitalism in the 18th and 19th
century the average worker would change jobs in a lifetime and I think this went on through the
40s and 50s you'd change jobs once maybe twice a lifetime now people change jobs seven or eight
times in a lifetime what I'm pointing to here is that the self must find meaning now however it
finds it in a system in which it is it just seems to me objectively true that the complexity level
has reached a point at which nobody and this is not Cartesian doubt you know this isn't doubt
brought on by an evil genie who makes me wrong to my clear mind no we doubt in a different way
now we doubt that we could know enough about the big picture to even make sense I mean that's why
you know one of the the battle cries of these lectures will be to just make sense because
that will be very difficult to do because we'll be doing it in a situation in which there's way
too much to make sense about and under in a situation in which the complexity of the systems
within which we try to make sense or way way too complicated even our purest motives get
caught up in these systems give you an example and I don't mean to have every environmentalist
in the world burn my tapes but let me give you example of system complexity suppose America
got behind recycling massively and we began to recycle and become a very efficient society
would all be proud of each other and in our and I mean you know nobody like debates environmentalism
anymore right even McDonald's is an environmentalist now I mean for God's sakes McDonald's goes yeah
I mean they're even for Martin Luther King now I wish they were there a few years ago but
anyway that's another point not a not a happy one but now suppose we became that environmentally
conscious well we'd all feel good our society would be cleaner what would be the outcome in
the third world where the only things they have to sell us are cheap labor and things that we
can't ruin in this country I don't think it's a long causal argument to see that an American
Renaissance and environment would be utterly disastrous for countries in the third world have
nothing to sell us but poisonous gunk I mean this is this is bad the bad news this is in a way
the disappointing thing about even contemporary political attempts to make sense of the self I
mean we hear politicians say oh well there's no conflict between the environment and the economy
and we go yeah I guess it doesn't have to be but we to the extent that we give it thought at all
it's not within the context of these large massively complex systems about which believe me Bill
Clinton I think clearly doesn't know any more than anyone in this room in fact I think the judgment
of the American people as he knows far less that most of these and this certainly isn't the time
to make a didactic political argument to bring in the last bunch of hacks who also couldn't
deal with complexity because the self under siege part of what it's about is the complexity of
meaning now this makes the world a double world in a way the world is on the one hand as rationalized
as it's ever been that means that down to its smallest detail we have chased what you might
call what I will call information what universities call knowledge I don't view it as knowledge I'm
sorry I just I look at it as information I it is that itself is a deflationary term we have
tons of that it's rational that we chase it down now here's the paradox is that a world filled
with instrumental what I will call instrumental rationality and by instrumental I will mean
technical rationality the kind that is measurable quantifiable that can be found in many of the
sciences in banking accounting and so on advertising the law and so on that this kind of
technical reason produces a situation in which human beings themselves don't feel rational and it
and with the especially with a younger audience and I think this is really true with the 20 or 30
somethings that are out there listening to me ask around and see how many of your friend if you
think the self isn't under siege in the late 20th century ask yourself how many of your friends are
on 12-step programs to stop something ask yourselves given the current use of the word dysfunctional
who's not I mean you know I mean I all I mean this is to me the best sign that the self is under
crisis there's a 12-step program to stop eating of course if it succeeded utterly you would die
12-step programs to stop having sex if that succeeded utterly the species would die
12-step programs to stop thinking or what we need next of course they have those already they're called
network television that's sort of a 12-step program that's on every night but in any case
the self is under siege in this sense now I don't want to here's going to be the problem of the
lecture is to try to give a sense for what the self was sort of more authentically because that's
the really difficult nut to crack is that I too am sort of left with what one person who enjoys
some of the paradoxes of chaos is called a fractal self you know a fractal self one that
sort of reproduces itself and I'm like this over here and this over here I'm a poker player here
and a lecturer here and a and a tv star here yeah and so on but I mean it's not like that you're
that this is some wisdom I can impart simply to you but a joint project and I hope we'll
lead to a conversation about it okay just a few more things here I need to get in and they're very
important we are in a unique situation visa v meaning the meaning of the self in our own human
autonomy it is a unique situation for you for for as far as I know most of the history of this species
there have been culturally available reservoirs of meaning that were relatively stable and within
which we could find a place for ourselves now this is not an argument to go back to any of those
archaic structures I'm just trying to bring alive how they gave meaning I mean a slave's life had a
meaning it was a horrible and barbaric meaning from my perspective but it was a meaning and so that
doesn't this is not an argument for slavery I think those are only made today by people like
pat Buchanan I don't have rational arguments to return to the institution of slavery I'm sure
somebody on the far right will think of one for me but I don't have them but we have we have we
have eras dominated by what are fairly called worldviews where people find themselves within
those views they find a place that their life can have meaning within in particular and for our
for western culture the great religions have been such a place within which people could find
the sort of what you might call life's final question why am I here what good do I do
what's the point in me being here where do I go when I'm through big question Job kind of had
problems with that one God didn't really answer me just got pissed off I mean you know if you've
read the book of Job you know God doesn't answer the question he just gets mad who the hell are you
Job you tiny little mutant what is this you know I made you I can make another one just like you
shut up I mean this is God I'm not saying God was wrong answer that way I'm not in a position to
talk about God that way no in as long as that could sustain people faith in some kind of higher
being then there could still be a reservoir of meaning and if you notice that still the
neo-conservative response is that we need a religious revival in this country the trouble
is with that response is that we have to pass through one a set of complex intellectual maneuvers
where we either know or suspect we know and I'll say this will be sort of really to get
around to the topic of the first lecture whether we know or we suspect we know that those belief
systems have come under considerable suspicion okay considerable suspicion in fact one of the
legacies of the of the 19th century and this is the title of my first lecture which I'm just now
getting around it explaining or trying to explain the title of my first lecture is the Masters of
Suspicion it's a wonderful book called the Philosophy of Paul Recours collects a whole
series of articles by the French philosopher Paul Recours and I'm not interested in all the articles
he has one in here about the critique of religion and in it he mentions the three great masters of
suspicion of the 19th century and it's not merely their intellectual work that began to make us feel
estranged and alienated and separated from the holy world of previous times the world in which we
could find our meaning in God or through his works they reflect a sea change in the species view of
itself I wouldn't I would have included the name of Darwin the first you know to give a natural
explanation of how we got here to give in the case of Marx and Nietzsche and Freud the reason
they're mentioned by Recours is they raise a criticism that I personally don't see how any
argument could get around in a way it's a counterpart to the believer's faith just like
the believer's faith even today in the late 20th century if you want to hang on to it stubbornly
enough can't be shaken although that's cold comfort given that any belief you want to hang on to
stubbornly can't be shaken through the nature of human beings to be stubborn obdurate to reason and
so on the suspicion they raise is is much deeper and and I think Recours puts them together well
because when you're faced and you will be in at least in some exciting intellectual context with
these critiques of religion at first you will notice only the negative part in other words the
destructive part of the criticisms and I'll run through them quickly I mean then they can be run
through quickly because these names Nietzsche Marx and Freud even Bill Bennett agrees they're all
classics okay so we're not you know we're not in here to like convert anyone to any other new
religion or anything these are classics they are in fact markers in our culture of this sea change
I'm talking about they put before us the problem of false consciousness of the self being false
to itself that problem is one that religion was ill equipped to deal with ill equipped to deal with
as long as we could believe with Descartes that if we knew something clearly and distinctly
we knew it we were okay but then when the suspicion crept in from the direction of Freud
that we could know something but it would really be a forbidden piece of our sexual history
prohibited and thus channeled in another direction that that was bubbling out of our little lips
then and that consciously we'd never admit it I mean I'm by the way not being a full-blown full
of a blown friday and I do believe sometimes pencil is just a pencil I think any one of these
theories can be taken too far but it's clearly the case that the field of the unconscious
undercuts religion a very important way gives a very profound explanation of it
of it is a white people go well how in the world could we not have a
a belief in God this seems to be most americans attitude even those who are not catholics
jewish christian whatever they just answer those damn surveys that you get in USA today
where 98 percent of them go I believe in God which of course that just irritates the hell out of me
I mean I grew up around baptists that that that hated that they loved God they loved their fellow
man but they just hated folks you know what I mean they loved God but they hated everybody they knew
I mean it was just you get a lot of that from like the jesse helms crowd I mean they just
love God but they hate everybody else badly sort of irritating given the great religious traditions
in any case a Freud raises a suspicion that when we're very very small we're very very insecure
we cry out to these larger beings for help and they give it to us and we go oh I see
but when we get older and and I think what I think a very nice passage in literature
is a Ray Bradbury is dandelion wine I hope I hope some of you have read this book
it's about a young man growing up in the Midwest and he goes to the movies it's a cowboy and
Indian movie he looks up on the screen and he's about 12 whatever and he sees an Indian being shot
and and for this is he goes to cowboy and Indian movies all the time but today it occurs to him
Douglas that he too one day will die he goes oh it's a bummer thing so he gets out of the theater
and he's he begins to ponder that you know that's that's really that's really bad I too one day will
will die well that kind of insecurity that we all have I mean the only democratic institution
contrary to popular political theory in the world is death utterly democratic seems to me
I mean if you want something that's democratic there it is it's death it's utterly democratic
it seems to me that that young Douglas is going to go to his mom and dad and and and
they'll talk to him about it and explain how it fits and so on and then we'll come that shattering
night when you're about 16 and you find out mom and dad are afraid to die too or maybe 14
and you know on a Freudian account it's not accidental that that's the time at which you
reach out for large and invisible fathers to protect you and mothers but and you know what
that's that's an elegant suspicion it is not an argument it's an elegant suspicion in fact when
you look at the the iconic significance of churches you know the the father the son the holy
ghost the family values stuff you know I mean I hate to sound cynical but as Freud says the whole
thing is so patently infantile so obviously infantile that to anyone with the love of humanity
it's just sad to think that most people will never rise above this view of life well when
when you've had a snotty German talk to you that way you begin to suspect he may be right and this
is one of the masters of suspicion Marx comes out of some a different direction he has noticed
that history is generally written by the sides that win you may notice that terrorists are people
who have not yet won and after terrorists win they are freedom fighters and after you've forgotten
their freedom fighters then they are called chancellors or whatever Marx has noticed this
and he's also noticed the complicity of religion with this and I don't want to this is not about
ragging on religion this is about trying to explain why it could never be the safe harbor that it
used to be because even for for those of you with faith and I haven't said I don't have it
the faith is rounded in by what complexity suspicion doubt and I'm not talking now about
doubt whether you know I doubt my faith no I mean doubt that even if you unconsciously don't
doubt it you're still screwed up you're wrong that's the problem of false consciousness
that's why it's severe as you could be absolutely clear you have no doubt
and it could be just a pure abstract cultural mechanism and not you and not you
in the case of uh of Marx what's my being masked is economic interest I mean this
inside is belong to our culture too I think many of you will be familiar with joe hill song
you'll get pie in the sky when you die and there is a certain style of american religion I call it
the billy graham style I don't dislike billy but it is notable that you could that billy graham you
know plays golf with the pharaoh I mean that's not like moses leading his people out of bondage
I mean moses didn't play golf with the pharaoh and pray over the pharaoh's trips it's just a
confusing thing when you see that you know it's not like the story exactly it's hard to imagine
billy graham being crucified although I've suggested it on occasion
people don't seem to listen I try I try I mean you know I'm not saying there aren't there aren't
any religious figures that are significant in the 20th century there are magnificent ones like gondi
Martin Luther King they appear as rare exceptions rare exceptions I mean there are still people
that try to leave their people out of bondage not everybody plays golf with the pharaoh but the
suspicion hangs over the entire religious enterprise that it serves vested interests
economic interests to be blunt with marks and I enjoy a blunt account of everything
that they are involved with that shit called money the fundamental criticism marks house of
capitalism is correct communism is stupid but the fundamental criticism is correct
and that's that our being is shaped by that murder that yuck called money
still is now that doesn't does that reduce complexity no not anymore it doesn't
money flows around the world in tiny little circuits we carry it in our pockets and little
computer cards we beg for it we have like one little note on our credit history and we can't
get a loan for a car you know it's just even money isn't simple anymore I mean some people pray for
the day when there used to be highwaymen you could at least stop a coach and go give me your money
and get money but now you can't even go to the bank and get it and I thought they had money at banks
but no they don't you go in I'd like some money no we don't have it sorry you don't know where to
go then right it's confusing this is complexity okay the third critique of religion comes from
Nietzsche and it's about the reversal that comes about when the religious as it were tricked themselves
about what they're really doing and I think that there are some great examples of this and and I
I'm going to go for the easy examples since I'm running out of time okay is that fair enough
I'm running out of time for the first lecture I'll go for the easy examples
and and these examples of course are christian televangelism although although
subtler forms of this are always possible it's like television you get the crude quick version on
tv but because everybody practically that we're around was raised by it then they give you the
slightly more complicated human versions of what brought them up they're televisions
it's pretty scary that's why the self is under siege all of these are reasons why it is
Nietzsche has noticed that uh something's happened like like the following uh
I'll try to sum it up with with something I heard one night uh Jerry Falwell say
by the way this is all philosophical don't get confused when we do philosophy my way we just
talk about what's going on and to try to find our way about because my negative remarks were
if you think that like John Rawls from Harvard can come up here and help you with this problem
then then it's useless it's I can't either but we're going to at least talk about my inability
to do so there's a difference so I call that the Socratic difference I'm willing to talk about my
inability to figure out who I am and my guess that most of you have the same problem anyway let me
go back to my Falwell story because it's too funny to leave out you know I think it's funny
Falwell has a line where he goes you know I love the homosexual but I hate his homosexuality
for Nietzsche that's a profound Christian remark oh we Christians we love our enemies we love our
enemies if they hit us we don't even hit them back but someday our kingdom will come you've seen the
bumper stickers someday our kingdom too will come of course they say that because people are supposed
to be so very humble in all they say it's an irony not appreciated by everyone the greatest
passage here and I've used it in a tape before so if you have the other tape just replay it now
but uh now the other uh uh Nietzsche has this wonderful quote where he goes Dante I think
committed a crude blunder which is of course already a fairly arrogant remark but he's a
German so what the hell Dante I think committed a crude blunder when above the gateway to the
Christian paradise he placed the words I mean above the gateway to the Christian uh uh Halley
placed the words I too was created by eternal love I mean that isn't Dante above the gateway to hell
as I too was created by eternal love Nietzsche says it would be it would be it would be truer
to place above the gateway to the Christian paradise I too was created by eternal hate
provided that one could write a truth above the gateway to a lie
the people that write that pungently raise suspicions in our minds you know they raise
these suspicions and it's not just them if you read st. Thomas carefully say and I'm not talking
now about one of these renegade 19th century figures that set the stage for this sort of
problem of meaning that we're faced with in the late 20th but st. Thomas Aquinas himself says that
among the among the chief pleasures in heaven will be that God will be kind enough to let us see the
torments of the damned meanwhile we live in faith in hope and in compassion after these three are
through with our intellectual culture marks Nietzsche and Freud no one can believe no one
it's like childhoods end for our culture follow me it's childhoods end you know how
you can believe something when you're a child and it's not like you can't come to believe it again
when you're 60 you may be cynical about it again until you're 60 but these critiques mark childhoods
end in regard to finding meaning in that religious framework and i mean paul recour has a beautiful
phrase for it he says uh the positive significance of these uh these criticisms i've mentioned
is what they have in common and that's their iconoclasm the fight against the gods of men
that's very interesting in other words their iconoclasm is their fight against the gods we've
created so far that's and that is what they have in common he goes on to say this atheism that we've
just discussed this attack on the god or the gods of men is not of the kind that that that some
philosopher is going to get up and dispute because this has to do with the very things that form
the consciousness of the person who would be willing to dispute it in other words you'll you'll
never know after marx and and and leech and Freud whether your argument is an argument or a symptom
you follow me you won't know whether you've got a good argument or a bad symptom you just there's
no that's the problem of finding you know your real self here and uh recour himself as a Christian
and so he says the following a marxist critique of ideology a Nietzschean critique of resentment
which is what i just discussed and a Freudian critique of infantile distress or hereafter
the views through which any kind of mediation of faith must pass now does that mean that every
ordinary religious person has to know these writers and stuff no these suspicions have become
widespread in our culture we don't need any more in a way to be instructed in them because they
permeate our culture this is what conservatives complain about in a way they go well you know
every time they show a Christian on tv he's either out for money or he really hates people
or it's some sexual thing where does that come from see the cultural critique of these people has
insinuated itself everywhere so the first thing you think when someone comes on a little too strong
with religion is you start running through the masters of suspicion going well what does he want
my billfold what kind of is he on some bizarre sexual trip is this another jimmy swagger thing
what kind of power trip is it for him you know i mean we've got some of these guys in dallas now
who just get on tv and say give me money because god says for you to give me money you give me
money and you'll get some money back not from me but from god he'll keep god's money and you'll get
money from god and that's a nice deal between him and god so wonderful advantage okay now
the reason i've spent so much time on these masters of suspicion the title of the first
lecture masters of suspicion these are critiques that were developed in the 19th and end of the
20th century they've become a common possession of our culture and they've cut off one of the
reservoirs within which we might find a coherent meaning for our life one of the reservoirs being
religious faith not entirely it's not like we can't go back and have it it's that we must have
it under the mark of complexity follow me under the mark of insecurity under the mark of confusion
about it it's not that you can't it's just under those marks and then i think that i'll close this
first lecture with a brief uh little story from a movie the big chill now i hate to film the big
chill let me make that clear and i hope i can't be sued for hating a movie i hate the big chill
because it's about members of my generation all of whom have become swine the only person in the
movie i like is dead when the movie starts and they're having his funeral and the old preacher
says something quite profound he asked the crowd of young yuppies he goes isn't our common life
together and just being a good man enough to sustain us anymore and the answer to that is no
it's no it's why people hate bill clinton the symbolic reason they hated is it is there was
this background of son kennedy asked meaning and he was supposed to deliver it and it turns out he's
just another slightly overweight southern guy and uh our lives don't mean any more than they did a
year ago and we're and we're pissed we're mad at him we're going dammit bill we wanted an adventure
we wanted meaning wanted hope it's not just tax and spend i mean of course if you have somebody
i want your money give it to me they don't like you but i mean i thought that they can't figure
that out either that's part of their problem in politics uh in any case uh the the question
the big chill is what i wanted to conclude with and that's uh the uh the rhetorical question the
preacher asks unfortunately with the self under siege in the late 20th century the answer to that
is no our common life among our fellow human beings and leading the life of just a good man or woman
is not enough to sustain us anymore it's a shame
