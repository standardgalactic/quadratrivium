Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/01 - The Masters Of Suspicion.txt
 In this section of the lecture, the speaker discusses the influence of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud—often referred to as the "masters of suspicion"—on contemporary culture. These thinkers have provided lenses through which many view religion and other aspects of society, often leading to suspicions about the motives behind religious expressions. The speaker points out that these critiques have permeated our culture so thoroughly that they shape common perceptions without everyone needing to be explicitly familiar with these theorists' works.

The speaker uses the term "masters of suspicion" to describe the ways in which Marx saw religion as a form of ideology used to maintain class structures, Nietzsche viewed it as an expression of ressentiment (resentment), and Freud saw it as a way to cope with infantile distress. These perspectives have influenced how people, especially in the West, look at religious beliefs and institutions, often leading to skepticism or even cynicism.

The speaker also notes that these critiques have made it more challenging for individuals to find coherent meaning in their lives through religion, as faith is now viewed through a complex, insecure, and confused lens. The cultural narrative has shifted, and religious expressions are often met with suspicion or are seen as motivated by power, money, or sexual desires.

The lecture concludes with a story from the movie "The Big Chill" to illustrate the sense of disillusionment and the search for meaning that characterizes the late 20th century. The speaker highlights the idea that simply living a good life alongside others is not enough to fulfill the deep yearning for meaning that many feel in this era. The answer to finding meaning seems to be elusive, and the cultural landscape is marked by a sense of malaise and a quest for something more substantial than what was previously taken for granted.

Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/02 - Heidegger And The Rejection Of Humanism.txt
1. The lecture begins with the professor discussing the concept of authenticity in the context of Heidegger's philosophy. He contrasts the search for an authentically human account with traditional philosophical approaches that tend to be abstract and rationalistic.

2. The professor acknowledges that Heidegger offers a more concrete understanding of human existence within the world and the concept of fleeing from oneself, which is an important aspect of his thought.

3. Despite Heidegger's flaws, particularly his association with the Nazis, the professor emphasizes the value in his work for freeing us from certain philosophical prejudices and for providing a more grounded perspective on human being.

4. The professor suggests that our lives should be more than just pursuing wealth and physical appearance, urging us to seek out something more meaningful and substantial. He uses historical examples like the defenders of the Alamo or figures like Davey Crockett to illustrate a life with a narrative beyond the mundane.

5. The professor encourages students to recognize their own mortality as part of the human condition, which should be both a source of relief and a reminder of the importance of living an authentic and interesting life.

6. The lecture concludes by emphasizing the importance of fearing death and realizing that no amount of health or wealth can change this fundamental aspect of being human.

7. The professor hints at the next topic, which will be Sartre's account of human existence, as a famous alternative to Heidegger's views.

In summary, the lecture is an exploration of authenticity in human existence, with a critical examination of Heidegger's philosophy, and a call for students to seek out a meaningful narrative for their lives that transcends superficial concerns.

Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/03 - Sartre And The Roads To Freedom.txt
1. **Sartre and the Average Woman's Magazine**: In discussing Sartre's caloric intake, the speaker reflects on how the average woman's magazine advocates for fewer calories than what prisoners in concentration camps like Treblinka received, indicating that societal standards for women may not have advanced as much as one might think.

2. **Sarkra's Relevance**: The speaker points out that with the resurgence of the '60s fashion, it might be worth revisiting other aspects of the '60s, such as Sartre's pursuit of freedom and authenticity. Sartre did an interview for Playboy, which demonstrates his cultural impact.

3. **Sarkra's Philosophical Contributions**: The speaker recommends Sartre's works like "Nausea," "The Words" by Sartre, and "Search for a Method." In "Search for a Method," Sartre argues that modernity, including both capitalism and its critique, Marxism, are still in their infancy as ideas.

4. **Marxism and Trade Unions**: The speaker clarifies that trade unions, not Marxism, were the original creators of the working-class movement, with Marx dedicating his life to this cause.

5. **Critique of Dialectical Reason**: While the speaker recommends Sartre's "Search for a Method," they also advise that the reader should think twice about tackling the entire four or five thousand pages due to its length and the finite nature of life.

6. **Sartre as a Human Being**: The speaker emphasizes that for Sartre, philosophy was not just an intellectual pursuit but a means to live authentically and construct a self worth discussing. The speaker admires Sartre for his dedication to living a life worth talking about and considers him a success in his quest for freedom and selfhood.

7. **Final Thoughts**: The speaker encourages the audience to consider how they can seek their own selfhood under siege, as Sartre did, and suggests that his approach to life and philosophy is still relevant and worthy of study.

Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/04 - Marcuse And One-Dimensional Man.txt
 The narrator reflects on the essence of human existence and the quest for meaning in a society that often simplifies complex issues through banalization. They acknowledge the limitations of their own understanding and the fact that many of the questions about human purpose and behavior are still unformed or incorrectly stated. The narrator criticizes the tendency to trivialise significant social movements, like the ones from the 60s, into mere fashion trends or jokes to maintain control over the populace.

This banalization is a part of the larger societal mechanism that reduces complexity and social threats to maintain order. The educational system, according to the narrator, also contributes to this state by producing students who are disengaged and disconnected from meaningful engagement with their environment or their own potential for critical thought.

The narrator muses on how past thinkers like Herbert Marcuse, who made similar critiques of society, might now be looked upon with nostalgia alongside the cultural relics of the 60s. They speculate that ideas and movements considered threatening to the system may be romanticized and normalized once they are no longer a threat or when they are resurfaced for new generations to consider.

In essence, the narrator is examining the ways in which society attempts to manage complexity by simplifying it, often at the cost of genuine intellectual engagement and meaningful discourse on pressing issues. The discussion raises questions about how individuals can navigate these complex systems and whether they can ever truly understand themselves or their place in the world.

Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/05 - Habermas And The Fragile Dignity Of Humanity.txt
1. **Interpretation and the Self**: The self is an interpretive being, and in the late 20th century, interpretation has become more complex due to technological advancements like television, which can bypass upper brain functions and directly influence our minds.

2. **The Role of Reason**: In the face of cynical reason and the complexities of modern life, Habermas defends the idea of communicative reason—the belief that people can communicate truthfully and rationally to one another. This is an attempt to promote enlightenment and rational discourse despite the challenges posed by systems of money and power.

3. **Habermas' Contribution**: Habermas' work, particularly in his later stages, such as "Theories of Communicative Action," addresses the issues of money and power influencing our everyday communication. He suggests that these systems need to be harmonized for genuine face-to-face dialogue to be possible.

4. **Habermas' Optimism**: Despite the potential for a dystopian future as depicted in Orwell's "1984," Habermas remains an optimist regarding human reason and our ability to communicate effectively. He believes that if we can align the structures of money and power with our communicative actions, we might avoid seeing reality through a "glass darkly" and instead find a way out of the current entwinement of enlightenment and terror.

5. **Habermas' Influence**: For these reasons, Habermas' work is influential and deserving of credit because it offers a strong argument for the possibility of rational discourse and the improvement of human conditions through better communication structures.

Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/06 - Foucault And The Disappearance Of The Human.txt
1. Michel Foucault, a French philosopher, introduced the concept of Panopticism, which is the idea that individuals are constantly observed by an authority, leading to self-regulation and internalization of norms, creating what he calls "docile bodies" that conform to societal expectations.

2. The Panopticon is a design for a prison where a single watchman can observe all inmates without them being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. This principle has been extended beyond prisons to other institutions like schools, hospitals, and even malls.

3. Foucault's work suggests that society functions as a carceral gulag, where individuals are subject to constant surveillance and control, which can lead to a form of social imprisonment. This is not about physical confinement but about the psychological effects of societal norms and expectations.

4. The fascination with criminals in media culture is a reflection of society's secret attraction to rebellion against societal rules, as well as a fear of crime. It's a compensation for our ambivalent feelings towards law-breakers—our simultaneous fear and admiration for their defiance.

5. In the context of Foucault's work, the overemphasis on criminal justice, especially in the United States, can be seen as a response to this fascination with criminals. It also highlights societal issues related to race and ethnicity, as certain groups are more likely to be monitored or arrested within institutions.

6. The "docile body" is a metaphor for the controlled and conforming individual that society expects, which can be seen in various aspects of daily life, including interactions with retail spaces like malls.

7. Foucault's ideas challenge the notion of power as something that is merely exerted by one group over another but instead presents it as a network of social relations that are constantly being negotiated and maintained through observation, surveillance, and self-regulation.

Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/07 - Derrida And The Ends Of Man.txt
1. The lecture begins by acknowledging that a statement about economy shouldn't be a joke, but it's used here to introduce the topic with a light touch.
   
2. The speaker highlights Derrida's impact on academia, particularly his challenge to the dominance of "white mythologies" in university curricula by advocating for the inclusion of other cultural narratives, such as those from women and people of color.
   
3. Derrida's approach unsettles traditional hierarchies of knowledge and opens up space for a variety of perspectives to be considered with equal validity.
   
4. The speaker suggests that Derrida's work is not just academic but also possesses a sense of humor, which can make learning more engaging, especially in competition with other forms of entertainment.
   
5. The lecture references Derrida's playful side and his book "Spurs," where he interprets a seemingly mundane note left by Nietzsche—"I forgot my umbrella"—as a philosophical puzzle.
   
6. The speaker argues that Derrida's approach to interpretation encourages a more nuanced understanding of texts and can lead to a more diverse and humane way of engaging with literature and culture.
   
7. The lecture concludes by emphasizing that there is no definitive reading or final word in the humanities, and this class will also resist providing a last word, encouraging students to engage with ongoing debates and interpretations.

Checking Self Under Siege - Philosophy in the 20th Century - Rick Roderick/08 - Fatal Strategies.txt
1. **Complexity of Postmodernism**: Frederic Jameson and Jean Baudrillard offer complex perspectives on postmodernism. Jameson discusses it as a cultural logic characterized by pastiche, schizophrenia, and hyperfunctionality, which makes it hard to read and understand. Baudrillard sees the world becoming hyperreal, where simulations of reality become more important than the real itself.

2. **Postmodern Critique**: The critique of postmodernism often points out its potential to trivialize or oversimplify complex issues, which can lead to a reduction of the richness and nuance of human experiences into mere images or simulations.

3. **Human-Technology Interaction**: In this new era, humans are increasingly intertwined with technology. This relationship is complex and can be seen in everyday life, such as in the design of malls, where the paths are designed to control pedestrian flow and in the architecture of buildings like the one in Atlanta that gleams like a palace.

4. **Social Stratification**: Despite the glossy surface of postmodernity, there is still a significant lack of sympathy for those who have been left behind or "fallen off the track" due to societal changes. The modernist, rationalized, capitalist system continues to dominate, with residual elements like patriarchy still present.

5. **Counterpower and Humanity**: There is hope that despite the overwhelming power of the hyperreal, counterpowers exist and will continue to emerge. Images and experiences can still have the power to remind us of our humanity and prompt us to fight for it in the battles between the self and society.

6. **Conclusion and Call to Action**: The lecturer concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the complexity of postmodernism, understanding its impact on society, and acknowledging the struggles individuals face as they navigate this new terrain. He encourages listeners to engage with these ideas further and to consider how they might respond to or resist the hyperreal in their own lives.

7. **Final Note**: The lecturer, Tom Rollins, concludes by inviting listeners to learn more about these topics through additional courses from The Teaching Company and reminds them to call or visit online for more information.
