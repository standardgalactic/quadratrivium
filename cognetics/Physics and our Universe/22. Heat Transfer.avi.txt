Welcome to lecture 22, whose subject is heat transfer.
It's kind of a redundant term because as you learned in the previous lecture, heat means
energy that is in transit, that is being transferred from one place to another because of a temperature
difference.
So heat transfer is kind of a redundant term, but it's widely used in physics and engineering
to describe the processes whereby heat flows.
So we want to ask here, how does heat flow?
We've got a temperature difference, we've got a heat flow, but why?
What process is carrying the energy?
And this lecture is going to look at three important mechanisms of heat transfer and
some applications both in technology and simple things like building design and in
nature as well.
So the first heat transfer mechanism and in some ways the most familiar one is conduction.
Conduction is a process of heat transfer between objects that are in direct contact.
So let's take a look.
Here's a beaker sitting on a hot plate.
The hot plate is hot, it's being heated by electrical energy that's warming up this top
of the hot plate and the beaker is in contact with the hot plate so energy is moving directly
by contact between the metal of the hot plate and the glass of the beaker and then into
the water.
What exactly are the details of that mechanism?
The details are that the internal energy, the temperature of this hot plate is high.
And as we'll see in another lecture or two, internal energy is a measure ultimately of
molecular motion, molecular kinetic energy molecules moving around and when the temperature
is higher they're moving around faster.
So the rapidly moving molecules in the hot plate are colliding with more slowly moving
molecules in the walls of the beaker and when a molecular transfer like that occurs it tends
to move energy preferentially from the hotter that is the faster moving molecules to the
slower moving ones and then the molecules in the beaker transfer their energy further
on and that process of direct contact materials in contact is what transfers energy by conduction.
Eventually the energy gets to the inside wall of the beaker where it's transferred by conduction
to the water and then another mechanism which we'll discuss shortly takes over.
So heat transfer by conduction is a molecular process that requires two substances to be
in direct contact otherwise heat can't flow through them.
We happen to be recording these lectures in January so in here it's a nice comfortable
temperature in the studio but outdoors it's actually a little bit below freezing.
And so the walls of this room are transferring heat through themselves to the outside because
of the temperature difference between the inside and the outside and we have to burn
fuel or consume electricity or something else in order to make up for the energy being lost
through largely through conduction through the walls.
Let's take a more detailed look at how conduction actually occurs.
So let's go over to our big monitor and do some mathematics of conduction.
So to give you a simple picture of conduction here's a slab of material of some sort and
I'm going to assume that one side of the material is at a high temperature TH and the other
side is at a lower temperature TC the red for hot the blue for cold.
The slab has an area A and it has a thickness delta X and I've indicated by these wavy
lines a heat flow which I will designate H.
So that's the conductive heat flow because I'm talking about the process of heat conduction.
It's measured in watts.
It's the rate at which energy is being transferred.
Rate of energy is power.
So this is the power flowing through that particular area A of that slab of material.
And what's that depend on?
Well clearly it depends on the area A. If I make the area A bigger I've got more molecules
to do that transferring and so the heat transfer is going to be say make the area twice as
great there'll be twice as much heat being transferred.
So the conductive heat flow will be proportional to the area.
Certainly it will be proportional to the temperature difference.
If I make the two temperatures the same there's going to be no heat flow.
The molecules are moving in same average speed on both sides.
But if one side is hotter than the other than that energy transfer process that I described
microscopically occurs and a flow develops of heat of energy that is proportional to
that temperature difference delta T, T hot minus T cold.
There's also a property of the material that helps determine how much heat flows through
it and that property is called the thermal conductivity.
It's given the symbol K. It's how good a conductor of heat substance is.
If K is big it's a good conductor of heat and for a relatively small temperature difference
you get a large flow.
If it's small the material becomes a good insulator and you get relatively little heat
flow for a given temperature difference.
And it's inversely proportional to not surprisingly the distance.
The longer the distance the heat has to go through the harder it's going to be for it
to flow.
So the thickness delta X also comes into this calculation of the heat flow.
Put that all together and you get that the heat flow is proportional to this thermal conductivity,
the area, the temperature difference and the thickness.
This quantity delta T divided by delta X, the rate of change of temperature with position
is called the temperature gradient and it's positive in the direction that goes from lower
to higher temperature and so there's a minus sign here that tells you the heat flow is
opposite the temperature gradient.
This case the temperature is increasing to the left and the heat flow is to the right
and that's what that minus sign means.
So that's the mathematics of heat conduction.
And a relatively straight forward process it depends on the, again the thermal conductivity,
the area in question and the temperature gradient or equivalently the temperature difference
and with it the thickness, the distance through which the flow has to go.
Let's take a look at a simple table of some values of this thermal conductivity.
Here are some thermal conductivities of typical material, air, aluminum, concrete and so on.
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it but you should notice that the materials,
the two materials really stand out with having much greater thermal conductivity than other
materials and those are aluminum and copper and if you think about it those are also excellent
conductors of electricity and when we get to electricity we'll understand a little bit
more about the conduction mechanisms that allow these materials to carry electric current.
They involve a lot of free electrons whizzing around in the material and it's those same
electrons that can carry heat, can transfer energy as heat and so not surprisingly the
metals, aluminum and copper, the good electrical conductors tend also to be good conductors
of heat.
Another interesting example here is fiberglass versus glass.
Glass is actually a fairly good thermal conductor with a t a of about almost one in SI units
but spun fiberglass because it traps a lot of little air pockets in it is actually a
relatively good insulator, a poor conductor as is for example styrofoam, water is somewhere
in between pine, there wood is a fairly decent insulator but not great.
So those are some examples of thermal conductivities that you might use to figure out what heat
flows would occur through materials of particular thicknesses and areas.
One way we express the process of heat conduction particularly in building materials and talking
about building houses and building energy efficient houses and so on in the United States particularly
is with something called R value.
Well we have R value in other countries but it's expressed in different units.
In the U.S. it's in English units and the R value measures the resistance to the flow
of heat of material, it's units we almost never say it's units we say this thing has
R10 or this thing has R20 it does have units but it's much easier to understand the inverse
of the R value.
So let's look at the R value, it's a measure of resistance to heat flow, the values of
adjacent layers add which is part of what makes it useful so if I'm thinking about a
house I can think well I've got an R value associated with the sheet rock on the interior
wall and then an R value associated with the actual insulation in the wall cavities and
then maybe an R value associated with the plywood sheathing and then an R value associated
with shingles or whatever I've got on the outside of the house and I can simply add
them up to get a composite R value for the whole wall that's why this is useful.
Its units in the English system that we use in this country in the United States are feet
squared times degrees Fahrenheit times hours per BTU, wow that's a mouthful.
What's a BTU?
It's a British thermal unit, it's a unit of energy, it happens to be the energy required
to raise a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit, more importantly it's about a thousand joules
about a kilojoule, 1054 joules, it's just another unit of energy.
More meaningful is the inverse, it's called U, it's not conductivity but it's a kind
of thermal conductance, it's one over the R value and its units are BTUs per hour per
square foot per degree Fahrenheit.
What does that mean?
It means if I have a piece of insulating material and here I've got a piece of styrofoam or polystyrene
extruded polystyrene insulation, it's two inches thick, this is the kind of stuff you
use on the walls of a basement for example, it's two inches thick and it happens to have
an R value of 10.
What does that mean?
It means if you take a square foot of this insulation and so there's an actual square
foot drawn there, if you take a square foot of that insulation, it will lose one-tenth,
the inverse of that number, of a BTU of a British thermal unit, that's about a hundred
joules, BTU is about a thousand joules, it will lose a tenth of a BTU every hour for
every degree Fahrenheit of temperature difference between the hot side and the cold side of this
styrofoam.
So that's what R value means.
And we can look at a table of R values of common materials, concrete for instance is not a
very good insulator, an eight inch concrete wall has an R value of only 1.1 which is why
we like to put that on the outside of a foundation wall, makes that R value go up about tenfold,
fiberglass 3.5 inch in standard two by four stud walls is about 11, 5.5 inch in standard
two by six stud walls is about 19.
You can see some other materials here including windows, the best commercial windows have
R values of up to 11 but they're extremely expensive, typical good double hung windows
2, 3, 4, really fancy ones 5, single pane windows less than one.
So you get an idea of the relative R values, the relative resistance to heat flows of different
building materials.
Let's take a look at an example where we use the R value.
And for once I'm stepping away from the SI system and using English units because that's
what's used in the building industry in the United States.
So heating a house, here we've got a house, this particular house and it's a really simplified
house it's 32 feet wide, 24 feet deep, 8 feet high, it's flat, it's rectangular, it
has no windows, nothing like that.
I'm ignoring heat lost through the floor because the ground tends to be warmer than the surrounding
air and I want to know when it's 70 degrees inside and 10 degrees Fahrenheit outside how
much oil, which you get about 100,000 BTUs when you burn a gallon of oil, how much oil
does this use on a winter day when it's 70 degrees in, 10 degrees out.
So we've got a temperature difference delta T of 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
We've got a ceiling area of 24 times 32, 768 square feet of R30 ceiling.
The installation is R30, that means we lose a 30th of a BTU per hour per square foot per
degree.
So the ceiling heat loss rate is a 30th of a BTU per hour per foot squared per degree
Fahrenheit multiply it by 768 feet squared and multiply it by that 60 degree temperature
difference we lose about 1500 BTUs every hour through the ceiling.
The walls we got 2 times this much plus this much so that's 2 times 32 feet plus 24 feet
times 8 feet, that's 896 square feet, about the same as the ceiling a little bit more.
On the other hand that's only R12 so we lose a 12th of a BTU per hour per square foot per
degree Fahrenheit.
So the wall heat loss rate is a 12th times the 896 square feet times the 60 degrees that's
almost 4500 BTUs per hour much greater than the ceiling loss because we got much less
insulation in the walls.
So the lot more wall loss is a little bit more wall area but not too much.
Add those up you got about 4500 and 1500 you get about 6000 that's the total heat loss
rate about 6000 BTUs every hour.
There are 24 hours in a day multiply 24 by 6000 you get 144000 I'll call it 150000 and
if we compare that with oil we see that this house uses 1.5 gallons per day.
Now that's a naive calculation there's no windows I left out an awful lot but you can
see how the idea goes how if you were a heating and contracting engineer you would end up
sizing a house or calculating how much insulation it needs or how big a furnace it needs or
whatever.
So that's our value a measure of resistance to heat flow.
Let's move on to another example of a heat flow mechanism let's talk about convection.
Convection is what happens once the heat conducted from the hot plate into the beaker and reached
the bottom of the glass then what happens is the water is warmed the warm water becomes
less expands becomes less dense and the warm water rises and it carries with it the internal
energy that is within it and that rising of that internal energy constitutes a temperature
driven flow of energy so that's heat and that's heat flow by convection and when the water
gets to the top it is in contact with the cooler air it gives up that energy by conduction
to the air and then the water sinks down and you can't see it but in here there are actually
patterns of convective motions carrying that heat around that's the process of convection
this lava lamp is a device that makes use of convective motions there's a blob of fluid
on the bottom and that fluid is being heated by a heater in here and as that fluid eventually
rises it there it goes it's beginning to get buoyant enough that it's getting warmer
less dense and it's rising upward and then it will rise to the top of the lamp and there's
a beautiful example of convective motion and then eventually that fluid will cool and it
will sink back down and the convection will continue so that's an example of convection
it's the motion of energy the flow of heat by the bulk motion of a fluid here's a picture
of how it works you typically have a hot surface a cool surface fluid rises cools in contact
with the cool surface it doesn't have to be an actual physical surface and then the fluid
sinks and it makes these patterns of rising and falling cells of convection some examples
of convection in your home you typically have a heater maybe on one side of a room and the
heater sets up a convection pattern heating air which rises toward the ceiling and then
comes back down the other side as it cools and across the floor by the way you end up
with a lot of your heat on the ceiling as a result of that but that's the way a convective
cycle is set up in your home earth's atmosphere consists of many complicated fluid motion cells
that are caused by heating at the equator where the sun's rays hit most directly and
those cells of convective motion actually transfer energy toward the higher latitudes
if it weren't for those convective motions the temperature difference between the equator
and the poles would be much greater than it is and another example inside the earth the
semi liquid mantle that the crust of the earth rides on is heated by heat from below from
radioactive decay primarily and that heat causes large convective motions and those convective
motions curve very slowly but they drive the process of continental drift. Convection in
the sun carries most of the interior of the sun is dominated by convection as the means
of getting energy from the sun's core where it's generated by thermonuclear fusion out
to the surface where it radiates away there's a picture of a sunspot and some convective
you see next to the sunspot a lot of little dotted patterns and those are the tops of
rising convective cells that are carrying heat from the interior of the sun to the surface
so this is an important natural process. The last of the three heat transfer mechanisms
I want to discuss is radiation. Radiation is the only one of the works in a vacuum and
radiation as we'll see when we get to electromagnetism arises ultimately from accelerated electric
charges and when you have thermal motions that is high internal energies high temperatures
you get a lot of thermal agitation and that gives rise to electromagnetic radiation so
when I say radiation I'm not talking about nuclear stuff I'm talking about light I'm
talking about infrared I'm talking about ultraviolet and let me give you a quick demonstration
here of what I'm talking about. Here is a light bulb it happens to be an ordinary light
bulb but without the frosting that makes it kind of glow nicely instead you can see the
bare filament and as I turn up the current to that filament with this dimmer it begins
to glow and at first it glows sort of red hot not giving off a whole lot of energy and
as I pass more currents it glows brighter and brighter and brighter in fact it gets dramatically
more bright quite rapidly and we want to concentrate on that effect right now later we'll also
concentrate on something else namely the fact that the color of it is changing but for now
the question is simply how much energy is it radiating or at what rate is it radiating
energy and that's given by something called the Stefan Boltzmann law and I want to look
at the equation that describes the Stefan Boltzmann law this is a really important law
in describing for example Earth's climate system on the left is the power emitted by
a hot object through radiation so there's the power on the right there's a quality called
the emissivity of the surface of this object it's a number that ranges from 0 to 1 if the
object is completely black it's 1 if the object is completely shiny it's 0 in fact the reason
thermos bottles are shiny here's a thermos bottle on the inside is because thermos bottles
actually have a vacuum which prevents conduction or convection because they can't occur in
the absence of material and the shininess bounces back radiation or makes that E factor
called the emissivity very small about 0 and so we don't get a lot of radiation loss either
that's why thermos bottles are shiny so let's continue to look at this equation A is the
surface area of the object that's radiating energy this is a universal constant of nature
it has the value roughly 6 times 10 to the minus 8 watts per square meter per kelvin
to the fourth and finally the most important thing here is the temperature in kelvin's
has to be in the absolute units and it's raised to the fourth power which is why as I turned
that knob things happened very very rapidly the brightness of that bulb went up very rapidly
if I double the absolute temperature go from say 300 kelvin's which is roughly room temperature
to 600 kelvin's the amount of energy goes up by a factor of 2 to the fourth power that
is a factor of 16 so that's a really dramatic effect and let's take a look at some examples
where we actually use this idea so let me begin by calculating the sun's temperature
well that's you know I can't just go stick a thermometer in the sun how am I going to
do that well I know what the sun's power output is it's about 4 times 10 to the 26 watts 3.9
it's like the sun is like a 4 times 10 to the 26 watt light bulb that's about 4 times
10 to the 2400 watt light bulbs we know that because we can measure the sun's power at
earth and we can extrapolate to a sphere as big as earth's orbit and figure out how much
power is coming out of the sun we know the sun's radius it's about 7 times 10 to the
10 meters and the sun has this emissivity factor of about 1 it is almost a perfect absorber
and perfectly emitter of radiation so that is a fact we know about the sun we know this
Stefan Boltzmann law and I just set that quantity e to 1 so I've dropped it out of there altogether
the power emitted by the sun is its surface area times this universal constant times the
temperature to the fourth I've told you the power we know the radius from which we can
get the area what we don't know is the temperature so let's solve for the temperature take the
a and the sigma divide the p by them and take the fourth root there we are the area of a
sphere is 4 pi r squared where r is the radius so I've got 4 pi times 7 times 10 to the 8
meters all squared that comes out 6.2 times 10 to the 18 square meters big number big
area big star well it's actually a relatively small star but it's a big thing in our solar
system do the numbers and the sun's temperature is the fourth root of all that and I've worked
that down to this form because it's actually pretty easy to take the fourth root of 10
to the 16 you just divide the 16 by 4 so it's going to come out with a 10 to the fourth
and the fourth root of 0.11 is about 0.58 it's a bigger thing as you multiply something
less than 1 by itself many times it gets smaller and so the answer is 0.58 times 10 to the
fourth kelvins or about 5800 kelvins not quite 6,000 kelvins remember not degrees kelvin
but kelvins so that's the surface temperature of the sun about 6,000 kelvins it's hot plenty
of things are hotter the atmosphere of the sun is 2 million kelvins for interesting reasons
that I won't go into here but the sun's surface is pretty hot 5800 kelvins good number to
keep in mind what happens if I have a system that is receiving energy and also giving out
energy that system and I don't care whether it's a planet or a house or a human body or
whatever and I don't really care what mechanisms are mediating that energy transfer but I'm
going to discuss particularly radiation in these examples that system will come into an
equilibrium temperature a fixed temperature an energy balance temperature when the rate
at which it's getting energy in is equal to the rate of energy going out if there's too
much energy coming in it'll get hotter if there's too much energy going out it will
get colder let me give you an example of that so here's a very simple example a solar heated
greenhouse it's warm in the greenhouse it's cool outside when it's in balance the energy
coming in from the sun is coming in at the same rate that the energy that's being lost
through the walls of the greenhouse and so forth is going out so maybe it's conductive
losses it's radiation coming in it's a mix of these energy transfer mechanisms and the
greenhouse will maintain itself at that fixed temperature because the energy coming in is
balanced by the energy going out even though it's warmer inside and cooler outside that's
when it's in balance if the greenhouse is too cool for these conditions because the
rate at which something loses energy the conductive heat loss in this case remember is proportional
to the temperature difference the energy out will be smaller than the energy in the flow
out will be less than the flow coming in consequently there's more energy coming in and consequently
the temperature will go up and the system will come back into balance what if on the
other hand the greenhouse is too hot if it's too hot because again the heat loss depends
on the temperature difference between the inside and outside the energy flowing out
will be at a greater rate than the energy flowing in and as a result the greenhouse
will cool down and so even though it has no thermostat this greenhouse will naturally
come into balance at a particular temperature that's determined by things like the rate
at which the energy is coming in from the sun and the thickness of the walls and the
kind of insulation and other factors like that and of course in reality night and day
and clouds and other things will affect this but if the sun were steady and the properties
of the greenhouse were steady there would be and the outside temperature were steady
there would be a fixed temperature determined by this energy balance so that's how a solar
greenhouse works and a solar greenhouse is just a nice example because it's simple a
far more important example is planet earth itself or any other planet for that matter
because to understand the climate of a planet to understand its temperature is most fundamentally
in the most simplest approximation just to understand this process of energy balance
and we can go a long way not to the final limit but a long way to understanding earth
and its temperature just with this simple idea so let me give you an example of that
so let's look at earth's temperature let's do it with a real calculation so here is the
picture for earth earth is warmed by incoming sunlight and it turns out that on average
and this is rough approximate number on average sunlight reaches earth's surface at the rate
of about 240 watts for every square meter of earth's surface now there's less near the
poles there's more near the equator there's issues of night and day and that number averages
that all out about a thousand watts on a square meter in direct sunlight but it comes out not
surprising it's something like a quarter of that that's the rate at which sunlight is coming
into warm earth now the earth gets warmer the earth can't lose energy from its whole self by
conduction it can't lose energy by convection although both those mechanisms can function
internally particularly between the surface and the atmosphere or the ocean and the atmospheres
and things like that so they become important in the more detailed look at climate but the big
picture is the only way the planet can lose energy to space because space is a vacuum is through
radiation and it turns out at the earth's temperature which is about 300 kelvins most of the
radiation is invisible infrared so here's the outgoing radiation and that outgoing radiation
is established by this steffen boltsman law that we've been talking about and it depends on earth's
temperature the warmer earth is the greater the rate of outgoing infrared and so what has to happen
for earth to come into energy balance is the outgoing infrared has to equal the incoming
sunlight that's the condition for energy balance on planet earth so we write the steffen boltsman law
earth turns out to be an object with emissivity approximately equal to one so again i'm going
to write p equals a sigma t to the fourth now i haven't given you the total power coming to earth
in the sun i could have but i gave you the average power per square meter of surface so i'm simply
going to divide this equation through by a to get the power per area and the power per area is this
universal constant times the temperature to the fourth power in energy balance that quantity p over
a the power per unit area emitted in infrared radiation had better balance the power per unit
area coming in in sunlight so p over a sigma t to the fourth that is has to be 240 watts per
square meter if the planet is to be an energy balance let's solve for the temperature so what
am i going to do i'm going to take sigma t to the fourth i'm going to equate it to 240 watts per
square meter i'm going to divide through by the sigma that's going to give me 240 watts per square
meter divided by that sigma and that give me t to the fourth so i've got to take the fourth root
let's work that all through i'm just doing arithmetic here i end up with 42 times 10 to the
eight kelvins and again i did it so i got a nice multiple of four on that exponent rather than
putting a 4.2 or something else there and 4.2 times 10 to the nine i made it 42 times 10 to the
eighth because the fourth root of 10 to the eighth is 10 squared and the fourth root of 40 of 42 is
about 2.5 or so and so if i work through that the answer is 255 kelvins if you work that out that's
about 18 degrees Celsius below zero it's about zero degrees fahrenheit for the average temperature
of the planet now that's not bad that's you know within the right ballpark it could have come out
a thousand kelvins and the earth would have had its oceans boiled away it could have come out
minus 100 Celsius and the earth would have its oceans frozen solid so this is in the right ballpark
but it does seem awfully cold for the average temperature of the earth i mean here we are
in january right now in middle attitude near washington dc and the temperature outside is just
about freezing which is zero degrees Celsius 32 degrees fahrenheit and i could easily imagine
that that's below the average temperature of the planet when you think about the tropics and all
so something else is going on here this doesn't tell us the whole picture but it tells us the biggest
part of the picture of what earth's temperature should be is right here i'll give you just a
little hint about what's causing the rest the rest is caused by the greenhouse effect and the
absorption of outgoing infrared by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and that's a whole different
story and why earth's climate is in fact right now changing but here is the bottom line basic
physics the basic thermodynamics of how you establish planetary temperatures including earth's
okay well let's wrap up with a summary of what we've learned here in this lecture on heat transfer
mechanisms we've learned that there are three major heat transfer mechanisms conduction by direct
contact molecular collisions doing the transfer convection by the transfer of energy through
the bulk motion of a fluid there is natural convection i didn't go into it there's also
force convection where you use fans and things to move the air around but the natural convection
gravity and density differences give rise to it and then there's radiation transfer by electromagnetic
radiation the only mechanism that works in vacuum and finally we looked at the process of thermal
energy balance involving radiation and other transfer mechanisms and we get a constant temperature
only when the rate of energy going in is equal to the rate coming out well you can stop there but
let me give you a challenge if you're interested let's do a more realistic house so in that heating
a house example let's give this house 10 double glazed r2 windows modest windows not very good
and they're each two feet by four feet now what's the daily oil consumption
well the total window area is 80 square feet there's the window heat loss calculated with
that one half btu per hour per square foot times the 80 square feet times the 60 60 degree difference
the wall area is almost what it was before but a little bit less so the wall heat loss
goes down a little bit the ceiling heat loss is unchanged add them all up you get 192 000 btu
per day that takes the oil consumption up from 1.5 gallons to 1.9 gallons per day so that's a
more realistic look at this house
