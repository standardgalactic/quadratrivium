Welcome to lecture 23 in which we want to look at how matter responds to heat flows.
Now we already know one answer to that question.
We've explored the specific heat and the heat capacity and we understand that matter
warms, it changes temperature or cools if it's losing heat so we understand temperature change
but we want to look at other things that happen to matter and two other important things can happen.
One is it can change shape or size, it can expand or contract as heat flows in or out
so there's thermal expansion usually it expands when it gets more heat not always there's one
unusual exception of a very important material and it can also change phase it can change from a
solid to a liquid or a liquid to gas or vice versa so we want to explore these other things
that can happen to matter as it's heated. Now why does thermal expansion occur?
Thermal expansion occurs because as we'll see in more detail in a few lectures the internal energy
that gets increased when heat flows into a material is actually the kinetic energy of
its molecules and their thermal agitation as they're bouncing all around as they warm up and
they bounce faster that effectively increases the mean intermolecular distance and that's why
thermal expansion occurs and I want to begin with just a dramatic example of thermal expansion
before I do that though I want to point out one other thing I have going on here here I have a
beaker of ice water and I just want to read its temperature which according to this thermometer
is zero degrees Celsius so let's just keep that in mind beaker of ice water we dump the water and
ice in before we started the lecture I just want to remind you about that and we'll see that again
later but let's do a dramatic example of thermal expansion and thermal contraction as we change
the temperature of something so here I have a balloon this ordinary rubber balloon blown up
and I'm going to put it in that pyrex dish just to keep it somewhere and I'm going to put on these
safety glasses because I'm going to pour onto this balloon some liquid nitrogen now it sounds like
dangerous stuff it is dangerous stuff because it's so very cold but it's just the major component
of air like nitrogen comprises 80 percent of air and it's been cooled down to the point where
it turned into a liquid and that temperature is 77 kelvins and this material is exposed to the
atmosphere and at atmospheric pressure nitrogen boils or liquefies at 77 kelvin so let me pour
some liquid nitrogen on the balloon okay now I wanted to do that experiment with the liquid nitrogen
because that is a dramatic change in the absolute temperature in kelvins from about 300 kelvins
room temperature roughly down to 77 kelvins that's a factor of four change in the temperature
by the way the liquid nitrogen now exposed to a large amount of atmospheric pressure is rapidly
boiling away there's still some liquid in there and any vapors you see coming off there are not
liquid nitrogen but they are droplets of water that have convinced on contact with the very
cold water the very cold air that's coming off there and the liquid nitrogen as it's evaporated
is still very cold and so that's what's going on and now as the balloon begins to warm back up
toward room temperature it's still held at a fairly low temperature by the liquid nitrogen but the
liquid nitrogen is rapidly boiling away and the balloon will expand back so you saw a dramatic
change in the balloon's volume as the intermolecular separation went way down as the molecular agitation
which is the internal energy of that the air in that balloon changed and now the liquid nitrogen
is pretty much gone and we're going to heat back up toward room temperature and the balloon will
come back to pretty much its normal size so that is the process of thermal expansion and
thermal contraction as the opposite of expansion as we call the balloon down okay so let's take
a greater look at this process how do we describe thermal expansion well it's characterized by
quantities called the coefficients of thermal expansion and we can either talk about the coefficient
of length contraction expansion or the coefficient of volume expansion it makes more sense for liquids
and gases whose shape isn't fixed to talk about volume it makes more sense for solids to talk about
length and what the coefficient of expansion is it's simply the fractional change that an object
undergoes as a result of a temperature change of one degree so for example for glass at the top of
this table it's 3.2 times 10 to the minus sixth is the thermal expansion coefficient per degree
Celsius and that means the a piece of glass if it raises its temperature by one degree Celsius
will undergo an expansion of 3.2 parts in a million and you can see that those thermal
expansion coefficients vary they tend to be greater for some of the other substances further down on
the list thermal expansion is important in engineering and in nature in a lot of applications
and on the right you see a dramatic photograph where thermal expansion on a very hot day
cause railroad tracks to expand they really had no place to go to expand to and so they were
distorted sideways and down the far end is a train that underwent a derailment as a result of
this situation so thermal expansion can be a real problem and let's do an example of thermal
expansion to see how we use these expansion coefficients so here we are at our big screen
monitor and let us begin with this simple example in which we worry about losing gasoline from our
gas tank if we fill it up on a hot day with gas that's coming out of the ground at reasonably
cool temperatures so let's say it's 75 degrees that's 24 Celsius we've got a 20 gallon gas tank
made of steel we're going to fill it with gas that's coming out of the ground so it's kind of cool
in the ground at 50 degrees Fahrenheit 10 degrees Celsius that is and the question is how much gas
is going to get lost as the gas increases its temperature to the 25 degree ambient temperature
of the day so how much gas is going to get lost well I grabbed a piece of that expansion coefficient
table for steel it's the coefficient of linear or length expansion it's 12 parts in a million
for every degree Celsius for gasoline it's a coefficient of volume expansion it's 95 times
10 to the minus 5 much bigger on the other hand one is length and one is volume I won't prove it
calculus you can prove it for any shape if you think about a cube and think about the length
versus the volume you can come up with this relationship yourself pretty quickly the volume
coefficient of any material is three times its length coefficient so the length coefficient of
the gasoline if you will is a third of that so that's about 30 something times 10 to the minus 5
that is still 30 times roughly the expansion coefficient of the steel and the gas tank so
the steel the steel coefficient is very tiny compared to the gasoline's coefficient of
expansion and we're going to ignore what happens to the steel of the gas tank which is anyway
already at 75 degrees so maybe we don't need to worry about that although it does get cooled down
by the gasoline so there's a temperature change of the gasoline it's going to start out at 10
degrees Celsius and go up to 24 degrees Celsius that's a change of 14 degrees Celsius gasoline
expansion it's that fractional change in the volume of the gasoline times 14 degrees C the
fractional change is per degree multiply it by the 14 degrees Celsius that's the fractional change
in the volume of the gasoline overall for the 14 degrees C temperature increase and we multiply it
by the volume of the gasoline which is 20 gallons and we get 0.27 gallons which is a little more than
a quart almost a dollar's worth of gas in today's prices so that's what would happen if you filled
your gas tank and that would have happened in an old-fashioned car today's modern cars partly to
conserve gas but more importantly to avoid air pollution from gasoline vapors actually have
expansion tanks that the gas can expand into and it gets absorbed in charcoal canisters and other
things and then gets sent back into the system as needed so there's an example of thermal expansion
that doesn't actually happen anymore but it could well let's see if you understand thermal expansion
let me give you a little quiz so over here i have a object with some holes in it and here i have
for example a disc that won't fit through that small hole just doesn't quite make it and here's
the question if i expanded this object thermally that is warmed it up would this hole expand or
would the hole get smaller look at it another way there's an object question's got a hole through it
the question is if it undergoes thermal expansion will the hole get larger or smaller so why don't
you press your pause button or whatever kind of device you have and stop it momentarily and
think about that will the hole get bigger or will the hole get smaller
well in fact the hole will get bigger every linear dimension of the object expands including the
hole you might think the object is going to expand into the hole and make the hole smaller in fact
every linear dimension of the object will expand and the hole will actually get bigger thermal
expansion is serious business here's a picture of a thermal expansion at a bridge where steel parts of
a bridge come together we leave these expansion joints to give room for the bridge to expand on a
hot day so we won't have that problem we saw with the railroad tracks so that's thermal expansion
serious business we got to worry about it one aspect of thermal expansion that is anomalous
is the thermal expansion of water water is a very unusual substance if you think about it's a very
important substance to us substance to us but it's a very unusual substance also ice floats first of
all water is one of the few substances whose solid state is actually less dense than its liquid
state and the reason water floats is because as this picture shows the molecular structure of
water is rather open of water ice is rather open and the crystalline structure allows a lot of
empty space and that makes the density goes down and from zero degrees to four degrees Celsius
liquid water still contains a little bit of a residue of the bonding that formed that molecular
structure and as that bonding breaks as we warm the water up the density actually increases
with increasing temperature from zero to four degrees Celsius and many many important consequences
follow from that one is that the water at the bottom of deep lakes is almost always at four
degrees Celsius by the way on the right you see a picture of a penguin diving under ice think of
how the world would be different if ice when it formed sank to the bottom the ramifications for
aquatic life are just staggering water is an unusual substance lakes turn over twice a year at
least in temperate climates because what happens is as they cool down in the fall the top layer
reaches four degrees Celsius eventually just a little above freezing at that point the whole
lake is at the same temperature it becomes unstable because the density is the same throughout
and it turns over and then in the winter it's it it's cooler at the at the top just under the ice
layer then at the bottom and then it undergoes a turnover again in the spring as the top warms
through four degrees Celsius and then the top is warmer in the in the summer than in the in the
bottom and so water is a very very curious substance in that way very anomalous so that's the curious
case of water now that's one thing that happens to materials when they get heat flows into them
they expand or in the case of water they may contract in that realm from zero to four degrees
Celsius the other thing that can happen is they can undergo phase changes and something people
realize usually about phase changes is two phases coexist during the phase change
when ice is melting both ice and water are present and during that melting the temperature
does not change the ice doesn't get warmer as it melts the warmest temperature ice can be at
least under normal atmospheric pressure is zero degrees Celsius and so as long as ice is melting
the temperature stays at zero degrees Celsius let's look in a little more detail at an example
of that but before we do let's look again at this beaker of ice water which has now been sitting
here while i've been talking for 10 minutes or so and it is still at zero degrees Celsius even
though there's less ice than there was a little while ago and more liquid water and as long as this
system has any ice at all to me it's reasonably well mixed it will stay at zero degrees Celsius
only after the ice is all gone can the temperature of the water then begin to rise assuming the system
is nicely mixed and it's all at one temperature let's look at that in a little bit more detail
here on the big screen so what i'm going to do here is plot a graph of temperature as a function
of time as i start out with a say a flask that originally has ice in it and then i begin to
heat it up what happens well first thing that happens is maybe i started out with ice at minus
20 degrees Celsius and the ice warms up and it takes a while for the ice to warm up because
he is flowing in from that flame at some fixed rate and so the ice warms up and eventually it
reaches zero Celsius and once it reaches zero degrees Celsius it has to melt and it stays at zero
degrees Celsius the entire time it's melting so then we have a mix of ice and water in here
and that ice water mix the two phases coexisting continues at zero degrees Celsius the entire time
the melting occurs and only when the melting is done can the water begin to warm up because of the
energy that's flowing into it so the water warms and the water warms until it reaches 100 degrees
Celsius it's boiling point and the water then boils and it boils and it boils and it boils and the
boiling water at atmospheric pressure can't be any hotter than 100 degrees Celsius to 12 Fahrenheit
and it boils and boils and only when it's done boiling if we had captured all the vapor somehow
without changing the pressure then we could warm the gas the vapor phase of the water if you look
carefully at this picture you will also see differences in the slopes of these curves both the
ice warming curve and the gas warming curve are steeper than the water warming curve and that's
because the water takes longer to warm because its specific heat is greater than that of either ice
or the gas you'll also notice something else on here the time to boil the water away is longer
than the time to melt it and this is nowhere near to scale the boiling time should actually be much
longer because it actually takes much much more energy to boil a given mass of water
than it does to melt a given mass of ice so there's an example for water and that's why
this beaker of ice water is not going to change temperature and begin warming toward room temperature
until we get all the ice melted and then the water can begin to warm to room temperature well these
phase changes as i suggested here with water require energy why do they require energy because
ultimately we're breaking bonds that hold molecules together in the case of ice the bonds lock the
water molecules into a rigid crystal structure like i showed you in case of any solid and in order to
turn that material into a liquid in which the molecules are still fairly tightly bound together
but they're able to move around each other although they stay pretty dense when we break those bonds
that takes energy when we break those weaker bonds that are holding a material into a dense
liquid and allow the molecules to go off on their own as they do in a gas that takes additional
energy those energies that it takes to transform from one phase to another are called heats of
transformation and again there's the word heat used in a not quite exactly rigorous way but that's
what these things have been called they're also called latent heats that's a sort of older terminology
i like the term heat of transformation better there's the heat of fusion that's the heat associated
with fusing a liquid into a solid or vice versa melting the solid into a liquid there's the heat
of vaporization that's the heat associated with turning a liquid into a gas or equivalently the
energy that you get back out when you turn the gas into the liquid they're all called latent heat
and we can look at some of these heats of transformation for a number of common materials
here are some and notice that water has a very large heat of vaporization these are in kilojoules
per kilogram two two five seven kilojoules per kilogram and the boiling point of water of course
is 100 degrees celsius that's 373 kelvins and water's melting point 273 kelvins zero degrees
celsius the heat of fusion is only 334 kilojoules per kilogram that's how much energy you have to
put in so there's a factor of maybe about seven between water's heat of fusion and its heat of
vaporization so in the graph i had on the big screen it should have taken seven times longer
to boil the water away i've included uranium dioxide on there for an interesting reason
that we'll get to shortly heats of vaporization are important in driving weather in particular
hurricanes hurricanes are driven by the energy associated with water that has been evaporated
from the warm tropical oceans into the atmosphere that water is carrying with it the energy that
it took to turn it from the liquid state to the gaseous state and when that water recondenses to
form clouds and clouds are droplets of made of droplets of condensed water it gives that energy
back up as heat and that's what drives the convective motions that become hurricanes those
motions are also coupled to earth's rotation which is why we get these big spiral structure
but hurricanes are powered by this so-called latent heat this heat of transformation and indeed
one of the major mechanisms for getting energy from earth's surface where the sun deposits most
of its energy into the atmosphere is by this process of heats of transformation latent heat
associated with vaporized water well let's move on and do an example of this to see what this might
mean for us and let's go back to another nuclear meltdown we had a nuclear meltdown last time when
we were worried about what would happen if we dumped water on this nuclear reactor and how long
would it take to reach the boiling point now we've got another nuclear meltdown this one happens to
be a 200 megawatts of fish of power from the radioactive decay the reactor fuel has 250 tons
of uranium dioxide that's a common reactor fuel we're going to dump 4 000 tons of cooling water
on it a tonne is a metric ton it's a thousand kilograms and it's within 10 percent of what
an english ton so you can think of it either way that's about a little more than we calculated in
the previous lecture we thought we needed 3 000 tons to keep from getting to boiling point for an hour
but now we're going to ask another question how long will it take to boil that water away once we
get the water to the boiling point and then how long once the water is all boiled will it take for
the uranium fuel to melt so i've grabbed a piece of that table talking about water and uranium
dioxide the energy to vaporize the water is the latent heat of vaporization or the heat of
transformation the heat of vaporization 2257 kilojoules for every kilogram we've got 4 times 10
to the 6 kilograms 4 million kilograms 4 000 tons and that's 9 times 10 to the 9 that's a big number
kilojoules wow that's 9 terajoules that's a big amount of energy that's what it would take to
vaporize that water so it's going to take a long time we got 200 megawatts of power dumping heat
into that water and trying to vaporize it that's 200 000 kilowatts 200 megawatts that's 200 000
kilojoules per second i converted to kilo because i had kilo here and so now i'm ready to figure out
how long that's going to take time to boil that many kilojoules i got to get i'm getting them at
the rate of 200 000 a second that's 45 000 seconds or about 12 and a half hours phew once we get that
cooling water in there that hour it took to get it in the previous lecture up to that temperature
that's not the issue the issue is that water is going to sit there for about 12 hours we have time
to work on the problem but woe to us if we don't solve the problem then because the energy to melt
the fuel is the heat of fusion of the uranium fuel 259 kilojoules per kilogram times the amount of
fuel which is a lot less than there is of water and that's 6.5 times 10 to the 7 kilojoules the
reactor power is still 200 000 kilojoules every second 200 megawatts and divide to get the time
and whoa it's only five minutes and that is a real meltdown and that is a real big serious problem
so we would have a problem on our hands if we let that water boil away fortunately the very large
heat of vaporization of water gives us some time to deal with this okay well let's take a more careful
look at this process of changing phases and see what happens to materials and i'm going to do that
by showing you what's called a phase diagram for a typical material typical but not the most common
material water but typical so here's a phase diagram and a phase diagram plots temperature on one
axis and pressure on the vertical axis and we see these curves that divide the space sort of
into three regions there's that region there's that region and there's this region by the way
there are many materials with much more complicated phase diagrams and in different sub phases and so
on but the simple kind of material we think of with three phases is characterized by this
kind of diagram solid liquid gas and you'll notice these curves that divide solid from liquid the
divide solid from gas the divide liquid from gas are characterized by these two points one is the
end of the liquid gas division curve and one is that funny point where they all meet that's the
triple point i mentioned the triple point before that's the one unique point where all three phases
can coexist simultaneously anywhere along the liquid gas transition the liquid and vapor can
coexist anywhere along the solid liquid transition the solid and the liquid can coexist as they are
for water in my beaker right now although this is not the phase diagram for water but there's only
one point and it has a unique temperature and a unique pressure where the three can coexist and
for water that point even though this is not the diagram for water it does have a triple point and
that point is that defined to be at 273.16 kelvins and it happens to occur at about six
thousandths of an atmosphere so you have to pump down to low pressure to get the triple point but
if you pump down on a container of liquid until you reach a point container of water you reach a
point where you see liquid water and ice and vapor in there and they're all coexisting and one
isn't changing into the other then you you're at the triple point and you know the temperature is
273.16 kelvins that's the definition in fact of the temperature scale two points on that scale
273.16 the triple point of water and zero absolute zero the extrapolation point to zero pressure
with a constant volume gas thermometer as we saw now let's explore this diagram in a little bit
more detail there are three processes that change the phases of materials a common one is melting
changing solid to liquid a common one is boiling changing liquid to gas a less common one is
sublimation changing a solid directly into a gas that doesn't happen for example to water
under ordinary pressures again this is not water's curve but it is a curve from many common
substances including in particular carbon dioxide and it turns out that carbon dioxide
does not do what we usually think of we usually think of if we increase temperature solid then
liquid then gas and that's what happens to water under typical conditions when we
melted that ice on the on a hot plate as i described for example but there are other
things we could do we could go right from point a to point b that would take a much lower pressure
but for carbon dioxide that pressure is atmospheric pressure so over here i have some
carbon dioxide which has been sitting on the table the entire lecture and it's subliming or
sublimating to carbon dioxide gas it's turning directly from the solid state to the gaseous state
it does not go through the liquid state because for carbon dioxide that line a b occurs at atmospheric
pressure for water that line would have to occur at a much lower pressure below the triple point
here we are below the triple point of carbon dioxide and we're below the triple point and
therefore we are we're at pressure below the triple point pressure and therefore the carbon
dioxide does not exhibit a liquid phase it's changing directly to a gas there is no liquid
lying on this table anywhere it's just completely dry that's why solid carbon dioxide is called
dry ice you seem to see some vapor coming on off again that's condensation of water vapor out of
the air on the very cold gaseous caused by the very cold gaseous carbon dioxide that's coming
off that lump of dry ice so there's the process of sublimation something that does not happen
to water at least under ordinary atmospheric conditions but which is common for carbon dioxide
by the way if you have a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher it contains liquid carbon dioxide
but it's under pressure and so it's moved up beyond the triple point and so there the carbon
dioxide does exhibit three phases so there's a phase diagram now there's some other things we
can do with this phase diagram for example we could move from point e to f at relatively high
pressure and you'll notice we cross the solid liquid transition but then we never encounter a solid
gas transition because above the critical point there's just a single fluid phase it's a very dense
fluid that goes gradually from more liquid like to more gaseous like without that abruptness of a
phase transition that occurs at a particular point and the study of phenomena around that critical
point and the study of these so-called super super fluids super fluid states is quite an
interesting process in modern science and technology in fact one of the things we're hoping to do with
carbon dioxide instead of sending it into the atmosphere is to pump it down into deep geological
formations where it would form a super fluid and be up in this region of its phase diagram so there's
this gradual transition above the critical point from liquid to gas and all you can say up here is
you have a fluid that changes gradually from more liquid like to more gaseous point below the critical
point you do get this abrupt transition from liquid to gas okay well let's look at the phase
diagram I haven't talked about yet let's look at the phase diagram for water and I'll leave this one
up as we move on and look at the phase diagram for water oh one more thing we can do I should
point out before I do that we can also change pressure there's nothing that says we have to
change temperature so if I go from point g to point h at a fixed temperature temperature is on
this axis I drop the pressure I'll start out in the super fluid state as I pass the critical point
and then definitely in the liquid state but then I cross the liquid gas transition going downward
and the liquid turns to gas if you put water at atmospheric pressure in a container and pump the air
out lowering the pressure the water will begin to boil eventually at room temperature why because
we've moved down this way that's also by the way why water boils at lower temperatures on
mountaintops where the atmospheric pressure is less you can see as we lower the pressure the boiling
point moves down in temperature along that curve but let me look at another phase diagram the one
I've sort of alluded to but haven't showed yet and that's the phase diagram for water
so here's the curious case of water in the upper left of this diagram I'm showing you the phase
diagram we just saw for a typical substance we saw it on the big screen now let's look at it for
water what's different can you see what's different take a look well if you haven't noticed already
look at the solid liquid curve it goes the other way for water most of the curves go up to the right
for water that curve goes up to the left and that's a reflection of the fact that
again water has this anomalous property that its density actually increases
for a short time after it turns from solid to liquid and it allows an interesting thing for
water it allows us to do what's called pressure melting if you increase the pressure on water
when you're in the solid phase you can actually go straight up in that diagram and you can cross
the solid liquid boundary and turn water into a liquid you can't do that with other sources
most substances if you go up from the liquid at a fixed temperature go up in pressure you will cross
the boundary into a solid for water you will go the other way and you will cross the boundary from
solid into liquid that's called pressure melting and it's important in a number of applications
it used to be said that ice skating worked by the pressure of the ice skate so the ice causing
pressure melting that turns out to be nonsense it's the friction of the ice skate blades that melt
the ice under your ice skates and give you a thin layer of water that you glide on relatively
frictionlessly but no matter how you look at it water is a fascinating substance and it behaves
anomalously relative to most everyday substances okay let's wrap up with a look at where we've been
when heat flows into a material it does other things than just warming the material up the
material may undergo thermal expansion or in this anomalous case water contraction if it's between
zero and four degrees Celsius it may undergo a phase change and the temperature remains constant
during the phase change because there's energy involved in the phase change and the energy is
given by the heat of vaporization or heat of fusion the heat of transformation multiplied
by the mass involved and the details depend on both temperature and pressure
and those details are spelled out in these phase diagrams
