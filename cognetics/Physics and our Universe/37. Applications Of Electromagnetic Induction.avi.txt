Welcome to lecture 37 in which I'm going to discuss applications of electromagnetic induction.
Now in the previous lecture I introduced the theory of induction that changing magnetism
causes electrical effects and I waved around my big bar magnet near coils of wire and I had
relatively puny effects like tiny movements of an electrical needle. I don't want you to go away
thinking electromagnetic induction is some kind of puny effect because in fact electromagnetic
induction is the source of nearly all the world's electrical energy. We generate electricity with
electric generators as I hinted last time electric generators involve changing magnetic flux by
changing the orientation of a coil of wire in a magnetic field. Let's take a look at how it
generator would work. So here's a picture of an electric generator and it looks very similar
to the picture of the motor that I showed you a few lectures ago and there's a reason for that.
A generator and a motor are really the same thing operated in reverse. Put electricity into a motor
you get out mechanical energy. Put mechanical energy in spinning a coil of wire in a magnetic field
and electromagnetic induction gives you electricity out. So that's how generators work. So this picture
looks very much like a motor. You can see the coil of wire that spins between the poles of magnet.
You can see a mechanism for pulling that electricity off from the rotating structure
onto stationary wires and onto some load which it then supplies with electrical energy. Generators
are ubiquitous and I have a lot more to say about generators. Let me just begin by giving you
several examples. Here are generators in large scale electric power plants. The one on the left
top is in a steam powered power plant, could be a coal or nuclear plant. You see great big pipes at
the back bringing in steam that turns a turbine, that turns the structure in the front which is an
electric generator, spinning coils in a magnetic field. Similar generators in a hydroelectric station
and the wind turbine is a smaller example of an electric generator. The one on the left is probably
generating about a gigawatt, about a billion watts of power. The ones in the upper right are probably
generating a few hundred million watts each. The wind turbine might be generating anywhere
from a few hundred kilowatts to a few megawatts, a few million watts. Well let's look at a real
electric generator in action. I have one sitting right here and I'd like to invite Laura from the
great courses to come in and she's going to do some cranking on this generator for us. So what I
have here before Laura starts is I have, actually it's an electric motor. I bought it as an electric
motor but a motor and a generator are basically the same thing. I got some belt that drives the
motor or generators back there and I got some meters that read how much voltage and current
is producing and I got some electrical loads I can switch in and out. So I would like Laura to
start turning that crank and crank it at a nice pace and Laura if you can crank it so that that
voltmeter reads about 12. It's not crucial but get it up about two-thirds of the way. So crank it nice
and fast. Okay, pretty easy. So she's having no trouble cranking that generator. There she goes,
real easy. Just keep it going just like that, nice and easy. Keep going, keep going, keep going,
keep going. She's spinning coils of wire in a magnetic field but right now there's no current
through those coils because I'm not asking them to supply power to any load. Keep going Laura,
keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. Okay, now I've
turned on a hundred watt light bulb and it's really, really hard for her and she felt that really
sudden hardness of turning it. I'm going to turn it off again, oh much easier again.
And I want you to think about that because if you're worried about conserving energy and not
generating as much global warming greenhouse gases or fossil fuel pollution or nuclear waste or
whatever comes out of your local power plant, you want to minimize the hard work the power plant has
to do and every time you turn on a light that power plant feels exactly the same oomph that Laura
feels and she has to crank that much harder. Now maybe it'd be a little easier if I asked Laura
to light a 50 watt light bulb. That's easier, right? So there we go and just to make it even easier
you can light this one. Okay, there's a compact fluorescent, produces the same amount of light
but with a lot less energy and consequently it's a lot easier for Laura to crank. But she's still
having to do work and again the reason she's doing work is the same reason I had to do work
when I thrust my bar magnet at that loop of current because the coils in there have current
flowing in them, the direction of the current is such as to oppose the induced effect that's
the effect that's causing that induced effect and consequently the permanent magnets in that
generator and the moving coils become magnets that oppose each other and Laura has to do work to
overcome that force. It's no problem at all when there's no force involved when there's no current
but as soon as I try to make her generate electric power to make energy to light this light bulb
it becomes very difficult and every electric generator feels that same when whenever somebody
anywhere in the world turns on a light bulb. Thank you very much Laura, appreciate it.
Okay, well electric generators are used as I say to generate our power, large-scale electric power
generation, about 40% of the world's primary energy consumption goes into making electric power
although the process isn't very efficient and so only about 12% of the energy the world actually
uses is in the form of electricity and it's generated almost all of it in electric generators,
tiny fraction in photovoltaic cells and other non-mechanical devices but almost all of it
in generators just like that one. But we use generators for other purposes as well for example
in your car there's a small generator it's called an alternator because it produces alternating
current it's used to charge your car battery. In a larger version of the same thing there's a
bigger generator in a hybrid vehicle sometimes the generator in the hybrid is the same as the
drive motor and when you slow the car down the wheels turn this motor and it acts as a generator
and recharges your battery. Hybrid vehicles also include hybrid cars aren't the first invention
such as diesel electric locomotives are in some sense hybrids they use diesel engines to generate
to turn generators which generate electricity which run electric motors which drive the train.
Emergency power is another example of electric generators so we use electric generators of
all sizes in a lot of different applications and they all share the fact the mechanical
energy goes in and electrical energy comes out and in principle you'd like them to be 100%
efficient at generating that energy they're not 100% but they're pretty efficient they take most
of the mechanical energy that comes in and send it out as electricity the inefficiencies in power
plants come in the conversion of thermal energy into electricity as you saw in the lectures on
thermodynamics so those are electric generators and let me just give you some other examples
I have here a couple of electric generators here's a fancy device it's a hand-cranked
flashlight has some rechargeable batteries in it and so I have to crank it a little bit I'm turning
the crank in an electric generator I'm doing mechanical work now the mechanical work has
been stored as electrical energy and I can turn on the flashlight this one is really a cool device
it also has a radio and a siren so that's a rather cool device that is powered entirely by
muscle power but the muscle power makes energy which then gets stored in the battery here's
another example this is a shake flashlight and this one's a little easier to see how it works
because what's inside this shake flashlight is a coil of wire a hollow coil of wire and a magnet
and you can kind of see the magnet can go back and forth through the coil and of course the magnet's
magnetic field is changing in the vicinity of the coil or the coil experience is a changing
magnetic field as the magnet goes back and forth through there and that changing magnetic field
generates electrical effects in this case an electric current and in this case the electric
current actually goes into charging a capacitor now a capacitor is an energy storage device that
can store energy for a little while but not for a really long time and so this is not a flashlight
you can charge up and then leave sitting on your dresser when you need it in the middle of the
night you have to kind of shake it a while and the magnetic flux through that coil is changing
and that's causing an electric current the flow in that coil and that current is putting charge
on the plates of a capacitor and if I've shaken it enough I turn it on and it lights so to example
that this is a rather different design of generators most generators are rotary devices where you spin
a coil of wire this generator the magnet shakes back and forth that's why it's a shake flashlight
I gave these out to souvenirs one year when I was teaching introductory electromagnetism to all
my students on the final exam but in order to keep their souvenir they had to write an essay
explaining how this thing works and I'm pleased to say they all did works by electromagnetic
induction well let's get a little bit quantitative let's talk about how you might actually design
an electric generator okay so let's start with a simple loop of wire in a magnetic field B
the wire loop is initially oriented so its perpendicular is here to the right same direction
as magnetic field the angle between them is zero I'm going to call that angle theta and we're
interested in what's happening to the magnetic flux as time goes on this loop is going to rotate
the flux through one turn of that loop is going to be the magnetic field times the area times the
cosine of the angle between them so as the angle increases you can see the flux decreases for a
while that's because the number of field lines going through there is decreasing there it is
decreasing further when it's perpendicular it would be zero and then it gets bigger again
as the loop continues to go around we're going to describe that motion as we did back in the
lectures on rotational motion as theta increasing linearly with time the rate of increase is omega
the angular velocity and we want to know then how theta equaling this linearly changing in time
quantity how cosine of that theta changes with time and I'm not going to prove it you could
prove it using calculus but the rate of change of cosine omega t is in fact minus omega times the
sine of omega t and let me try to motivate that here I have the red curve is the cosine of two
t so omega is two in this case and you can see that where the cosine curve is flat that is at
its maxima and minima it's not changing instantaneously and that's where its rate of change goes through
zero where the cosine curve is changing most steeply is where the sine curve has its biggest
values and I've put the two here without the minus sign so I'm showing you sine of two t two sine of
two t not minus two sine of two t but here's the big point cosine turns into a sine when you figure
out its rate of change and it gets multiplied by this angular frequency because the more rapidly
it's changing the bigger the rate of change so now we can go on and finish designing our generator
we're going to start with a 500 turn loop we're going to give it an area of 0.018 square meters
so I've already figured out the area I haven't told you it's radius it's spinning at 60 revolutions
per second an important number because that will make it generate 60 hertz alternating current which
is the kind of electricity we use in north america although a real generator might have multiple coils
and so it might be spinning faster it's in a 50 millitesimal magnetic field and we want to know
what its peak output voltage is so we know that the induced voltage is always the rate of change
of the magnetic flux and now we've sort of figured out how to get that rate of change
that's going to be the magnetic flux or rather the rate of change the magnetic flux was ba cosine
theta that's going to be ba and then the rate of change of cosine theta and there it is and I've
taken the minus sign off because I'm just looking at the absolute value so there's the rate of change
of magnetic flux the angular velocity is two pi times the frequency that's because there are
two pi radians in a full circle we worked out this relationship earlier when we're talking about
rotational motion so the frequency is 60 revolutions per second the angular frequency is 377 radians
per second and that's the natural measure again of angle the radian so we're getting there we've
got almost everything we need now one other thing to point out I asked what's the peak output voltage
what's the maximum it ever gets to because this voltage is alternating spinning coils in magnetic
fields naturally makes sinusoidally varying alternating current which is why that's so common
one reason it's so common the maximum value of sine is one so if I work out the peak value I can
take all my numbers put them together change the sine into one because I want the peak value and I've
got my 500 turns each turn gets this much flux I got 500 of them there's the area there's the
magnetic field and there's the 377 radians per second and that comes out to be 170 volts and by
the way that is the peak voltage of the power coming out of your wall outlets in north america
you think it's 120 volts 120 is a kind of average it's a sinusoidally varying waveform
that goes up as high as 170 as low as minus 170 and its average is about 120 so there is an example
of how we design an electric generator and again I emphasize all generators use electromagnetic
induction and they provide most of the world's electricity well let's look at what we what happens
now after we generate electric power generating power using power at 120 volts isn't the most
efficient way to transmit power as we already saw when we were talking about electric circuits
how do we get to these high voltages hundreds of thousands of volts we use to transmit electric power
well we use devices called transformers and I have some examples of transformers here first of all
I have a simple demonstration and in the previous lecture I actually built a transformer I didn't
call it that I put two coils hanging together on a rod and I varied the current one coil we saw an
induced current in the adjacent coil that's a transformer here I have a better example of a
transformer it consists of two coils of wire one of them is hooked up to an alternating current
power source the other one's hooked up to our meter there it is the two coils happen to be
mounted on an iron core and the reason for that is the magnetic flux gets concentrated in that
iron and that ensures us all the magnetic flux that comes through the first coil also goes through
the second coil and those two coils happen to have the yellow one has 400 turns it's marked and the
blue one has 200 turns and that means the voltage induced in the blue one
because of the changing flux from the yellow one ought to be half this is a step down transformer
and if I reversed it and turned it the other way it would be a step up transformer so let's see
what happens so I turn the voltage on and I've got about six volts here and I've got about
2.6 volts on that meter so my step down transformer is in fact working it's taking the
six volts and turning it into roughly three volts it's not a perfect transformer if I turn it around
I get a step up transformer this does not buy us more energy because we get less current out of it
and the product of current and voltage is electric power so I'll turn this one on I've got about
now about six volts again and I've got 11 or so volts there so now I've got a step up transformer
and we use transformers widely throughout the power system to alter voltage levels that's one
reason we use alternating current because alternating current makes changing magnetic fields and
changing magnetic fields make electromagnetic induction so we can easily change voltage levels
up so there's a quick look at how transformers work they change voltage levels with alternating
current there's a primary coil producing changing magnetic flux that induces voltage in a secondary
coil and this iron core that we have here concentrates the magnetic flux and in principle
the output voltage should be to the input voltage as the ratio of the turns in the two coils as you
saw it isn't perfect because not quite all the magnetic flux gets transferred but we can make
them pretty good and here's some examples of transformers down at the lower right is a simple
power brick that you might have to charge to power say your cell phone charger in the upper
right is one that might be a transformer in a stereo system or a television at the middle left
as a transformer that you'd see hanging on a power line pole near your house it typically steps down
4 000 volts or if you're in the country 7 000 volts to the 120 and 240 volts in your house
and the other two transformers you see there are big transformers at power substations that are
transforming power throughout the electric grid in fact if you look at the electric grid
it looks something like this what we do is we generate power typically at tens of kilovolts
at the generator at the power plant tens of thousands of volts and then we step it up we
send it over long distance transmission lines that might have voltages as high as say 345
kilovolts or 365 kilovolts is typical but at each juncture you see the kinds of transformers that
might be used we step it down say on the outskirts of a city transmitted at about 4 000 volts through
overhead or underground lines in the city and then that last transformer the one you saw in the pole
steps it down to actually 240 volts at your house and that split into two 120 volt circuits and then
you see one of those circuits going to power a tv set and inside the tv there's a transformer that
steps voltages down to run the electronics in the television so there's an example of transformers
are many transformers as they're used throughout the power grid and again they work by alternating
current because it's only alternating current that is changing and making the changing magnetic flux
and can therefore use electromagnetic induction okay let me look at just a couple of other examples
of things that are sort of like transformers i gotta brush my teeth
how does that work there's no electrical contacts on this thing whatsoever there's an electric motor
in it there are batteries in it and what happens well at the base of this electric toothbrush
is a coil of wire and when i plug the thing in that is where the power is going it's going to
energize that coil and making changing magnetic fields because it's alternating current and when
i place the toothbrush there there's a coil in the bottom of the toothbrush and the whole thing
acts like a transformer and so i have contactless transfer of electrical energy that is an example
also of a transformer another example is a proposed charging system for electric vehicles and you see
an example here in which the vehicle is sitting over a coil in the roadway and there's a coil in
the vehicle and that coil in the roadway is sending up is making changing magnetic flux in the coil
in the vehicle and that's making electric currents that are going into charge the vehicle's battery
this is an experimental system it has been actually there's a prototype underway near
london on the m25 roadway it's not clear exactly how well this will work when vehicles are moving
but you can imagine building a stationary situation where you park your car in a particular parking
space and you get it charged that way so that's another example of using induction to transfer
electric power that thing becomes temporarily a transformer when you've got the car parked over
the device one other example slightly related to transformers but a bit different are so called
inductive transducers a transducer is a device that converts some non-electrical signal into an
electrical signal or vice versa like a microphone or a loud speaker in fact one kind of microphone
not the one i'm wearing because this is capacitive is a dynamic microphone in which a diaphragm
a ferromagnetic diaphragm vibrates near a magnet and near a coil of wire and the magnetic field
changes as a result of the motion of that diaphragm and that generates a current which is analogous
to the sound in an electric guitar you have a similar situation of coils wrapped around a magnet
and the strings of an electric guitar are steel strings they're ferromagnetic they alter the
magnetic field and that's how the sound is converted into electricity finally you can do
sophisticated things like measuring pressure with a diaphragm and a coil of wire and pressure
moves this diaphragm and that affects the magnetic field and that gives you
currents that tell you something about the pressure so inductive transducers are very
much with us well let's look at some other applications of electromagnetic induction some
of which will be familiar and some of which will be more obscure induction isn't just about making
currents flow in particular circuits currents can also flow in bulk material conductive material
that's subject to changing magnetic fields and i have here a demonstration of that here i have a
thin plastic tube with nothing in it and a small spherical marble the marble is actually made of
steel and it's actually magnetized i drop it down the tube and of course gravity accelerates it and
it goes down at a great rate an increasing rate here i have three cylinders hollow cylinders
sleeves made of conducting material this one's made of aluminum which of course is not magnetic
the magnet does not stick to the aluminum this one's copper the magnet does not stick to the copper
and this one is brass which of course is also non-magnetic so these are non-magnetic materials
and i'm going to put these sleeves around my tube i'll put the aluminum one at the bottom
i'll put the copper one in the middle and i'll put the brass one at the top it doesn't matter
and watch what happens as i drop the ball here we go
went fairly quickly through the brass spent forever to get through the copper and then
went moderately quickly through the aluminum what's going on there as the magnet falls it's
creating a changing magnetic field and that changing magnetic field is inducing electric
currents in these cylindrical objects conductors and that energy associated with those currents
is being dissipated as heat the aluminum the copper is the best conductor so it gets the
biggest currents where does the energy that ultimately gets dissipated as heat comes from
it comes from the only place it can the kinetic energy of the fall of the magnet and so the
magnet is slowed down that phenomenon is called eddy currents currents in bulk material caused by
changing magnetic fields and it's put to a number of practical uses uh among those practical uses
is eddy current breaking in eddy current breaking we actually have spinning conducting materials
like an electric saw blade for example or in this picture like the brake hub on a high speed
train a japanese bullet train and what we do is that spinning conducting break we turn on an
electromagnet right near it we induce eddy currents and they sap the rotational kinetic energy and
the train comes to a stop japanese bullet trains were using that technology until 2007 when they
got smarter and used another electromagnetic technology they used that kinetic energy to turn
electric generators and put the energy back in a battery instead of dissipating it as heat so
there's an example of eddy currents we use electromagnetic induction also for airport
security when you walk through an airport metal detector you use what's called in most metal
detectors pulsed induction technology in pulsed induction there's a current pulse that generates
a brief magnetic field and if there are eddy currents occurring in metal on the person who's
walking through the metal detector those eddy currents slow the field collapse and so that
slowness is detected by uh electronic devices and that's what sets off the alarm we use induction
also or have used induction more in the past than today in information storage and retrieval
when we do that we store information in patterns of magnetization on ferromagnetic materials like
tapes and discs there's a coil in a so-called read head that gets induced currents as the
magnetic medium moves past the head and those induced currents reflect the stored information
and the time variation of that current is what gives us the information content and some bygone
technologies did this reel to reel tapes cassette tapes video cassette technologies not too long ago
many of you remember those they all read their information through electromagnetic induction
and hard discs still look like this picture used to read their information through
electromagnetic induction today they all read it through something called the magneto resistive
effect in which the resistance in that read head changes rather than getting induced currents so
information storage and retrieval and i'd like to end with the last example and probably the most
common that is today's technology we still use this although it's on its way out probably
we use magnetic strips on the back of credit cards and other cards and we swipe those strips past a
little coil bond around an iron core and we induce currents that take off the information
that is contained in that card and i want to end with a demonstration that shows what actually
happens when you swipe your credit card okay here i have an actual card swipe mechanism removed from
a card reader there's a little plastic channel that the card rides through and behind it is a small
coil of wire wound on an iron core and the a little gap in the iron core is right where the
strip on the back of the card will slide by i've connected this to a cable to this oscilloscope
which we will use to display the voltage that is induced by the card so we're ready to go we'll
also look at that on the big screen i've got the oscilloscope set to trigger off the induced voltage
we're in a very noisy environment here in the studio so the results are going to be very noisy
and occasionally it triggers by itself off the noise but here i'll try to make it happen
with my card so i've grabbed my credit card out of my pocket and here i go okay we have what looks
like a nice trace and let's talk about that that looks kind of messy but what you're seeing here
is the beginning of a rising quickly alternating voltage it's going a little higher as i go along
which is an indication that i actually was accelerating the card as i moved it and then
when the card left the reader we dropped back to this stuff which is the unfortunate noise that's
present electrical noise in this studio we think it's coming from some light dimmers but this is
the signal from the credit card and let's take a closer look at it so i'm going to expand that
horizontal scale so we can look at what's in there and you begin to see that we're not just looking
at random noise we're looking at a distinct pattern of ups and downs and ups and downs
and occasionally you'll see deviations from standard down up down up down up down up there's
one that's a little narrower and there's a couple of them and you can see variations and those
variations contain in some way that i don't know the information that's stored on my credit card
i'm not going to display the whole thing because if you know that information you could decipher
my credit card probably the people who design card readers had to be pretty clever because
the speed with which i swipe the card can't matter and yet because induction depends on
the rate of change of magnetic flux the faster i swipe the card the bigger the induced effects
furthermore the frequency of these ups and downs is going to be more rapid as i sweep the card more
rapidly so none of that can matter for the information that's contained in the card so somehow
the information has to get stored in these varying patterns which will appear no matter how big the
voltage gets or how close those patterns together get together will still be able to see those patterns
so there's what's on my credit card a little tiny piece of my credit card when i changed this knob
to make the time scale uh back where i started there's the entire swipe of the credit card but
now we can't see much because those little information peaks are really crammed together
so every time you swipe a card think about faraday's law and electromagnetic induction
because that's what's doing the reading okay let's wrap up with a summary of lecture number 37
and instead of giving you a verbal summary here's just an example to remind you of the many many
devices in your everyday life that use electromagnetic technology electric power generation
the transformers that send voltages up and down transducers like microphones the less
obvious eddy currents that are flowing in bulk materials the security devices like metal detectors
and finally the information technologies especially card swipers
