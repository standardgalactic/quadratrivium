Welcome to lecture 30 in which I want to give you a deeper and more sophisticated understanding
of a concept that you're surely familiar with already and that's the electrical concept
of voltage.
You probably know that the voltage available at your standard wall outlets is 120 volts
something like your electric dryer may run on 240 volts.
You know to worry about high voltage so if you see that high voltage sign you know that
you want to stay away from whatever that sign is marking.
You work with batteries frequently and you probably are aware that batteries are specified
by their voltages.
Here I have a whole sequence of batteries from the highest voltage one I happen to have available
going down.
The highest one is a 12 volt car battery.
Right next to it is a 9 volt battery the kind you might put in your smoke detector
it's a lot smaller on the other hand it's a lot smaller than the next lower down one
which is a 6 volt lantern battery you might use this in a heavy duty camping lantern or
something like that and the rest of them a D cell a 1.5 volt D cell flashlight battery
a C cell perhaps used in smaller flashlights and other applications and a double A and
triple A batteries that are widely used in a number of devices.
So these are all 1.5 volt batteries at the very bottom there's a little button battery
like you might use in a very small electronic device like for example a TV remote or a calculator
something like that or even smaller you might see one in a hearing aid.
These are all 1.5 volt batteries that's a 6 volt battery that's a 9 volt battery and
there is a 12 volt battery I can measure their voltages with a voltmeter this device which
measures many electrical quantities but particularly voltage so here's the 6 volt battery it's
actually 6.4 volts that's close enough here's the 12 volt battery 12.6 volts yep here's
the 9 volt battery let me put it up here so we can see it 9 volt battery yep 9.4 volts
so these batteries are true to what their labels say well that's the concept I want
to explore a lot further in this lecture because the concept we think of as voltage is really
very closely related to not absolutely identical to but closely related to a concept called
electric potential difference and that's the much deeper more profound concept and that's
going to link us back to the earlier ideas of electric forces and electric fields.
So let me introduce you to this concept of electric potential difference and for the
purposes of this course with one exception the words voltage and potential difference
are essentially synonymous so you can think of them as synonymous and I'll point out the
one case where there's a slight subtle difference so we're learning about voltage or potential
difference so let me take an electric charge and let me put it in an electric field so
here I have arrows indicating an electric field that's pointing that way to your right
my left that way and so you can see that that field is a uniform electric field these are
the field lines of that electric field the fact that they are pointing all in the same
direction and the fact that they are equally spaced they aren't changing how close or far
apart they are indicates this is a uniform electric field it has the same value and the
same direction everywhere and I want to take this ball and I want to try to move it from here
to here now it's not easy and the reason it's not easy is of course this ball being positively
charged experiences an electric force q times the electric field as we found in the preceding
lecture and that electric force is that way and so I'm pushing against that electric force and
so I'm having to do work it's exactly as if I were lifting a ball against earth's gravitational
field I'm going quote uphill against that electric field and I have to do work the concept of
potential difference and the concept of voltage are related to the amount of work I do in moving
electric charge through electric fields and very key to that concept is we're talking about moving
from point A to point B we go and do work against the electric field or maybe we let the electric
field do work on us accelerating the charge but the whole concept of potential difference and
electric field is about that work that gets involved in moving charge around in electric fields work
and energy as you saw with the work energy theorem back in the mechanics lectures are very closely
related concepts so I'll often use them essentially interchangeably here and say electric potential
difference is about the movement of charge around in electric fields and how much energy is involved
in that motion so let's look in a little more detail about what this concept means first of all
I'm going to define it and I'm going to say that the electric potential difference between two
points I'll label them A and B and I'm going to write it all out in gory detail at first I'm going
to call the electric potential difference delta delta remember means difference change in or
difference delta v is going to be my symbol for potential difference v for voltage if you will
and then I'm going to put the subscripts a b because I want to indicate that I'm moving between
two points a and b and by definition the electric potential difference between two points a and b
is the work per unit charge needed to move charge between those points that's what potential difference
is it's the work per unit charge needed to move charge between two points or equivalently it's
the energy charge gains moving between two points okay work we found out in lecture 11 is force times
distance essentially gets more sophisticated if the force changes with position but basically it's
force times distance electric field as we found in lecture 29 is the force per unit charge so what
if I want to calculate the work per unit charge well instead of multiplying force times distance
I'll multiply force per unit charge times distance so potential difference is essentially electric
field times distance that's because potential difference is work per unit charge electric field
is force per unit charge force times distance is work so field times distance is work per charge
and that's my definition of potential difference so let's look at an example here here's a uniform
field again it's pointing up to the left on the screen between we want to know the potential
difference between points a and b there's an electric field I've labeled it e with an arrow over it
to indicate that it's a vector and I'm going to use my definition and find out what the potential
difference is between those two points a and b if they're a distance delta x apart so delta v a b in
this case is simply the electric field the force per unit charge times the distance I've moved
delta x so delta v in that case of a uniform electric field is simply the product of electric
field with distance if the field is non-uniform things get more complicated because as I move
from point a to point b the field in this case is getting well think about it is it weaker or
stronger the field lines are getting farther apart as I move toward b and so the field is weaker and
consequently that means I have less work as I move a given distance and I'd have to do some
dividing of that distance into little tiny intervals or else I'd have to apply calculus we're not
going to bother to do that but we already did something similar for the case of work back in
mechanics when we had a force that varied with distance and we found that the work was the area
under the force distance curve or force versus position curve and consequently in the same
situation the potential difference is going to be the area under the field versus position curve
so here I have a graph that shows the electric field strength as a function of position it might
represent what's going on there at the left where the field is stronger at the left and weaker as I
go toward point b and if I could find that area either by some kind of graphical means or using
calculus delta v a b the work per unit charge involved in moving from point a to point b is in
fact that area under that force versus position curve so that is electric potential difference work
per unit charge what are its units well the electric potential difference delta v a b between two
points a and b is the work per unit charge needed to move between those points work is measured in
joules charge is measured in coulombs so the unit of potential difference is the joule per coulomb
energy per charge that unit defines the volt so you've heard of volts you know you've got
six volt batteries 120 volts at your wall high voltage to worry about what do those things mean
ultimately voltages about the energy imparted to individual charges voltage is the work per
unit charge in the SI system it's joules per coulomb and a joule per coulomb defines a volt so if I
have a battery here's a picture of a nine volt battery what that nine volts is telling you is
that if you move charge from one terminal of the battery to the other you will either have to do
nine joules of work or else nine joules of work will be done on you for every coulomb of charge you
move between those terminals so let's go back and look at our batteries a little bit more think
about them in this context of this new understanding here's the 12 volt car battery if a coulomb of
charge comes out of here the positive terminal and flows through a wire well actually negative
electrons would go the other way we'll get to that in a couple of lectures but if that were to
happen every coulomb of charge that flows from this terminal to that one has 12 joules of work done
on it with the six volt lantern battery here's the positive terminal every coulomb of charge that
flows from here to here through an external circuit has six joules of work done on it half a
coulomb would have three joules of work done on it a sixth of a coulomb would have a sixth of a
joule of work that's what that means pick up the one and a half volt battery what does that mean it
means for every coulomb of charge that goes from the positive terminal to the negative terminal
the battery gives it 1.5 joules of energy that's what voltage is it's about energy per unit charge
voltage is a measure of the energy involved in moving between two points moving electric charge
between two points and it is the energy per unit of charge involved in moving between those two
points now there's a term i've stressed over and over again here and that's the idea that we're
talking about two points each one of these batteries has two terminals two places i can connect things
to it two terminals those springy things on top of there two terminals on the one and a half volt
battery the top and the bottom two terminals on the nine volt battery the two snap connectors
two points voltage is a property of two points people who don't understand voltage miss that
and consequently they misuse the term voltage and that can have serious real consequences
i've seen people misunderstand voltage and hook up uh car batteries when they're trying to jump
start a car wrong and with disastrous consequences you have to understand that a volt is a property
of two points it's about the work involved in moving between two points the fact that we've
now defined the volt gives us an alternative measure of electric field strengths we were
measuring electric fields as newtons per coulomb i'm not going to go through the math of this
but if you work out the newtons per coulomb in a uh in si units and work that out in terms of
volts as joules per coulomb you will find that you can write newtons per coulomb equally well
as volts per meter so volts per meter of distance is another measure of electric field strength
so let's look at an example where it's really important that voltage is a measure of work per
unit charge or energy per unit charge involved in moving between two points so here is a happens
to be a news photograph it's not terribly clear a photograph but it's a fascinating photograph
electrically because it shows a paraglider who landed in a power line a high voltage power line
danger high voltage well he's in real danger he's sitting astral the power line as you can see
and with his hand he's grabbing the power line for stability how come he hasn't been electrocuted
well if you really understand potential difference as the work or energy per unit charge involved
in moving between two points you'll understand why he's not being electrocuted or if you see
a bunch of birds land on a high voltage line why aren't they being electrocuted it's not because
the wire is insulated it's not no sense insulating high voltage power lines it's because potential
difference is a property of two points and unless you're in contact with two points that
are electrically different you are not going to get electrocuted and that's what's happening with
this paraglider he is in a situation where if somebody reached up from the ground and grabbed him
both of them might get electrocuted that's why you see those signs on cherry picker trucks saying
danger don't touch this truck because if the person up in the boom of the truck is accidentally
touching a high voltage power line they may be okay but once you touch it also and make the contact
to the ground you got a problem so potential difference is about two points why is potential
difference even useful if it's about two points i do i have to tell you every time what those two
points are well i sort of have to tell you the two points but here's what i don't have to tell you
i don't have to tell you how i get from one point to the other and the reason i don't is because
the electric force is a conservative force now way back in mechanics we talked about
conservative forces they're forces that when you do work against them as in gravity lifting
a ball against the force of gravity you can get that energy back again the energy you put in the
work you did is stored as potential energy in the case of a conservative force and like gravity
the electric force is also conservative and we found out with conservative forces that it doesn't
matter what path you take to get from point a to point b the amount of work had to be the same
and i gave you a little proof of that for the mechanical case and the electric force is also
conservative so it's true for electricity as well and that means if i talk about point a and b and
i say what's the electric potential difference between them it doesn't matter whether i take
that nice nice straight path between a and b where it might be reasonably easy to calculate the
potential difference or i take some curved path like that or i take some complicated looping path
like that it doesn't matter i guarantee you the answer for the work per unit charge to go from
a to b by any of those paths will be the same on that complicated looping path i may have work done
on me as i'm going backwards toward a briefly but it will all compensate in the end and the amount
of work it takes to move a unit of charge between point a and point b will be the same if that weren't
the case then this whole concept wouldn't be very meaningful and i will show you cases later on
with a different kind of electric force sort of where in fact it isn't conservative but for
now the electric forces we've encountered due to electric charges are conservative and so this
concept of potential difference is useful because all i have to tell you is i want to go from here
to here doesn't matter how i get there the work involved is path independent that's potential
difference and let's pause and do just a simple example on our big screen of involving potential
difference very simple example we can talk about thunderstorms we can talk about the voltage that
develops as a result of thunderstorms now it so happens that even in fair weather there is an
electric field in normal fair weather air of about a hundred volts per meter that means between my two
hands a meter apart there's a voltage of about a hundred volts now wait a minute how come i'm not
getting zapped well because i'm such a good conductor compared to air that i've basically
short circuited that out and by putting my hands there the electric field has gone away
i've drained the charges off they're giving rise to it ultimately but under normal fair
weather conditions there is this electric field in the fair weather air the air will break down
meaning that electrons will be torn off air molecules and the air will become a conductor
in fields of about three million volts per meter so we're very far from that in fair weather
conditions on the other hand under a thunderstorm cloud there's typically an electric field of
about 10 000 volts per meter and incidentally that field is pointing downward because as i mentioned
earlier the earth carries a slight negative charge and there we are and the question now is what's
the voltage between the bottom of that thunder cloud and the surface of the earth so let's assume
the altitude of the cloud bottom is typically about two kilometers this is a really easy calculation
what's the potential difference between the cloud and the ground delta v was the electric field
multiplied by the distance in this case delta y because it's vertical that's about 10 000 volts
per meter divided by not multiplied by 2000 meters 20 million volts 20 mega volts that's a big
voltage but that's the voltage between the bottom of the cloud and the sky because that's over two
kilometers it's still a lot less than the three million volts per one meter that it would take
to break the air down but in the vicinity of a thunderstorm the fields can get much higher and
when they do the air breaks down and that's what gives rise to a lightning strike so there's a very
simple example where we've done a calculation of voltage well so far i've talked mostly about
uniform fields and potential differences as in the case of that field under the thunderstorm
what happens when the field is changing with position well i'd like to give you some ideas of
how you can think about potential differences in such cases let me begin with the point charge
we've seen the point charge electric field it's this radially outward field it's falling off as
one over r squared i want to ask the question what's the potential difference if i try to move from
point a to point b in this diagram in the potential difference in the electric field of the point
charge well i'm not going to do the math but it's similar to something we looked at in lecture 13
namely the gravitational potential energy associated with moving around in the inverse
square gravitational field it turns out the same thing it's an inverse r potential difference so
it's k q over r b minus k q over r a and it turns out to be very convenient to ask the following
question what if i started with a charge that was very very far away from this point charge
it brought it in from almost infinitely far away and so what we do is we say let's always make point
a be infinitely far from a point charge sounds a little odd but it makes the math real easy
because one over infinity is zero so then we can talk about the potential of a point charge
as i go from a point a a distance r a from that charge to a point r b a distance r b from that
charge and i'm going to let point a get infinitely far away so that r a goes to infinity and one
over r a goes to zero and then i have a very simple expression if i'm taking the zero of potential
effectively at infinity v as a function of position is simply k q over r for a point charge
i didn't do the calculus to get that result but there is a very simple result describing the
potential in the field of a point charge now i made a big point about the fact that we always
have to talk about potential as a difference and now i'm saying oh the potential in the field of a
point charge what i'm really saying is the potential difference between a point infinitely far away
and a point of distance r from a point charge is this quantity k q over r so there it is for a
point charge and now we can begin to think about potential differences of more complicated charge
distributions by thinking about individual point charges before we do that i want to take a digression
into something that seems to have nothing to do with electricity and that's a digression about
maps so here's a picture of a mountain in our three-dimensional world well when you go hiking
in the mountains you don't carry a three-dimensional holographic map probably you carry a flat map
or you've got one on your gps device or whatever that flat map represents the third dimension
with contour lines so here's a contour map of that same mountain and you can see where the
contour lines are close together the map is the mountain is steep that means the height and consequently
the gravitational potential energy are changing rapidly with distance we can do exactly the same
for the electric case we can think of electric fields the same way we think of the strength of
gravity as you look down a mountain slope the gravitational force component down the slope
and we can draw things similar to these maps here's an example here is on the left a three-dimensional
plot of the potential of a dipole it's in a a plane it's because the dipole exists in three
dimensional space and i'd have to do a four-dimensional map to show that so this is a
slice in a plane containing the dipole and you can see that tall mountain-like structure on the
right that's the potential as a function of position associated with the positive point charge the
hole on the left is associated with the negative point charge and the two of them combine to make
the potential of the dipole you can see in the picture on the right where i've drawn both the
electric field of the dipole that's the yellow structures that are going out in those loops
we've already seen for the dipole but i've also drawn now the dipole equipotentials lines by
contour lines on a map which give you regions where the potential is the same you could walk
around one of those curves or carry a charge around one of those curves and you wouldn't
have to do any work just like you could walk along a contour line on the side of a mountain and you
wouldn't be going up or down so you wouldn't be doing any work against gravity so we can represent
equipotentials by these contour line like things or represent potentials by these contour like
things we call equipotentials and you'll notice the equipotentials are right angles to the field
they have to be because the only way you can do no work moving against the field is to not move
against it and that is to move at right angles to it so there's a potential map the dipole and let's
look at a couple more potential maps here's a map this is an actual data of a human torso you can
kind of see the torso in the background these are equipotentials taken on the body and this is
essentially what doctors do when they take your electrocardiogram except they're not mapping out
hundreds and hundreds of points they're maybe taking a dozen points or so and measuring the
voltages and they're telling you something about the heart and if you map out the equipotentials
in this case down on the right is a region of positive potential on the left is a region of
negative potential like that hole in the case of the dipole in fact this picture is showing you
that the heart has a dipole like structure and that in the heart there is an electric field that
points from the positive region toward the negative region now I should say the heart of course is
dynamic it beats and its electrical structure changes with time and that's what electrocardiogram
show us but there's an example of how the heart would tell us something about dipole equipotentials
and using equipotentials to understand what's happening in an electrical system let's take
another look at such a system on our big screen so here I have a map of some equipotentials and
I'm asking the question what's the greatest electric field in this region well if this
were a contour map and I said what's the place where the mountain is steepest you would go to
where the contours are closest and they say the mountain is most steep there same thing here the
electric field is greatest here furthermore I'm going from 40 kilovolts that's sort of high up
in mountain analogy 30 kilovolts 2010 that means downward is that way the electric field is pointing
to the left in that region so there's what the electric field looks like that's the maximum
electric field in this region by the way I've labeled these converse with measures of potential
they're all relative to some place where the potential is defined to be zero so what's the
greatest electric field here well the we've gone from five meters where the field where the potential
is 40 kilovolts to two meters where the potential is 10 kilovolts that's 40 kilovolts minus 10
kilovolts in five meters minus two meters that's 30 kilovolts per three meters that's 10 kilovolts
per meter uh volt per meter is equivalent to a newton per coulomb so the answer to our question
is 10 kilonewtons per coulomb to the left what's the force just incidentally if we put say a one
milli coulomb charge in that field well the force is always the charge times the electric field
strength that's one milli coulomb times 10 kilonewtons per coulomb that comes out 10 newtons you
might say how did I get that well in fact I took the milli which is 0.001 and it canceled the kilo
which is 1000 so there we are so that's the concept of equipotentials analogous to contour lines on a
map well let me end with one other additional consideration involving equipotentials I'd
like to think now about what happens if we have an electrical conductor now one thing about a
conductor is a conductor has no electric field within it and if you think about the electric
field right at its surface if the conductors in equilibrium the field must point perpendicular
to the surface because charge can't move around on the surface and if the field had a component
parallel to the surface charge would move we wouldn't be in equilibrium and since the equipotentials
are at right angles to the field that means equipotentials right near the surface have to be
basically parallel to the surface so let's look at an example here's a charged conductor some
irregularly shaped object and as I try to draw equipotentials around that the ones closest in
are going to hug that surface and the ones farther out are going to become less hugging
of the surface and eventually if I went very far away because we proved earlier that a charged object
if you're very far from it looks like a point charge they'll become circular like the equipotentials
would be around a point charge and consequently if we try to draw the field lines we see that they
have to concentrate in the regions where those equipotentials are hugging around that pointed
part and that means the electric field of a charged object is going to be strongest
where the object curves most sharply and I want to do a demonstration of what that means so let's
move over here where we have our vandagraph generator set up again and we have a couple of
objects nearby right now I've got the vandagraph set up ready to go I've got a smaller ball there
the smaller ball is connected by this wire to the ground through the electric power line and so
it is going to draw charge off that charged sphere of the vandagraph when it charges up and let's
look at what happens as the vandagraph charges up and charge that we feel a very big potential
difference between these two spheres by the way the field of these spheres since they're spherical
looks sort of like the field of a point charge radially outward and the equipotentials are sort
of spheres around those so here we go turning it up
and as it charges up we begin to get some sparks jumping not very many
and not super strong let's watch them a little bit
okay but now let's replace that object with another one discharge that
with the pointed one this pointed end is going to face the vandagraph about the same distance apart
and I will bring it up again
we draw a spark a lot quicker we're drawing more sparks
and I think you'll agree that if we look close up they're more dramatic looking sparks
so why are we interested in this is this just some kind of g-wiz demonstration no this is really
important because it means if you're designing systems that operate at high voltage you need to
avoid sharp corners here's an example a picture showing what's called corona discharge on a power
line it's a place where we have nuts or bolts or something with sharp edges to them on a high
voltage power line and we actually get strong enough electric fields that they break down the
air and we're actually losing electrical energy to these sparks that are jumping off the power line
so avoid sharp corners on power lines unless you happen to be studying lightning or want to draw
lightning to a lightning rod here's an example where we researchers studying lightning have shot
a very thin rock a very thin wire up into the air trailing behind a rocket and they generate
lightning as a result of that they're doing it under a thunderstorm and they're able to
get to make the lightning happen when they want it to because they develop very strong electric
fields the breakdown of air occurs and the charge from the thunderstorm dumps onto their
wire and they get lightning so unless you're studying lightning or maybe you can safely handle the
current which happens in tall buildings with metal frames they're struck by lightning many many
many times without any damage because the heavy metal within the building can move that charge
right down to ground without any problems so you avoid sharp corners when you're dealing with
high voltages well let me end with a quick summary of lecture 30 we found that electric potential
difference this key idea very closely related to voltage is the work per unit charge needed to
move charge between those two points again voltage is a near synonym for electric potential difference
the unit is the volt what a volt really means is energy per charge it's one joule per coulomb is
the definition of a volt we can calculate the potential difference as the electric field times
the distance at least in the case of uniform electric fields the point charge potential falls
off like 1 over r the work per unit charge to move from infinity to a distance r from a point charge
equal potentials help us describe contours of constant potential and finally we get strong
fields where conductors are sharp because of and we can understand that in terms of drawing the
equal potentials around those sharp corners
