Welcome to the final lecture of this course in which we've been learning to see and understand
structure in the world's great buildings, bridges, and towers.
Over the past 23 lectures, we've examined many great structures, from the pyramids of
the 25th century BC to the Burj Khalifa of 2010, from simple stone beams and columns
to complex steel tension structures and thin concrete shells.
Yet, there are many more great structures that we haven't yet had an opportunity to discuss.
And there are even more structures that probably don't qualify as great, but are certainly
interesting enough to warrant our attention.
Today our course comes to an end, but what happens tomorrow?
What happens when you encounter a noteworthy structure that hasn't been included in the
course and you want to know more about it?
I'd like to devote today's lecture to answering that question, to sending you forth with some
suggested strategies for understanding any structure, great or otherwise, when you encounter
in your world.
And I'll illustrate these strategies by introducing you to even more great structures, including
my own personal favorite.
Perhaps the most straightforward approach to understanding a structure that we haven't
seen in this course is by direct comparison with structures that we have seen.
As we've worked through our thematic case studies of the past 14 lectures, we've often
seen a clear developmental progression within a particular structural category.
For example, the development of domed structures has been characterized by a series of milestones
from the Pantheon all the way to the Zeiss Planetarium.
When we encounter a new structure in the same category, we can make sense of it through
direct comparison with one or more of these milestones.
And in making the comparison, we can often learn as much from the differences as from
the similarities.
For example, the dome of the U.S. Capitol can be understood through direct comparison
with the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
Like St. Paul's, the Capitol dome uses the same basic three-part configuration, non-structural
outer and inner shells, and then concealed between the two a roughly parabolic-shaped
structural dome that supports the lantern above.
As structures, both domes work exactly the same way.
The only significant difference between them is that the structural dome of St. Paul's
is a solid brick, while the Capitol dome is an open iron framework.
And in this one difference, we can see the influence of the iron-framed dome of the Paris
grain market, which was built about 100 years after St. Paul's and about 50 years before
the Capitol.
Similarly, when we encounter the spectacular new Tokyo Sky Tree, we should recognize it
as a modern legacy of Gustave Eiffel's Great Tower in Paris.
The Sky Tree has been designed to top out at 2,080 feet, making it the world's tallest
tower.
Its overall shape and its use of a truss as the principal structural system evoke that
great Paris tower and clearly reflect the same structural challenge that Gustave Eiffel
was responding to, resisting lateral wind load.
But the Sky Tree goes a few steps farther, incorporating a reinforced concrete core inside
the truss and employing a uniquely varying cross-section, triangular at the base for
stability, but gradually transitioning to circular at the top for decreased wind resistance.
In the Tokyo Sky Tree, as in the U.S. Capitol, our understanding of structure is aided and
enriched by comparison with milestone structures from the same general structural category.
But what happens when we encounter structures and categories that haven't been covered
in the course?
Well, in such cases we can often draw analogies with different types of structures that nonetheless
carry load in essentially the same way.
For example, we haven't discussed dams in this course until now, yet I hope you can
now see the Hoover Dam as really nothing more than an arch turned sideways, holding
back an immense wall of water in essentially the same way that the arch of the Roman Pont
Saint Martin carries the weight of stone above it.
So what about tunnels?
Well, I hope you can now see the tunnel that 31-mile tunnel linking England and France
has just another interesting variation on the arch.
Completed in 1994, the tunnel actually consists of three passages, two rail tunnels and a service
tunnel.
All three were excavated with immense tunnel-boring machines shown here.
At the front of the machine is an immense 30-foot diameter rotating cutter head that
was used to excavate the tunnel openings.
The back end of the machine, not visible in this photo, is a hydraulic arm that was used
to install the tunnel lining at the same time as the excavation was occurring.
The tunnel lining consists of arch-shaped precast concrete segments placed around the
entire perimeter of the excavation, as shown here.
Now, if you're thinking that these segments look a lot like the stone voussoires of a
Roman arch, congratulations, you are learning to see and understand structure.
The tunnel lining of the tunnel works exactly like an arch, except its principal loading
is soil pressure, which is exerted inward around the entire perimeter of the tunnel
lining, like this, and so the tunnel lining needs to be a full circle, rather than the
semi-circle of a traditional arch.
In that sense, the tunnel is also quite similar to the treasury of Atreus, that ancient Mycenaean
corbel dome built underground with its circular layers of stone held in place by soil pressure.
Conversely, sometimes you'll encounter a structure that superficially resembles one
of our categories, but it's actually something else entirely.
For example, a structure that looks like an arch isn't always an arch.
This is the Quiancheng Bridge in China's Fujian province, one of the few surviving
examples of a traditional Chinese bridge configuration called a rainbow bridge, which dates back
to the 11th century.
Most people refer to these structures as arch bridges, but the structural system isn't
really an arch.
Look very closely at the underside of this bridge, at the interwoven timbers that constitute
its main load-carrying elements.
I know it's kind of hard to see in this photo, so let's build a model.
I'm going to build a model of the rainbow bridge from these eight essentially identical
wooden members, plus five shorter members which we'll use as transverse or cross members.
Now I've fabricated these elements to fit together very precisely, but in fact, if you
wanted to build a simple model to investigate this same structure, you could do a reasonably
good job with a stack of popsicle sticks.
And as you might expect, I do strongly recommend the construction of simple models as a way
to gain insights about how structures work.
Now, the rainbow bridge only becomes completely stable after it's been fully constructed.
So because of that condition, I'm actually going to build my model of the rainbow bridge
lying on its side, and then when it's complete, I'll stand it up.
While it actually would have been possible to build the full-size actual structure this
same way, my best guess is that the actual rainbow bridge was built in place, standing
upright using temporary supports while it was still under construction.
So we'll begin by setting out the basic shape of the rainbow bridge, which is essentially
trapezoidal, by putting three of these principal structural elements in place.
Now at the joints where the members come together, I'm simply going to place these transverse
elements.
Now on top, we'll overlay another set of longitudinal members to come together in the center, and
we're also going to add a transverse member here.
Notice that as I put this structure together, I'm not using any glue or nails or screws
or fasteners or adhesives to hold it together.
The members simply interlock and are interwoven at the places where they cross over each other.
Now I'm going to complete the structure by adding an exact copy of the first layer, that
trapezoidal layer that I started out the construction with, and in doing so, I will complete the
basic structural system.
And now as I said, all we need to do is take the structure and stand it upright and put
it on its support so that it can carry load.
I need to make a few adjustments so that everything's aligned properly, and at this point the
structure is now capable of carrying load on its own, and indeed, it can carry a significant
amount of load.
Notice also that as I load the arch, there is no lateral support provided at the base
as we saw when I built the model of the classical semi-circular Vouchoir arch.
And so we can conclude quite legitimately that this is not an arch.
In fact, it is a frame, similar to the rigid frames that we saw in iron and steel framed
buildings.
Doesn't look the same because the modern rigid frames we examined in Lecture 18 get their
rigidity from specially designed connections.
The rainbow bridge gets its rigidity from this interweaving of transverse and longitudinal
elements.
But like a modern rigid frame, its members carry load in bending and axial compression
combined, rather than just in compression as an arch does.
By the way, the frame bridge is not just an ancient Chinese technology.
Here's a typical modern example, the Fahey Bridge over the Lehigh River in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.
Because we already know how rigid frames work in buildings, we can understand this analogous
structure without too much difficulty.
But what if we encounter a structure for which there aren't any obvious analogous structural
categories?
Well, in that case, we can and should examine the structural system using the same approach
we discussed back in Lecture 9.
For example, consider the cable-stayed bridge.
We've seen a few examples of cable-stayed bridges in previous lectures, but we've never
considered them systematically as a structural category.
And we should, because the cable-stayed bridge represents a relatively new form in which
there are already many great structures, and in which interesting new structures of incredible
variety are being built every day.
So let's try analyzing a typical cable-stayed bridge as a structural system, as a way of
gaining new insights about the category as a whole.
This is the Stromsund Bridge in Sweden, built in 1956 and generally regarded as the first
modern cable-stayed bridge.
The principal loads acting on this structure are traffic loads and the bridge's own self-weight.
Here are those loads acting on the main girder.
That girder is supported by vertical reactions, which occur at the abutments and the towers
where the girder physically rests on those supports, and also by tension in the state
cables that are attached to the girder along its length.
The cable tension then is also applied in the opposite direction to the tops of the towers.
Note that in this bridge, the cable tension forces are balanced horizontally.
They are symmetrical about the towers, so the horizontal components of all of those cable
tension forces counterbalance each other.
But in the vertical direction, the net effect of all those cable tension forces is a large
downward force transmitted into the towers.
The towers then transmit the entire bridge weight down into the structural foundations,
and that's the way the structural system functions as a whole.
Now cable-stayed bridges are often confused with suspension bridges, but they are entirely
different and this analysis helps us understand why.
Let's look at a free-body diagram of just one segment of the main girder of that bridge,
isolated from the rest of the structure.
Note that for the girder to be in equilibrium, all the forces must be in balance in both
the vertical and horizontal directions.
But the only way to achieve equilibrium in the horizontal direction for this segment
is for the girder to experience a large internal compression force, which counterbalances the
horizontal component of cable tension.
The girder then needs to be designed to resist this compression, as well as the bending loads
caused by the traffic that's crossing the bridge and is transmitted to the girders through
the deck.
And that's why the main girder of the Stromson bridge is so much more substantial than, say,
the stiffening girder of the Severn suspension bridge, shown here.
Another important difference between a cable-stayed bridge and a suspension bridge is that the
cable-stayed configuration is much stiffer.
Remember that a suspension bridge hangs from a draped cable, and draped cables change their
shape significantly in response to changes in load.
In a cable-stayed bridge, the girders are directly connected to the towers by those straight cables,
which don't change shape under load because they are, in fact, perfectly straight.
By the way, this is precisely why John Robling used stay cables on his Niagara Falls and
Brooklyn suspension bridges to reduce the inherent flexibility of the suspension bridge
configuration by connecting the stiffening trusses directly to the towers.
The disadvantage of this direct connection between girder and towers is that a large
concentrated load out in the center span of the bridge can cause a tendency to either
bend or overturn the towers.
And there is no such tendency in a suspension bridge because suspension bridge cables pass
over the tops of the towers without a physical attachment.
The designer of the Strom Sun Bridge handled this overturning tendency by attaching the
outermost stay cables, called backstays, to the girder near the concrete abutments.
This arrangement provides a direct load path from the tower right down to the abutment,
and as this free body diagram shows, the overturning tendency of that big load out on the main
span can now be counterbalanced by a downward reaction at the abutment.
The Strom Sun Bridge is a conventional cable state configuration, two vertical towers with
stay cables arranged symmetrically around those towers.
But there have been many, many creative adaptations of this configuration, particularly in recent
cable state bridges, and we can understand these unconventional cable state arrangements
as well.
This is the Kniebrücke in Düsseldorf, Germany.
It has only one tower rather than two.
And on the shore side of that tower, out on the girder, are a series of closely spaced
concrete piers.
You can see them here in this slide.
Each of those piers is located at the shore side attachment of one backstay.
Once again, this direct attachment of the backstays to external supports is designed
to stabilize the tower against tipping in response to loads applied out on the main
span.
Cable state bridges can also have more than two towers.
In fact, the Milau Bridge in France, the world's tallest bridge, has seven towers.
But in this configuration, it's only possible to anchor the backstays to exterior supports
for the outermost spans.
So the five interior towers of the Milau Bridge are particularly susceptible to that problem
with overturning or bending.
And that's why the towers are supported on two-legged piers, and the towers themselves
are formed into triangular shapes.
That added width increases stability, just as it did with buttresses in medieval cathedrals.
Now, let's consider the Alameo Bridge in Seville, Spain, designed by Santiago Calatrava
and constructed in 1992.
This bridge has an even more unconventional configuration, a single tower with no backstays
at all.
The backward lean of the tower might appear to be an aesthetic feature, but it's actually
a structural necessity.
The tension in the cable stays causes a tendency to rotate the tower forward toward the center
span.
The rearward tilt, on the other hand, causes a tendency to rotate the tower backward.
The two tendencies counterbalance each other.
In effect, the tilt of the tower replaces the backstays.
So if it makes good structural sense for the tower of a single tower bridge to lean backward,
how do we make sense of Calatrava's Samuel Beckett Bridge in Dublin, Ireland?
Why does this tower lean forward?
Well, here the answer is largely aesthetic.
Calatrava designed the Beckett Bridge to resemble a harp, the national symbol of Ireland.
This effect required an inward leaning tower, even though the inward lean actually reinforces
the overturning tendency of the tension in the stay cables.
And note that the only way to make this configuration work structurally was to add two very substantial
backstays to stabilize the tower.
Note that in all of these examples, important distinguishing characteristics of an amazing
variety of structures can be understood in terms of a single concept, the equilibrium
of the tower against overturning.
Note also that all of these insights derive directly from our structural analysis of the
Stromson Bridge.
That's precisely the point of this discussion.
A qualitative structural system analysis can open the door to deep understanding of an
entire category of structure.
Having said that, I must also emphasize that we can gain many fascinating and rewarding
insights about structures without doing any sort of formal analysis at all.
This is because structures often communicate with us in clear and compelling ways simply
through the shapes and proportions of their elements.
To illustrate this point, let's have a look at London's Millennium Dome, the largest single
roofed dome structure in the world, completed in 1998.
Those 12 tall towers, characteristic features of this structure, tell us that they carry
load in compression because of their stout proportions and the orientations of the attached
stay cables.
The array of cables radiating out from the towers tell us that they carry tension simply
by virtue of their slender proportions.
We might call this the language of structure, a language that structural elements use to
tell us how they work.
If we can read the language of structure, if we can discern how members carry load based
solely on their shapes and proportions, well, we don't need to do a formal structural analysis.
The members themselves tell us that the Millennium Dome, for example, is a cable-stayed building.
So my final recommended strategy for seeing and understanding structure is to learn to
read the language of structure, to see the shapes and proportions of structural elements
as subtle messages about their load-carrying purpose.
And in this language, there is no more interesting bit of structural vocabulary than the parabola.
There is something very special about the parabola and its cousin, the catenary.
In this course, we've seen that the parabola is a direct reflection of the underlying science
that governs the behavior of many different types of structural elements.
That's the natural shape of a draped cable.
It's the shape of the thrust line in an arch.
It's the shape of the moment diagram for a uniformly loaded beam.
And so when we see the parabolic form in a structure, we're almost always looking at
an element that was optimally designed for load-carrying.
We've seen the parabola in the main cables of great suspension bridges.
In the vaulting of the Persian imperial palace at Ctesiphon.
And in arches from Eiffel's Garabit viaducts to Kalitrava's Campo-Voluntean bridge in
Bilbao.
But the parabola is found in more than just cables and arches.
It's also in the profile of optimally designed beams like the graceful box girders of the
Raft Sundit bridge in Norway.
And even in trusses like Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash, a particularly rich example
because we get two parabolas for the price of one, a top cord that works like an arch,
and a bottom cord that works like a cable.
Now that you understand why parabolas are used in so many different kinds of structural
applications, you're going to start noticing them in all sorts of unexpected places.
For example, you'll occasionally encounter them in the facades of buildings.
As you can see in the Marquette Plaza, the former Federal Reserve Bank building in Minneapolis.
Here that parabolic shape on the facade corresponds to a steel tension element that works like
a draped cable to support the upper floors of the building, allowing an open, column-free
first floor lobby.
And here's that very same concept applied in reverse.
The Broadgate Exchange House in London.
A huge parabolic arch carries the weight of the building in compression, and because
it's supported only out at its ends, the arch system allowed the building to be constructed
directly over a set of train tracks running below ground level.
The tower of the cable-stayed Denver Millennium Bridge is a compression member with a parabolic
profile, and the tower of the Reggio Emilia Bridge in Italy is an immense parabolic tube.
I could provide hundreds more examples like these, but that might spoil all of your fun.
Now that you know how to look for the characteristic shapes and proportions of the language of structure,
you're going to be amazed at what you find.
I'd like to conclude this lecture and this course with a look at my personal favorite
structure.
It's my favorite because it speaks the language of structure so vividly, and because it incorporates
so many features of great structures we've seen elsewhere in the course.
The structure is Pierre Nervy's Palazzo Dello Sport in Rome, built in 1957.
We've already seen the thin-shell dome of Nervy's Palazzo Dello Sport in lecture 21.
The Palazzo is smaller, as its name implies, but it's even more interesting as a structural
system.
Let's start at the top with this marvelous thin-shell dome, 197 feet in diameter.
The dome was built up from hundreds of individual diamond-shaped concrete shells, which you
can see in the ribbed pattern on the interior surface.
Each diamond was prefabricated using Nervy's signature material, ferrocemento, a thin sandwich
of concrete and wire mesh.
These diamond-shaped modules were then positioned on scaffolding and connected together by pouring
a thin layer of concrete on top, producing a structure of extraordinary strength and
lightness, and extraordinary beauty by the way.
This is a distinctly modern dome, yet in a way it evokes the ancient dome of the Pantheon,
and in a way that's particularly intriguing.
Those hollow ferrocemento diamonds fulfill the same role as the coffers of the Pantheon,
and Nervy's dome incorporates an oculus that functions exactly as the oculus of the Pantheon
does.
Now, near the base of the dome, note how the pattern in the concrete ribs changes to channel
those compressive forces in the dome out into discrete points of support at its bottom edge.
Much as the pendentives of Hagia Sophia channel the weight of that immense dome down into four
supporting columns.
On the exterior of the palazzetto, we can see that these points of support connect to
flying buttresses, which carry the loads out to the foundations beyond the building's outer
perimeter.
But Nervy's buttresses go one step beyond the flying buttresses of Gothic cathedrals.
They're triangulated so that they also function as trusses to stabilize the dome against lateral
loads.
And finally, the foundation of this wonderful structural system serves as a tension ring,
which contains the lateral thrust of the buttresses in much the same way that Filippo Brunelleschi's
stone chains contain the thrust of his dome over the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore
in Florence.
This structure is an amazing combination of structural elements, drawing upon the technologies
of ancient Rome, Byzantium, Medieval Europe, and Renaissance Italy, yet combined in a way
that's thoroughly modern, beautifully integrated, and perfectly expressive of structural purpose.
Nervy himself described this quality when he said,
�Beauty does not come from decorative effects, but from structural coherence.�
I suggest that we can all benefit from learning to see the built environment as Nervy did,
to seek out and recognize building's bridges and towers that clearly communicate how they
work as structures, and that do so in an aesthetically compelling way.
You now know everything you need to understand, structures like Christian Men's Gantor Bridge
in Switzerland, which combines the features of a cable-stayed bridge and a continuous
segmental box girder bridge, and which achieves structural benefit and striking appearance
by encasing its steel-stay cables in those triangular-shaped concrete walls above the deck.
Structures like Calatrava's Turning Torso Tower in Mamo, Sweden, which evokes the human
body through its twisted shape, and more importantly, through that dramatic externally
mounted truss that serves as the building's spine.
Not only are these sorts of structures uniquely rewarding to see and understand, but because
of this compelling integration of structure and form, they may just be the greatest of
the great.
At the start of our first lecture, I read a short segment of the poem Passage to India,
in which Walt Whitman sang the strong lightworks of engineers.
In this course, we too have celebrated the strong lightworks of engineers in the world's
great structures, from antiquity to the present.
Our song is now at an end, but I hope that your appreciation of the world's great structures
has only just begun.
Thank you.
Thank you.
