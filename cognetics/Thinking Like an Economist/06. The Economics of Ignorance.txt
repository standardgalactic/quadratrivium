Welcome back for one more time.
Today we're going to use lecture six in our series on how to think like an economist.
And much of our time has been spent trying to figure out how to make rational decisions.
But rational decision making is probably dependent more than anything else on the quality of the
information that you have. When computers first came out there was a principle that was adopted
that still holds called the Geigo principle. Garbage in, you're going to get garbage out.
I think there's kind of a Geigo to life as well. If you get garbage info in before you make your
decision processes the decisions you make are likely to be garbage as well. It's so important
in fact that for the next three lectures we're going to spend a lot of time talking about different
aspects of thinking like economists about information. If you think education is expensive
you should try ignorance. That's a bumper sticker I often see on cars driving around my
overeducated college town. And I know you're saying here he goes again what kind of a professor
uses bumper stickers as illustration points but I do it a lot. I understand what that sentiment
is. I understand what they mean to say but if you think about it like an economist you know it
mischaracterizes the choice we have to make. Why? The choice is never between omniscience on the one
hand and total ignorance on the other. This is a choice about trade-offs on the margin and as always
there's an optimal balance between the costs of acquiring information and the costs of being ignorant
and as much as it pains me as a college professor to admit it there is such a thing as having too
much education. And in this lecture and the two that follow we're going to address a number of
variations on that theme. We're going to examine some trade-offs between ignorance and information.
Economically speaking for each decision there's going to be an optimal level of ignorance.
We'll use our toolkit to explore that the same six foundation principles the same core concepts
and that Pareto standard of economic efficiency. And we're going to reach the conclusion that a
certain amount of ignorance almost always makes sense. It's not that information isn't valuable
obviously it is and it's not that having more and better information doesn't lead to better
decisions because it does. More information is valuable more information does aid decisions
but you know what I'm going to say next. There's no such thing as a free lunch
there's no such thing as truly free information as well. Information always has a cost if nothing
else it takes time and effort to absorb it and to assimilate it. If you spend two hours down at
the library reading free materials that has its own cost an opportunity cost perhaps not a direct
financial one. But in order to be rational the benefit of more information must always be balanced
off with its cost. Economics as you know is all about making choices and it's hard to overemphasize
the significance of information. If we don't know what the alternatives are if we don't know what
the consequences of those alternatives are going to be it's going to be very hard for us to choose
wisely between the options that are available to us. Information is essential for optimization.
Yet we enter this world not with omniscience but if you'll allow me to coin a new term we enter with
omnign ignorance we know virtually nothing so we run high risks of making bad decisions
and the balance the acquisition of information is itself costly. One of the key decisions we
make over and over and over again how ignorant is it rational for me to be. In this lecture I want to
make an assumption a metaphor that will say that the essential information is out there somewhere
and our problem is how do we go about getting it and how much should we get. So conceptualize
information a giant pile of data a giant pile of sand nobody owns it nobody controls it is
just there we can go get it when we want but it's bulky so we have to make repeated trips and each
time we can get a bit of it or a bundle of it or a bucket of it and we bring that back and evaluate
and of course that's our marginal information what we acquire in each trip. Now the real
opportunity costs in doing that and I'm going to assume as I have more and more information here
to work with the value of getting just one more bit at some point starts to decline we've reached
the term diminishing returns so at some point getting another bit of information won't really
add much and won't be worth the cost of going after it that's too simplified and later we'll
get much more complicated we'll worry about the world when there are chance events and risk and
probability coming in we'll worry about what happens when other people control that information
and can use it strategically to try and influence us but for today for today alone we're going to
put those complexities aside and focus on this simpler problem. How much information and how
much ignorance is optimal is it the same for every decision if not what determines what's
the amount of information slash ignorance in a different decision are there things we can do
to try and reduce the amount of ignorance to make information more accessible to an economist of
course this is all going to depend and you know where we're going it's all going to depend on
the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of information what is more information by you
what it does if you have more information there's a reduced chance that you're going to make a
suboptimal a not so good decision and the cost of making a bad decision is what happens if you
make the perfect one relative to what happens if you make the less good one and sometimes that
difference is trivial the movie I chose to see was awful I would have enjoyed the other one more
sometimes the difference between choices is monumental if I had gone to the doctor before
my disease became terminal my life would have been saved and the size benefit for making the right
choice or alternatively the cost of making the wrong choice is what establishes one of the
parameters one of the the maximum possible value of information so it would have been irrational
perhaps even downright stupid for me to spend a hundred dollars buying information about movie
choices before I went to the theater I'm sure that cost is many times what it would have been worth
to know but I should have paid far more than that to go see the doctor the size of making that wrong
decision is so extraordinary that it would have justified an immense amount of investment in
information the size of the wrong decision defines one of the parameters for the optimal degree of
ignorance now no matter what that maximum is it's also true that at some point as I say the
marginal value of information starts to decline when I know a lot a little more information
doesn't add that much but similarly it also means that when I'm acquiring information
some of it's easy to acquire but at some point as I try and get more and more information the
marginal cost of getting more is going to start to rise so in the marginal value of information
is coming down and the marginal cost of acquiring information is rising there's an optimal point
there's a sticking point there and you know where it is where they're equal to each other the equal
marginal principle has been satisfied and that's the optimal amount of information it also defines
what's the optimal level of ignorance to acquire information beyond that point would be irrational
so when you think about information and ignorance it can lead to some fairly depressing kind of
conclusions to contemplate I don't know if you remember the last lecture we talked about Anthony
Downs classic book an economic theory of democracy where he thought like an economist about electoral
democracy and the processes in it so one of the questions he asked is what's the optimal level of
ignorance what's the optimal investment in information for a rational voter now of course
when you go into the polling place and you cast your ballot you care about future policies but
you're not voting for future policies you're voting for an individual who may or may not
face a whole lot of different policy decisions at some time in the future that may or may not
have an impact upon you now to know how the future candidate might behave in all those cases
would be a huge investment in inventory we'd have to evaluate all possible policies we'd have to do
it for all possible candidates and that would be an extraordinary investment so that's the cost
what would be the benefit of being an informed voter well the benefit of being an informed voter
would be that you might reduce the probability of making the wrong policy choice versus the right
one and here's where it gets interesting the difference between a well cast vote and a poorly
cast vote multiplied by the probability that your one vote is going to determine the outcome of the
election because if it doesn't then there's no real benefit to being informed at all and that
means that the actual benefit to being an informed voter in pure rationality terms is almost always
just about zero so Downs ends up in his book by saying quote for a great many citizens in a democracy
rational behavior excludes any investment in political information now that's a depressing
conclusion it's one that i'm horrified to see before me but i'm hesitate but have to tell you
it's empirically verified for far more often than not the national election survey gets undertaken
each election year and it finds listen to this it finds that only 15 percent of americans can even
name just name one candidate for the house of representatives from their own district and only
four percent can name two candidates from their own district if americans don't even know the names
of the candidates it seems unlikely that they're going to know a whole lot about their policy
positions that may or may not in the future be taken it may be wrong to be an informed voter
but it is not sadly irrational and even more sadly it's certainly not uncommon in a later lecture
we're going to come back to this and look at political campaigns as a as a way to process
and exploit this rational ignorance but for now i want to consider some innovations some rational
ways that we have developed or might develop to try and overcome some of these costs of ignorance
and overcome our own vulnerability to some bad decisions remember right now we're operating
with this metaphor that the information we need is out there it's just too expensive to acquire
and there's a lot of it it's scattered all over the place many people have information
relative to what we need to know and collectively we know more than any of us knows individually
but of course it's the individual that has to make a rational decision so here's a problem
is there a way to aggregate and use that collective knowledge
as a man named james sir wiki who's written it just a fascinating little book that he calls
the wisdom of crowds and in that he looks at a whole number of ways in which processes have been
established or experiments have been undertaken to see what we can learn about collecting that
information and putting it into a useful form he cites some simple and very intriguing examples
experimenters and this is something i guess psychologists do will ask a large number of
people independently to guess the number of beans in a jar so they have a jar here and say how many
beans are in this and you know that the guesses are going to be all over the place some will be way
too high some will be way too low but the extraordinary thing is that if you take the average of those
guesses it's likely to be very close to the real number he concludes that if if you were to run
10 different jellybean counting experiments it's likely that each time one or two students would
do better than the group be closer to the real average but it wouldn't be the same students
every time over the 10 experiments the group's performance is almost certainly going to be the
best possible now sir wiki finds that interesting but he uses it to go to far more significant
events i want to tell you a story and this is one that i find absolutely astounding in 1968
an american submarine disappeared somewhere in the north Atlantic and the navy had had no
success in finding where it was so this young officer and i don't know where he got the idea
came up with a unique process so he gathered a whole panel of experts who understood about
submarines and understood the geography and the geology of the north Atlantic and he isolated them
he put them apart from each other he gave them all the data and asked them to independently estimate
what could have been the cause and what would be the location where the submarine had gone down
they couldn't discuss their theories with each other they couldn't influence one or
convince somebody else that their idea was wrong he wanted independent expert opinions
and then he used something that's called Bayesian analysis and he found a way to take all these
estimates and average them to the group's prediction of the location where the missing sub could be
found now not one of the individual estimates was very close to being on point but the extraordinary
thing is when they finally located that sub it was less than a quarter of a mile from the group's
average if we take lots of independent estimates and we find that they can yield information
better than any one participant can generate if we can find a way to mix them together
and get a good result nobody was able to steer others away from their analysis
errors wouldn't be compounded or created by the most aggressive arguer the results were impersonal
they were independent and more than that they were accurate that naval officer had created a
technology to overcome ignorance and the high cost of information that i think is much of what's
behind economist affinity for markets they think that markets do what that naval experiment did
they provide an inexpensive and accurate and valuable way to take lots and lots of information
and compress it into a clear and accessible form and in this case price economists think prices
are primarily a system of information they're condensed information and having access to prices
they significantly lower the cost and simultaneously create accurate incentives
remember it's in prices that smith's invisible hand finds the information to guide its action
and when the prices are wrong the action is wrong markets are a human invention that ranks right
up there with the wheel and the control of fire economists like markets so much they sometimes
create artificial markets to see if they can find a way to reveal the wisdom of the crowd
the university of iowa for several years has run something called the iowa electronic markets and
they use that to predict election outcomes to predict changes in federal reserve policy or
even something as trivial as the opening weekend box office take when a new movie opens and the
way it works is they create futures contracts that people buy with real money that covered
different potential outcomes and so if people think an event is likely to happen the price
the contract goes up and if they think it's less likely to happen the price of the contract is
likely to go down so whenever they have information they can compare it to the group's current
average that's found in the price of the contract and see whether or not they think they have
information that will change that so the value of the contract is really the collective bet
of all the market participants so here's the example here's how this works
say it's a presidential election and let's say that the republican candidate is elected
then holders of future contracts for the republican can redeem them for a dollar apiece
the democratic nominee contracts having not been elected have a redemption value of zero
so before the election there's this active market as people all over the country acquire
information anywhere from any source that makes them believe the chances of one candidate are
improving they see a profit opportunity by quickly trying to buy those contracts and that increased
action drives the price upward and of course if any information anywhere in the system leads people
to believe a candidate's chances of election are being reduced then they want to get out now before
the price falls and of course selling those contracts drives down the price price changes reflect
any change in information anywhere almost instantly new polls take days to conduct and process
but election markets they respond immediately people watch them and see what happens on an
hour by hour basis now it's important the investors they're not buying and selling contracts based on
their preference for candidates if you want to make money you have to reveal the truth you invest
in contracts for the candidate your information tells you is most likely to win it's not a
preference poll it's an information evaluation poll over several election cycles the Iowa
electronic markets have consistently predicted the actual vote with more accuracy than the major
polls it's sir wiki's wisdom of crowds in action it's a mechanism that produces vast quantities
useful information cheaply and excessively collectively we know more than we do individually
economists are awfully good at thinking about things like this we aren't always so good at
thinking about how about how other people are going to view our own thinking buoyed by the
successes of the iowa electronics experiment the pentagon a few years ago came up with a plan for
a terrorism futures market anyone anywhere in the world could buy futures contracts on specific
terrorist events and timeframes for example if the subway bombing in new york city occurs before
august 12th there's a payout if it doesn't the futures contract falls to zero the idea the pentagon
had was that if people anywhere in the crowd in the world had any information that led them to
believe that such an attack was likely the price of the futures contract would rise if they had
information that it was less likely it would fall and the pentagon planners thought they
could use changes in price in the terrorism futures market as a very low-cost intelligence
evaluation and prediction process technically they were probably right but talk about a public
relations disaster the angry speeches on the floor of congress the media columns that were
generated the talking heads on television all of them were horrified make a monetary profit off
a national disaster bet on a tragedy that felt like it was and probably even was morally wrong
there was also some fear that economists that economic thinking might be uh affecting terrorists
in the whole process people argued that if you bought futures contracts on events you were actually
planning then when you carried them out you'd end up with a financial windfall as a result of
being a terrorist the massive opposition to that market was overwhelming it was never implemented
being able to think like an economist is not always a highly appreciated trait
prices can give us a lot of important information about the wisdom of the crowd
but sometimes we need information that price alone isn't enough to carry we may want information
on specific product qualities and perhaps we may need that information a lot and there's some
other insights to be offered in there as well one of the things that i think all of us care about
is the crash worthiness of the automobiles we drive if my family is unnecessarily harmed because i
made the wrong choice of car i think that would be catastrophic now i could buy one of each model
car and then crash it into a wall i think that would be a lot of fun but it's probably prohibitively
expensive i is valuable information for me but it's not going to justify that kind of a cost
i can't produce that for myself so are there incentives for someone else to do that for me
and that's a complicated question information isn't like an ice cream cone if one person consumes it
it's not gone it's not unavailable to others it's not used up information used by one can be equally
valuable to other people so is that a good thing or a bad thing and the kind of smart alec answer
of course is yes it's a good thing and a bad thing it's good because there's a potential for us to
divide up that extraordinary cost produce it once and then share it and use it many many times over
and over and the shared cost for each of us will be less than the combined benefit would be
and we'll be able to afford doing that a Pareto improvement is possible now the unfortunate part
of that is that collecting that information is kind of like cleaning up the atmosphere
everybody wants the information but nobody really wants to have to pay for it we all want to ride
for free if i can wait and get enough others to chip in and pay for the crash test results
i get them for nothing i'm better off if i don't pay and i also know that if many others do not
step up then even if i contribute a huge amount the tests won't get done so i have to find some
other way to find out this information and of course voluntary cooperation among 250 million
americans is no more likely to work here than it did in solving global climate change so
could an entrepreneur somebody get rich by conducting these tests and then selling the
results over and over again maybe but they're real obstacles because once those first few
sales are made that reusable information is impossible to control it's like air and a balloon
one leak it's out into the atmosphere it's free for all and the profit potential has disappeared
yet information on crash worthiness does get generated it's made available to the public
free of charge who has an incentive to do that well actually there are two sets of crash test data
that get generated first is produced by the national highway traffic safety administration
and we know how they solve the free rider problem they don't let us ride for free we have to pay
those costs and compulsory taxes but more interestingly there's a second group and that's
the insurance institute for highway safety and i'm going to tell you that they gain they are
benefited by getting all that expensive information and then giving it away for free think like an
economist their profits get reduced when people drive less crash worthy cars safer cars mean lower
claims they mean higher profits the more information and the better the information that's in consumers
hands the higher the insurance company's profits so the more consumers who have that information
the more the profits will be increased and how do you get the widest distribution possible on
information you make it free there's one final technological innovation i want to talk about
briefly a way we can come up with to lower the cost of acquiring information to increase the
amount of optimal information and that's we've already developed a lot of transactions that
take place between experts people will acquire very specialized knowledge and then we enter into
what's called a principal agent relationship we're going to pay somebody more knowledgeable than
ourselves to make important decisions for us and hopefully they'll have our interests foremost
obvious case of this is diagnostic physicians it's only when i'm finding myself in dire need
of medical knowledge does it become important enough to me to figure out what's going wrong
but a wrong diagnosis at that time a wrong decision can be very costly i don't know ahead of time
which knowledge i'll need to treat what disease and what condition when you begin having chest
pains and shortness of breath it's too late to start applying to medical school instead we turn
to experts who are going to do this for us to become a medical doctor is an extremely expensive
proposition i know this because i married my wife a month before she started medical school
and i have two children have gone through medical school it's an extremely expensive proposition
it probably is an investment of a million dollars or more when you count in the opportunity costs of
time and it's really only worth it to make that investment because the information that doctors
have isn't like crash test data no one can sell it over and over and over again they have to have
individually tailored information to give to the patient that matches their immediate need
the extraordinary costs of capturing that tremendous investment are possible only because
the diagnosis that you gave to the last patient is of absolutely no value to me i'm going to have
to buy my own i want the doctor to evaluate my ekg not the last patient and i can't resell my ekg
tracing to someone else the next patient's going to have to buy her own personal diagnosis
so where are we now complete ignorance is certainly not bliss it leads to bad decisions
often with harsh consequences on the other hand complete omniscience is neither humanly possible
nor affordable information is limited information is costly the human dilemma then is to navigate
rationally between these two extremes balancing the cost of making wrong decisions with the
costs of acquiring more information and what in the final analysis does that mean for you
it means that the amount of investment and information you make rationally is going to depend
on the size of the cost if you make a wrong decision it means that when information is
widely scattered and diffusely held you can look for processes like markets that are going to
aggregate and compress the information to see if it will reveal the wisdom of a crowd
but before placing too much faith in the wisdom of a crowd you want to ask yourself
is this a situation where there are multiple people making truly independent evaluations
or is this a structure where each is just repeating what others have said they must be independent
evaluations is each person's interest best served by revealing their best estimate
would it be misserved by a systematic distortion in the iowa electronic markets
when people had information they thought changed the likelihood of an outcome
they could only profit from that if they revealed that information in their market behavior
and finally expert advice reduces the costs of overcoming coming ignorance
but only if it's truly in the expert's best interest to disseminate complete and unbiased
information is it in the insurance industry's best interest to tell you the truth about the
crashworthiness of cars probably it is is it in the doctor's best interest to tell you the truth
about your diagnosis probably it is is it the used car salesman's best interest to tell you the
truth about the cars on his lot probably not as always economic thinking involves a consideration
of incentives yours and everyone else's that's true whether we're talking about actions and it's
true when we're talking about information now this is a lot of information about the economics of
information but there's more in the next lecture we're going to ask a slightly different question
what's the rational thing to do when what we need to know is unknowable when chance and risk
are going to lead to a future that it is impossible to predict with certainty
there are unavoidable elements of that and it's an important choice that's the topic we'll take up next time
