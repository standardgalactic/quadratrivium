Checking Thinking Like an Economist/01. The Economist's Tool Kit—6 Principles.txt
1. **People respond to incentives**: Every individual makes decisions based on what they are motivated or rewarded to do, whether it's financial compensation, social recognition, or any other form of motivation.

2. **The law of diminishing returns**: As more resources are applied to a project or activity, the rate of increase in output will gradually decrease until eventually, it becomes unprofitable or impractical.

3. **Trade-offs and opportunity costs**: Since resources are limited and there's scarcity, every choice involves giving up something else of value. The best alternative that is forgone is known as the opportunity cost.

4. **Interconnectedness**: Every action has far-reaching effects because everything in an economy is interrelated. A change in one area can have unforeseen consequences elsewhere.

5. **Unintended consequences**: Even well-intentioned actions can lead to outcomes that were not anticipated, often due to the complex nature of interactions within a system.

6. **No one is truly in control**: Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of economic systems, it's impossible for any single entity or individual to predict or fully control all outcomes.

In conclusion, thinking like an economist means applying these principles to understand how incentives shape human behavior, recognizing the trade-offs inherent in decision-making, understanding the complex interactions within an economy, and being aware that both intended and unintended consequences can arise from any economic action or policy. These principles provide a foundation for analyzing economic phenomena across various contexts.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/02. The Economist's Tool Kit—3 Core Concepts.txt
1. Incentives: Understanding incentives is crucial in economics. It's not just about what individuals want, but also how they behave when faced with rewards or penalties for certain actions. The Soviet Union's approach to motivate athletes by offering bonuses for breaking world records is an example of this. Athletes like Sergei Bubka responded rationally, often setting new records by the smallest margin possible to ensure they could break the record again and collect the bonus multiple times.

2. Individual vs. Social Efficiency: The rational response to incentives may not always align with what is socially efficient. Charles Dickens' style of writing was influenced by his payment structure, which was different from Ernest Hemingway's. This illustrates that personal and social efficiency can diverge.

3. Applications of Economic Thinking: The principles discussed today are not limited to professional athletes or authors; they apply to anyone in any situation where incentives matter, including compensation for employees, financial advisors, and service providers like snow plowers.

4. Next Steps: In the next session, we will explore the concept of economic efficiency in more detail. We will consider how individual rational responses can lead to outcomes that are not optimal for society as a whole, and how economists think about achieving social efficiency through market mechanisms or government intervention. The focus will be on understanding the balance between individual incentives and collective welfare.

1. **Prisoner's Dilemma**: This is a situation where two individuals might both be better off if they cooperate, but each has an incentive to act against their mutual interest because it's in their individual best interest to do so, especially when they cannot communicate or negotiate effectively.

2. **Rational Choices and Inefficient Outcomes**: In a prisoner's dilemma, individuals make rational choices that lead to an inefficient outcome for both parties involved. This can be seen in various contexts, such as the wrestling example where both wrestlers rationally choose to cut weight, potentially harming themselves, because not doing so could leave them at a disadvantage against an opponent who also cuts weight.

3. **External Regulation**: In some cases, like with wrestlers, external authorities can intervene to change the rules or provide incentives that lead to more efficient outcomes. For example, sports organizations implemented weight classes and physical exams to prevent unsafe weight cutting.

4. **Real-World Examples**: The prisoner's dilemma is not limited to hypothetical scenarios; it occurs in real life, as seen in the canned soup advertising war between two companies. Both companies rationally continued their negative campaigns against each other, ultimately leading to a decline in sales for both.

5. **Communication and Negotiation**: Effective communication and negotiation are key to resolving prisoner's dilemmas. If the canned soup companies could have communicated and agreed not to engage in negative advertising, they would have been better off.

6. **Economic Solutions**: In the next lecture, we will explore how economic thinking has provided solutions for prisoner's dilemma situations, particularly in the context of environmental issues. The concept of creating enforceable agreements or institutions can help coordinate actions that are beneficial for all parties involved.

7. **Looking Ahead**: The upcoming lecture will apply these concepts to an environmental problem, demonstrating how economic analysis and policy design have attempted to solve real-world prisoner's dilemmas.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/04. Incentives and Optimal Choice.txt
1. **Real-world Example**: The captain of a fishing boat has crab that is no longer valuable because the cannery has fulfilled its order. The captain keeps the crabs on ice waiting for the agreed payment of $2 per pound, which results in a significant loss since the crabs die and the market value diminishes.

2. **Legal Obligation to Mitigate Damages**: While the captain's stance might seem morally sound, under the law, he has a duty to mitigate damages. This means he should have sold the crabs at a lower price rather than letting them spoil, which would have minimized his losses.

3. **Economic Efficiency and Law**: The legal system often relies on principles of economic efficiency, even if it doesn't explicitly state so. Judges tend to decide cases by considering how their decisions will affect future behavior and incentives.

4. **Rights and Incentives**: The rights and rules established can shape the decisions and behaviors of individuals. They can either lead to outcomes that are harmful (like overfishing) or beneficial (like negotiated settlements for shared resources).

5. **Economic Thinking**: When faced with rules and rights, it's important to consider how they create incentives. Economists analyze whether these incentives are guiding individuals toward optimal decisions or if they need to be adjusted to improve outcomes.

6. **Future Topics**: The next lectures will address situations where prices do not accurately reflect all costs, and where individuals must make decisions under incomplete or distorted information and in the face of unavoidable risks. The tools developed earlier will be applied to these challenging scenarios.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/05. False Incentives, Real Harm.txt
1. **Free Rider Problem**: The tendency for individuals to benefit from a common resource or public good without contributing to its production or maintenance. In the context of climate change, this means countries and companies may reap the benefits of a stable climate without paying the costs of maintaining it.

2. **Global Warming as a Public Good**: Climate change is a classic example of a global commons problem where the benefits and costs are not directly linked to who uses or pollutes the atmosphere. This makes it difficult to assign responsibility and collect payment for its maintenance.

3. **Individual and Collective Rationality**: While it may be rational for an individual to free ride, it is collectively irrational because if everyone does it, the public good (in this case, a stable climate) is not maintained, leading to a suboptimal outcome for all.

4. **Political Responsiveness**: Politicians are responsive to the interests and concerns of their constituents. They are unlikely to push for policies that require their voters to bear significant costs without similar commitments from other countries.

5. **Developing Nations' Arguments**: Developing nations like China and India argue that developed nations, which have historically contributed significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, should take the lead in reducing emissions. They contend it is unfair to ask developing nations to shoulder a significant burden for an issue they did not create.

6. **Economic Solutions**: Economists suggest various mechanisms to address the free rider problem, such as emission permits that could be auctioned off, thereby placing a cost on emissions and potentially rewarding those who have already reduced their carbon footprint.

7. **Information and Rational Decision Making**: The ability to make informed decisions is crucial for addressing issues like climate change. Without accurate information, individuals and policymakers may make irrational choices that exacerbate the problem.

8. **Next Steps in Understanding Economics**: In the following lectures, we will delve deeper into economics, particularly the economics of information, to understand how better information can lead to more rational decision-making and how this relates to solving public good problems like climate change.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/06. The Economics of Ignorance.txt
1. **Human Decision-Making and Information Costs**: Humans often make decisions based on incomplete information due to the high costs associated with acquiring all relevant data. The challenge is to balance the cost of making a wrong decision against the cost of obtaining more information.

2. **Information Acquisition**: Information is typically expensive because it's often unique to an individual's needs (e.g., a doctor's diagnosis for a patient). This means it can't be resold, and the costs of capturing it are high.

3. **Markets as Information Aggregators**: Markets can help by aggregating and compressing information from many sources to provide a collective estimate of likelihood or value. However, this works well only if there are truly independent evaluations and if participants have no incentive to misrepresent their information.

4. **Expert Advice**: Relying on experts to overcome ignorance can reduce the costs of information acquisition. However, this relies on the assumption that experts will act in your best interest and provide complete and unbiased information.

5. **Incentives Matter**: The behavior of individuals and entities providing information is influenced by their incentives. For example, Iowa electronic markets encouraged participants to reveal their best estimates by allowing them to profit from accurate predictions about future events.

6. **Medical Diagnosis as an Example**: The cost of medical education makes it a highly specialized knowledge domain where the information provided by a physician is unique and personalized to the patient's condition, rather than being resellable or reused.

7. **Key Takeaways**: The rational approach to decision-making under conditions of uncertainty involves considering the costs of acquiring information, the reliability of markets as information aggregators, and the trustworthiness of expert advice, all of which are heavily influenced by incentives.

In the next lecture, the discussion will shift to address decisions when the future is truly unpredictable and incorporates chance and risk, exploring how to make rational choices in such uncertain environments.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/07. Playing the Odds—Reason in a Risky World.txt
1. **Information Cascades**: These occur when individuals observe others making choices and follow those choices without knowing the underlying reasons. This can lead to collective irrationality, as seen with the case of the pesticide Allar where public fear led to its removal from the market despite it being safe when used correctly.

2. **Financial Bubbles**: Similar to information cascades, financial bubbles occur when investors buy an asset, driving up prices, which then causes others to invest as well, believing the price will continue to rise. Eventually, a critical mass of sellers can trigger a market crash, as seen with the Dutch tulip mania, 1987 stock market crash, dot-com bubble, and the housing crisis of 2008.

3. **Rational Ignorance**: Individuals often lack sufficient information to make decisions, leading them to rely on the observed behavior of others. This can result in a misallocation of resources when many individuals act based on incorrect beliefs or incomplete information.

4. **Unavoidable Risk**: Decisions in life involve probabilistic risks that are inherently unpredictable. People must estimate both the probability of different outcomes and their value to make rational decisions using the concept of expected value.

5. **Subjective Probabilities**: Real-world decisions often depend on subjective probabilities that can be distorted by experts with conflicting interests or by social cascades leading to collective irrationality.

6. **Knowledge as Power**: Information is a valuable asset, and individuals control it based on their incentives. Those who possess crucial information can influence outcomes and exert power over others who lack that information. This dynamic will be further explored in the next lecture on asymmetric information.

In summary, understanding the principles of decision-making under uncertainty, the influence of information cascades, and the effects of rational ignorance are crucial for making informed decisions in the face of probabilistic risks. The power of knowledge can significantly impact these decisions, and recognizing the incentives that drive information control is key to navigating such situations.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/08. The Economics of Information.txt
1. **Complex Financial Products**: The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was partly due to the complexity of financial products like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which made it difficult for investors to understand the risks they were taking.

2. **Information Asymmetry**: The crisis highlighted the issue of information asymmetry, where one party has significantly more or better information than the other. In the case of MBS and CDOs, the originators, sponsors, and sellers had a better understanding of the risks involved than the ultimate investors.

3. **Rational Ignorance**: Due to the complexity of these financial products, investors rationally chose not to understand all the details, which led to overconfidence in the stability of the market.

4. **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: These were insurance policies that promised to pay out if the MBS and CDOs failed. Companies like AIG sold these without adequately setting aside reserves to cover potential losses.

5. **The Role of Real Estate**: The value of real estate was assumed to be a safe hostage that would guarantee repayment, but as housing prices fell, this assumption collapsed.

6. **Risk Underestimation**: The market underestimated the risk of homeowners defaulting on their mortgages, leading to an upside-down situation where people owed more than their homes were worth, prompting them to walk away from their obligations.

7. **Market Freeze**: The uncertainty and lack of trust led to a freeze in credit markets, which in turn caused businesses to halt investment and spending, exacerbating the economic downturn.

8. **Economic Lessons**: The crisis underscores the importance of understanding information asymmetry, rational ignorance, and risk in economic decision-making. It also highlights the need for skepticism when faced with financial products that promise high returns with low risk.

9. **Future Discussions**: In the next lecture, we will explore how time adds another layer of complexity to these issues, particularly in the context of Einstein's theory of relativity and its implications for economic decision-making.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/09. A Matter of Time—Predicting Future Values.txt
1. **Youth and Retirement Planning**: The lecture emphasizes the importance of starting to plan for retirement in your youth rather than in your fifties. It's a common realization that planning for retirement should have begun much earlier, but it's never too late to understand the principles of economic decision-making to improve one's financial future.

2. **Economist's Vocabulary**: The lecture introduces key economic concepts such as nominal vs. real measures of wealth, the impact of inflation on purchasing power, and how changes over time affect the value of money. It also explains the difference between present and future values in relation to interest rates.

3. **The Felicity Foresight Story**: This is a hypothetical scenario where a woman named Felicity is given $1 with perfect information about future investments, which she moves into the best-performing asset class each year for 100 years. The outcome illustrates the power of compounding and high returns but also serves as an example to distinguish between nominal amounts and real purchasing power over time.

4. **Key Takeaways**:
   - Distinguish between nominal dollars (the dollar amount without considering inflation) and real dollars (the dollar amount adjusted for inflation, which affects purchasing power).
   - Understand how future inflation can erode the value of money over time, and use tools like the consumer price index (CPI) to measure changes in purchasing power.
   - Recognize that moving an event into the future generally reduces its equivalent present value due to the time value of money and the potential for inflation.

5. **Future Lecture**: The next lecture will apply the economic thinking skills learned to real-world decisions, using examples that involve shopping, where the application of these principles can be surprisingly complex and engaging.

In summary, the lecture encourages listeners to understand the economic principles that affect financial decisions, particularly in planning for retirement, and to practice applying these concepts in everyday scenarios. The story of Felicity Foresight serves as a compelling illustration of the power of compounding and the importance of considering both nominal and real values when making economic decisions.

1. **Extended Warranty Decision**: The decision to buy an extended warranty on a television is a practical example that encapsulates various economic concepts, such as expected value, risk aversion, information asymmetry, and the role of competition. It serves as a bridge to understanding behavioral economics.

2. **Risk Aversion**: Not everyone feels the same about risk. Some people (risk seekers) enjoy taking risks for the excitement it brings, while others (risk averse individuals) dislike risk and would prefer to avoid it even if it means paying more for certainty.

3. **Expected Value**: The expected value of a decision is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome occurring by its monetary value and summing these products. For risk-averse individuals, the expected value must be significantly higher than the cost of protection to compensate for their discomfort with risk.

4. **Cost of Risk**: The cost of bearing risk itself is a real expense for risk-averse individuals, and this cost should be considered when making decisions. Economically rational individuals will take into account not only the financial implications but also the psychological ones.

5. **Risk Neutral Individuals**: There are some people who do not have a strong preference for either risk or certainty and are therefore indifferent between options with equal expected values.

6. **Peace of Mind**: The price of peace of mind should be as low as possible, reflecting the idea that cheap protection is preferable to expensive protection. Buying too much protection can lead to unnecessary expenses.

7. **Behavioral Economics**: The discussion on extended warranties sets the stage for understanding how emotions and perceptions affect decision-making, which is the focus of behavioral economics. This field explores why people often make choices that do not align with traditional economic theory's rational actor model.

8. **Economic Thinking**: Economic thinking provides a framework for making rational decisions even when complete information is not available. It emphasizes asking the right questions and considering all relevant factors, such as expected value, risk attitudes, information asymmetry, competitive dynamics, and the timing of costs and benefits.

9. **Conclusions**: The lecture highlights that while economic models can provide precise answers in ideal conditions, they often serve as a guide to making informed decisions in real-world scenarios where complete data is not available. Economic thinking helps individuals navigate complex situations by considering the essential elements and potential biases in their decision-making processes.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/11. Behavioral Economics—What Are We Thinking.txt
1. **Status Quo Bias**: We often stick with the default option or the current state of things even when it might not be the best choice. This can lead to suboptimal decisions and even financial losses, as seen in studies like the one conducted by TIA-CREF among college professors.

2. **Anchor Points**: Our decisions are influenced by the first piece of information we encounter (the anchor), which can be used strategically by marketers or negotiators. For example, a high initial price can make a subsequent lower price seem more attractive.

3. **Diminishing Sensitivity**: We react less to changes in gains and losses as they become larger. This can lead to underestimating the value of additional gains and overestimating the pain of additional losses, affecting our financial decisions.

4. **Loss Aversion**: Losses loom larger than gains in our minds. This can cause us to hold onto losing investments for too long or to avoid taking risks that could lead to potential gains.

5. **Inertia**: Our tendency to do nothing and keep the current pace or state of affairs, which can result in sticking with bad decisions or missing out on better options due to inaction.

6. **Irrational Behavior**: Many of our decision-making processes are influenced by psychological factors rather than rational economic principles. This includes overpaying for items because of rebates we don't claim, or being swayed by the presentation of options.

7. **Nudges**: A concept developed by economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, which refers to subtle changes in the way choices are presented that can guide people towards making better decisions for themselves without restricting their freedom of choice.

8. **Personal Application of Economic Concepts**: To counteract irrational biases like status quo bias or loss aversion, we can create our own "nudges" by setting up our environment to encourage more rational decision-making. For example, we can commit to periodic financial reviews or establish incentives for ourselves to follow through on important but neglected tasks.

In the next and final lecture, we will explore additional nudges and apply our new economic knowledge to both large policy issues and small personal decisions to see how well we have understood the principles of economics.

Checking Thinking Like an Economist/12. Acting like an Economist.txt
1. **Mexico City's Odd-Even License Plate System Failure**: The system was intended to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality by restricting cars based on their license plate numerals, but it failed to improve air quality due to the influx of additional, older vehicles and the use of secondary cars. This illustrates the difference between legal dictation of behavior and economic inducement.

2. **Economic Solutions for Traffic Congestion**: Economists recommend changing incentives rather than imposing strict rules. They suggest using congestion pricing as a tool to manage traffic flow effectively.

3. **London's Congestion Charge**: In 2003, London implemented a congestion charge system where drivers must pay a daily fee to enter the core city area. This has successfully reduced traffic congestion. However, a more efficient approach would involve dynamic pricing that varies according to real-time traffic conditions.

4. **Dynamic Pricing for Congestion**: The ideal economic solution would involve a GPS-like system that displays variable congestion charges in real time, allowing drivers to make informed decisions about their travel plans based on the cost of a trip at that moment.

5. **Final Thoughts and Takeaways**: The course has aimed to teach you how to think like an economist by providing a framework for analyzing economic decisions. Thinking like an economist is not about having predefined answers but about approaching problems with economic reasoning, which can lead to more rational decision-making in personal, business, and policy contexts.

6. **Final Exam**: The true test of your ability to think like an economist comes from applying these concepts to real-life decisions you will face outside the classroom. The course encourages you to use economic reasoning as a tool for better decision-making.
