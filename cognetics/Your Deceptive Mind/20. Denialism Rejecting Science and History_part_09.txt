be true.
That's often, in fact, the motivation behind denying a specific science.
It's because the deniers have an alternative that they are really promoting.
This, however, is nothing more than an argument from ignorance combined with the false dichotomy
logical fallacy.
What they rarely do is provide positive evidence that supports their alternative claim.
If they could do that, that's what they would be doing.
But since they don't have the evidence to support their claim, they must reside themselves
to attacking the accepted scientific alternative.
And when all else fails, simply claim that there's a conspiracy.
In this way, denialism and conspiracy thinking are related.
This is yet another way in which there is a connection between the two.
The ultimate fallback position for the denier is the conspiracy theory.
When the evidence does not support their position, they will simply claim that the scientific
evidence itself is all a fraud, a grand conspiracy, usually of their ideological opponents.
This allows them to dismiss all that pesky evidence, all the published studies that prove
that the science they do not want to acknowledge.
In the end, denial is just another form of pseudoscientific thinking.
Deniers violate multiple principles of critical thinking, logic, and scientific methodology
because of their a priori beliefs.
By studying the tactics of deniers, we also learn to recognize the more subtle versions
that we engage in every day.
Generally, we resist changing our beliefs that psychological studies show, that we marshal
a lot of cognitive energy in order to maintain what we already believe and what we want to
believe.
A little bit of motivated denial can save us from a lot of cognitive dissonance, unless
we deliberately engage our learned critical thinking skills.
