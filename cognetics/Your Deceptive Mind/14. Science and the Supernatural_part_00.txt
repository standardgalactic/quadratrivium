Are ghosts real?
Do miracles sometimes happen?
Can science prove the existence of God?
Can science even address these types of questions?
In the last lecture, I discussed the philosophy of science and mentioned the fact that science
is dependent upon a philosophical position known as methodological naturalism, which
holds that material effects must have material causes.
This is not an arbitrary choice, as some may claim.
The methods of science simply do not work without this underlying philosophical basis.
This is because non-material causes cannot be falsified, they cannot be proven to be
untrue.
They therefore fail to meet unnecessary criterion for science.
The reason they can't be falsified is that they are not constrained in any way.
There is no limits to what they can potentially do because they are not, by definition, following
the laws of nature, the laws of material cause and effect.
Now we are not concerned about the ability to falsify things because we are trying to
be negative.
That is simply how critical thinking and science works.
That is how we separate out what is likely to be true from what is likely not to be true
by looking for observations, experimental or otherwise, that can show that an idea is
wrong, it cannot be true.
And when an idea, theory, survives multiple repeated attempts at showing that it can't
be true, then scientists begin to take that theory seriously and consider that it's a
reasonable model for how the natural world works.
Let's take ghosts, for example, whatever you think a ghost might be.
How are their characteristics constrained?
How could we falsify, for example, the hypothesis that ghosts are responsible for any particular
observed phenomenon?
Let's take a photograph, for example.
Many people present photographs of orbs or splotches of light on film as evidence for
a ghost.
That splotch of light, that's a ghost.
Well, how could we test that hypothesis?
