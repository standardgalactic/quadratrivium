After the fact, these coincidences seem amazing, like there must be some explanation there,
but this is all post hoc analysis. This is looking for connections and then assigning some meaning
to those connections after the fact. There is also a fallacy in exaggerated precision.
An answer may be technically correct, but if it has more precision than is warranted in the inputs,
then that results in what we call exaggerated precision. Here is an example from a website
called Bad Physics. This website will comb through newspaper articles, journalistic reports,
looking for instances of enumeracy. Here is one example. A recipe was given with ingredients
such as one teaspoon of sugar or one cup of minced onion, etc. Those kind of measurements.
It then says at the end that this recipe will make from four to six servings and then it gives a
per serving calorie count of 271 calories with 28.73 grams of protein, 5.38 grams of fat,
25.90 grams of carbohydrates and 591 milligrams of sodium.
Those are incredibly precise figures, two figures beyond the decimal point, 28.73 grams of protein
when it makes between four and six servings. It doesn't even give you precision in terms of the
number of servings. The inputs were things like a teaspoon, which is a remarkably imprecise measurement.
In conclusion, throughout this course, we discuss human cognitive strengths and weaknesses.
Statistics and probability is a general area of pretty extreme weaknesses for most people.
Like many things, there's a lot of variation. Some people do have a better mathematical sense
than others, but for an average person, the fact is we just have a terrible sense of numbers and
statistics. However, it's easy to compensate for this with the learned skills, specifically mathematics.
