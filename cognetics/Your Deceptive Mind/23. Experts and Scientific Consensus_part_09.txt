from the global warming consensus.
In the end, Mueller changed his mind and accepted the fact that the planet is warming.
This is an excellent example of how science should work.
This agreement was resolved by further analysis, by the data.
In the end, the data is king.
That is what held sway over Mueller's opinion.
And he should be congratulated on doing exactly what he did, a detailed analysis replicating
prior studies and ultimately building on the consensus.
And in the end, the consensus on global warming was strengthened by his work.
Although it doesn't seem likely that this will end the political controversy that surrounds
the many types of claims that are being made about global climate change.
The consensus of scientific opinion is an important factor to consider when evaluating
any claim.
A robust consensus should be built on evidence hammered out in the research and at meetings.
It is more reliable than the opinions of any individual.
But it is no guarantee by itself of being absolutely correct.
As the case with Mueller showed that the data always must hold sway.
And as new information comes in, new ways of analyzing data and new ways of interpreting
the data, new ideas come to the forefront, the consensus will slowly change and shift.
But there are some scientific questions that have been around for so many years for which
there is such a mountain of evidence that the current consensus of opinion is not likely
to change ever.
I don't think it's ever going to be discovered that DNA, for example, is not the molecule
of inheritance.
So while it is reasonable to respect a hard one consensus of scientific opinion, there
is also a role for dissenting opinions.
As with science in general, there is never any guarantee of being absolutely correct.
The goal is simply to maximize the probability of being correct while remaining open to new
evidence, new analyses, and new ideas.
