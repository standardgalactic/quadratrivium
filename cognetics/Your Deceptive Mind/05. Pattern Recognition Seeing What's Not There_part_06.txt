There's going to be some patterns that emerge.
In order to know that that pattern is real,
they would have to then verify it
with a completely independent set of data.
Of course, when that's done,
it turns out that there is no consistent pattern
with astrological signs.
Astrology is based almost entirely
on false pattern recognition and data mining.
Let me move on to another concept
which is related to this.
That's also very important to understand
in order to know how our brains work
and how they can lead us astray.
Psychologists now recognize a phenomenon
called hyperactive agency detection.
I spoke in a previous lecture
about the concept of agency,
that something is acting on its own will.
There is a will behind what is occurring,
what something is doing.
We tend to feel that something has agency
when it acts as if it has agency.
When we see an animated robot,
we emotionally react to that robot
as if it were alive,
even though we know it's a thing,
because it's acting like something that has will.
We tend to assume agency
even when randomness is sufficient.
That's why it's hyperactive.
We tend to err way on the side
of feeling as if there's agency
even when there isn't.
One might take an evolutionary perspective
to try to explain why it is.
Why is it that we err so much on the side
of assuming agency even when there probably isn't?
Evolutionary explanations are difficult
because it's very difficult to test them,
but putting aside the question
of whether evolutionary psychology
has legitimacy as a science,
it is interesting that it's easy to come up
with adaptive explanations for why
we may have this hyperactive agency detection.
For example, if we are on the plains of Africa
and we hear a rustling in the bushes,
if we assume it's the wind,
then we may be at risk for getting eaten by a tiger.
If we assume it's a tiger and we run away,
