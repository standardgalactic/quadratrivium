 Don Howard is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame and Director of its Graduate Program in History and Philosophy of Science. He earned his B.S.C. in Physical Science from Michigan State University's Honors College and Lyman Briggs College, an M.A. and then a Ph.D. in Philosophy with a specialization in the Philosophy of Science from Boston University. Prior to joining Notre Dame, he served as chair for the Department of Philosophy at the University of Kentucky for four years.

Professor Howard has contributed significantly to scholarly work on Einstein and related topics, serving as an assistant editor and a contributing editor for the collected papers of Albert Einstein and co-founding the Einstein Study Series. He was named a Fellow in Columbia University's Society of Fellows in the Humanities in 1980 and awarded a University Research Professorship by the University of Kentucky in 1992.

In addition to his academic roles, Professor Howard is a Fellow of the Center for Einstein Studies at Boston University, a Riley Fellow in Notre Dame's Riley Center for Science, Technology and Values, and a Faculty Fellow in Notre Dame's Nanovik Institute for European Studies. He has also been honored as a Fellow of the American Physical Society.

For these lectures, Professor Howard has prepared a course guidebook that includes detailed outlines for each lecture, a timeline, a glossary, biographical notes, and a bibliography. It's recommended to follow along with or review these outlines before or after each lecture to get the most out of the course.

 The year Albert Einstein spent in Aarau Cantonal School was a period of significant growth for him as he prepared to enter university. It was during this time that he developed his famous thought experiment involving a light wave and a moving observer, which played a crucial role in the development of his theory of relativity. This thought experiment demonstrated that it was problematic for an observer or other material system to move at the speed of light according to classical electrodynamics.

Einstein's time in Aarau also marked a turning point in his relationship with Germany, as he sought and won release from German citizenship due to his growing hatred of German militarism. His graduation from the school showed that he was academically gifted, but his grades were affected by an inverted grading scale, leading to the misconception that he had failed several subjects, including mathematics.

In terms of Einstein's character and personality, his time at Aarau revealed a combination of adolescent rebellion and a deeper, more visceral rejection of conformity, particularly with regards to German militarism. This sense of social conscience would become increasingly prominent in Einstein's later life as he championed progressive causes.

In summary, Einstein's year at Aarau Cantonal School marked significant academic growth and the transformation of a precocious, but perhaps insecure adolescent into a confident young man. It was during this time that Einstein developed his famous thought experiment involving a light wave and a moving observer, which played a crucial role in the development of relativity.
