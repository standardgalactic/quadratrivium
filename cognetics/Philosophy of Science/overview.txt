1. **The Role of Hypotheses in Science**: We acknowledge that any claim made by scientists, including the claim that one is listening to another person, is a hypothesis subject to potential falsification. This does not mean that such claims are without merit; rather, it underscores the provisional nature of scientific knowledge and its reliance on empirical evidence.

2. **Thomas Kuhn's View**: Thomas Kuhn challenges the positivist view by suggesting that science is not as rational or cumulative as previously thought. He argues that science progresses through "paradigm shifts" and that what we consider scientific knowledge is often influenced by the prevailing paradigms of the time.

3. **Critiques of Kuhn**: Some critics argue that if science is not rationally guided, it could be nothing more than a form of madness. Others believe that Kuhn did not sufficiently challenge science's claim to be a superior way of understanding the world.

4. **The Ambition of Science for Explanation**: Science aims to explain phenomena by going beyond or behind them, invoking unobserved entities and laws. The challenge is to reconcile this ambition with the need to base scientific claims on observable evidence.

5. **Scientific Realism**: Scientific realists argue that science can and does theorize about unobservable entities, such as quarks, in the same way it does about observable ones like tables. This view relaxes some of the constraints that positivism imposed on science's connection to experience.

6. **Philosophy and Science**: With scientific realism, the distinction between philosophy and empirical science becomes less sharp. Philosophers and scientists may work together, with philosophy addressing broader questions while science tackles specific issues.

7. **The Probabilistic Revolution**: Recent developments in the philosophy of science have emphasized the probabilistic nature of scientific knowledge, which could reframe our understanding of objectivity and justification.

8. **Examples from Particular Sciences**: The course will apply general principles to specific sciences—physics, biology, and psychology—to explore philosophical issues that arise within these fields.

9. **Conceptual Geography**: By examining smaller puzzles, the course aims to trace back to the broader questions about the nature of science, objectivity, truth, and the relationship between science and philosophy.

10. **Next Steps**: The next session will focus on formulating a clear and rigorous statement of what is distinctive about scientific knowledge, taking into account the insights from both positivism and realism, as well as the historical and philosophical contexts that shape scientific inquiry.

1. **Problem with Falsifiability in Practice**: Karl Popper's criterion of falsifiability for demarcating science from non-science faces challenges when applied to real-world scientific practice. For instance, a run of 56s from a die doesn't necessarily mean the die is biased, as unlikely events do occur. Similarly, genetic drift can explain the persistence of a particular gene without every individual in the population expressing it, even though each individual's expression is highly improbable.

2. **Probability Statements and Scientific Consensus**: Popper's criterion doesn't satisfactorily address how scientists determine the threshold at which a theory is falsified based on probability statements. The basis for scientific consensus isn't always clear, raising questions about the logical versus the practical aspects of what makes a theory scientific.

3. **Scientific Theory Handling vs. Scientific Theory Itself**: Popper sometimes presents falsifiability as an intrinsic property of scientific theories, but it may be more about how practitioners handle those theories. This raises questions about whether a theory is scientific based on its content or its use within the scientific community.

4. **Scientists' Reluctance to Abandon Theories**: Popper's view seems to imply that scientists should readily abandon their theories when they conflict with observations. However, historical examples like the discovery of Neptune show that scientists often modify theories rather than abandon them, suggesting that confirmation and explanatory scope are valuable even within a Popperian framework.

5. **The Role of Confirmation and Explanatory Scope**: Popper's view doesn't fully account for the fact that having a theory that fits with a lot of data is indeed a virtue in science. The wide applicability and explanatory power of Newton's physics, for example, were significant strengths, not weaknesses.

6. **Distinguishing Genuine Science from Pseudoscience**: Despite the challenges, Popper's idea that scientific theories should be falsifiable does play a role in distinguishing genuine science from pseudoscience. However, it's not clear that scientists always or should always adhere to this principle in their practice.

In summary, while Popper's criterion of falsifiability is influential in the philosophy of science, its application in real scientific contexts is complex and nuanced. The criterion doesn't fully capture the practical considerations that scientists actually use when deciding how to treat a theory. The next lecture will delve deeper into these issues and explore alternative views on what constitutes good scientific practice.

1. The demarcation problem, which seeks to distinguish between science and pseudoscience, has proven to be a challenging and perhaps insoluble issue in the philosophy of science. Philosophers often argue that the task is hopeless when approached as a binary classification problem.

2. Intelligent design creationism presents a complex case for demarcation criteria because it can appear untestable or a poor scientific hypothesis until it is tested, which raises questions about how we define science and what we mean by a "scientific hypothesis."

3. Some argue that the focus should shift from whether a theory is scientific to how it is handled within the scientific community. This approach suggests that the difference between science and pseudoscience may not bear the weight historically placed upon it by the demarcation problem.

4. The main concern behind the demarcation problem was to determine which theories deserve serious consideration as good scientific theories, rather than simply being recognized as scientific.

5. Scientific theories that are considered poor or false are typically not funded, taught in science classes, or taken seriously in the scientific community. This indicates that it's not just about being scientific but also about being a good scientific theory.

6. The analogy of the Olympics is misleading because it focuses on the contestants' feelings rather than the practice itself. In science, we need to distinguish between views that should be taken seriously and those that shouldn't, which requires more nuanced criteria beyond the traditional demarcation problem.

7. While the Constitution doesn't bar teaching inferior science, if creationism is granted scientific status (but not necessarily good scientific status), it does not warrant equal time in education because there are many scientific views to consider, and resources should be allocated to those with merit.

8. The challenge remains to find a way to distinguish between good and bad theories within the context of scientific practice, which may offer a solution to the problem of how to evaluate what is scientific.

9. Progress in the philosophy of science may lead to a more satisfactory resolution to the demarcation problem as we learn to combine different philosophical insights and practical examples from scientific history.

In the next discussion, we will explore scientific practice further by examining Einstein's theory of relativity as an example that illustrates what makes science distinct and valuable.

1. Operationalism is the idea that the meaning of scientific concepts should be based on the empirical procedures used to test them, rather than theoretical definitions or non-empirical criteria. It was influential in the 20th century and is still used in some fields like psychology for operational definitions.

2. The motivation behind operationalism is to ensure consistency and clarity in scientific language so that all researchers use terms like "depression" in the same way. However, this approach can lead to problems if it's too restrictive or if it tries to eliminate theoretical concepts entirely.

3. Operationalism faces challenges when trying to account for all potential variables that could affect a measurement (like someone tampering with a pan balance). It's difficult to ensure that all relevant factors are operationally specified and included in the procedure.

4. The concept of weight is an example where operational definitions can be insufficient because there's more to what we mean by "weight" than just the outcome of a pan balance test. Similar issues arise with other measurements like temperature, where even though we use different instruments (like Fahrenheit or Celsius thermometers), we presuppose a notion of temperature that goes beyond any single measurement procedure.

5. The Einsteinian Revolution in physics highlighted the importance of not relying on theoretical constructs that cannot be directly measured. Operationalism aimed to address this by focusing solely on what can be empirically observed and measured.

6. Despite its intentions, operationalism can't entirely escape reliance on non-operational concepts because there are aspects of scientific measurement that require broader understanding and theoretical context beyond the specific operations used.

7. The challenges faced by operationalism illustrate the complexity of defining scientific concepts purely in terms of empirical procedures, and this has implications for how we understand the relationship between theory and observation in science.

1. Hume's Empiricism and the Problem of Philosophy: David Hume presents a strict empiricist view where all meaningful statements are either relations of ideas or matters of fact, as outlined in his "fork." Relations of ideas are formal and verbal, found in logic and mathematics, while matters of fact are empirical and found in the sciences. This leads to the question of what role philosophy plays within this framework.

2. The Challenge of Solipsism: Hume's strict empiricist view seems to lead to a solipsism of the present moment if taken to its extreme, where our knowledge is confined to immediate experience. This raises the question of whether we should reconsider or modify empiricism to avoid such radical conclusions.

3. The Problem of Philosophy's Status: Hume's own work, which is a kind of "psychology" of human understanding, does not clearly demonstrate how philosophy can be a legitimate discipline if it is neither empirical science nor purely formal logic. This raises the issue of what exactly philosophy is doing if it isn't engaging in empirical investigation.

4. The Challenge of Scientific Inference: Empiricism faces the challenge that scientific inquiry often requires us to go beyond immediate experience, making inferences that cannot be directly verified by sensory data alone. This raises questions about how we can justify such inferences within an empiricist framework.

5. Philosophy's Role and Legitimacy: The challenges lead to the broader question of what role philosophy plays if it is not a science and cannot simply be reduced to formal logic. Is philosophy just an inferior form of scientific inquiry, or does it have its own unique value and methodology?

6. The Narrative Moves Forward: As we move into the 20th century, these challenges remain central concerns for philosophers who continue to grapple with the question of how experience informs our knowledge and how philosophy relates to both experience and science. The narrative will explore these issues further when we consider the early 20th-century responses to Hume's empiricism.

In summary, Hume's empiricist framework raises significant questions about the nature of philosophy and its relation to empirical science, as well as the justification of inferences that are essential for scientific progress. These questions continue to be central in the ongoing philosophical discourse.

1. The verification principle, as initially proposed by Logical Positivists, required that for a statement to be meaningful (empirically meaningful), it must be either conclusively verifiable or falsifiable based on experience. However, this criterion is too strict because few scientific statements can be conclusively verified or falsified with a finite number of observations.

2. AJ Ayer proposed a weaker version of the verification principle, suggesting that a statement is verifiable if we can describe observations that bear on its truth or falsity. This allows for statements that have an indirect connection to experience, which seems necessary for scientific statements and especially those about unobservable entities.

3. The problem with Ayer's criterion is that it is too weak; it allows for the inclusion of any statement as scientifically meaningful if it can be used to derive observational predictions along with a sufficient number of auxiliary hypotheses, regardless of whether those auxiliary hypotheses are themselves empirically meaningful.

4. Positivists attempted to refine the verification principle further by requiring that auxiliary hypotheses be independently established as empirically meaningful. However, it was shown that even with this refinement, almost any statement could still be considered meaningful.

5. Despite the difficulties in pinning down a satisfactory verification principle, the positivist project continued to influence philosophical thought due to its emphasis on the importance of observation in scientific knowledge. The need to address the legacy of Einstein and his reliance on observational evidence also gave momentum to the positivist approach.

6. In the next lecture, we will explore how positivists conceive of scientific theories and confront similar issues regarding the verification of theoretical statements within their framework. Despite the challenges faced by the verification principle, the positivist emphasis on empirical meaningfulness has had a lasting impact on the philosophy of science.

1. **Gene Concept**: The term "gene" was introduced before the full understanding of heredity. As science progressed, the concept of a gene evolved from a simple marker for a trait to a complex understanding of DNA sequences that code for proteins and regulate various biological processes.

2. **Positivism**: This philosophical view holds that scientific theories are primarily tools for systematizing experience, rather than descriptions of unobservable reality. For positivists, the utility of a theory lies in its ability to generate predictions from observational data.

3. **Acupuncture as an Example**: Acupuncture provides reliable predictions and cures within certain domains but contains explanations (like energy channels) that are not accepted by Western medicine. For positivists, the non-empirical aspects of acupuncture's theory can be disregarded, as what matters is the connection between input (e.g., my back hurts) and output (e.g., my back no longer hurts).

4. **Instrumental Conception of Scientific Theories**: According to this view, scientific theories are instruments for making predictions based on observations. They need not be true or accurately describe unobservable entities or processes. Instead, they serve as "inference tickets" that guide us from empirical data to further empirical conclusions.

5. **Historical Example - Andreas Ossiander**: In his preface to Copernicus's work, Ossiander presented heliocentrism not as a true account of the universe but as an effective method for predicting planetary positions. This pragmatic approach helped to secure acceptance of Copernicus's theory.

6. **Barclayan Side**: This refers to the practical, experience-focused approach to scientific theories, which avoids metaphysical claims and emphasizes the predictive power of a theory without necessarily asserting its truth.

7. **Scientific Imperative vs. Metaphysics**: The course acknowledges the tension between the scientific imperative to predict and systematize experience and the desire to avoid metaphysical speculation about unobservable reality.

8. **Course Outlook**: The received view of theories, which balances empirical adequacy with a cautious approach to unobservable entities, will be revisited and challenged later in the course as we delve deeper into the philosophy of science.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_08.txt
1. **Hypothesis Evaluation**: When evaluating a hypothesis, two key criteria Quine emphasizes are simplicity and conservatism. Simplicity involves minimizing the number of basic laws and types of basic objects posited, while conservatism involves preserving as much of the existing web of belief as possible without necessitating major changes.

2. **Zeus vs. Electrical Explanation of Lightning**: As an example, the explanation of lightning via Zeus's thunder versus a modern scientific understanding involving electricity can be evaluated based on these criteria. The scientific explanation is often preferred because it is simpler and more conservative, meaning it requires fewer new basic laws and better fits with existing knowledge.

3. **Pragmatic Criteria vs. Truth**: Quine does not claim that simpler or more conservative theories are necessarily truer; rather, he suggests that these criteria make the theory more practical to use. The question of whether simpler or more conservative theories are likelier to be true is a separate and complex issue.

4. **Under Determination of Theory by Data**: Quine argues that there is no unique theory that can be singled out as definitively correct based solely on empirical data. This is because different theories can account for the same empirical data without conflict. This under determination applies to all possible data, not just the data we currently have.

5. **Quine's View on Relativism**: Quine rejects relativism, even though his arguments suggest that no theory is uniquely determined by the facts. He maintains that simplicity and conservatism provide constraints on acceptable theories, and he does not believe that all theories are equally valid.

6. **The Puzzle of Under Determination**: In actual scientific practice, scientists do not typically face under determination by all possible data; they often find a theory that fits the empirical evidence reasonably well. Additional constraints beyond deductive logic and pragmatic criteria are likely at play in real-world science.

7. **Inductive Logic or Method**: To further constrain legitimate webs of belief, there may be additional principles of inductive logic or method that guide scientific practice. These principles are also subject to revision and are part of the web of belief itself. In the next discussion, we will explore these inductive principles and their status within the scientific enterprise.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_09.txt
1. Philosophy as an a priori discipline does not have its own empirical territory but claims a role in justification. Empirical testing is the domain where hypotheses are tested once they are generated.

2. In mathematics, generating potentially provable theorems cannot be systematized, but proving them can be, through deductive logic.

3. The origin of scientific hypotheses (like the structure of the benzene molecule) is not relevant to their justification. Justification comes from empirical testing, while discovery may be influenced by history and psychology.

4. Popper and the positivists distinguished between the discovery of hypotheses (which they saw as psychological or historical) and the justification of hypotheses (which they thought could be addressed through methodology).

5. Recent developments in artificial intelligence and computational power have rekindled interest in the logic of scientific discovery, suggesting that some aspects of creativity might be rule-governed, even if not in a classical sense.

6. Techniques like Darwinian models of AI demonstrate that interesting and plausible hypotheses can emerge from blind variation and retention processes, which are mindless recipes that iteratively produce better results.

7. There is evidence to suggest that human discovery processes might also operate in ways similar to these computational methods, where the data pushes our buttons and suggests hypotheses.

8. The classical conception of methodology, which was considered old-fashioned by mid-20th century thinkers, may have more relevance today than it was given credit for at the time.

9. In the next discussion, we will explore the early 20th-century empiricists' ambitions to establish an objective methodology for scientific justification, despite recognizing the limitations of Mill's methods in pinpointing the correct explanations for empirical data.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_10.txt
1. Karl Popper's philosophy of science emphasizes the importance of choosing theories that have been severely tested and corroborated because, according to him, there is no reliable method of induction to predict future events or confirm theories.

2. Popper's position faces a challenge: while he insists on the superiority of corroborated theories, other methods like reading tea leaves could be considered equally without basis since neither induction nor tea leaves provide guidance for future performance.

3. The "dance with who brung you" principle suggests that we should hold onto a theory until it fails a test, but this principle doesn't necessarily justify preferring corroborated theories over untested ones without relying on inductive reasoning.

4. Popper's view that scientific theories aim at the truth is problematic because it implies a pursuit of the holy grail—a goal that can never be definitively confirmed as achieved, even though scientists must discard theories when they are falsified.

5. The main issue with Popper's view is the lack of a satisfactory answer to David Hume's argument against induction, which questions the justification for inferring general laws from particular observations.

6. To address this, we need to either assume some form of inductive reasoning or admit that there is no good reason for preferring corroborated theories over untested ones, both within and outside the realm of science.

7. The challenge for Popper's philosophy is to explain how we can rationally choose between scientific theories without relying on some form of induction, which he has rejected as unreliable.

8. Next, we will explore whether there are better ways to answer Hume's argument and provide a foundation for the rational choice of scientific theories that aim at the truth.

1. **Broccosaxidyle Dilemma**: Nelson Goodman presents a thought experiment involving "broccosaxidyles," which are items that could be broccoli, saxophones, or crocodiles. This illustrates the difficulty of determining whether our categories reflect real distinctions in nature or are artifacts of our language and concepts.

2. **Chemical Elements**: While categories like "predator" or "chemical elements" seem to carve nature at its joints, there is philosophical skepticism about whether these categories truly reflect objective distinctions.

3. **"Green" vs. "Grew"**: Goodman criticizes the traditional view of inductive logic by showing that both valid and invalid inferences can have the same form. For example, "all observed emeralds are green" is a valid inference, while "all emeralds are grew" (where "grew" refers to the process of observation) is not, despite their formal similarity. This highlights the subjectivity of inductive reasoning and the problem of determining which uniformities in nature are significant for prediction.

4. **The Curve Fitting Problem**: This problem illustrates that with a finite number of data points, one can always fit a more complex model to them than a simpler one, but it raises questions about whether nature inherently prefers simplicity or if our language and concepts shape our understanding of what is natural.

5. **Hume's Problem**: David Hume argued that since events are distinct, we cannot find any real connections or necessary connections between cause and effect.

6. **Goodman's Challenge**: Goodman argues that there are too many potential connections between events to be meaningful without further criteria to distinguish which ones are significant.

7. **The Unsolved Problem of Induction**: The traditional problem of induction remains unresolved, as we must discern which uniformities in nature are relevant for making predictions, and how our language and concepts influence this process.

8. **Next Steps**: In the next part of the course, we will explore alternative approaches to addressing the problem of induction, including the concept of confirmation theory, which attempts to provide a more rigorous foundation for inductive reasoning.

1. The model of "inference to the best explanation" is not just about identifying what explanation is given the evidence, but also determining when an explanation is sufficiently supported to be a reasonable conclusion. This is akin to the climax in crime shows where one hypothesis emerges as the most plausible.

2. The phrase "inference to the best explanation when the best explanation is a good enough explanation" more accurately captures what the model aims to describe, emphasizing that the "best" explanation is often the least problematic among a set of alternatives rather than the most likely.

3. The challenge lies in defining what makes one explanation better than another. Two main notions have been considered:
   - Likelihood: The hypothesis that is most likely to be true given the evidence. However, this approach is not particularly helpful because we need a clear understanding of what "likely" means in the first place.
   - Loveliness: The hypothesis that best accounts for the data and contributes most to our understanding of it. This is different from likelihood and seems more desirable, but it raises questions about the relationship between explanatory loveliness and likelihood.

4. The problem is deepened by the question of whether hypotheses that enhance our understanding are necessarily more likely to be true. It suggests that what makes an explanation lovely might not be tied to its truth value.

5. Instead of continuing to discuss the logic of confirmation, the discussion will shift to a historical approach inspired by Thomas Kuhn's work as a historian of science, which offers a different perspective on understanding and explanation in science. This approach will be explored in the following content.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_13.txt
1. **Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions**: Kuhn argues that during a crisis, the rules of normal science are loosened, and it becomes legitimate to question the prevailing paradigm. In such times, science becomes more paparian, with scientists critically examining established theories.

2. **Normal vs. Crisis Science**: According to Kuhn, normal science is characterized by dogmatism, which allows researchers to delve deeply into a particular area without being distracted by every anomaly. This dogmatism can lead to apparent irrationality or failure to fit observations, but it also ensures that paradigms are given a fair chance to resolve issues before being overthrown.

3. **Paradigm Crises and Revolutions**: Kuhn likens scientific crises to political constitutional crises. When a crisis is resolved, scientists may return to normal science, or a new paradigm may emerge, marking a scientific revolution. A revolution occurs when the community of scientists adopts a new worldview that fundamentally changes how they understand and approach scientific problems.

4. **Bug vs. Feature**: Kuhn's defense against the charge that dogmatism leads to bad science is that what appears as a paradigm's flaw (a "bug") may actually be a desirable characteristic ("feature") that contributes to the progress of science. The occasional crisis and potential for revolution are not pathologies but essential parts of the scientific process.

5. **The Role of Crisis**: Kuhn suggests that crises are beneficial because they force scientists to reevaluate their assumptions and theories, leading to potentially more accurate models of reality. These periods of intense scrutiny and debate ensure that science does not stagnate but continues to evolve and address the most pressing problems.

6. **The Importance of Paradigms**: Kuhn emphasizes that paradigms are essential for scientific progress, as they provide a framework for understanding and making sense of observations and experiments. However, when paradigms fail to fit observations consistently, a shift to a more critical and exploratory phase is necessary to resolve the issues and potentially lead to a new scientific paradigm.

In summary, Kuhn's view is that science is a complex process involving periods of stable investigation (normal science) punctuated by crises that can lead to scientific revolutions when new paradigms are adopted. These shifts are not arbitrary but are the result of the inherent dynamics of scientific progress, where dogmatism and crisis play crucial roles in ensuring scientific advancement.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_14.txt
1. **Kuhn vs. Popper**: Thomas Kuhn's view of scientific progress differs from Karl Popper's. Popper saw science as a process of conjectures and refutations, where hypotheses are put forward without evidence and then tested for falsifiability. In contrast, Kuhn viewed scientific practice as dominated by 'normal science,' which is conducted within the framework of an accepted paradigm.

2. **Normal Science**: During periods of normal science, scientists work within a given paradigm to solve problems and refine theories without questioning the paradigm's fundamental assumptions. Progress is incremental and often consists of puzzle-solving within the established framework.

3. **Paradigm Shifts**: Occasionally, anomalies and new discoveries accumulate to such an extent that the existing paradigm becomes untenable, leading to a scientific revolution. This involves a paradigm shift, where scientists adopt a new framework that reinterprets previous data and sets a new research agenda.

4. **Truth and Objectivity**: Kuhn was skeptical about the notion of objective truth that is independent of any specific paradigm. He argued that what we call 'truth' is often relative to the prevailing scientific context. This view challenges the traditional, more linear and objective, conception of scientific progress.

5. **Kuhn's Influence**: Kuhn's work has been influential in understanding how science actually operates, emphasizing the role of human practices, social interactions, and historical contexts in shaping scientific knowledge.

6. **Metaphor Comparison**: Kuhn's view can be likened to the punctuated equilibrium model of evolution, which contrasts with the more traditional Darwinian view. In this analogy, normal science corresponds to long periods of stability in species, and scientific revolutions correspond to rapid evolutionary changes that lead to new species.

7. **Critical Evaluation**: The next step is to critically evaluate Kuhn's theory, considering its implications for the nature of scientific knowledge, objectivity, and progress, as well as how it accommodates the tension between descriptive accounts and normative expectations of science.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_15.txt
1. **Theory-Ladenness of Observation**: Thomas Kuhn argues that all observations are theory-laden, meaning that our understanding of observations is always mediated by the theoretical context within which we operate. This challenges the idea that there's a neutral observation untouched by theory.

2. **Paradigm Shifts**: Kuhn introduces the concept of a "paradigm" as the fundamental framework through which scientists view the world. A shift from one paradigm to another, he argues, is a revolutionary change that fundamentally transforms how scientists understand the world.

3. **Incommensurability**: According to Kuhn, before and after a paradigm shift, the language, concepts, and criteria of evidence used by scientists are incommensurable, making it difficult to compare competing paradigms directly or to see which one is "truer."

4. **The Nature of Scientific Progress**: Kuhn's view suggests that scientific progress is not linear or accumulative but occurs in "puzzle-solving" episodes within a paradigm. Only after a paradigm shift can scientists address new problems and make significant advancements.

5. **Implications for Realism**: Kuhn's views raise skepticism about the traditional notion of scientific realism, which holds that science progressively uncovers the true, underlying reality of the world.

6. **Response to Falsification**: Kuhn acknowledges that observations can still serve to falsify theories, even if those observations are theory-laden. A famous example is the evidence that would be provided by finding a pre-Cambrian rabbit fossil, which would contradict established geological and biological theories.

7. **Alternative Models of Knowledge**: Kuhn's views suggest that we need a new model of knowledge that recognizes the active role of theory in our scientific practices, rather than thinking of science as a passive discovery of an objective reality.

8. **Philosophical Reactions**: After Kuhn, philosophers and sociologists of science grappled with his ideas, leading to various responses and further developments in how we understand scientific knowledge, practice, and progress. The next lectures will explore these post-Kuhnian developments.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_16.txt
1. **Thomas Kuhn vs. Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos**: Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" posited that science progresses through periods of "normal science" followed by paradigm shifts. This view contrasted with the views of Popper and Lakatos, who emphasized the importance of testing theories against evidence and each other, a process that should be as rigorous as possible to ensure scientific progress.

2. **Paul Feyerabend's Influence**: Inspired by Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend developed his "Against Method" thesis, which argued for the value of epistemological anarchism in science. He suggested that a wide variety of methods should be used to test scientific theories, including those that seem implausible, to ensure that current theories are thoroughly scrutinized.

3. **Feyerabend's Methodological Anarchism**: Feyerabend believed that science should embrace a diverse array of creative and unconventional ideas. He argued that this would lead to more robust scientific progress by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of existing theories. He drew an analogy with Galileo, suggesting that the rigidity of the Church in his time stifled scientific progress, much like he thought current scientific orthodoxies were doing.

4. **Feyerabend's Critique of Science**: Feyerabend was critical of science as a monolithic institution that could stifle creativity and dissent. He saw science as wielding significant cultural power and argued that it often functioned to support its own interests rather than human well-being. He believed that the concepts of reason and truth were often used to maintain the power of scientific elites.

5. **Feyerabend's Later Views**: In his later years, Feyerabend softened his stance somewhat by recognizing that science is not a single, unified endeavor but rather a collection of various practices and methods. This allowed him to view science with less hostility while still maintaining his critique of the idea that science has a unique or privileged epistemic status.

6. **Feyerabend's Legacy**: Feyerabend's work challenged the notion that there is a single, objective method for scientific inquiry and highlighted the complex social dynamics at play within scientific communities. His radical critiques of science have had a lasting impact on the philosophy of science, prompting reconsideration of the role and status of science in society.

In summary, Paul Feyerabend's views on scientific methodology and the nature of science as an institution are characterized by his advocacy for epistemological anarchism, his critique of scientific orthodoxy, and his later recognition that science is a diverse set of practices rather than a monolithic entity. His work remains influential and provocative in discussions about the role of science in society and the nature of scientific knowledge.

 The Science Wars were a series of heated debates in the mid-1990s that pitted scientific realists and defenders of reason against postmodernists who questioned the objectivity, neutrality, and political naivety of science. The conflict was characterized by a lack of mutual understanding and often devolved into personal attacks rather than constructive dialogue.

Alan Sokol's hoax article, "Transgressing the Boundaries Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity," exemplified the tensions between the two sides. Sokol, who was not a cultural conservative but a physicist concerned about the left's embrace of postmodernist thought, aimed to demonstrate the confusion he perceived within the postmodernist approach to science.

The Science Wars highlighted the problems with both extremes: postmodernists overreacted to the complexity of knowledge and representation, while some scientific realists were dismissive of any critique of science as anti-reason or politically motivated. Both sides failed to appreciate the nuances of each other's arguments and the potential for constructive engagement.

Philosopher of science Clark Glymour's quip captures the frustration felt by many who saw the world through a binary lens of either being a logical positivist or an English professor, reflecting the polarized nature of the debate. The positivist view, which held that science is based on objective logic and empirical evidence, was shown to be too simplistic, while postmodernism's skepticism of scientific objectivity seemed overly cynical.

In conclusion, the Science Wars revealed the need for a more nuanced understanding of science that acknowledges its complexities, including both its epistemic strengths and its social and political dimensions. The conflict underscored the importance of avoiding extremes and seeking a middle ground that respects the rigor of scientific inquiry while also recognizing its human context.

1. **Ian Hacking and the Covering Law Model (CLM)**: Ian Hacking critiques Karl Popper's strict interpretation of the covering law model, arguing that the CLM is more flexible than Popper allows. According to Hacking, the CLM can accommodate partial explanations and doesn't require complete deterministic explanations for every event or phenomenon.

2. **Paul Hemple's Critique**: Paul Hemple takes a stricter stance on the covering law model, insisting that an explanation must be able to predict the event in question before it can be considered an explanation. He argues that if the theory could not have predicted the occurrence of the event when all available information was present, then it cannot provide a complete explanation for that event.

3. **Hemple vs. Other Sciences**: Hemple applies this stringent criterion of prediction to sciences like biology, psychology, and history, which he believes are less explanatorily successful than physics due to their inability to make precise predictions about specific events. He contends that these sciences often deal with complex systems influenced by randomness, making complete explanations difficult.

4. **Biology as an Example**: In the case of evolutionary biology, Hemple would argue that while it can offer probabilistic explanations for the emergence of certain traits or species, it cannot explain specific instances of evolutionary change (like why a particular weasel evolved) because it could not have predicted these events with certainty.

5. **Psychology and History**: Similarly, Hemple would apply this strict interpretation to psychology and history, suggesting that these fields can at best provide partial and probabilistic explanations due to the complexity and randomness involved.

6. **The Controversy**: The debate here revolves around whether the stringent criteria set by Hemple for what counts as a genuine explanation are too demanding, potentially dismissing valuable insights and explanations provided by sciences that deal with complex systems. Critics argue that Hemple's model may be unnecessarily exclusionary and that it overlooks the practical utility of partial explanations in understanding the world.

In summary, Ian Hacking's view allows for a more flexible interpretation of the covering law model, recognizing the value of partial explanations. In contrast, Paul Hemple maintains a strict criterion for explanation, demanding that any explanation must be capable of predicting the event in question before it can explain it. This stance leads him to downplay the explanatory power of sciences like biology, psychology, and history, relative to physics. The debate touches on the nature of scientific explanation and the extent to which partial or probabilistic explanations are meaningful and valuable.

1. The concept of function in biology has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it threatens to eliminate functions by reducing them to mechanisms, while others claim it vindicates functions within a mechanistic worldview.

2. The philosophy of psychology raises questions about whether beliefs and desires are legitimate scientific categories and if they must possess causal powers to be considered as such.

3. Teleological explanations are not exclusive to biology; they also appear in other sciences, including physics, where terms like "equilibrium" or "null geodesic" suggest goals or purposes that can be interpreted mechanistically.

4. The covering law model of explanation faces challenges due to its inability to handle causal explanations and the complexity of scientific practice.

5. The causal approach to explanation also encounters difficulties, particularly in accounting for scientific laws and the role of function, purpose, and teleology within a mechanistic framework.

6. A multifaceted approach to scientific explanation may be necessary, recognizing that different contexts require different types of explanations, such as those provided by the covering law model or the causal model.

7. The distinction between explaining laws and explaining events is important, and a complete account of scientific explanation might need to incorporate aspects from both models, as well as consider statistical and probabilistic explanations.

8. Statistical explanation, where laws and causes are statistical rather than deterministic, presents unique challenges for understanding how science explains phenomena without necessitating events.

9. The ambition of science to provide explanations is an inescapable part of scientific inquiry, but the methods and principles for achieving this ambition remain a subject of ongoing philosophical debate and investigation.

1. **Von Fressen's View on Explanation**: Von Fressen argues that explanation is not an intrinsic part of science, suggesting that some events just happen without needing to be explained. He believes that if we insist on seeking explanations, we are looking for something beyond the mere occurrence of events, which may not be grounded in experience.

2. **Challenges for the Covering Law Model**: This model faces problems both in deterministic and probabilistic contexts. In particular, it struggles with issues of irrelevance: just because an event is nomically expected doesn't necessarily mean it's explained. For example, a patient taking vitamin C and recovering from a cold might be nomically expected but doesn't constitute an explanation if it's not causally relevant.

3. **Causal Models of Explanation**: These models suggest that explanation involves raising the probability of the event to be explained, rather than simply making it probable. A causal factor is something that either increases or decreases the likelihood of an outcome, which is a key aspect of explanation.

4. **Probabilistic Explanation**: Probabilistic explanations can make the event they explain less likely than it would have been without the explanation. This shows that statistical laws don't necessarily render outcomes more probable to be explanatory; they must bear relevantly on the probabilities of what's explained.

5. **Tension Between Causation and Explanation**: The tension between the use of causation in explanations and the empirical constraints of science is a recurring theme. This debate will continue as we explore laws of nature and their role in scientific explanation.

6. **Looking Ahead**: The next topic to be discussed will be laws of nature, which will further illuminate our understanding of explanation in science. The course will delve into how laws are understood and used within explanatory frameworks.

1. **Evaluating Counterfactuals**: To evaluate counterfactuals, like what might have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald had not shot President Kennedy, we maintain the laws of nature and ensure continuity with our actual world. We aim to find a possible world that is as close as possible to our own while still differing in the event in question.

2. **Laws of Nature**: Laws are not determined by individual beliefs or usages but by the best theories we have, which are judged on their simplicity and strength. These theories should reflect patterns observed in experience and deductive relationships among those observations.

3. **Systems View of Laws**: This approach suggests that laws emerge from the best systematization of our scientific theories. It avoids the problem of the epistemic regularity view, which might suggest that beliefs or practices determine laws, by grounding laws in objective patterns and deductive relations rather than subjective judgments.

4. **Objectivity**: Laws are not metaphysically imposed on the universe but are instead a reflection of how our best theories describe the world's workings. This maintains an empiricist stance by ensuring that laws are built out of mere patterns in experience and deductive relations among them.

5. **Causation**: Following Hume, this approach treats causation as a construct within our thinking rather than a metaphysical necessity out in the world. Similarly, laws of nature are seen as constructs within our best theories rather than as external, mind-independent entities.

6. **Mind Independence**: The laws of nature are independent of what any individual might believe or think. They are grounded in the most idealized and refined versions of our scientific understanding, which strive to be objective and reflective of reality.

7. **Causes and Cue Balls**: Just as there is no metaphysical causation out in the world dictating that a cue ball must cause an eight ball to move, there is no metaphysical law dictating behavior within the universe. Instead, what we call 'laws' are simply the most robust and coherent descriptions of how things work according to our best scientific theories.

In summary, the systems approach to laws of nature offers an empiricist solution to explaining the objectivity of laws by grounding them in the best systematization of scientific theories, which are independent of individual beliefs and aim to capture the simplicity and strength of the world's workings as observed through patterns in experience.

1. The debate between those who see gravitational laws as describing real component forces and those who see them as merely capturing tendencies for bodies to behave in certain ways is a complex metaphysical issue.

2. Nancy Cartwright's position, which is controversial, argues against the existence of component forces beyond net forces to avoid double counting. Net forces are the result of multiple forces acting together, and we should not treat each force as an additional entity.

3. An analogy is used to illustrate this point: Just as saying a house is empty can be context-dependent (considering only furniture versus including light bulbs), the existence of component forces in scientific laws can also be context-dependent.

4. The law that metal bars expand when heated still holds even if there are external factors (like hammering) that influence the bar's behavior. What counts as "holding" a law is determined by the context in which it is applied.

5. Science faces a tension between two legitimate aspirations:
   - The empiricist view, which emphasizes the importance of observation and the need for laws to be grounded in patterns observable in experience.
   - A more ambitious view of science that aims to describe how things would be if the universe were different, including what must or cannot happen.

6. This tension reflects a deeper philosophical problem about whether scientific laws are strictly constrained by empirical evidence or whether they also explore the necessary structures of reality.

7. The course will continue to explore these tensions, particularly in relation to whether biological phenomena can be reduced to physical laws, which is another significant metaphysical issue in science.

1. **Reduction vs. Replacement**: The distinction between reducing an old theory to a new one versus replacing it entirely can be complex. Reduction typically involves showing how one kind of explanation or phenomenon emerges from another without losing the identity of the phenomena being explained. In biology, the concept of a "gene" is a good example of this. Genes can be seen as mutons (segments of DNA subject to mutation), recons (segments of DNA that can undergo crossing over), or cisterons (functional units responsible for traits), depending on the context and what aspect one is focusing on.

2. **Approximation**: The idea of approximation in scientific theories suggests that what we're reducing is close enough to the old theory, but this notion of closeness can vary across different scientific contexts. A general account of approximation is desirable but challenging because it works differently in each case.

3. **Cumulative and Progressive Science**: For science to be cumulative and progressive, it must offer increasingly good theories about the same phenomena. This requires a balance between allowing for corrective reductions (where new theories account for aspects that the old theories missed or got wrong) and recognizing complete replacements when necessary.

4. **Identity Across Time**: Issues of identity over time, such as nations, corporations, and institutions, are complex and can inform our understanding of scientific reduction and replacement. The notion of identity across time is not just a verbal issue but has implications for how we understand the progress of science.

5. **Epistemic vs. Explanatory Basicness**: In science, what is epistemically basic (observable and evidentially accessible) tends to be at one end, while what is explanatorily basic (such as microphysics) is at the other. There is a tension between the need for empirical modesty and the drive for comprehensive explanations.

6. **Unified Physicalism**: The next topic to explore will be the idea that all sciences are unified under a physicalist framework, where everything in the world can be explained by the laws and entities of physics. This is a more ambitious reductive project that seeks to understand the diversity of phenomena in terms of a single underlying reality.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_24.txt
 Physicalism is a philosophical viewpoint that posits all aspects of reality are ultimately physical, and any mental or moral properties supervene on the physical base. Supervenience means that there cannot be any difference in mental or moral properties without a corresponding difference in the physical realm. However, it allows for multiple realizations of these properties across different physical substrates. This provides an asymmetry where the mental and moral depend on the physical but not vice versa.

Supervenience comes in various forms, depending on how the "have-to" aspect is grounded—whether in meaning, laws of nature, or other factors. It's a weaker notion than reductionism or identity theory, capturing the intuition that everything depends on what happens at the physical level while acknowledging that not everything can be reduced to or explained by the physical alone.

The example of two universes with identical physical happenings but different laws of nature challenges the notion of supervenience, suggesting that even the laws governing physical events might not be fixed and could supervene on something more fundamental or abstract. This highlights the complexity in articulating a unified theory of the world that accounts for both the diversity of phenomena and the underlying unity of reality.

In the next lecture, we will delve into the notions of meaning and reference, which play crucial roles in understanding reductionism, and how these ideas intersect with the goals of evidential modesty and explanatory ambition in science. The challenge lies in balancing the desire to explain the world with the recognition that some aspects of our theories may remain underdetermined by empirical evidence.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_25.txt
1. **Semantic Conception of Scientific Theories**: This approach suggests that a scientific theory can be interpreted in various ways, including through patterns observed in nature (e.g., fox and rabbit populations), mathematical equations, or even computer simulations. Each interpretation is considered equally legitimate. A theory is true if its literal content can be applied to the real world, which means that theoretical terms can acquire meaning from their use in models.

2. **Departure from Empiricism**: The semantic conception allows for analogical and metaphorical reasoning to contribute to the meaning of unobservable phenomena, a departure from the empiricist view that all literal content must ultimately be observable. This enriches our understanding of unobservable realities but also introduces the risk of falling into conceptual confusions if not carefully managed.

3. **Quantum Mechanics**: Quantum mechanics presents unique challenges for modeling and interpretation. Models that are too concrete can introduce hidden variables or other elements that conflict with the theory's mathematical structure. The temptation to interpret quantum phenomena in classical terms (e.g., an electron passing through one slit) is often misguided because the mathematics of quantum mechanics does not support such interpretations.

4. **Advantages and Disadvantages**: The semantic conception allows for a richer understanding of scientific theories, potentially enabling science to describe unobservable reality more accurately. However, it also requires careful management to avoid introducing intuitions or hidden variables that are not supported by the theory itself.

5. **End of Logical Positivism**: The shift from the empiricist view to the semantic conception represents a significant evolution in the philosophy of science, effectively marking the end of logical positivism as the dominant paradigm in understanding scientific theories and their interpretations. This new perspective acknowledges that science can aim to describe reality beyond what is immediately observable, using enriched semantic resources to do so responsibly.

1. **Scientific Realism vs. Empiricism**: The lecture contrasts scientific realism with empiricism. Scientific realism posits that our best scientific theories are often true or approximately true, even though we may not have direct evidence for the entities or mechanisms they describe. Empiricism, on the other hand, is more cautious about asserting the truth of unobservable entities and emphasizes the reliance on observational evidence.

2. **Historical Examples**: The lecture mentions the shift from Newtonian physics to relativistic and quantum mechanics as an example where our best theories change, yet the historical record suggests that science builds upon itself rather than starting anew with each paradigm shift. This challenges the view that scientific progress is a series of wrong turns.

3. **Approaches to Truth**: The lecture explores different ways to understand what it means for a theory to be true. Some suggest that only certain aspects of our theories are likely to be true, or that only some of our theories as a whole are likely to be true. Geology might be considered more secure than physics because we have better access to the entities posited by geological theories.

4. **Mathematical Structures**: Another approach to scientific realism is to focus on the mathematical structures underlying scientific theories, rather than the specific entities they posit. Even if our description of what exists is wrong, the laws or structures might still be accurate. This is illustrated with the example of Saadi Carnot's work on thermodynamics.

5. **Ontology vs. Structure**: The lecture distinguishes between ontology (the stuff that exists) and structure (the formal relationships described by a theory). Realists might argue that it's the structural aspects of theories that are often correct, even if our descriptions of what the structures pertain to are incorrect.

6. **Tensions in Scientific Realism**: The realist position has an internal tension between metaphysical modesty (acknowledging that the world has a nature independent of our beliefs) and epistemic presumptiousness (claiming we can know that aspect of the world).

7. **Next Steps**: The next lecture will explore the main arguments for scientific realism, including its most serious empiricist competitor, constructive empiricism, as proposed by Bas van Fraassen. This will allow us to better understand the debate between those who believe in the truth of our best scientific theories and those who remain agnostic about their truth but still find them useful for explaining the observable world.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_27.txt
 The debate between realism and empiricism, particularly in the context of scientific theories that posit unobservable entities or phenomena, is a central issue in the philosophy of science. Realists argue that our successful predictions and technological applications of scientific theories are best explained by the theories' approximate truth about both observable and unobservable reality. Empiricists, such as von Fressen, contend that we should only believe what can be empirically verified and that the success of science does not require us to posit the existence of unobservable entities.

Von Fressen's position is that science should focus on what is directly observable and that any extension to unobservables must be justified by our methods of inquiry as they apply to observables. He draws a line between what can be explained by the empirical adequacy of theories (their success in making predictions consistent with observations) and what would require metaphysical speculation beyond observation.

The realist-empiricist debate touches on several key philosophical issues, including the nature of scientific explanation, the justification for belief in unobservable entities, and the burden of proof between opposing viewpoints. The "No Miracles" argument is a realist position that posits our theories' success as evidence of their truth, but this argument is problematic for empiricists who question the legitimacy of extending observational methods to unobservables.

The impasse between these positions suggests that there may be no conclusive resolution to the debate. In the next lecture, we will explore whether a less ambitious version of realism can offer a middle ground that might satisfy both sides by focusing on the inference to the best explanation without overreaching into unjustified metaphysical claims.

In summary, the discussion between von Fressen and realists highlights the tension between accepting the existence of unobservable entities based on the success of scientific theories and maintaining a strict adherence to empirical evidence. The debate underscores the complexity of understanding how science works and what we can legitimately infer from its successes.

1. **Inductive Practices and Reasoning Challenges**: The inductive practices in science often seem messy when compared to the norms of logic and probability theory. Studies in social psychology, such as those by Tversky and Kahneman, show that humans frequently reason badly in ways that violate these norms. An example is where most people incorrectly believe it's more likely for a woman who is deeply concerned with issues about discrimination and social justice to be both a bank teller and active in the feminist movement than just a bank teller.

2. **Naturalized Epistemology**: This approach in philosophy raises questions about the norms that should govern our reasoning and how we can determine these norms, especially considering the systematic ways people often reason poorly.

3. **Evolutionary Perspective**: While evolutionary psychology suggests that our cognitive faculties are well-attuned to our environment for survival, it also implies that we might have false beliefs about aspects of the universe that fall outside of our evolutionary context, such as with some interpretations of physics or geometry.

4. **Sociology of Science**: Some sociologists argue that a naturalistic approach to the philosophy of science cannot vindicate scientific realism because categories like truth and objectivity are not central to scientific explanations. They suggest that the idealized image of science as an objective, rational pursuit is mythic and that a more scientifically informed view deflates these aspirations.

5. **Philosophy of Science**: The naturalistic approach to philosophy of science seems like an awkward hybrid of old philosophical aspirations to ground science and newer, more scientific approaches to understanding science itself. This raises questions about whether a scientifically informed examination of how science works undermines or vindicates science's epistemic specialness.

In the next lecture, we will explore to what extent naturalized epistemology and a scientifically informed perspective can vindicate science's special place in our intellectual lives and whether this scrutiny reinforces or challenges the notion of science as an objective, truth-seeking endeavor.

1. **Moral Responsibility of Scientists**: The traditional view in philosophy of science holds that scientists are morally responsible only for acquiring knowledge and not for its applications. However, this view is increasingly challenged as the consequences of scientific research become more unpredictable and significant.

2. **Practical Applications of Research**: There are examples where the practical applications of scientific research were unexpected, such as the development of computers and the internet from abstract logic work. This suggests that an open-ended pursuit of knowledge can have beneficial outcomes.

3. **Genetic Data and Ethics**: The use of data from projects like the Human Genome Project raises ethical concerns, particularly if it leads to discrimination based on genetic profiles. Scientists may not be directly responsible for such outcomes, but the potential consequences influence the decision-making process for researchers.

4. **Medical Research and Global Inequality**: Medical studies conducted in less economically developed countries can provide better healthcare than what is locally available, but they also raise concerns about exploitation of economically disadvantaged individuals as guinea pigs.

5. **Scientific Decision-Making and Democracy**: Fireobin argued that science could become a threat to democracy because non-scientists must rely on scientists to assess the scientific importance of projects, which scientists might overstate due to their interest in the research. Conversely, citizens are asked to determine social significance without equivalent expertise.

6. **Balancing Scientific and Social Significance**: The challenge is to establish a social structure that allows for informed judgments on both the scientific and social aspects of significant projects like the superconducting supercollider. This requires a nuanced understanding of how to integrate expert knowledge with democratic decision-making.

7. **Probability in Philosophy of Science**: Probability has been a peripheral issue thus far, but it will be central in the next topic of discussion. Understanding probability is crucial for evaluating scientific theories and evidence, as well as for making informed decisions about scientific research and its societal implications.

In summary, the philosophy of science grapples with the ethical dimensions of scientific research, particularly the potential impact of such research on society and individuals. The moral responsibility of scientists, the predictability of research outcomes, and the role of probability in assessing scientific claims are all critical issues that reflect the complex interplay between science and society.

1. **Problems with the Principle of Indifference**: The principle of indifference often leads to arbitrary choices when assigning probabilities to different outcomes in cases where there is a lack of information, as seen in the Bertrand's box paradox and Goodman's new riddle of induction. These examples illustrate that our choice of language or framework for dividing up the space of possibilities can seem arbitrary.

2. **Subjective vs. Objective Probability**: Subjective theories of probability treat probabilities as degrees of belief held by actual agents, rather than as frequencies in a series of events. These beliefs are subject to rational criteria, such as coherence, but not to the objective frequencies that frequency theories propose.

3. **Measuring Degrees of Belief**: A common way to measure an individual's degree of belief is by considering their willingness to take bets at various odds. The notion of a fair bet helps determine how rational an agent's beliefs are, as they should be priced in such a way that the agent would expect to break even over time if those beliefs were correct.

4. **Problem with Coherence Alone**: While probabilistic coherence is a necessary condition for rational belief systems, it is not sufficient to ensure that beliefs are accurate or truthlike. Beliefs can be coherent without being true, as seen in examples like paranoid delusions, which coherently assign high probabilities to certain events but are clearly false.

5. **Next Time**: We will explore how a scientifically effective approach to reasoning can be built using the modest requirement that beliefs be probabilistically coherent at a time and across time. This approach is influential in addressing issues of confirmation and evidence in science.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_31.txt
 The Raven paradox, formulated by Carl Hempel, is a famous problem in the philosophy of science that challenges our understanding of confirmation and induction. The paradox arises because the statement "All ravens are black" seems to be confirmed equally well by observing a black raven or a white shirt, which seems intuitively incorrect.

To address the Raven paradox, we can turn to Bayesianism, a statistical approach to reasoning under uncertainty that updates our beliefs in light of new evidence using Bayes' theorem. According to Bayesianism, the probability of a hypothesis given the evidence (posterior probability) is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (likelihood) multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis.

In the context of the Raven paradox, if we believe a priori that it's more likely that all ravens are black than that all ravens are white, then after observing an instance of either a black raven or a white shirt, we should continue to believe more strongly in "All ravens are black" than in "All ravens are white," simply because our prior probability for the former was higher.

The confirming power of evidence is related to how expected that evidence is under each hypothesis. If an event is highly expected under one hypothesis and not under another, then the event confirms the former hypothesis more. In the case of the Raven paradox, observing a black raven is much more expected if "All ravens are black" is true than if "All ravens are white" is true, thus confirming the initial hypothesis more strongly.

Bayesianism can handle the Raven paradox by quantifying the confirmation each instance of observation provides for the hypothesis, which allows us to maintain rational confidence in our hypotheses based on prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence. This approach can potentially offer a coherent theory of scientific reasoning that addresses issues like the Raven paradox.

In summary, Bayesianism provides a framework for understanding how new evidence should update our beliefs about hypotheses, offering a potential resolution to the Raven paradox by appealing to the relative probabilities of evidence under different hypotheses and our prior beliefs about those hypotheses.

1. **Bayesian vs. Classical Statistics**: The discussion centers around the differences between Bayesian and classical approaches to statistics, particularly in the context of legal evidence. Bayesian statistics involves updating prior probabilities with new evidence to obtain posterior probabilities of hypotheses, which can be influential but also subjective. Classical statistics, on the other hand, does not use prior probabilities and focuses on setting confidence intervals or performing hypothesis tests without relying on subjective beliefs.

2. **Subjectivity in Statistics**: The conversation highlights the challenge of avoiding subjectivity in statistical analysis, especially when interpreting evidence in a legal context. Lawyers may implicitly rely on subjective priors even if they don't acknowledge them, which can lead to misleading conclusions about the likelihood of a defendant's guilt based on evidence presented.

3. **Classical Approaches to Learning from Experience**: Despite not being able to assign posterior probabilities to hypotheses, classical statisticians have developed methods to learn from experience and make decisions that balance different types of errors. These methods include controlling the risk of one type of error by minimizing the risk of another, or using structured approaches like the 20 questions method to find answers efficiently.

4. **The Cost of Avoiding Subjectivity**: The conversation emphasizes the cost of trying to eliminate subjectivity in statistical analysis. While it's important to strive for objectivity, ignoring the role of subjective beliefs can have negative consequences and may prevent one from fully learning from experience.

5. **Philosophy of Science and Physics**: The discussion hints at a future exploration of how philosophical concepts apply within particular sciences, with physics being the first to be examined. This suggests an investigation into how philosophical inquiry can provide insight into scientific practices and understanding.

6. **Summary for Tomorrow's Trial**: There is a recognition that the discussion of statistical methods and their implications could be relevant or even influential in the context of a future trial, potentially influencing the outcome based on how evidence is interpreted and presented.

1. The intuition that contact forces don't require explanation whereas distant-acting forces do has historically been influential, and Einstein's theories can be seen as aligning with this view to some extent.

2. The past hypothesis—the principle that the past has a definite course—is an example of something that only happens once but may function lawfully in explanations. It doesn't fit the classic universal conditional form of laws but could be considered an axiom within a best system approach to laws.

3. Some argue that because the laws of nature, including the past hypothesis, determine what's physically possible, there's no need to explain the past hypothesis itself. It's simply a given within our universe.

4. Philosophical naturalists and others might demand an explanation for such a remarkable fact or law, even if current science doesn't offer one. This tension between accepting astonishing facts without explanation and avoiding untestable explanations highlights deeper tensions within scientific practice.

5. The debate touches on empiricist versus realist views about the conditions under which explanatory inferences are possible and desirable, illustrating the complex relationship between evidence and explanation in science.

6. In the next lecture, we will explore similar philosophical questions within the context of biology, particularly concerning the status of species—whether they represent a real classification system or a convenient one. This will further illustrate how philosophical issues arise from within particular scientific disciplines.

Checking Philosophy of Science/4100_34.txt
 In this lecture, Peter Godfrey-Smith discusses the concept of classification in biology and its philosophical implications, drawing parallels with phonetic classification in linguistics. He outlines three main approaches to classifying organisms:

1. **Phonetic Classification**: Similar to the species concept, this approach aims to categorize based on similarity among organisms. However, it faces challenges due to the unclear nature of similarity and the potential for overemphasizing human perceptions of resemblance.

2. **Evolutionary Disparity**: This approach classifies organisms based on their level of morphological or bodily differences, reflecting both historical and current states. It's less common than the cladistic approach but has its merits in certain contexts.

3. **Cladistic Classification**: The most prevalent method, this approach groups organisms based on common ancestry, as revealed by evolutionary history. This method is objective and avoids the pitfalls of classifying based solely on perceived similarity or disparity.

Godfrey-Smith also touches upon the debate between monists and pluralists in classification:

- **Monists** argue for a more objective approach to classification, emphasizing the need for a principled method that reflects real groupings as determined by evolutionary history.

- **Pluralists** recognize the legitimacy of multiple classifying schemes, each with its own explanatory role and utility in different contexts.

The lecture highlights that classification in biology is not simply a matter of imposing personal views but involves complex philosophical considerations. The cladistic approach, while dominant, does not encompass all aspects of what constitutes a 'real group.' The discussion also connects to the broader philosophical issues of realism and the nature of scientific practice.

In the next lecture, Godfrey-Smith will explore the philosophy of psychology, which deals with questions about the mind, mental states, and how they relate to physical processes in the brain.

1. **Folk Psychology as a Theoretical Construct**: Folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is a set of theories about human behavior that predate scientific psychology. It uses concepts like beliefs, desires, and intentions to explain and predict behavior. These ideas are part of our everyday understanding of the world and ourselves.

2. **Criteria for Good Scientific Theories**: A good scientific theory should be bold, falsifiable, and have some degree of explanatory and predictive success. It should not be judged by unduly harsh standards, especially considering that many areas of psychology are still developing.

3. **Successes of Folk Psychology**: While neuroscience may not yet fully explain human behavior in terms of brain processes, folk psychological concepts have been successfully applied in various fields such as history, economics, anthropology, and sociology. These fields often implicitly rely on folk psychological explanations.

4. **Compatibility with Neuroscience**: The apparent mismatch between neuroscientific explanations and folk psychology does not necessarily mean incompatibility. Psychology as a science is young, and we have much to learn about how the brain gives rise to mental states.

5. **Instrumental Interpretation of Folk Psychology**: Philosophers like Daniel Dennett suggest that we may adopt an instrumental stance towards folk psychology, treating it as a useful fiction for making predictions and explaining behavior without necessarily asserting its literal truth.

6. **Folk Psychology as Placeholders**: On this view, beliefs, desires, and other psychological categories function as placeholders or calculating devices in our attempts to understand complex systems, including other humans. They are not necessarily claims about unobservable reality but serve as tools for dealing with observable phenomena.

7. **Ontological Seriousness of Folk Psychology**: Even if the exact status of beliefs and desires is uncertain, they can still be taken seriously as part of our psychological theory because they appear to have explanatory and predictive power.

8. **Conclusion**: The sense we have of ourselves is influenced by the scientific theories we accept. Folk psychology, whether or not it fits neatly with neuroscience, has a role in our understanding of human behavior and may continue to be a legitimate part of psychological explanation despite its unscientific origins.

In summary, folk psychology is a complex topic that intersects with the philosophy of mind and the practice of scientific psychology. Its legitimacy does not depend solely on its compatibility with neuroscience but can also be justified instrumentally and through its practical utility in understanding behavior across various disciplines.

1. The lecture addresses the tension between realist and constructivist views of science, highlighting how this tension led to the "science wars" in the 1990s. It emphasizes the importance of finding a balanced view that acknowledges both the objective aspects of science and its constructed nature.

2. The lecture outlines various theories of evidence, including Kuhn's notion of normal science, which shows how consensus is reached within scientific communities while still allowing for a form of objectivity to emerge from subjective human elements.

3. The discussion on probability in statistics illustrates the objective aspects of scientific inquiry, where certainty is rarely absolute but decisions can be made based on the best available evidence.
