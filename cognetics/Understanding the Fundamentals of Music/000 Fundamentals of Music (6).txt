Lecture 6, Meter Part 2
Welcome back.
This is Lecture 6 and it is entitled Meter Part 2.
Metric Consistency.
In what we call the music of the common practice period, from roughly 1600 to 1900, spanning
the Baroque, Classical and Romantic eras, the meter of a particular movement will tend
to stay the same from the beginning to the end.
Now yes, there are exceptions, but for the most part, once a meter is established at
the beginning of a movement, it will continue until the end of the movement.
All such metric bets are off in the 20th and 21st centuries, during which changing
meter, sometimes changing in every measure, becomes as common as changing pitch.
Syncopation.
The most basic and common manner by which a composer can manipulate our sense of beat
and meter is through a technique called syncopation.
A syncopation is an accent where we do not expect an accent.
Syncopation can take two forms.
One, it can be an accent or series of un-patterned accents used to create a sense of rhythmic
interest, ambiguity and or tension.
Two, a composer might employ a pattern of syncopations that in effect momentarily change
the meter during a given passage of music.
I'll demonstrate these two basic types of syncopation one at a time.
First, an accent or series of un-patterned accents used to create a sense of rhythmic
interest, ambiguity and or tension.
As our first example of such a syncopation, we turn to the third movement of Beethoven's
string quartet in C minor, Op. 18 No. 4 of 1799.
The movement is labeled as being a minuet and as we would expect, it is set in triple
meter.
But contrary to our expectations, Beethoven proceeds to accent to almost obsessively accent.
Beat three instead of beat one.
Question.
Why the syncopations?
Answer.
To create conflict, ambiguity and sheer musical excitement in what was for Beethoven an increasingly
obsolescent musical genre, the minuet.
Let's hear the opening of the movement and I will count it.

The musical genre of ragtime depends entirely on syncopation to create its characteristic sound.
Ragtime is a piano music developed by African American musicians at the end of the 19th
century.
Like the spiritual, blues, jazz and rock and roll, ragtime is a composite music, a synthesis,
a musical wedding of vastly different elements, some Western European and some West African
in origin.
In the case of ragtime, the Western European element is the marching band of music that
was so fabulously popular in the United States around the turn of the 20th century, of which
the marches of John Philip Sousa are the preeminent examples.
The West African element of ragtime is its rhythmic profile.
You see in ragtime, the complex poly or multiple rhythmic layers of West African drumming are
transferred to the piano with a march-like on-the-beat accompaniment supporting off-the-beat
syncopated music above.
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to listen to the opening of Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag of 1899.
Initially, we're just going to find and then clap to the beat.
It's a rock-solid, duple meter march-beat.
Once we've found the march groove and it's about as tough to find as a wooly mammoth
in your boudoir, I will ask you to continue clapping that march-beat along with the pianist's
left hand while I scat sing the accents, the syncopations being played by the pianist's
right hand.
What we will discover is that those accents don't quite line up with the march-beat.
They will be either slightly ahead or behind, and the rhythmic tension created by these
two different rhythmic layers is the essence of what ragtime is all about.
It's also, my friends, the essence of what jazz is all about, although jazzers will not
call that rhythmic tension ragging the beat, but rather swinging the beat.
Here we go.
Let's first find the beat, and then I'll sing the syncopations.
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop.
Excellent.
We observed that syncopation can take two forms.
We've just demonstrated the first, an accent or series of unpatterned accents on moments
other than the downbeat. The second form is a pattern of syncopations that in effect momentarily
change the meter of a given passage of music. For example, let's say we're in triple meter.
We expect an accent on one of every group of three. One, two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, three, one, two, three. Now, let's say that for a number of consecutive measures,
a composer accents every other beat instead of every third beat. One, two, three, one,
two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. By syncopating
every other beat, a composer will have de facto momentarily change the meter from triple to
duple because we're hearing an accent every second rather than every third beat. Again,
let me count four measures of regular triple and then I will syncopate every other beat.
One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two,
three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. Such a rhythmic event is called
a hemiola, one of the nastiest sounding words in the entire musical lexicon, hemiola. A
hemiola is a pattern of syncopations that creates the momentary impression of a change
of meter. For example, the first theme of the first movement of Beethoven's Symphony
number three, the Eroica. The movement is in triple meter and so begins the opening theme
until about halfway through that theme when suddenly it goes rhythmically haywire. As
a pattern of syncopations, a hemiola, momentarily appears to shift the meter to duple before
correcting itself and shifting back to triple for the conclusion of the theme. I'll count
it, you listen.
This rhythmic ambiguity, this hemiola, returns with a vengeance at the climactic moment of
the movement, during which huge dissonances are pounded out in hemiolas. This is music
of utter negation. Because of the dissonances, we sense no key area, and because of the hemiolas,
we sense no consistent meter. This is as brutal as Beethoven's musical language will allow
him to be, and even today, this passage shocks. I'll count it, you listen.
One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one two, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two,
three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two,
three, two, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, one.
Beethoven was one of the most rhythmically inventive composers who ever lived, isolating
and manipulating rhythm in a way that was unique in his time.
I would suggest that one of the reasons why Beethoven's music remains so modern and edgy
and viscerally powerful for us today is his rhythmic audacity, his manipulation of our
sense of time, which is frankly very 21st century.
Compound Meter A compound meter is any meter that features
a triple subdivision within each beat.
I will explain with a musical example.
We're going to hear the fourth and final movement of Johannes Brahms' absolutely spectacular
trio for violin, piano and horn of 1865.
Everything would seem to be moving by in groups of three, so I will count the piece
as if it were in triple meter.

Davis Jr. or Gregory Hines Reincarnate, those beats grouped in threes are simply too fast
to be considered the primary beats in this music.
So we move up to the next rhythmic level.
We hear each three-note grouping, or triplet, as constituting a single beat.
Let's listen to that excerpt again, and I'll clap that slower beat.
Feel free to clap along.
Now that's still pretty fast, but we can move to that beat, which is the primary beat,
And lo and behold, that primary beat is being grouped in twos.
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.
So, what have we got here?
We have a meter in which the primary beats are subdivided into very fast groups of three.
We call such a meter a compound meter because it is a composite of two different rhythmic levels,
a primary beat that is subdivided into a fast group of three.
This particular meter is called compound duple meter because the primary beat is in duple.
1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
For another example of compound duple we turn to the opening of the third and final
1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3...
One, two, three, one, two, three, two, three.
Is most usually notated as a time signature of six over eight as what's called 6a time,
meaning that there are two fast groups of three or six eighth notes in every metric unit.
Musicians know when they see a time signature of six eight to beat the music in compound
duple meter.
One more example of compound duple meter, the first theme of the first movement of Beethoven's
symphony number seven of 1812 one two three two two three one two three two two three one
one two three two two three one two three two three two three.
Now there is also such a meter as compound triple in which again each of the primary
beats is subdivided into a fast group of 3.
As an example of compound triple meter, let's hear Johann Sebastian Bach's two-part invention
in G major of 1723, and we'll count it this way.
1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3
2, 3, 1 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
There's an important point to be made regarding compound meter.
Any meter perceived as being a compound meter will be, by definition, fast in tempo.
Now my friends, why should that be?
Usually tempo and meter have nothing to do with each other.
Tempo refers to the speed of the beat, and the meter refers to how the beats are grouped,
which are two entirely different things.
It's true, except when it comes to compound meter.
Let's go back to the Bach invention in G major, set in compound triple meter.
As you recall, it began this way.
We perceive this as compound meter, because the triplet subdivisions of the beat are too
fast to feel as the primary beats, but what would happen if we slowed this music down
more and more?
Well sooner or later, my friends, will cross a threshold.
Sooner or later, those formerly fast subdivisions of three will begin to feel like the primary
beats, and that's why I did that terrible thing and turned the end of that last excerpt
into a waltz.
If we go slowly enough, one measure of compound triple meter will eventually sound like three
measures of regular triple meter.
Thus, for us to properly perceive a meter as being compound, the tempo must be fast
enough that the triplet subdivisions will be perceived as subdivisions and not as the
primary beats.
Conversely, let's say a composer notates a movement in triple meter, assigning a time
signature of three-quarter time, and then that same composer turns around and marks the movement
molto vivace, very lively, meaning very fast, just as Beethoven does in the second movement
of his Symphony No. 9 of 1824.
Does this sound like triple meter? Well, according to the notated time signature, it is. But
as listeners, we do not perceive it as being triple meter. At this tempo, the individual
beats are simply too fast to consider as being the primary beat, and I would tell you
that conductors do not conduct this movement in three, but rather in one.
There is no term for a meter like this. For our information, there is no such term as
compound single. We'll just have to stick with triple meter that's so fast that we feel
it and conduct it in one and leave it at that.
By this point of our three lecture survey of beat and meter, we should be feeling fairly
confident about our ability to identify duple and triple meter. So, in the spirit of, let's
identify one more, I present to you the second movement of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6
of 1893. My friends, find the beat, feel around for accentuation, and determine whether the
beats are groupings of two or three.
Hmm, that music's got the lilt and the feel of a waltz, yes? So, it must be in triple
meter, yes? Well, let's count it in three. One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two,
three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two,
three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two,
three. Now, that didn't work at all. Is it a compound meter, you ask? No. Is it filled
with syncopations and hemiolas? No. Then what the heck is going on? My friends, it's
an additive meter, which is some combination of twos and threes. As it is, the meter of
Tchaikovsky's movement is a five, arrayed as a three, plus a two. Count with me.
One, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one,
two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two,
one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, four, five. one, two, three, four, five, one, two,
three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four five, one, two, three,
four, five, one, two, three, four, five. Now doesn't that feel better? No wonder the
movement has been referred to as the five-legged waltz. It sounds like a waltz. It feels like
a waltz, but it's missing a beat every other measure. Hey, who says Pete Tchaikovsky didn't
have a sense of humor?
While additive meter is common in any number of Eastern European folk traditions, until
the 20th century, it was very rarely used in Western European music. What this means
is that when we do hear additive meter in pre-20th century concert music, it will almost
always be in works by Eastern European composers like Tchaikovsky.
Another example. Modest Mazorksky begins his magnificent pictures at an exhibition of 1874
with a movement entitled Promenade. The Promenade begins with a fanfare that consists of four
metric units of 11 beats each, spelled out in the score as a 5 plus a 6. Let's listen
to this opening and let's count to 11 four times.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
The Promenade music we just heard returns periodically representing, as it does, our
Promenade, our stroll through an exhibition of drawings, designs, sketches and watercolors
by Mazorksky's friend, the architect, Viktor Alexandrovich Hartmann. In an appearance
about halfway through the piece, the additive meter that characterized the opening of the
first Promenade goes into hyperdrive as Mazorksky mixes and matches a whole bunch of
different meters. Here's what happens. This Promenade, like the first one, begins with
four units of 11, each spelled out as a 5 plus a 6. Then there are two units of 6 followed
by an 11, a 6, another 11, two 6's, then two 7's, and finally three more 11's. You
got that? 11 plus 11 plus 11 plus 11 plus 6, 6 plus 11 plus 6 plus 11, 6, 6, 7, 7,
11, 11, 11. I'll count, you listen. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. One,
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three,
four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. One,
two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
One, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven. One
Sidebar, metric asymmetry.
Mzorkski indicates that the promenade movements in pictures at an exhibition, including the
one we just heard, be played allegro giusto nel modo russico, which means moderately
fast and in Russian style.
We ask rightly, what does Mzorkski mean by Russian style?
It's the rhythm, my friends, the additive meters as well as the rhythmic asymmetry created
by all the different meters.
It's a sort of asymmetry that's characteristic of the Russian language and Russian folk music,
and it's a sort of rhythmic asymmetry that the Russian-born Igor Stravinsky will cultivate
to extremes during the course of his long career.
We turn as an example to Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring of 1912 for a perfect example
of metric asymmetry gone wild.
At the conclusion of an episode called The Game of the Abduction, we hear this dizzying
succession of different meters.
1-2-3, 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6,
1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6,
1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-1-2, let's hear it.
I know you want to hear that again, so indeed let's hear that again.
This is incredibly exciting music in which the excitement is almost entirely a function
of the unpredictable nature of its metric asymmetry.
Back to Additive Meter.
Now, play it.
This is incredibly exciting music in which the excitement is almost entirely a function
of the unpredictable nature of its metric asymmetry.
Back to Additive Meter.
Now, please, let's not confuse Additive Meter with metric asymmetry.
A passage of music characterized by metric asymmetry, as we just observed in Stravinsky's
The Right of Spring, exhibits no particular repeated metric pattern, as opposed to Additive
Meter, like Duple and Triple.
An Additive Meter is one made up of some combination of twos and threes.
As we observed earlier, in the 19th century, Additive Meter, on those rare occasions when
it was used at all, was generally the province of Eastern European composers.
Having said that, all bets are off when it comes to the 20th and 21st centuries, during
which Additive and Asymmetrical Meter became part of the common syntax of western music.
Of all the experiments with Additive Meter in the music of the 20th century, no composers
dedicated more of their creative energies to creating a body of music employing Additive
Meter than did the pianist Dave Brubeck and the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond.
An easy confession, my friends.
Growing up, I worshipped the Dave Brubeck quartet in both of its permutations, its first
permutation with Paul Desmond on alto sax and in its second with Jerry Mulligan on baritone sax.
Brubeck himself has always been, for me, a musical hero.
A first-rate pianist and a superb composer who has created what I believe will be a lasting
body of first-rate work from his jazz numbers and songs to his concert works and oratorios.
I had the privilege of participating in a performance of Brubeck's oratorio The Gates of Justice
when I was in high school in 1971, and it was a life-altering experience for me.
And I will tell you that never will you meet a nicer, more generous, more good-spirited man
than Dave Brubeck.
Anyway, Brubeck and his quartet recorded five concept albums between 1959 and 1966 entitled
Time Out, Time Further Out, Time Changes, Countdown, Time and Outer Space, and Time In.
The avowed mission of these albums was to break the tyranny of duple meter and create a body of jazz
in triple meter, additive meter, and multiple simultaneous meters.
The most famous individual piece from this period of metric experimentation is Take Five,
written by Paul Desmond.
As I'm sure you've already guessed, if you didn't already know, Take Five is in five,
with the beats arrayed as a three plus two.
One, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, and so forth.
The movie and television composer Lalo Schifrin took a page from Desmond's Take Five
when he composed his Mission Impossible theme in 1966, which is also in five
and also breaks down to a three plus two.
One, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two.
We're going to conclude this lecture with a piece by Dave Brubeck, the rather painfully titled
Blue Rondo Alaturk of 1959.
The piece is neither a rondo nor terribly blue, as in blues-like,
though Brubeck claims that the additive rhythms he employs were inspired by folk music he heard on tour in Turkey.
Whatever, it's a great piece, and here's how it works.
The theme itself is set in nine, which is subdivided in two different ways.
The first subdivision of those nine beats is one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three.
All right, what have we got here? We have three sets of two and one set of three, all of which adds up to nine.
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three.
Say it with me three times in succession. Ready? Here we go.
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three.
Excellent.
I'll play the first three measures of the piece slowly, and we'll hear how the subdivisions of one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three lay out in those measures.
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three.
And now, the interesting part.
Every fourth measure, every fourth metric unit.
Reubeck changes the way he subdivides the nine beats going from one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, two, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.
So here's the metric pattern that will repeat itself every four measures.
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.
Let's all do that together.
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 1, 2, 3
One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, one, two
Once two, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three
Now I would point out the tempo of this piece is rather fast, and as such, Rubek's subdivisions
can also be felt at a higher rhythmic level.
The groups of two can be felt as a single short beat
and the groups of three as a single long beat.
Let me show you what I mean
and I'm gonna clap on the ones.
One two, one two, one two, one two three,
one two, one two, one two, one two three,
one two, one two, one two three,
one two three, one two three, one two three,
short short short long,
short short short long,
short short short long, long long long.
However we choose to count it,
Brubeck is saving his best rhythmic trick for last.
One minute and 52 seconds into the recording,
the music begins alternating back and forth
between one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three,
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three,
and straight swinging duple meter,
in which the beats are the same length
as the long one, two, three.
Here's what it will sound like.
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three,
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three,
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three,
one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, three, four, two, one, two, three, four.
After alternating back and forth four times,
the meter finally settles into the jazzy,
duple groove and the musicians proceed
to take their solos.
Let's listen from the beginning.
At first I'll count the fast beats,
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three,
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three,
and so forth.
Then I'll identify the larger beats
by speaking short, short, short, long,
then I'll zip it until the meter begins to alternate
between additive and duple,
which time I'll start counting again.
Here we go.

Concluding review, the smallest time division in a given section of music to which we can
comfortably move our bodies is called the beat or the pulse. The speed at which the
beat or pulse moves is called the tempo. Most music, certainly the overwhelming majority
of music composed between 1600 and 1900, will exhibit a pattern of accentuation that will
allow the listener to identify patterns of beats called meter. Meter refers to how
beats are grouped in a given section of music. Thank you.
Thank you.
