Lecture 29, A Newtonian Science of the Mind, John Locke on Human Understanding.
It's entirely fitting, if not inevitable, that the age of Newton would also host the
first Newtonian philosophy of mind, the first Newtonian psychology.
And credit for that, I think, quite properly goes to John Locke, who was a younger contemporary
of Newton's and a friend of Newton's.
John Locke, of course, is one of the most influential philosophers in modern history.
He was trained as a physician.
He was one of the few people during the early decades of the Royal Society to be elected
fellow of the Royal Society, chiefly on the basis of contributions of a philosophical
nature rather than an experimental or scientific nature.
But Locke was committed to a scientific approach to the mind and society, and in his essay
on the human understanding makes quite clear that progress in an area like this must be
slow at first.
He says in an age that includes the great Newton and Hoigens and Christopher Wren and
alike, it's sufficient for someone like himself to work as an under laborer and sort of clear
a path so that the future will be able to make much greater progress.
But progress will be made only when we adopt the methods and perspectives characteristic
of Newtonian science.
So Locke becomes a central figure in that part of the history of philosophy, sometimes
dubbed British empiricism.
We can say that it begins with it sort of signaled with Francis Bacon's Nova Morganum
and it will feature centrally John Locke and George Barclay, David Hume, John Stuart Milth
and other lesser known but also quite influential philosophers.
Now to say that Locke had committed himself to a Newtonian approach to the issue of mind
and the human understanding requires us to rehearse for a moment what that approach is
all about.
First of course Newton famously idealizes complex phenomena that is he develops a simple
model in which only one or two variables are operating to see how the phenomenon comes
out in the ideal case and then he will try to approximate ever more closely to the actual
physical situation through observation and experiment.
The other feature of Newtonian science is its ontology that is to say Newton begins
with the assumption that the ultimate constituents of reality are obviously not in the visible
palpable form presented to the senses but some more elementary and indeed some ultimately
atomic form that the ultimate constituents of reality are to use the Newtonian terms
corpuscles and corpuscular.
It itself is a phenomenon made up of invisibly small corpuscles and matter in any form that
it takes is ultimately at least in principle reducible to some more fundamental and atomic
or corpuscular ontology.
It's not unlike Gassendi's revival of the atomism of Democritus.
This is a feature of 17th century scientific thought whether in Galileo or in Newton or
in Gassendi namely that complex phenomena are to be reduced at least in theory to more
elementary components and at the elementary level you see how things are going and then
you pull these together in order to recreate reality.
If you can recreate it from its fundaments or its elementary composition then of course
you understand it.
What it means to understand a phenomenon is to break it up into its components, determine
the laws that hold these components together and there you have it.
So Locke's approach is going to be very much along those lines.
It's going to be patterned on the science of Newton indeed we might say on the science
of Newton and Bacon.
Well what are the most elementary ingredients of the human understanding asks Locke.
In fact the central question that the essay begins with is profoundly influential essay
on the human understanding which appears in 1690 the animating question is how does
the mind come to be furnished?
How do we have anything in our mind at all and what is it that's in there?
Let's understand what he's not going to accept.
He's not going to accept some Cartesian notion of innate ideas.
He doesn't mention Descartes by name when he attacks the theory of innate ideas and
indeed I don't think Locke did spend some time abroad and read what Descartes had written.
We're fairly confident that he certainly came across not only Descartes' major works
but probably Descartes' explicit repudiation of a form of the theory of innate ideas that
Regius and others had attributed to him.
Locke doesn't mention Descartes and a group of philosophers at Cambridge called the Cambridge
Platonists had already begun to restore to respectability intuitive modes of knowledge
forms of knowing that are based on reason as such do not require the exercise of the
senses in any case couldn't be verified or vindicated by any possible experience etc.
So Locke certainly had a group closer to home in mind when he takes out against a nativist
or a nativist theory of the unknown.
Locke is prepared to accept that there are what he calls certain quote original acts
of the mind.
There are some things that we obviously do not need experience for and indeed would have
to be present for there to be any kind of rational or mental life at all.
An example of this is the law of contradiction a thing cannot simultaneously be and not be.
Well this is some basic logical feature of all thought and Locke is not at pains to establish
that this comes about by learning and the like.
But when it comes to the facts of the external world the matter is entirely different.
Locke says look there are really three modes of knowing available to us.
There are some things we know immediately and certainly on first examination.
I just illustrated that with the law of contradiction.
Not only do you know that a thing cannot simultaneously be and not be but you know it immediately
and you know that it is a certain truth.
It's not probable.
It's not something that might vary over time and from culture to culture.
So this he says might qualify as a mode of knowing that we can call intuitive.
There are certain intuitive acts of the mind or characteristics of thought as such that
yield certain knowledge indubitable knowledge and immediately.
Well actually there are other things that can be known to be true certainly true true
in all contexts and in all circumstances.
For example the axiomatic productions of some formal system like geometry.
Now the difference between geometry and intuitive knowledge is that geometric proofs indeed
have to be proven.
They are proven through a series of formal arguments those formal arguments filling out
what we call Euclid's geometry.
Now when you reach a conclusion in the science of geometry or in abstract mathematics you
recognize that the truth of the conclusion is necessary that has that property.
But look you've had to go through an argumentative chain to reach that point.
Now Locke says that's an instance not of intuitive knowledge but of what he calls demonstrative
knowledge.
You know this by demonstration in the older Aristotelian sense of demonstration being
a form of argument that successfully leads to a certain conclusion.
But with this aside with the formalities and abstractions of mathematics to one side and
with certain basic logical modes in place for there to be mental life at all then we
can ask the question how comes the mind to be furnished and Locke says I answer that in
a word from experience that is anything we ever will correctly say about the external
world about ourselves about our own mental life will finally be tied to that mode of
knowledge that is referred to as the perceptive mode of knowing not intuitive not demonstrative
but something that you acquire in the course of a lifetime of experience and absent the
relevant experiences these are things you couldn't possibly know.
But of course if we examine for a moment what we do know what we do know generally is of
a very complicated sort just think of demonstration in mathematics itself just think of a knowledge
of a lectern or a camera or lenses or the state politics law and the like now how does
one approach the vastness and complexity and incredible interconnectedness and subtlety
that is the human understanding well obviously it doesn't begin that way de novo this isn't
something the infant comes into the world knowing so what we take to be the complex
understandings we have must be accumulated over the course of a lifetime where does all
this begin will lock true to his empiricistic credentials says of course it all begins
with sensation the most elementary act predating anything that's going to constitute the complex
contents of the human understanding the most elementary act is the sensory act and indeed
the most elementary contents of the mind are sensations what enters the mind first enters
there by way of the senses that is all of the facts of the external world present themselves
must present themselves by way of those sensory channels that are uniquely equipped to pick
up information in the external world lock as a trained physician knowledgeable in biology
knows enough in the late 17th century to know that this this this is how the thing works
absent the senses you you you would not have any knowledge about what that in the essay
he he rehearses the famous mollino problem the irish philosopher and scientist mollino
had raised the question he and lock were correspondence had raised the question whether a man who
was born blind blind and subsequently as a result of surgery acquired sight would be
able to recognize visually what he had long learned how to recognize tactually that is
a blind person who can feel around the edges of a of a rectangle or any other regular object
such that that he would always be able to recognize it as a square or a rectangle or
a circle now has some cataract removed that was present at birth he had never had any kind of
patterned vision at all and the question is would he be able to look at objects in the
external world and identify the ones that were squares triangles and the like lock answers
the mollino problem as you might expect an empiricist to answer that challenge he says
that on gaining sight such a being could have no appreciation of scarlet or green lock lock
translating this into the knowledge of colors that that a person born blind and at a later time
in life coming to have sight for the first time would would be a babe in the woods that there
wouldn't be anything he could know by way of some other sense modality that would give him direct
knowledge now about the elements of this sense modality so lock here is is providing a kind of
camera model of visual experience and the ideas that we can form about the visual world are an
extricably bound up with the basic visual sensations that are mediated by the optical
and and physiological organs of visual perception
now these elementary sensations of course have to be pulled together because if if I see something
before me which I'm prepared to call let's say a lectern it has a combination of properties
constitutive of lecterns and in the particular case of the lectern on which today's notes rest
first it's solid it has a certain shape it has a nearly square shape it's a bit rounded at the
top it has a certain color to it if I feel that it even has a a temperature to it it's a little
bit cooler than room temperature I think almost anything is cooler than this room temperature
it has a solidity and a mass and a like so so it it can be made to stimulate my auditory system
it does stimulate my visual system it does provide information that is tangible and available to my
tactile sensitivity or tactile sensors and indeed I suppose at some level it probably would have a
recognizable odor and if I started chewing on the edge of it I would say it has a recognizable
taste and so forth if I were a druid priest I might even worship it now these quite complex
features are not themselves elementary sensations so how do they come about well they come about
in the course of experience as elementary sensations that come to be joined together they come to be
held together think of the elementary sensations as the corpuscular elements of a Newtonian mental
realm now that is elementary sensations are going to relate to mind as such the way corpuscles
relate to physical reality now we all know what holds the corpuscular components of external
reality together Newton has worked that out famously what holds the corpuscles together in the physical
world are gravitational forces so there must be something akin to gravitational forces holding
elementary sensations together Locke does not engage in a systematic disquisition on this though
though he's he's quite alert to what the the principles are they're as old as Aristotle if
not older it's going to be later as we'll see in David Hume that that this this aspect of things is
examined in in great detail in depth but Locke is satisfied that the principle of association
is the principle you need to do the work of gravity sensations are held together by an
essentially associative process those events which we experience together frequently come to be
associated together it's a virtual characteristic of of mental dynamics or mental life that where
two events are joined together in our experiences each of them comes to be associated with the other
so out of these elementary sensations we are able to form by an associative process what Locke
refers to as simple ideas and of course out of a congruence of simple ideas we are able to form
ever more complex ideas again it is by way of an associative process or binding forces in the
understanding that the understanding comes to be furnished with ever more complex ideas well this
is all all very interesting the question then is the extent to which the ideas that we have faithfully
mirror what in fact is in the external world this of course is has been a fundamental aspect of the
problem of knowledge since the presocratics can we trust the senses how how good are they at
reporting and recording and faithfully representing the the facts of the external world now on this
matter Locke's approach to the problem of knowledge finds him adopting what might be called a dualistic
kind of of epistemology he's he's a realist when it comes to certain attributes that we perceive in
the external world and and the faithfulness with which we recover and and and and and and have a
realistic representation of these things and he's much more what might be called a phenomenalist
when it comes to other properties in the external world for example using the lectern again as an
illustration the lectern physically is made up of matter that is that whose atomic structure
whose corpuscular structure is sufficiently dense as to give the lectern hardness now i can actually
feel that hardness which is to say that the sensation i have by way of touch actually is
picking up the physical property that corresponds to the sensation itself i feel it as hard and
indeed it is hard which is to say what whatever in the physics so to speak is creating hardness
is also being picked up by the relevant sensory system that is to say in this case
i am able to detect report record and know what Locke refers to as the primary quality of the
thing one of the primary qualities of course is hardness it's what is there actually another of
the primary qualities of an object in the external world is its extension i feel this to be
square or square like and in fact it is so i have a direct knowledge so to speak of the
primary qualities of things when it comes to extension and hardness mass
now what about the color of the things suppose i say well this looks to me sort of tanish it looks
to me sort of oak like there's some kind of oak veneer on on top of this goodness knows what
sort of composite material is underneath but this is an oak veneer now are we to assume
that at the corpuscular or atomic or today we might say at the quantum level we're dealing with
little quanta that have oak colorations or that if i see a blue dress or a blue suit that the
ultimate constituents the the ultimate atomic or subatomic or quantum structure of that dress
or that jacket is invisibly tiny things that are blue or that are yellow well obviously not
what's happening here is something in the physics of the situation is interacting with something
unique to my physiology in order to create the experience of color it's not that the color
itself is in the ultimate physical constituent of the thing but something is in the ultimate
physical constituent of the thing that is capable of exciting that experience in a
recipient made up composed in a certain way color then stands in locks theory of the understanding
as a secondary quality now note it's not a chimera it's not some kind of hallucination
there is a bona fide physical physiological relationship between a specific property
in the material world and the sensation that it reliably excites in all normal visual systems
the difference between a primary and secondary quality is that the primary quality is not
only in the object but it is in the experience itself whereas the secondary quality though
produced by something in the object itself is not in that form in the object itself now i
dilate on this point because it it does leave room for a certain skepticism about our knowledge
claims it it is an invitation to what will be much more fully developed later in philosophy it's
an invitation to the view that there are features of the external world which because they are
mediated by by organs of perception and sensation can never be known as in fact they really are
they can only be known in this sort of mediated psychological way enter a home as we shall see
in in a later lecture but i say that's that's already in place in locks philosophy well if
everything that we know about the factual world is based on experience then we can start raising some
of those good old metaphysical questions that kept the scholastics awake at night and to some extent
plague the sleep of one or more of the ancients and indeed on a certain reading of cogito ergo sum
were inclined to think it might have plagued Descartes himself i hope i've made clear that the
cogito argument is not a vain attempt or or or indeed successful attempt on the part of
rené Descartes to establish that he really existed that the ambition was rather different from that
but personal identity what's the basis upon which i come to know myself as the as the entity i am
how how do i have this continuing personal identity i'll be all too brief here this is a
vast and vexing subject of great intrigue and and no small amount of amusement it it has ancient
foundations as it's sometimes featured in ancient scholarship in the form of the ship of theses you
know after theses got out of the labyrinth and did so much to found Athens as it would be known and
love there'd be annual celebrations of the the achievement of theses and the ship of theses
would go from port to port in the Hellenic world and of course over a course of many years just
about every plank in the ship of theses would be replaced by another plank so that a hundred years
later that the question naturally could be raised is this the ship of theses it has some sort of
continuing identity but it but but none of the parts remains the same over a course of time well
similarly with the human body lock didn't know this but he surely could have guessed at it he the
cellular structure of the human body is a dynamic sort of thing and there is no cell in the body
that was that was a present at birth well you might say some of the neurons were present at birth
but they they've all changed they change constantly they're changing even as we meet today
how is it that i can have this continuing personal identity well lock regarded our personal identity
is the gift of experience and it's the fact that we have memories that uh that are present in
consciousness and are held together within the understanding that constitutes our continuing
personal identity such that the self is nothing but this constellation of memories this constellation
of events in consciousness which for all practical purposes just are the memories that we have and
lock even illustrates this point by raising the the example the metaphor of uh of the peasant and the
prince now suppose the peasant and the prince both go to sleep there's the peasant out there in the
forest under the tree dozing off goes into a deep sleep there's the prince in his castle with his
silken sheets and hot toddy and all that and he goes to sleep and somehow magically and mysteriously
in the course of the night all of the contents of the present peasant's consciousness are transferred
to the princes and vice versa now lock raises the question on they're getting up the next morning
what do we have lock says i regarding the peasant or the prince i do not deny that he is the same
man but he is not the same person lock's point being that the person you are just is this constellation
of experience driven and experience given memories and you do see here i don't want to make the
the leap to lock's political writings uh improbable not to mention dangerous but i say you do see here
a philosophy of experience that's going to account for class and caste largely in terms of the external
arrangements one finds in one's world and that had these arrangements been different had there been
a more nurturing a more liberating a more liberal set of options then indeed the distance between
peasant and prince would not be nearly as great as we ordinarily find it lock on tolerance lock on the
fundamental rights of life liberty and property is is very much the lock who who has argued that our
very being our very personal identity is bound up with these events in the external world that
constitute that reservoir of memories by which we come to know who we are and by which others come
to know who we are so that on property for example lock lock will argue that the fundamental right
to property arises from this fact when a person's labors have been so inextricably bound up with
himself and his life that the objects produced by that labor are veritable extensions of himself
any tendency to appropriate property of that kind or lay claim to the property of another
is violating not just a property right but violating one of the grounds on which we recognize
ourselves to be the persons that we are so i say a political program of an essentially
liberal nature is going to grow out of an empiricistic psychology that that understands
the great great differences between and among persons chiefly in experiential terms well you
know one of the functions of philosophy i think is not only to enlighten and indeed to confuse but
i think one of the unintended functions of of philosophy is also to amuse and lock in this
in in this theory of personal identity proved to be a source of great amusement to a collection
of wits who are contemporaries of his they come down to us known as the scriblarians i don't know
that students learn too much about the scriblarians anymore these these were chaps who thought that
their their specific mission in life their identifying function was to take the celebrations
of these philosophers and scientists and expose them for what they were worth which was very often
very little indeed they came to be known as the scriblarians after a character of of arbeth
knots arbeth not being one of the scriblarians a character of arbeth knots called dr. scriblairs
if you haven't heard of the scriblarians generically you've certainly heard of one of them one of
them was jonathan swift and of course gulliver's travels is a side swipe at at the royal society
and its scientific pretensions you'll recall in gulliver's travels the land of lapata which is
this floating island you see it's sort of anchored to the earth by ropes but it's it's floating above
the ground the place is run by scientists do the whole thing is is in the hands of a scientific
and technological elite and of course one of the things they're busy doing and they're very proud
of their achievement here is they're developing techniques for extracting sunlight from vegetation
and they've promised the the ruler they've promised the government that with a little
more funding do you see they think they can get enough of this stuff so that pretty soon the price
of it can be lowered somewhat and they'll be able to sell off sunlight cheaper than than here to
for well when the scriblarians got hold of lock on personal identity of course they obviously had
a field day are clearly the experiences that the felon has between the moment he has killed
somebody and the time he's brought before the bar of justice will now constitute him as a different
person so the one you're bringing up on charges clearly couldn't have been the one who perpetrated
the crime and by the time you execute the poor fellow he isn't even the one you found guilty
and so this can be nothing more than a rank in justice now
this i mean one can say all right very very funny but this is not honest labor the honest labor of
serious philosophy this is just a bunch of wise guys sitting around a around a round of whiskies
and having fun at the expense of someone wiser than themselves i don't want to suggest that
that's the way the scriblarian should be understood that would be like saying that
shakespeare's comedies and tragedies were invented merely for the amusement of his
contemporaries and to turn a profit at the gate no in this humor in this scandalizing of the
philosophers we see a very strong tendency to oppose what many found imminent in that philosophy
namely a skepticism a reductionist strategy that would blow us into the belief that we really
understand the world by reducing it to a to a set of indefinitely small particles
that are somehow held together by some principle we cannot observe and that if you believe that
i've got a bridge in brooklyn that i might try to sell you on the cheap so the scriblarians are
part of a community of critics late 17th century early 18th century critics who actually will be
forming the the foundation for an enlightenment wit and humor that that indeed will be much
sharper in its criticism and more pointed in its observations but lock really did put a ball in
play that that remains active even as we meet
