Lecture 36, Moral Science and the Natural World, Kant and the Moral Imperative
In the previous lecture I mentioned Kant's claiming that Hume's philosophy had awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers
and of course that was at the level of epistemology and knowledge and understanding and reason
but there was much more in Hume that awakened the whole world to dogmatic slumbers particularly at the level of morality
because Hume had made a very strong case for the proposition that our moral reasonings so to speak
are based finally on considerations of emotion and sentiment and utility
that the grounds on which we judge things to be good or bad is not on some abstract rational moral precept
but actually on the manner in which the event in question affects us sedulily and physiologically
events that arouse in us feelings of revulsion are judged to be wrong in virtue of the fact that we respond to them that way
and those events that conduce to human pleasure and happiness are on the whole judged to be morally right
and morally right for that reason that summed across all actions and possibilities
what we judge to be the morally acceptable course of action is the one that answers to the criterion of utility or general usefulness
and that the business of moral philosophy then is not to sit back in an armchair and attempt to deduce moral first principles
it's to come to grips with the natural nature of human nature and to recognize the obstacles and challenges that it faces in a complex world
and how it uses its own natural resources to frame forms of government moral propositions, moral systems and the like
now utilitarianism is a profoundly influential moral theory in the world
and I should think that its principal opponent would be the moral theory most closely identified with Kant's writings
a theory that's sometimes referred to as a deontological theory of morality
I do think it was C. D. Broad who was the first to use the term deontological
but what's characteristic of a deontological moral theory is that it asserts the validity of certain moral precepts come what may
that is an act of a certain kind is right under any and all circumstances
find the right moral precept and that moral precept is applicable in every imaginable situation
considerations of utility, sentiment, emotion and the like are entirely irrelevant
I say moral theories that are based on that kind of argument are richly indebted to Kant
and they are as philosophers call them deontological moral theories
they are explicitly and expressly opposed to utilitarian theories
to the idea that something's right because it achieves good or desirable outcomes
that something's right because in your heart you know it's right
we've had political campaigns waged on the basis of you might disagree at an intellectual level
in your heart you know so and so is right
well we're going to find room in Kant's moral philosophy for something like what you might find in your heart
but it's a moral theory that's going to depend much more on what you find in your head
now Kant comes to grips with the essential duality of human nature
Kant by the way was well educated and had a lifelong interest in the sciences
and he certainly was not at war with an essentially scientific conception of human nature
but what he did reject was the proposition that the merely natural dimensions of human life
exhaust the characteristics of our humanity
he said look properly understood human beings are of course natural beings
if you drop one out a window he falls at 32 feet per second per second
and as purely natural beings or physical material beings
human beings are subject to all of the causal laws of the physical and natural sciences
but human beings are also rational beings
and what that means is that in addition to occupying the natural realm as all physical entities do
rational beings and human beings who are rational beings occupy what Kant calls the intelligible realm
in the intelligible realm we account for events not by invoking physical causes
but by examining reasons that is to say you understand the course of action taken in the intelligible realm
by understanding the reasons that are guiding the act
now the other characteristic that is central in Kant's moral theory
the other characteristic of our human nature that is central to a theory of Kant's stripe
is our autonomy that is you could not have morality at all
except in so far as we have the freedom to do or forbear from doing certain things
if our actions were entirely determined by our physical constitution
then we could neither be praised nor blamed for them
our actions then would simply be reactions it would be like being dropped from a height
and falling with a certain acceleration
you certainly don't blame somebody for falling at 32 feet per second square
so the grounds on which we become subject to moral judgment at all are the grounds of autonomy
there must be sufficient freedom for us to be charged with wrongdoing
or praised for doing what is regarded as virtuous or worthy
autonomy is the necessary condition for there to be moral ascriptions or judgments at all
now Kant is quite direct in saying that the kind of freedom at issue here can't be proven
it would not be possible to prove that kind of freedom
it is sufficient however that freedom be thinkable
now it would take too long I think to parse those sentences in Kant
but let me try to do an all too hurried gloss on it
look what's the real difference between my thinking that I am acting freely when I do X, Y and Z
and in fact my being free to do X, Y and Z
might I be deluded or hallucinating or simply talking myself into it
from a moral point of view that wouldn't make any difference at all
it is my intentionality that constitutes the grounds on which I am going to be subject to moral judgment
and if I think in my heart of hearts that what I am doing is proceeding directly from an act of will on my part
autonomously chosen, a course of action autonomously chosen by me
that's enough to satisfy the minimum requirements for bringing moral judgment to bear on what I am doing
no we can't proceed to develop a scientific proof of freedom
what form do scientific proofs take they generally take an empirical form you present some kind of evidence
we've already left the natural realm however we are in the intelligible realm
and in the intelligible realm the arguments for freedom are going to be arguments grounded in reason
not evidence grounded in sense do you see
so what is proposed here then is that the idea of freedom is a thinkable idea
it is sufficient to get the moral ball in place so to speak
we have sufficient autonomy to have some choice in the course of action that we take
so now we can get back to the question of Hume's utilitarian or hedonistic
I shouldn't want to call Hume's theory a hedonistic theory as such
but it is a utilitarian theory and it is finally grounded in considerations of an essentially affective nature
we can get back to that question and see what sort of work Kant is prepared to do on that theory critically
well suppose I say this suppose I say it's a beastly hot day and I've been out gardening all afternoon
you can already see I speak as a member of the leisure class
I've been out gardening all day the throat's parched and the like
and there I see a nice tall glass of lemonade
I am very thirsty if I would slake this thirst necessarily I must drink that glass of lemonade
so there is a connection indeed a kind of causal connection between eliminating the thirst
and taking this glass of lemonade
now I am operating in this circumstance under a kind of imperative
if I would slake my thirst necessarily I must drink something
let's say in this case I must drink the lemonade
now Kant refers to that as a hypothetical imperative
a hypothetical imperative says if you would achieve this specific outcome
necessarily you must do that Aristotle centuries earlier of course had talked about hypothetical imperatives
that if you would achieve this necessarily you must do that
Kant is arguing is going to argue that hypothetical imperatives of this sort
are inevitably grounded in our natural being
where we are subject to the causal laws of science
that is to say hypothetical imperatives are going to be tied up with conditions of the body
with particular motives and desires that a creature would have
presumably much of the animal kingdom is guided by hypothetical imperatives of this sort
but of course all this means that I've got the capacity to have thirst
to have pain to have hunger to be overheated to be chilly in the winter
to have to put a roof over my head to get the car out of the garage etc etc etc
these are all things taking place in the realm of natural causation
these are all things that descend upon me and my life in virtue of the fact
that I am a creature of nature and that I occupy the natural
properly understood then I'm under some sort of coercive influence
when I act on the basis of these motives and impulses
the coercive press of hunger and thirst and frustration
and visceral sensations and antagonism and worry and fear and the like
I'm under the general press of the desire for pleasure
and the very very keen desire to avoid that which is painful
and in all these contexts then I'm functioning as a natural being
a kind of physical system in the realm of natural causation
moral philosophy need not apply here this is not what morality is about do you see
because in this domain sooner or later the right explanation of why I'm doing
what I'm doing is not going to be in terms of a rational and autonomous being
choosing a course of action on a ground produced by reason itself
rather it is going to be the course of action chosen by a natural kind of entity
coercively worked on by the forces of nature and responding to its own internal
physiology constitution etc etc
actions in that context really are a species of reaction
they're almost like conditioned reflexes and to the extent that deliberation is involved at all
the deliberation is for the purpose of satisfying some condition of our nature
some condition of our essentially physical and even physiological nature
now morality can't argues does not begin here
morality begins with a rational and autonomous being in the intelligible realm
which is the realm in which we are called upon to give reasons
reasons for action
that is to say if I take my hand off a hot stove no reason for that action is necessary
that's a reflex and indeed a fine and finally grained analysis of what's going on here
can be achieved merely by consulting the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system
indeed you can get that behavior with just spinal mechanisms you don't even need a brain for that
but when we move into the intelligible realm where reasons and justifications are called for
what we invariably must find is a rule or precept or principle that guides actions of a given kind
now if you find a rule or precept that is of a general nature which is to say
I can give you a reason for acting that reason itself if it is a rationally sound precept
is going to apply to all situations of that particular kind
so one of the characteristics of a moral precept is that it's universalizable
that is if it were not universalizable it would be tied to a particular condition
if it's tied to a particular condition then it's almost invariably part of a natural physical contingent realm
the contingent realm of mere happenings in the world
I did this because I was thirsty I did this because the music was too loud and the like
but when we take a look at bona fide moral cannons they are of the sort do this
you know thou shalt not kill not thou shalt not kill Tuesdays or thou shalt not kill short people
so the universalizability of a precept or maxim becomes the hallmark of moral maxims
moral maxims as reasons for acting are applicable to all situations in which generically
that given kind of action might take place
now as they are universalizable they carry with them an imperative that is not hypothetical
not if I would get across the street then or if I would slake my thirst then
no no rather these imperatives state do acts or forbear from doing acts
so it's not hypothetical it's the categorical imperative is not tied to a particular desire or impulse or motive
rather the categorical imperative asserts its own moral authority
the authority of the imperative is contained in the maxim itself
not something that it brings about not some contingent happening
not if you're a good boy you'll get chocolate it's not that at all
it is the categorical summons to a rational being who is autonomous the categorical summons to act in a certain way
and as I rehearse forms of the categorical imperative you'll see you'll be able to supply content to it
now let me pause on this matter of moral content
no lesser figure than John Stuart Mill thought that Kant's categorical imperative was a license to perform
absolutely hideous acts of a morally bankrupt nature
I'll mention something about that in a couple of minutes
but as Kant's pure categories of the understanding do not supply content
that is as the categories of quantity, quality, relation and modality
don't actually fill in the content as the pure intuitions of time and space
don't tell you what it is you're going to experience in the world
so the categorical imperative does not supply content
does not supply the actual actions that are going to be performed
rather it is the form of rationality, the form of moral thought
that legitimately can be classified as a moral imperative
you can supply the behavior in the given circumstance
well what is the categorical imperative then
that this imperative accessible only to a creature that is rational as such
you are not a moral being because you are a human being
any number of human beings can have no moral standing at all
infants are not moral beings
the profoundly retarded I should think on Kant's account
would not be moral beings
a serious defect of the nervous system could strip one of one's autonomy
and rational powers
what constitutes an entity as a moral being is rationality itself
that it inheres in human beings renders us fit for moral judgment
but you need not be a human being
that is it could be imaginable anyway
that there might be rational beings who are otherwise not human
and it is certainly a factual case that many human beings are not rational
and human beings that are not rational or are not possessive rational power
would be excluded from the domain of morality
indeed we don't hold such persons responsible for what they do
the successful insanity defense is saying in effect
that the perpetrator lacked sufficient rational power
to frame means and relationships
or to comport his behavior according to the requirements of law
and things like that
so where there are those defects and deficiencies
one is exempted from moral judgment
and this of course is quite consistent with Kant's theory
of course it would be consistent with any moral theory
the forgiveness of the insane would be consistent with any moral theory
well what then are versions of the categorical imperative
I have a friend who insists that after a glass of wine or two
it would be very difficult to recite the categorical imperative
without breaking into a smile of some sort
I should say that this is an Oxford friend
and that may explain his position on this matter
we did perform the experiment one night
and we got data supporting his general theory
of course this is the sort of experiment you'd have to replicate
any number of times and I suspect we will
well the categorical imperative
it's actually a quite summoning statement
and indeed it's the sort of statement
that will have a reflective being pausing and asking
if this really is the case
what has been the moral quality of my life and my actions
act in such a way that the maxim of your action
would be instituted as a universal law of nature
so act that the maxim of your action
not the physical details of the behavior
but that the maxim of the action
the principle that that action instantiates
would be if you could make it happen
would be instituted as a universal law of nature
you would make this principle dispositive
everywhere and for all time if you could
act in such a way so act so comport yourself
that the principle on which that action is based
if you could make it so would guide all actions
everywhere and at all times
now there's a moral law worth having
well all right let's have sort of a stock problem
the kind of problem that in philosophy 101
or ethics more likely ethics 101
or these days shall we say bioethics 605
well the ocean liner has sunk
and there is a lifeboat
the lifeboat is capable of supporting and sustaining five people
shocks unfortunately six actually made it through the sinking of the vessel
and so the question is whom shall we pitch overboard
well you know there's mother Teresa says
let me jump in you know and well we don't want to do that
it's generally not a good idea to pitch saints overboard
you're going to need them one day
they do a lot of good in the world
well there's this luckless felon who's going
who was on the way to being extradited
where it was going to be executed anyway
48 hours later why don't we throw him in
well there's a little infant who won't know any better
now once you engage in deliberations of this sort
you're already developing some kind of calculus of utility
to figure out what you should do based on
what there is to gain or lose in the process
or try this one
the terrorists have no they're not terrorists
they're right thinking decent public-spirited citizens
they're fairly convinced that the chap you've apprehended
really is this murderous rapist
now you happen to have evidence to the effect that
this chap didn't do it at all
the crowd doesn't believe it
the crowd stands outside the prison and says
you either hang this chap or we blow up
let's say the town
which has 600 people living in it
now if you're sitting there saying
well look I can kill this one innocent guy
and save 600 lives
there you are doing the calculus again
well let's say that the crowd is actually
rather more formidable than I've presented them
if you don't hang this person
we're going to blow up let's say
for argument's sake
earth
everybody everything
everything that ever could have been
will not be unless you do this
now if you think this somehow makes it easier
the decision is now easier
well we're obviously not going to kill the
innocent chap in order to save
three people
oh well kill the innocent chap to save the whole world
well this again is a kind of calculation
you know the old
was it lady astra in church
I forget
would you
oh yes sure then
would you have intimate relations with
someone you didn't love for a farthing
or the tuppence or something
you know would you do the same with someone
for a million pounds oh yes
would you do it for a tuppence
so what do you think I am and the reply of course was
well we've already established what you are
what we're doing now is haggling about the price
well quite so
with the utilitarian calculus
you certainly aren't going to kill a lot of
innocent people
if what hangs in the balance is saving a few lives
you don't want those people to die of course
but you're not going knowingly
you're not going to set out to kill the innocent
the whole village or the whole city
or the whole state or the whole world
well that's a different matter isn't it
so again what you are invoking
is a calculus of utility
a scale of utilities
the categorical imperative
specifically denies us the right to do
that
because if you are prepared to do wrong
just as long as the consequences
are acceptable
then indeed you're prepared to do wrong
and you cannot justify wrongdoing
by pointing to some other
set of outcomes that in some
sense or other might prove
to be desirable or might prove
to be even morally worthy
you can't cover up a wrongdoing
by pointing to consequences
intended consequences
that were just
that were just right
now there are other versions
of the categorical imperative
man is never
merely a means to an end
but always an end unto himself
man is never
merely a means to an end
now what is Kant getting at with this
suppose I intentionally
use another as an instrument
of my purpose
if I intentionally set out
to use another as an instrument
of my purpose then I am
formally rejecting I am
formally denying that person
the standing of a morally
autonomous being which means
I am prepared to suspend
the presumption of moral autonomy
which means I am prepared to suspend
precisely what is necessary
for there to be morality at all
well I'd only do it Thursdays
or I'd only do it under these circumstances
forget about it it means that
your position on morality
is a contingent position
I will invoke moral precepts
when they are serviceable
but if it just turns out that a week from now
it is a good idea to take
significant numbers of persons
and use them as if they were mere tools
or instruments of my purpose
well then I'll do it
now that constitutes I say
the formal rejection of the very possibility
of morality because it constitutes
your conferring on moral
autonomy an iffy contingent
status something you are
prepared to suspend or invoke
as the spirit moves you
the institution of slavery
endorsed on any version of the
categorical imperative to take
a rational autonomous being
and treat that entity as
nothing but a tool or instrument
as in Dred Scott do you see
to do that you can't
even claim the right to do it
because to claim the right to do it
is to invoke a moral precept
and in denying the moral
autonomy in denying the moral
standing of this
subject of the institution of slavery
you've lost the very
moral resources to claim
a right do you see it just can't
work it just won't do
we are not to use others
as tools or instruments
ever man is
an end unto himself
now
Kant is famous for concluding
from this I mean there are many
conclusions that arise
from this line of reasoning never lie
never lie
ever lie
never ever ever
do you like this suit
oh yes I think it's great
how do you like this
make up oh terrific
not even the little
white lie not just sort
of making each other feel a little bit better
I mean was Kant so
curmudgeonly that he is there
no elasticity in the system at all
well let's take a look at I don't want
to get to the level of the little white lie
sink to the level of the really serious lie
fraud and manipulation and the like
look what's going on there
if Smith lies to Jones
to have Jones do something that Jones
properly informed would never do
then Smith is using Jones as a tool
or an instrument of Smith's purpose
that is he is trumping
your moral autonomy by filling
your head with wrong information
so that you will do something
which in your rationally reflective
moments you would not do
in violation of the categorical imperative
alright let's have the
bioethics 605
second essay question
the SS is at the door
the stormtroopers are at the door
and you open the door
and the question is
where are the Jews hiding
there's the question
now
what does Kant say
what does a Kantian say
it's a vexing question
I think one of the best answers
to the question is a Kantian says nothing
nothing at all
of course that's one way of seeing to it
that you do not lie
now there is
there is more to it than this
it's easy to make Kant into a kind of stick figure
such that after a second glass of wine
it's hard to
reiterate the categorical imperative
without seeing something
quintessentially
north German
late 18th century
awfully formal
awfully abstract
utterly rationalistic
life is richer
more robust and
inevitably far more confusing than a system like this
is going to allow
Kant gave her series of lectures on ethics
published
as Kant's lectures on ethics
he didn't write these
lecture notes taken by students in the class
you do see a strong
element of benevolence
in here of public spiritedness
our humanity
is addressed in its own terms
I don't want to
offer this as a kind of apologia
I mean if you want to know what Kant's moral theory is
I don't think you want to look at
lecture notes taken by students in a course
that he gave in Kernigsberg
where he has gone to the trouble
of giving us major moral
excuses in which he declares these
to be his fundamental
positions
what Kant alerts us to is this
you can never justify
something morally simply on the grounds
that it makes you feel better
in this we will find morality
in the hands of the madman
the criminal, the lunatic, the debauch
it will never be sufficient
to say that the reason I
did this is because it made me
happy and it's making me happy
is the beginning, middle, and end
of the moral status of the act itself
that obviously won't work
on the question of utility
utility tends to beg the question
I'll get to this in a later lecture
but how do we know what over the long haul
is useful
so Kant is trying to save us from vulgar
forms of consequentialism
do you know what his epitaph is
Kant's epitaph is
the starry sky above him
the moral law within him
thank you
thank you
thank you
