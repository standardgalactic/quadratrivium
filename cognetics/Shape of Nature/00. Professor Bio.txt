Kelso Morrill Award for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics. In 2001, he received the Freshman
Research Seminar Award at the Ohio State University. In 2007, he was awarded the Henry L. Alder
Award, a national honor given by the Mathematical Association of America for distinguished teaching
by beginning college or university mathematics faculty member. From August to December of
2009, Professor Devadas was a research member of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute
in Berkeley, California. Professor Devadas prepared the course guidebook
that comes with these lectures. The course guidebook includes lecture guides, a glossary,
biographical notes, and a bibliography. To get the most out of this course, you may
find it useful to review these materials before or after each lecture.
