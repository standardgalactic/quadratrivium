Let's pretend that this lecture was given concurrently with the preceding lectures.
You could hear both of them at the same time.
This gets back to a problem that is generic to speech and to writing for that matter,
which is that they're both linear and reality is not linear.
It's multifaceted and lots of things happen in parallel.
The 12th century Renaissance was much more broadly based in Western European culture
than the university movement.
The university was merely one symptom of that renaissance and it's the one that I chose
to talk about first because it is the one that reverse engineering 19th century techno
science calls to mind.
But the base of the 12th century Renaissance really was the first industrial revolution
that took place in Europe and it's quite an astonishing phenomenon reflecting this explosion
of cultural dynamism that I refer to in the preceding lecture and it happened in parallel
with the university.
In fact, the university must be understood as symptomatic of this development in European
and Southern European culture that took place at that time, roughly speaking from 1100-1350
when we have the first outbreak of the Black Plague and a very devastating period in European
history which may account for the time it took to move beyond the achievements of 14th
century Western Europe.
In any event, what I want to talk about now is in this lecture is European is the technology,
the industrial revolution of the 12th and 13th centuries, this aspect of the cultural
renaissance that not only regains the kind of expertise that the Romans possessed.
I referred to the baths of Caracalla as only one instance of the quite astonishing technological
capabilities of the Romans but I also referred very briefly to the fact that the Romans knew
how to build water mills, water powered mills for grinding grain, that there were a small
number of such mills in the vicinity of Rome, there was a very large complex that I referred
to near Arles in France that contained a total of 16 water powered grain grinding mills in
one single complex and apparently could grind enough grain to keep a population of 80,000
people fed, so the Romans could build water mills but they deliberately did not spread
that technology by contrast. What we find in medieval Western Europe is an incredible
number of machines being built, water and wind powered machines being built and broadly applied
across many industries and this is just one facet of this industrial revolution that is a
parallel expression of the 12th century renaissance to the university movement and
nicely complements the theory practice distinction. Let me point out that we will not be seeing much
about, there is no room to talk here about techno science. The idea that theory should guide
practice is not an attribute of this industrial revolution which is more like the technological
innovations of the millennia from 10,000 BCE roughly speaking down to the Greco-Roman period
but let's just look at water mills. When William the Conqueror, he wasn't called that before he
left Normandy, it was not a very nice name that he had while he was still in Normandy but he was
William the Conqueror after 1066, after William conquered England so he did a survey, he ordered
survey of the resources of England so that he could distribute the country among the 10,000
knights that accompanied him to England, that was the reason why they went on this adventure
and risk both risk life, that's all that mattered. If you lost a limb you lost your life pretty much
in those days. This survey was compiled in what is called the Domes Day Book and it lists
you can count the population of England at the time, the area covered by this survey had about
1.4 million inhabitants in it, this was pretty empty and it had over 5,000 water mills.
There were in fact over 5,600 water mills in England alone at the end of the 11th century
and the number of water mills, water powered mills, grew dramatically all over Western Europe
leading to many lawsuits for example from towns where the speed of the river had been so reduced
by mills upstream that they couldn't build water mills and there's a body of law that grew up
that we would recognize today as I guess environmental law of a particular sort. The water mills
were used initially to grind grain, I mentioned that but in the 12th century they started being
applied much more broadly than that. The water mills were applied to filling cloth which requires
pounding the cloth in order to give it the qualities that you need before you make fabrics
and apparel to use felting wool. So the water wheel was used to drive trip hammers that pounded the
wool in order to make felt. They used the water mills to make to power saw mills so you had water
powered saw mills sawing lumber as opposed to having people doing the sawing of the lumber.
Water mills were applied to the bellows of forges, the first iron forges that we know about that
had water powered bellows in order to maintain the temperature of the fire in order to melt the iron
in order to get the iron. We're talking here the 12th and 13th century. In the 12th century you
get the first paper making mills, made rag paper, got to be pounded. You've got to pound those rags
in order to get them to the point of where you can make paper out of them. The first paper mills
in Europe were in Spain but in a very interest that was in the 13th century at the turn of the
14th century a French, the first French paper mill was was water powered mill was created,
was built at the Moulin Richard de Bach and this company is still in business, still making paper,
fine paper used primarily by by artists but that company has been in continuous existence
since roughly speaking 1320 and it's not the only one. The water the water powered mills became so
important to the economy that for example also this one comes from France near Toulouse there was
a complex of water mills that became incorporated in which the shares of the mills there were a
total of 96 shares spread out over the the the the mills that made up the complex those shares
were publicly traded and over the centuries that continued that that corporation continued to exist
until the mid 20th century when by which time its water mills were being used to generate electricity
and they were nationalized by the French government as part of creation of electricity de France so
that here we have another and there was a Swedish company that was incorporated in the 13th century
and Stora that also continues to exist to this day so what we're talking about is an economic
technological revolution in which machinery becomes increasingly familiar we may think of
the Middle Ages as a very crude time but the period from 1100 to 1300 crude in many other
respects was one in which machinery became ubiquitous in western and southern Europe
water mills and there are many applications for example i love pounding olives in order to make
olive oil and recognize everywhere is that look at how much labor we are saving the productivity
of western european and so the western and southern european societies became rows dramatically
and this is another expression of the underlying secularism where am i going with this secularism
as we'll see in a subsequent lecture i'm going towards the idea of progress and the role that
it played in making science the kind of an enterprise that society would accept as a driver
of change because the desire for change keyed to the idea of progress is uh what was what was
what was behind the embrace of science and techno science in the in the what we see in the 12th
and 13th and 14th centuries is that within a faith-based culture there was a growing sense
that we wanted to live better there was also growing wealth there was a positive assertion
of work that work was a good thing to do because you could make money from work because you could
make life more comfortable for yourself through work work was not a punishment which it does
seem to have been perceived to have been from the greco- roman period the really nice people the
people who could the people who mattered in society didn't work in fact we still have into the modern
into the modern period this idea that a gentleman is someone who does not work for a living unless
he unless he's a professional a doctor a lawyer a civil servant working for the government a priest
a minister then that's okay but to actually have a job to need a job in order to pay your bills
then you're not a gentleman if you work for a living you are not a gentleman by definition
now we don't use the word gentleman this way today but into the 20th century
that's the way it was used in in europe in all european countries there was something negative
about work but in the 12th and 13th and 14th centuries people became excited about work because
they were doing new things in new ways and they were benefiting from that work the the windmill
was clearly invented first in central asia there are windmills horizontal windmills
in iran in the eighth ninth tenth centuries but what the europeans invented was the vertical
mode the so-called post windmill the horizontal windmill works okay if the wind's always blowing
in the same direction but in western europe the wind changes direction too much too often
to use a horizontal windmill effectively so they invented a windmill that was mounted on
a post so that it could turn into the wind and that allowed wind-powered machinery to be
wind-powered mills powering machinery to become popular eventually of course it created holland
the the the dutch made used wind-powered pumps windmill powered pumps in order to drain the
approximately i think about a third or quarter of holland that is today that would have been underwater
except for this pumping and they became international experts in pumping and irrigation in clearing
swamps etc based on the application of of wind power now it's a wonderful story to talk about
this machine and that machine but what's really interesting is what's happening here is we have
a society in which expertise in which there is a very broad base of mechanical expertise
in the design and construction of gear driven machines it looks as though the romans knew about
cams camshafts but it was only in the 12th and 13th and 14th century that you had a wholesale you
had machines that exploited the cam principle because when you build the windmill you need
to be able to take that power off and transmit it so you need to know how to make things like
crown gears and lantern gears and you need to know how you have to have a clutch so that you
can disengage the the the wind the water mill which keeps turning because that river is still
flowing but you may not want it to turn whatever machine that you have on at that time so you
need a clutch to engage and disengage you need ways of transmitting power so that it goes at
right angles so that if the windmill is turning on one axis and you want the power to go on another
axis also you need to change reciprocating motion back and forth motion into rotary motion
or in the case of the windmill rotary motion into reciprocating motion so the ability to do all of
these kinds of things became very broadly based in in western europe and and and one can legitimately
say that not only was there an industrial revolution the sense that machines became
increasingly prominent in the economy and the social life of the time but there was also
an industry generating the knowledge and the expertise and the and the the resources necessary
to support those other industries just as for example it's wonderful to make computer chips
but in order to make computer chips you need to have machines that can make computer chips
those machines stepping machines for example that are responsible for for printing the
circuit designs onto these minute bits of of of silicon those machines you never you almost never
hear about but without those machines the companies like Intel and so on that manufacture chips that
you do hear about wouldn't be able to do it so there's an infrastructure at work here in a society
that uses machines this intensively now the most famous gear driven machine of the high middle
ages was unquestionably is the mechanical clock the weight driven mechanical clock now we didn't
invent the clock though I think that I mentioned the last lecture tessibius the Greek engineer I
will call him who who was cited by vitruvius as being one of those who use scientific knowledge
in order to design new machines tessibius was famous for having built a very accurate clepsidra
or water clock a so-called compound clepsidra in which the outflow of water because the Greeks
understood that water flows through a novel a nozzle at a at a fixed rate if you keep the
the head of water constant and so you can measure you can let the volume of water that flows through
a tiny little orifice drive the hands of a clock and as long as you keep the level of the water
constant in the tank then the water will flow out at a constant rate and so you can have a clock
that measures hours and minutes the mechanical the weight driven mechanical clock was therefore not
a revolution as a timekeeper per se and in fact it was less accurate initially and for quite a
while than a good clepsidra but the weight driven mechanical clock became a public instrument
well you can the way it was the way it was designed the the the clock was time was kept by a weight
that fell and under the force of gravity and there was a special gear mechanism which is called
a virgin folio escapement which caused the the the falling weight to stop every let's say second
so then every jerk of the escapement was one second and then that drove the hands of the clock now
in fact it was so crude that there were no minute hands for centuries on these kinds of clocks only
hour hands but but by the same token you can see that you're gonna have to wind the clock up all
the time unless you have a very high unless you mount the clock very high up for example you mounted
in a gothic cathedral tower or in a tower specially built that you put a clock face in so the clock
became a public timekeeper in the west and it piggybacked on the kind of knowledge of gear
train design that was ubiquitous in the society that was growing at the the amount of technological
innovation involved here was analogous I believe at a lower level of technical sophistication
but it was analogous to the rate of innovation that we have experienced post world war two
in in the west it was a tremendous it was a tremendous enthusiasm for this among many people
and other people who who didn't like this this much change so the the clock has been singled out by
historians as as what j david bolter once called the defining technology of the of that age i'll
be using that metaphor again when we talk about the computer but the clock as the defining technology
of early modernism as if somehow the clock drove european society in secular directions it it
it's spatialized timekeeping many so some famous historian has said and in opposition to the
spiritual timekeeping of the church the seven hours religious hours of the of the day in the
catholic ritual here we have instead a spatialized timekeeping which is completely secular the clock
didn't force european society to become secular it was the secular design it was the underlying
secularism of the society which made the clock an attractive innovation as opposed to an innovation
that that could be ignored so this is one aspect of the of the industrial revolution of the of the
12th century concurrently a great deal else was happening in the society for example agricultural
technology was completely revolutionized by a number of innovations that included developing
an effective breast harness for a horse so that you could use a horse rather than an ox a horse is
approximately twice as fast as an ox in doing farm work and while it eats more it it costs more to
feed a horse than to feed an ox you more than get it back in the speed with which it can work
but in roman times horses wore neck collars and and with a neck collar if the horse has to pull a
heavy weight then it chokes the breast collar allows you to have the horse to exert its strength
with its body not with its not with its neck and and not only the breast collar but also an
effective harnessing mechanism so that horses could be used in tandem so you could have a wagon
pulling heavy loads for example and and these that was a very important innovation which reshaped
a good deal of farming together with the systematic use of a three field rotation system as opposed
to the roman system which the middle ages had inherited of having of taking your farm and
you you you plant one one half of your field and you let the other half lie fallow the three field
rotation involved a winter crop a spring crop and a fallow crop and you alternated these fields in
a particular cycle and it dramatically increased the productivity even of the existing farms together
with the first systematic use of manure as a fertilizer in order to build up the soil for
example keeping your animals on the fallow field during the year that it was fallow so that that
field became enriched when it was not being uh when it would not have a crop sown on it and then
through the rotation cycle this this kept the the field fertile so um agricultural technologies
enhanced by the heavy plow the plow inherited from the romans was was okay in italy where the
soil is relatively light and thin but utterly useless in northern france germany the so-called
low countries that became belgium and holland and and in much of england a new kind of plow was
invented with heavy wheels with and with an iron tipped plow and uh so-called moldboard and colter
that turned the earth aside as you pulled the plow ho hooking such a plow up to horses opened
whole new areas of of europe to farming and they were very productive because they hadn't been farmed
before the the soil was very rich and the crops were very substantial so yields doubled and tripled
and quadrupled in the course of the 12th 13th and 14th century which by the way meant that
fewer people were needed to work on the farm which is why probably urbanization increased
in the 12th century and why there were so many people around said well i might as well go to the
university might as well go to school might as well learn something or uh it's it's much better to
be living in paris and london uh oxford and cambridge uh balonia and padua than to be living
on an isolated farm and they don't need me here anyway and my oldest brother's going to inherit
the farm so what the heck am i doing wasting my time here i might as well become a doctor or a lawyer
or or even a philosopher concurrently a dramatic change in nautical technology took place new
innovations in nautical technology the the centrally mounted stern post rudder was introduced
which meant that ships for the first time could be controlled in heavy seas so you didn't have to
only coast along the shore you could you could go from europe to north africa directly instead
of going around the periphery of the mediterranean because the centrally mounted stern post rudder
which was enabled by the gearing that allowed a single steersman holding a big wheel to control
a heavy rudder mounted centrally on the ship as opposed to uh only in the rear uh that uh that
kind of gearing reduces the effort necessary to control the the rudder and so the centrally
mounted stern post rudder together with the latin sail which seems to have been borrowed from
islamic merchant ships uh as opposed to the square rig sail the latin sail is is a much
more maneuverable and allows much better tacking in the wind than the square rig sail does so the
combination of the latin sail the centrally mounted stern post rudder the compass which was
ultimately brought in which was brought into europe in this time period ultimately from china
through intermediaries and new kinds of maps borrowed i believe it is correct to say from islamic
sailors and merchants new kinds of maps together led to a tremendous increase in trade
in a marine trade in europe and that increase in trade which made europe much increasingly
prosperous in this period that increase in trade was uh was also supported by changes in banking
and commerce so for example leonardo of pizza in 1202 published a book which introduced double
entry bookkeeping into european the inter in european business world from uh uh muslim traders
in north africa who uh from whom he seems to have gotten it now as a matter of fact while the history
books say that this was the beginning of double entry bookkeeping it took centuries before business
men routinely used double entry bookkeeping and there were good reasons for being cautious about
it the nice thing about double entry bookkeeping is that you can look at the record and see exactly
if you're making money or losing money but the danger is that anyone else who sees your books
can tell also and so not what at a time when businesses were privately owned not everybody
wanted to have a set of books that were so transparent that anyone could see uh how well
they were doing but that is a sign uh that businesses were becoming unmanageable because
so much business is being done that you couldn't keep it in your head merchants had so many
investments going on in so many different ships going to this place in that place buying here
selling there that they needed a most a more sophisticated way of keeping records that's all
by itself it's a sign of heightened activity but even more powerful in terms of this underlying
social pressure that i've been trying to suggest is this secularism which was driving a lot of
these changes or let's put it differently it was driving the adoption of these changes was the rise
of banking what we recognize as but even though there were something like banks in the antique
world of Greece and Rome there was that what we recognize as modern banking really begins in
the 12th 13th and 14th centuries initially controlled by a small number of families in mostly
Italian towns uh Florence and Genoa and uh uh and Luca uh which got overwhelmed eventually but
Venice was another important center the Bardi and Peruzzi families stand out as having
become very very prominent and powerful bankers the the problem here was that the church opposed
lending money at interest because that's usury and it's forbidden by the bible and so there was
a tension here between a tremendous increase in the scale of business the opportunity to make lots
of money and then this religious principle that you're not allowed to charge interest on money
you're not allowed to make money on money well how can we invest in businesses if we don't get a
return on the money that we're investing we make profit what are we supposed to do with the
profit just spend it all on food and clothes and houses we want to use part of that profit to build
new businesses so now i'm making money on money and the church says that that's a terrible crime
and i'm going to go to hell and burn forever because i've lent money at at interest what gave
well the church had in a series of church councils that's the highest level of of of promulgation
of definitive church teachings that took place in the 12th 13th and 14th centuries the church
repeatedly condemned usury there is no excuse for usury there is no basis for usury however behind
the scenes they changed the definition of usury that well but if you're lending your money in
something that's risky then it's okay to expect a return because why should anyone rescue or why
anyone risk their money for the for the sake of what is for what is a risk so what happened
behind the scenes was that while we retained the religious teaching that usury is wrong and it is
wrong we will not compromise on that we redefine usury so that we support the that we support
the growth of commerce so trade
nautical technologies the new new ship designs for example that eventually became the kinds of
ships that the portuguese who in the in the 15th century used to sail to asia and begin the
transformation of the world under this european imperialist of the thrust of european imperialism
they were what the portuguese did in the 15th century was to pull together developments in the
12 13th and 14th century in sail design ship control design ship design the use of the compass
the use of new more sophisticated kinds of maps and to then go out into the open oceans eventually
sail around africa to india and then begin all of those voyages of of of commerce and exploit
and and colonization and exploitation that characterize the next 500 years of of world history
it is in the context of this industrial revolution that the medieval historian that the historian
of medieval culture lin white used the expression which i referred to in the second lecture namely
that new technologies only open doors they do not force a society to enter through that door
this was in opposition to the view that is called technological determinism
that once a technology is introduced into a society the technology dictates that how that
society must must adapt to the implementation of that technology many people especially in the 1960s
and 70s and the anti-establishment fervor of the time acted as if once an invention has been released
once an innovation has been channeled into society it's all over a society has to adapt to it
whereas what white was saying and i think that this requires considerable thought and and and needs
to be paid attention to when we see an innovation embraced by by a society then that's a sign that's
that society recognizes that a door has been opened and it wants to go through that door
the 12th century renaissance powered deep down by a putting a value on the secular
is i believe what lies behind the enthusiastic embrace by western and southern european societies
in the 12 13th and 14th centuries of of of these doors of these new technological innovations so
you don't embrace the door you walk through the door they embrace the innovation by not just walking
but by racing through those doors by making the clock a means by which social life could be
structured differently than it had been before and in ways that just happened not coincidentally
to reinforce the requirements of the growing business environment they raced through the door
of the nautical technologies in order to exploit the benefits of trade that this opened up that
they raced through the doors opened up by gear train wind and water power technologies
exploiting gear train designs in order to industrialize in order to sustain a growing
population at a higher level of prosperity if you put this together with the university movement
and the kinds of issues that i referred to in the last lecture especially the the study of nature
in ways that clearly reflect the beginnings of the mentality that in the 17th century became
modern science it raises this question of why didn't modern science arise in the 14th century
it seems as though absolutely all of the ingredients that we are going to see in the 16th and 17th
century are right there in the 13th and 14th century and there is no satisfying answer to that
question historians have said well it was the black plague it was the plague which in 1347 first
broke out in europe and over the next 50 or 75 years devastated the population maybe that played
a role in it but i don't think that that in fact is the answer it's just another illustration
that in the end human history is not logical
