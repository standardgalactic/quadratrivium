In the last lecture we discussed the atomic theory of matter, but the atomic theory of
matter is just one instance of what I will call an atomistic style of thinking ultimately
rooted in this Parmenidian approach to explaining reality. The atomistic style of thinking includes
the atomic theory of matter, but I believe that it is also correct to characterize the
cell theory of life, the germ theory of disease, and the gene theory of inheritance, which
we will be exploring in the next two lectures as further instances of this same style of
thinking in which we attribute phenomena to the manifestation of different configurations
of underlying elementary building blocks. These building blocks have fixed properties
and they combine in various ways with one another in order to produce all of the phenomena
that we are interested in. So in each case the idea is that we can isolate an elementary
cause that is itself fundamental in some functional sense, in functional within the context of
scientific explanations and that fundamental element, that cell, that germ, that gene with its
particular distinctive properties allows us to explain life processes in the case of the cell
theory of life, disease in the case of the germ theory of disease, what we call genetics or
inheritance in the case of the gene theory. So in this lecture we are going to focus on the
cell theory of life where the cell, the idea being that all living things are made up of cells,
they have certain internal, right from the beginning, we're understood to have certain
internal structures and properties and that they combined with other cells in various ways to give
you tissues, the tissues then built up into organs, the organs then built up into an organism so
that the cell is this again a building block, not identical to an atom but it has that same
explanatory and conceptual flavor as the atom in the theory of matter. This style of thinking is
very characteristic of the West for just think in terms of our attitude towards society in which we
think that the individual is the basic unit of society, individuals form families, families
form clans, clans form communities, communities form society and societies form the so-called
family of nations although that's a relatively recent concept. So that same idea that the
ultimate building block is the individual at least of course in the Western social atomic, we even
call Western social theory or one aspect of Western social theory, social atomism, that the
individual is the basic building block of society, alternative views would be that society has
a holistic character that supersedes the reality of the individual, the individual is in a sense
created to and beholden to society whereas we believe that the individual has inalienable rights
and that society cannot legitimately take a form which violates those rights. So this style of
thinking is very familiar to us even in sports we tend to think that there are stars, superstars
that deserve a special praise and attention and we have a lot of difficulty dealing with teamwork.
We praise teamwork at one level but in fact we then undercut it by highlighting somebody
as the hero, somebody as the goat and giving extraordinary praise to superstars, sports
superstars but also intellectual superstars. The whole theory that geniuses are what propel
intellectual history associated with the 19th century British historian Thomas Carlisle is
another instance of that. Anyway what we're going to deal with in this lecture is focus more
narrowly now on the cell theory of life and what prompts the cell theory of life of course is the
emergence in the 18th century especially of a scientific response to the question what is life
which is in some sense the most fundamental of all questions for us to answer not necessarily the
first question that we want to address or would be capable of addressing but it certainly it seems
to be the most fundamental of all questions what is life. So a typical response prior to the rise
of modern science is that life is a divine gift but within science that response does not wash.
We need to explain life in terms of natural phenomena natural forces and that really becomes
possible or at least it emerged in the 18th century and within the framework of modern science.
The term that we use the scientific term that we use to describe the study of life is biology and
that word was invented around 1800 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck Lamarck a very very important French
biologist and zoologist in fact who developed an evolutionary theory of his own that we'll be
talking about more when we talk about the theory of evolution and the Darwin Wallace version of
that theory but Lamarck was an extraordinarily important thinker at the end of the 18th the
beginning of the 19th century and he coined the term biology from the Greek word bios from
life to in what as an umbrella term to refer to the spectrum of increasingly scientific studies
in ways that we now understand when we say that a study is scientific because the ideas have been
framed in terms that fit within the context of what the community of scientists recognizes as a
scientific explanation studies in for example botany zoology anatomy medicine of course and
the study of respiration the study of digestion the study of reproduction especially reproduction
we will see as a special significance to understand these as natural phenomena to understand the
process and what causes them and in the 18th century they were broadly speaking two underlying
theories one was a Cartesian influenced mechanistic theory of life that life happens to be no more
than a very complex manifestation of strictly mechanical physical forces and that therefore
all biological phenomena term is anachronistic until roughly 1800 but all by all living phenomena
are reducible to physics on this view they're mechanistic it is that there are there are matter
has can be configured in ways so complex that we call those ways living creatures and analogously
today for example there are some people working in artificial intelligence research who believe
that once we can make computers once we can make chips that have billions of transistors that are
interconnected in a in the dense way that the human nervous system is that somehow consciousness
and intelligence would emerge out of the complexity of those interconnections and so there's really
nothing special if you have a sufficiently complex nervous system where the cells are connected
in the sufficiently complex arrangement then then consciousness simply emerges there's nothing
wonderful in that sense except the improbability of it all so in the we have this mechanistic
view but then there was a rival view broadly called vitalist which held from the word vitality for
life that the that there were irreducible forces at work in biology that were necessary to be added
to physical and chemical forces in order for those physical and chemical forces to be selectively
utilized to construct living to construct living things and in the course of the 19th century
this vitalist view came under increasing pressure from the growing materialism of 19th century science
where more and more biological processes could be explained in terms of physics and chemistry
without any need for a special vital force Lamarck himself was an an early proponent not the first
one can argue that perhaps George Buffon great mid 18th century french naturalist whose book
natural history mulled the volume work that appeared over a period of many years and was an
international sort of a coffee table bestseller they had coffee tables then the natural history and
one volume of which had to do with the ages of the earth that Buffon argued that argued for
something like the common origin of all life forms but it's not clear that there was a single
life form in Buffon that that then radiated into all the different life forms that we see in nature
but Lamarck explicitly argued that in the beginning there was one extraordinarily primitive very simple
life form and that all subsequent life forms including human beings evolved out of that life
form under various kinds of of pressures environmental pressures acting on the complex
character of a living organism we'll come back to that in a moment what's interesting is that
in the 1790s when when Lamarck was formulating and publishing these ideas
Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin who was a physician with a wide range of interest
and quite an eccentric character published several epic poems his writings in biology and
natural in naturalism were in the form of very long poems which actually sold pretty well although
what we might call real poets thought he was comical but Darwin's Darwin argued like Lamarck
that in the beginning there was one single life form and that all of the others radiated out
in something like under something like natural selection and we now know and eventually Charles
Darwin admitted that as a teenager he had actually read his grandfather's poem although he claimed
that didn't influence him very much Lamarck's theory was that that through was a dynamic theory
that through the use of its organs in response to environmental challenges organisms evolved
and developed new capabilities through striving to survive under continually changing environmental
circumstances which implied the inheritance of acquired characteristics and we'll see how
controversial that became when we talk about the gene theory of inheritance the study of life
in the night in the 18th century the study of life in the 18th century had been had had been
aided tremendously in the 17th century by the the development of the microscope especially
the use of the microscope by uh by Lewin Hook in Holland and by uh by Robert Hook in England
and Marcello Malpighi in in Italy they revealed that there was a whole world within ordinary
experience especially by looking in fluids of various kinds to reveal that there were these
tiny little creatures swimming around and the temptation in the 18th century was to keep
pushing the magnification of these micro microscopes in order to look more and more carefully
at these uh at uh at these creatures in order to discover the secret of life but the more you
magnified the original simple microscopes of the 18th century which were not corrected for what's
called color aberration chromatic aberration which is that the uh that a lens because light has a
wave-like character which even Newton recognized in his in his atomic theory of light uh he he
recognized that these light atoms had something like what we would call a wave-like character
although he he called the different uh uh fits of transmission and reflection um that the uh that
because different colors of light have different frequencies they are brought to a focus at
different points by a lens if the lens is not very curved and the magnification is low so it's
not a big deal but the more you curve the lens in order to to get higher magnification then the
blurrier the image becomes and so 18th century microscopy became a kind of a Rorschach test
in which you saw pretty much what you were looking for because everything you saw was
extraordinarily blurry and this led a number of 18th century biologists to give up the use of the
microscope most notably a um a french biologist contemporary with Lamarck named Bichat who
developed a tissue theory of life which was an early rival to the cell theory of life before the
cell theory of life was formulated in a scientific form uh that uh that that life that the fundamental
unit of biological explanation was tissues and he identified for example in the human body 21
different types of tissues that combined to form all of the organs of the body and then the total
system of the organism that made up the the human organism and so with all other living things
the problem with the microscope was solved by in two ways that were not unrelated and kind of
interesting one was a very interesting character named John Dolland who was a silk weaver who
became self-educated in mathematics and physics and chemistry to the point where he was clearly a
serious scientist and he and he figured out how to combine crown and flint glass two different
kinds of glass in a sandwich that solved within limits the problem of chromatic aberration and
in 1758 took out a patent on this founded together with his with one of his sons a business that
flourished for about a hundred years making optics uh concurrently the great mathematician Leonard
Euler addressed this problem of chromatic aberration and came up with a mathematical theory that sort
of solved the problem mathematically and also predicted that by combining a glass lens and a
fluid water for example you could use a combination of a single lens and fluid rather than these
compound lenses and interestingly Dolland originally did his experiments to prove that
Euler was wrong discovered in the course of his experiments that Euler was quite right but nevertheless
made up a three-piece sandwich lens rather than a sound of a lens made up of glass and and a fluid
um and it was a hundred years almost before a superior kind of microscope in the 1870s was
designed by Ernst Abe for Carl Zeiss everybody's heard of Carl Zeiss optics I assume and uh and
they started marketing an oil immersion lens in which oil and and a glass lens are combined
to solve this problem of chromatic aberration so the problem was in a certain sense solved in the
last third of the 18th century but it wasn't until the 1820s that microscopes that the whole
microscope set not just the lens you how you package the lens here we have an achromatic lens
the blurring problem is solved but not until you package it in a microscope with an appropriate
functioning uh focusing mechanism with a stage for the presentation preparation and presentation
of the specimens you're studying with appropriate lighting packaging matters as the Apple II and
the IBM PC remind us packaging the same technology that other people may be using can have a powerful
influence on how that technology is used and sort of unleashing a torrent of innovation and in the
1820s especially a design by the by the Italian um um Amici who put together a package that you
could just buy and use and we start seeing from the 1820s on a tremendous explosion in in the in
biological research and a revival of the cell theory which had first been suggested by Robert
Hook in the in the late um uh in the late 1600s when he published his work micrographia and included
in it a picture of a a slice of cork that he had observed under the microscope and you can see the
beautiful little cells as he called them and and wondered if maybe this is the way plants are that
they have a cellular structure but he didn't go any further than that in the 18th century it was kind
of casually assumed that plants uh at least some plants had the same kind of cellular structure
that cork had but it was really it was it was really in the 1830s that the idea began to grow
that all cell that all plants and then separately all animals have a cellular structure that all of
them are built up out of cells and in in fact not only a built up out of cells but cells that have
what Robert Brown who we know of from Brownian motion um was also the person who named the
nucleus he saw this dark spot within the cell and uh and so in 1838 and in 1839 Theodore Schwann
and Matthew Schleiden Schleiden in 1838 Schwann in 1839 um formulated the universal theory the cell
theory as the universal theory of life that all plants in the case of Schleiden and all animals
in the case of Schwann all animals have a cellular structure and that their cell has a nucleus
and that this nucleus seems to play some role in cell reproduction now uh initially it was uh the
let me just say at the outset uh that Schwann and Schleiden both of whom were directly or
indirectly students of uh John's Miller uh whose laboratory uh at the university was uh was uh uh
a seed bed for mechanistic theories of life physical and chemical theories of life while
he himself personally was a vitalist but his students advanced the uh the mechanical theory or the
science what's called materialistic theory uh theories of life uh they were not the first to
to come up with the idea that plants and animals have cells have have a cellular structure there
were predecessors in the early 1830s uh that um uh a friendship by the name of René Dutrochet and
and a check by by the name of uh Johann's Portini that um that formulated that also claimed that they
saw in all plants and all animal uh tissues that they examined a cellular structure but it was
Schwann and Schleiden who are considered to be the ones who formulated a universal theory of life
based on the cell and what's interesting is that in the course of the 1840s and 50s this theory was
universally accepted that's very interesting that the theory was universally accepting uh and on the
basis of relatively modest experimentation when you consider how broadly sweeping the claim is
how could you empirically justify the claim that all living things have a cellular structure
when you haven't examined all living things how many what percentage of the different kinds of
living things on the planet were examined at the time that that claim was made and essentially
universally accepted minute and yet that is uh that is a very interesting fact about science
that sometimes theories are accepted on the basis of of relatively modest empirical evidence
strictly speaking by looking at what percentage of the possible pool of evidence there is and
others like the atomic theory of matter in the preceding lecture can have a growing body of
evidence and function within scientific explanation for decades and still uh and still be controversial
so the cell theory of life is now in the 1840s and 50s essentially universally adopted by biologists
and the question is what are cells what's going on inside these cells one of the questions of
course has to do with identifying the internal structure of the cell unlike the atom the cell
clearly has an internal structure and in the course of the 19th century and especially after
the 1870s when the improved Abe Zeiss microscopes came out the Dahland microscope had a resolution
of one micron which is a millionth of a meter had a resident could resolve two objects that were
only a micron apart a millionth of a meter apart but the after 1870 the Abe Zeiss microscopes
Zeiss had actually died by that time but the company remained the Carl Zeiss company
Zeiss the Abe Zeiss microscopes were much better and so we see a tremendous increase again in the
sophistication of microscopic observation of the cell identifying structures within the cell
but because after the 1870s for example we already are seeing not only chromosomes but seeing that
during reproduction of the cell chromosomes split longitudinally and and even making out
structures within the chromosomes so the the one line of research is to identify what the
composition of the cell is and what and because the secret of life is now believed to be contained
within the cell to understand the secret of life you must know what is going on in the cell
and one facet of research into the cell that captured more and more attention was how do
cells reproduce where do cells come from initially Schwann and Schleiden seemed to think that a
thought no question about it or taught that that the cells were somehow formed out of some
mucus substance that was in the embryo sac and that they were manufactured within the growing
embryo but in the 1850s and this is associated especially with Rudolph Verkau very powerful
figure in the in the mid 19th century biology and especially the biology of the cell that the cell
is the key to life and Robert Remack and Rudolf Koliker that argued and came up with a principle
that all cells only come from the division of other cells you can't manufacture cells out of
raw materials cells reproduced by division cells come from other cells only of course that leaves
open the whole question of where did that first cell come from that's the spontaneous generation
of life question which is quite complex for science but and still obviously still not resolved
but given a cell the cell produces other cells by a process of division it was Remack who in the
early 1850s first recognized that a frog egg is a cell but it was another 25 years before
Aska Hartfig was able to show that the fertilized egg is a single cell that comes from the fusion
of sperm and egg cells that the sperm was a cell the egg is a cell that the fusion of the two
produces a single embryo fertilized embryonic cell from which all the other cells of the body
then develop so this is a major a major discovery within the framework of the cell
theory of life the idea that the cell is the is the basis of life the as I said in the 1870s
an increasing recognition that that the structures that there are structures internal to the cell
that are fundamental to the process of cell division which is the same same as cell reproduction
and and in the 1880s this process was given a name by Walter Fleming it was called mitosis
and all of the different steps of mitosis began to be worked out between the 1880s
and and the end of the 19th century what is especially interesting I think that we will
note in the lecture on the gene theory of inheritance is that as early as the 1870s
a German chemist named Friedrich Miescher chemist biologist biochemist suggested that within the
nucleus there was a particular substance an acid by nature that seemed to be important for the
purpose of of cell division that played some in particularly important role in cell division
and that idea sort of laid dormant for quite a while but what that acid of course in the 20th
century was identified as DNA and and then DNA is another version of atomistic style of thinking
within genetics but we'll we'll come to that let me pull together a number of ideas here
that that are relevant to the cell theory of life we are still concerned with the quest answering
the question what is life the cell theory by itself is valuable to us because it seems as though
the cell theory of life is our best answer to the scientific answer to the question what is life
but we need to understand well what is it about the cell that is the essence of life what with
in the cell is the essence of life the first version of a response to this question came
from what was based on what was called protoplasm a term invented by by the German Ugo Moll again
a chemo biochemist associated with just as Liebig who will run into again Liebig was a kind of a
radical mechanist and attempted to reduce all biological phenomena to chemical phenomena so
Moll introduced this term protoplasm protoplasm was conceived to be the essence of life in fact we
still hear that word or read that word being used as if it were somehow the secret of life is
contained within the is contained within protoplasm but by the end of the 19th century that was much
to vague a term and by in the 1890s especially it had morphed into a colloid theory of life namely
that colloids are tiny little particles that are suspended within some that are suspended within some
solid so within the cell it was believed that there were tiny little particles that were the key to
controlling cell metabolism this colloid theory rather quickly gave way to an enzyme theory of
life at the turn of the at the turn of the 20th century that is that enzymes were the secret of
life that the body that every cell manufactured enzymes and that it was the enzymes that that
were responsible for controlling all the processes going on within the cell so if you wanted to
understand if you wanted to have a really satisfactory theory of life you had to understand
how enzymes worked and what they were identify them and discover how they worked clearly this
is moving us increasingly towards a biochemical theory of life in which in a life is reduced
from being something that can only be explained in living terms to being explained in terms of
complex processes that are physical chemical mechanical electrical they are but they are not
specifically alive the processes themselves are not specifically alive and so life becomes a kind
of a derivative property it was in the early 20th century enzymes were soon discovered to be a
particular kind of protein enzymes are those proteins which acts as catalysts so there's no
so now it becomes a protein theory of life proteins were discovered by amel fischer early in the
20th century we're still in the first 15 years of the 20th century would discover to be chains of
amino acids or or made up out of amino acids amino acids are chemicals that you can make in the
laboratory and you can then link them together and you can make proteins and fischer made several
proteins in the laboratory including some proteins that actually exist within living bodies including
within the human body which again reduced the idea of life to essentially a chemical phenomena
although as quantum theory developed the it became chemistry itself was believed by physicists to
have been reduced to quantum theory so ultimately a strictly physical phenomenon life becomes a
strictly physical phenomenon within this context but proteins now become the key to life until
in 1953 when Watson and Crick discovered the structure of DNA precipitates a consensus that DNA
is the secret to life but again at each one of these stages what we're doing is we're identifying
an atom in quotation marks a conceptual atom that is responsible that ultimately it's the
properties of that atom are going to explain everything else everything else concatenates
out of that particular definition of that particular atom and that's why I say that
the cell theory of life is an instance of atomistic of the atomistic style of thinking
and we'll see this very clearly when we talk about DNA and molecular biology in the next lecture
we're going to see how the germ theory of disease is another instance of this atomistic style of
thinking
