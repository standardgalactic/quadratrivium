We have seen how the idea of science evolved in the world of ancient Greece through the
work of philosophers, through the thinking of philosophers from roughly speaking 500 BCE
down to approximately 300 BCE, in the form of first a very particular definition of knowledge
that was coupled with a very particular conception of reasoning, and especially the idea of deductive
reasoning as being the only way to fulfill the conditions of knowledge, namely that knowledge
had to be universal, necessary, and certain.
And the third piece of the puzzle that we needed was that mathematics is directly relevant
in some sense, that mathematics in some sense is the essence of the order underlying nature,
and that therefore the scientist, the student of someone who wants to explain natural phenomena
is going to have to use mathematics.
There was, if you recollect, another piece to understanding science as a driver of social
change, how science changes the world, and that was the idea of techno science, that is
to say coupling knowledge to know-how, know-how developing as we discussed independently of
science, of course, for millennia before writing, and then more or less independently of science
certainly through down into the Greek period that we've been discussing, but the idea
of techno science in the 19th century, I had suggested, is the means by which science
emerged as a dominant driver of physical and social change in the world in which we live.
That idea of coupling knowledge in the philosophical sense, of coupling the idea of science as
we have just been discussing it, to know-how first emerged in the Greco-Roman world, and
although at the time it had limited impact in terms of changing the world, that idea
was well-developed.
It was not just a hint that I'm trying to exaggerate, but that idea that knowledge could
be coupled to know-how, mathematical, deductive, scientific knowledge of nature, could be coupled
to know-how and that that would give us more power than we have ever had over natural phenomena.
That idea was well-developed in antiquity and a pivotal figure in this regard is the
Roman Vitruvius, the Roman, we would call him an engineer, and at that time he was considered
an architect because the title architect in the Roman period translated very well into
what we mean by an engineer and in part because that what the architect was really expected
to do was to develop engines to develop ingenious devices, engines that would be able to accomplish
things that people ordinarily could not accomplish by, for example, moving weights or by channeling
water and we'll see examples of this.
So Vitruvius was an engineer from our sense, but the title that he had was architect and
he wrote a book called Ten Books on Architecture, which was important in its own time, but it
became even more influential in the Renaissance when that book was, when that manuscript was
discovered and published and in the course of the late 15th and 16th centuries went through
dozens of editions.
It became kind of a standard text for the training of Renaissance engineers and modern
engineering finds its roots in the Renaissance as we'll see in a later lecture.
So Vitruvius is a pivotal figure in his own time and a very influential figure in terms
of the development of modern engineering and its eventual coupling in the 19th century
to science creating in the process this powerful driver of change, but again the idea of techno
science emerges in antiquity and we see it very clearly in Vitruvius.
This book of his called Ten Books on Architecture, we would call it Ten Chapters in one book
on architecture.
This book on architecture is really a civil engineering handbook and in the course of
these Ten Chapters, Vitruvius describes how an architect slash engineer should go about
citing a new city where you decide to put, if you've been sent out by the emperor to
build a new city somewhere because Rome has just conquered some section of what subsequently
came to be called France and a way you should put the city, how you should build the streets
and the roads of the highways leading into the city, the streets within the city, how
houses should be situated, how you build the houses, how you build and cite public buildings,
where you put the theater and how you design the theater including considerations of acoustics
and scene painting.
So for example he has referenced to using central vanishing point perspective a mathematical
technique that we of course identify with the Renaissance but the Romans were familiar
with it and had a name for it which reveals its Greek roots, Scenography was essentially
scene painting and the idea was that the audience should see a backdrop that looked realistic,
naturalistic and he has reference to this and some of the things are, some of the chapters
are devoted to military applications of engineering but particularly interesting is that at the
very beginning of the book the opening paragraph of the book of Vitruvius writes as follows.
The architect should be equipped with knowledge of many branches of study and varied kinds
of learning for it is by his judgment that all work done by the other arts is put to
test, it's by the judgment of the architect slash engineer that all work done by the other
arts and arts here means crafts is put to test.
This knowledge, the knowledge that the architect slash engineer must possess is the child of
practice and theory.
Practice is the continuous and regular exercise of employment where manual work is done with
any necessary material according to the design of a drawing.
History on the other hand is the ability to demonstrate and explain the productions
of dexterity on the principles of proportion.
This paragraph all by itself is the basis of a short paper without having to go beyond
it to explicate how startling these claims are to claim that the knowledge that an engineer
must have is the child of practice and theory is quite a startling claim because we have
never heard before that you can get a fertile hybrid out of joining practice and theory.
Know how is one thing, theory is another from the point of view of the Greek philosophers
especially the Platonic Aristotelian tradition in which knowledge was defined as we've been
talking about it subsequently incorporated into science.
Practice is of no concern to the theoretician.
The theoretician wants to understand nature, wants to understand the truth about reality.
It is not part of the so to speak mental and spiritual makeup of the theoretician to be
concerned with practice.
This is what mechanics do, that's the arts, the mechanics.
They have craft skills and they build things and they do things and of course we need them
in order to make life comfortable but they don't understand anything.
We who understand, you may be a master of thermodynamics but you don't know how to fix
your car's engine when it malfunctions.
This distinction between theory and practice is deeply rooted in Greek philosophy, in fact
in the 19th century, right here in America there were major controversies over the attempt
to link physics as it was developing in the 19th century to technology.
As I'll mention in a later lecture, one of the leading American physicists of the 19th
century, one of the few that had a European reputation, Joseph Henry in fact invented
the electric telegraph, built an electric telegraph between his laboratory in Princeton
and his home a mile away so he could tell his wife when he was going to be home for
lunch and then he did nothing with it and when Samuel Morse wanted to hire him as a
consultant because without Henry's knowledge Morse could not have made the electric telegraph
a success, Henry refused on the grounds that that's not what you do with science.
Given today with biotech startup companies and so on, this is a strange attitude but
in the 19th century there was a major controversy in American intellectual circles and especially
scientific circles of whether practice, whether there was any place for practice in the world
of theory, whether that's not a prostitution of theory and here's Vitruvius saying, he
didn't invent this, he is saying this in the first century BCE that the kind of knowledge
that an engineer must possess is the child of practice and theory so that practice and
theory can give birth to a child.
This is a fertile union as opposed to hybrids in nature which are typically sterile, here
he's saying that practice and theory are not two different things but analogous to mixed
metaphors to two sides of the same coin.
Practice he says is the continuous and regular exercise of employment where manual work is
done guided by the design of a drawing, interesting for being just a casual reference to the fact
that in those days people worked off drawings, we take it for granted, in fact none of these
drawings have survived, theory on the other hand is the ability to demonstrate, now what
is a demonstration, I mentioned this in an earlier lecture and in fact in the last lecture
Archimedes is, his methodology was famous for showing that a demonstration in science
means just what it means in mathematics, you have to be able to show that the phenomena
you're trying to explain can be deduced from the principles that you have established,
so from your theory you have to be able to deduce the phenomenon that the theory tries
to explain, that's what a demonstration is, just as in mathematics you demonstrate the
truth of a theorem, like the angle inscribed in a semi-circle must be a right angle, you
demonstrate this by showing that it is a deductive logical consequence of the definitions,
axioms, postulates and other theorems of Euclidean geometry that are relevant to demonstrating
that point, the word demonstrate here means deductive proof, theory is the ability to deductively
prove and explain the productions of dexterity on the principles of proportion, the principles
of proportion is mathematics, the Greeks as we will be talking about in a later lecture,
the Greeks had a very passionate commitment to geometry and rules of proportion in mathematics
and a total, almost total distrust of or disinterest in what subsequently came to be called algebra,
so the Greek mathematics is geometry, trigonometry and proportion, proportion trigonometry is
in a sense the mathematics of proportion and Euclid's elements contain books or chapters
on proportion, so when he talks, when Vitruvius is saying that you have to, that the role
of theory is to demonstrate why machines work and how they work based on principles of proportion,
he's saying you have to give a mathematical logical proof, that's the role of theory,
so we and an engineer must know how to couple, must know how to couple knowledge, scientific,
mathematical scientific knowledge to practice and in fact in the course of this book, Vitruvius
describes many wonderful kinds of machines and in the very last chapter he refers to
a distinction between machines and engines, he said it's important for an engineer to
recognize, it's even more important for his customers to recognize the distinction between
machines which although built he says according to scientific principles uses that phrase
nevertheless and he uses the Greek word, because this is the Greeks who made this up, remember
the Romans had conquered the Greeks in the 2nd century BCE about 150 years before Vitruvius
wrote this, the Romans conquered Greece but they assimilated Greek learning and strongly
supported Greek scientists, mathematicians, philosophers and considered that to be an
important asset under the umbrella of Rome, subsequently the empire after the murder of
Julius Caesar, so he sees this as a Greek contribution that scientific principles are
used design machines but basically machines are relatively crude devices that take a lot
of people to use and they're made out of wood and they use to hoist weights or to build
relatively crude constructions but engines are built based on intelligence, engines
are devices that a single person can operate because they have been designed in such a
way using theory that they reflect knowledge and so they are much more powerful than machines,
they are different from machines because they embody more theory and they work more effectively
and allow us to do things that machines do not allow us to do, now Vitruvius is making
another distinction in that paragraph that I read that will become extremely important
in the 19th century, he is saying he is carving out a space for the architect slash engineer
that is different from the cultural and social space occupied by artisans, people who do
the arts, mechanics and on the other hand scientists, the people who develop the theory,
the engineer he says has to have knowledge that is the child of practice and theory,
the engineers drawings guide the artisans, the craftsmen, the machinists, the scientists
develops theories that the engineer links to practice, now in the 19th century as a matter
of fact until the 19th century the overwhelming majority of the people that we call engineers
did not have much training in science, they were really gifted mechanics and gifted inventors
with a natural bent, we will see a lot when we get to the 19th century how true this is,
it was in the 19th century that engineering as we understand it became professionalized
exactly as a community that stands between the theoreticians on one side with one foot
in the camp of theory and one foot in the camp of practice and transmits so to speak,
let's call it scientific knowledge, transmits that to the craftsmen in a way that allows
ideas to become technological innovations, that allows knowledge to become technologies
that affect how we live, so Vitruvius is already saying here that the engineer is not a scientist,
that term is anachronistic, I've said that several times but it's just too convenient,
not a natural philosopher of the Greek theoretical sort, let's Archimedes, but that turns out
not to be not so great because Archimedes however reluctantly in fact did apply his theoretical
knowledge to the design and construction of machines although he seemed not to be really
excited about doing that, he liked to just do the theory and on the other side the engineer
was not a craftsman, the engineer guided the craftsman, so this is socially speaking this
is a very interesting distinction that comes out of Vitruvius, now I said that Vitruvius
was a pivotal figure and by that I meant in his own time and by that I meant that one
can look back from Vitruvius and forward from Vitruvius and see how roughly speaking a couple
of hundred years each side, 150 years each side of Vitruvius let's say, there was a substantial
body of techno-science knowledge that was generated, that is to say Vitruvius did not
invent the idea that theory could be linked to practice in ways that led to new kinds
of engines that had never existed before and that did wonderful things.
It looks as though while there were some machine design books that were written in the third
century BCE, it was really in the second century BCE about 150 years before Vitruvius that
there were a number of books that were written by people who linked, who used mathematical
knowledge to design new kinds of machines. Vitruvius refers to a number of these, there
was a Greek named Thessibius of Alexandria who designed, who was the son of a barber
and who designed a number of really quite fascinating machines that were based on using compressed
air and water. He designed a force pump with a cylinder and a piston and a valve that was
able to allow you to compress air, compress water and to use the water and the force driven
air and water in order to drive various kinds of machines. So according to Vitruvius he
built singing blackbirds, he built little model birds that when air was forced through
their mouth openings they trilled and various other kinds of toys which are called automata.
They are sort of self-moving machines and the word automatic comes from that but automata
historically refers to machines that move typically driven by either compressed air
or water and Thessibius invented a whole spate of machines, some of them quite practical
using the force pump. For example, Vitruvius refers to a Thessibius force pump that was
used in Rome for fire engines. That's the way they had fire engines that used Thessibius'
pump, improved versions of Thessibius' pump in order to pump water out for fires. Hero
of Alexandria about 100 years after Vitruvius describes a Thessibius pump that was used
for watering gardens the way you would use a hose today. Almost certainly the pump was
operated by a slave, always helped to have slaves around to make these machines work
as effortlessly as possible for the person who owned them. He also Thessibius invented
as a wide range of machines including a much improved catapult that used bronze springs
in order to get a more powerful to store more energy and release it very quickly which
if you're using a catapult in anger you want to do. So Thessibius' own book has disappeared
but numerous subsequent writers in the ancient world referred to Thessibius' machines and
so we have no doubt and we can actually reconstruct some of these and actually figure out how
these machines worked and whether they worked well from the descriptions that were subsequently
given. There was another machine design author using this kind of sort of mathematical knowledge
named Phylon of Byzantium, sometimes called Phylo, but probably the most important predecessor
of Vitruvius was Archimedes and I already mentioned him in the last lecture as the
historic exemplar of mathematical physicist. I won't go over that and I hope you're convinced
that he was an extremely powerful influence especially since he was the mentor conceptually
of Galileo and Isaac Newton. But Archimedes also made machines and he also developed a
scientific theory of how simple machines, what are called the simple machines of antiquity
work, a scientific theory of how the lever works, a scientific theory of how pulleys
and windlesses and screws and wedges work. The screw doesn't mean what we mean by a screw
but the Archimedean screw is a device for lifting water. If you can imagine a water
wheel that is wrapped around an axle that has a gigantic screw thread in them then you
can move water as the water in a river turns the water wheel, the axle rotates and because
of the screw, the thread pattern on the axle water gets carried, it's like a kind of a
water mill. So Archimedes had a theory which was widely used to build machines. Now he
also had a reputation for building by legend because most of his books were lost but enough
survived so that when they were republished in the Renaissance he had this tremendous
influence on others including Galileo and Newton. But Archimedes was reputed by legend
to have built wonderful machines that emulated the way the planets moved, the way the planets
moved. What we call that an orery, a machine in which, for example, if we take the popular
view then that the earth was the center, how the sun and the moon and the Mars and Mercury
and Venus and Jupiter and Saturn, how they moved around the earth at the right rates
relatively speaking. That's called an orery and nobody believed that he could really do
this. However, in the early 20th century a shipwreck, an ancient shipwreck was explored
off the island of Antikythera off the Greek coast and a device was found completely rusted
and a mess visually called the Antikythera machine which is just because it was found
near the island of Antikythera. It took about 60 years before historians of technology decided
to study this lump of rust and using modern technology today with x-rays and so on, discovered
that this machine was an incredibly complicated collection of gears, very carefully machined
such that it is unquestionably had to be built in accordance with theory but almost certainly
was built to be the driver of an orery to reproduce planetary motions. This is very interesting
for a number of reasons. First of all, wow, it's interesting that they could make a machine
that required that kind of precision in terms of machining and that they had that knowledge
of gear trains which we normally would have associated only with the late Middle Ages but
it also means that they were making machines that embodied ideas. The machine is specifically
designed to show you the power of an idea, namely an astronomical theory. Once the Antikythera
machine was found, then all of a sudden the legends about Archimedes building oreries
for people and having a globe on which the night sky, the positions of the stars in the
night sky were, they now are taken much more seriously that these are not merely ridiculous
legends praising a great figure but that in fact there was this level of competence.
Working forward from Vitruvius, some of the great writers who left books on machine design
in which they again explicitly state that their coupling scientific knowledge as we
call it to practice are a hero of Alexandria who has a, one of whose books that has survived
is called The Pneumatics of Hero of Alexandria and he says in his opening paragraph, the
investigation of the properties of atmospheric air having been deemed worthy of close attention
by the ancient philosophers and mechanists, the former deducing them theoretically the
latter from the action of sensible bodies that means from practice, straight practice,
the mechanics, they know how to do things but they don't understand them. The ancient
philosophers deduced natural phenomena using too much credit. We also have thought proper
to arrange in order what has been handed down by former writers and to add there to our
own discoveries, a task from which much advantage will result to those who shall hear after
devote themselves to the study of mathematics and hero then goes on to describe dozens of
different kinds of machines, some of them including steam power based machines in which
the force of escaping steam is used to make things happen and so hero's book is a very
good insight into the kinds of machines that could be designed and that could be built
in the Roman world and another book of this sort which nevertheless is not very original,
it refers to the designs of earlier technoscientists is a book written about 200 years after hero
by the mathematician Pappus. I want to spend a little time talking about the technological
infrastructure of ancient Rome. Just as in an earlier lecture I tried to suggest how
much awe should be inspired in us by understanding the know how accomplishments of human beings
from about 10,000 BCE down to the Greek period so the technological infrastructure of ancient
Rome was very deep and it really is almost as awesome as all of that cultivation of
cereals and domestication of grain of animals etc. and the metal working technologies. We
would if we were fortunate enough to be born into the ruling class have founded quite comfortable
to live in ancient Rome a city of one million people during the empire that was notoriously
clean. It had at the peak of the empire imperial period 900 public baths distributed around
the cities around the city the water supply into Rome it is estimated amounted to approximately
200 million gallons a day approximately 200 gallons per person in order to flush that
city out there were public toilets all over the city all sewage was underground and flushed
into the Tiber River tough on the river but it made the city nice and clean smell and look
clean and it supported of course all of these other baths as well as residential water which
for those people who could afford indoor plumbing indoor water supply was meter so for example
Pompeii destroyed on an August day in the year 75 we can see in the ruins of Pompeii
that the big homes in Pompeii had metered residential water from a central water supply
and we know a great deal about the water supply of Rome because frontinas who lived about 75
years after Vitruvius was a Roman an educated Roman of high social status who was given the
task by the emperor of renovating the water supply feeding the city because the population was
growing very rapidly and frontinas wrote a book which has survived he himself was not an engineer
but he had to learn enough mathematics in order to understand what how to he's got calculations
about the cost of pipe whether you want lead pipe terracotta pipe nozzles flow rate through
different nozzles because the government taxed the water so it was important to know how much
water was how much water was flowing in the third century the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninas
who was nicknamed Karakala built an enormous bath complex the ruins of which still survive in
ancient Rome the baths of Karakala which covered 33 acres the bath house itself was 750 feet long
and 380 feet wide that's two and a half football fields long and a football field long in width
and contained a series of baths starting with hot and going to lukewarm going to cold going to an
outdoor pool that that could accommodate 1600 bathers at a given time plus the grounds had a
theater they had a library divide into two parts books in the Greek language books in the Latin
language so they were reading rooms for the public containing containing works of literature and one
hopes philosophy and mathematics as well a hundred years later the emperor diacletian built a bath
a public bath that was twice the size of the baths of Karakala that the that could accommodate
over 3000 bathers at a given time so the think of the technology infrastructure necessary to
support the kinds of construction that the Romans did and nevertheless did not deliberately as we
know from documents did deliberately did not want technology to have the power to change social
the social status and so they had a they could build water mills they built one large water mill
complex near Arles in southern France with 16 mills with 16 water wheels but did not pursue
that kind of technology at the level that would change the social system
