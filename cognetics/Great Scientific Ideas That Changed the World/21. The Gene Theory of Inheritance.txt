The gene idea is the solution is a proposed solution to the problem of inheritance. How
is it that offspring so closely resemble their parents most of the time, but then always
in some small ways and some and sometimes in some large ways do not resemble their parents.
So the problem of inheritance is what motivates the gene idea, explaining the transmission
of characteristics of an organism's characteristics. It's not enough to say that well dogs always
give birth to dogs, but the specific type of dog always gives birth to the specific
type of dog well not always because sometimes we discover in the litter that some of the
puppies look very different from the type that the one or both of the parents represent.
So there's always been and in the 19th century especially with the growth of biology as a
science and the focus on the cell there was a sense that now we are beginning to come
close to resolving this truly age old problem of inheritance because like illness inheritance
psychologically is a very meaningful problem to human beings. We need to feel that our
progeny are our progeny. These are my children and in fact even in the legal sense of the
term inheritance we have a need to establish that so and so is truly the offspring of this
particular father, this particular mother. So the problem of inheritance is truly an
age old problem and it became one that scientists believed that they were approaching a solution
to especially in the second half of the 19th century. But there's something really quite
puzzling about the gene that we need to sort of get on the table up front in this lecture
and that is that while the idea of the gene as we commonly understand it took form at the
close of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century. The gene as we commonly
understand it this idea is of a kind of atom, a biological atom of a maybe a better to call
it a black box that controls for a specific characteristic. So you inherit one gene from
the father, one gene from the mother for a specific characteristic for example skin color
or hair color and then the result is depends on some relationship between the gene you got
from the father and the gene you got from the mother and for each characteristic there is a
gene from the one side from one parent and a gene from the other parent and the gene acts as a
kind of atom each gene codes for to use current language a specific characteristic and the result
is a function of the relationship between the genes that you inherit from each of the two parents.
What is sort of ironic is that the name gene that the word gene was coined about 1909 by a
Scandinavian biologist named Wilhelm Johansen and Johansen himself did not believe in the gene as
this kind of an atom as this kind of a discrete particulate unit of inheritance that's a more
correct description a particulate in a unit of inheritance he believed that the process by
which embryos developed the characteristics that they did was much more complex than simply
inheriting one black box from the father per characteristic one black box from the mother
per characteristic it's been anthropomorphic let's say one black box from one parent one black box
for from the other parent for each characteristic and then the the result was something had something
to do with the relationship between those two genes we are familiar for example with the case of
dominant genes and recessive genes but so in 1909 when when the word gene now became current it was
actually being used in in two very different ways it was it was being used to refer to a thing and
a thing that fits very nicely within the atomistic style of thinking that we've been developing in
the last few lectures the atomic theory of matter the germ the cell theory of life the germ theory
of disease even more than the cell in the germ the the gene is is like a physical atom in its
initial conception because it has a really very specific character and at least at the moment
at the time we're more or less indifferent to exactly what goes on inside the gene that gives it
this a capability to code for a specific characteristic the other reference to the word
gene the one that Johann himself preferred was to a to a what he believed to be a complex process
that there was a process in which something in the nucleus played a key role but that the process
himself was much more complex than a black box here in a black box here fusing to provide to
to form a new black box that codes for a specific characteristic and what's ironic is that Johansson
who came to the United States at this time and in order to and lecture at Columbia University it was
exactly at Columbia University where he named where I think in a lecture he named the gene that
Thomas Hunt Morgan who was a geneticist with a laboratory at Columbia University that became
extraordinarily famous that then he moved to California Institute of Technology kept being
famous Morgan at that time 1909 1910 was just shifting from not believing in the gene as an
atom into believing in the reality of the gene as an atom and through his graduates through his
research and his experiments and his graduate students work between 1910 and 1927 effectively
convinced the most of the biology biological community that genes in the sense of black boxes
were in fact real now it turns out that Johansson's intuition was was perhaps more correct than
Morgan's in that today in the wake of the greater knowledge that we have of how the DNA works it
really turns out to be the case that that that genes better refer the word gene refers more
accurately to a complex process than to some kind of unilateral directive that comes from the DNA
molecule and we'll be talking about this later on in the later on in the lecture so like the atom
the the gene had to struggle to become real to become accepted as physically real and this
process more or less took place between roughly 1910 and 1927 when a student of Thomas Hunt
Morgan's Hermann Muller used x-rays to artificially induce mutations in genes and that convinced I
guess the last holdouts that genes must be real that they really must be this encapsulated unit
within the nucleus that is responsible for the inheritance of the transmission of characteristics
the inheritance of specific characteristics because look we can actually we can actually use the gamma
rays from x-rays to gamma gamma ray photons from x-rays in order to change a gene and so well
it's got to be real if you can if you can change it Morgan sort of initiated this this line of
thinking when in 1909 1910 experimenting with fruit flies which have large chromosomes he was
able to his surprise initially to locate a mutation for eye color on a specific chromosome and again
as we saw with the making atoms physically real it was the the process of localization if you
could spatially localize something then it must exist as in as a unit and so he began to believe
that there really were such things as genes that they were located on chromosomes and that that here
he had identified a specific site on a specific chromosome that was responsible for eye color
and that various mutations changed at that specific site were responsible for the eye color of the
fruit flies over the next decade or so he and his students mapped over a hundred mutations in fruit
flies onto specific chromosomes and specific regions of specific chromosomes and in the
process essentially laid down the foundation for the gene theory of inheritance the rules for the
gene theory of inheritance and of course in the process also made the gene seem to be quite real
so that Mueller's work in 1927 was the if you like the smoking gun or it was the occasion that gave
people who were still sitting on the fence a reason for switching although my guess is that by the
late 1910s most geneticists believed that the gene was real and this is jumping ahead a bit in the
story because the gene idea is is quite a complex idea and one that we need to understand the context
of the emergence of that idea just as we did for appreciating the atomic theory of matter the cell
theory of life and the germ theory of disease I started off by pointing out that the gene is the
gene idea is a solution to the problem of inheritance the context of the gene idea is the
problem of inheritance and that's related to the problem of embryological development it's related
to the problem of individual variation why do offspring vary from their parents they're not
always exactly like their parents in fact they're almost never exactly like their parents but they
are like enough that we can say oh there's such a strong resemblance there's such a there is a
family resemblance so the embryological development is important because that's when the organism
acquires its its characteristics the individual variation is important and then the there's a
related problem to this that may not seem immediately obvious and that is the problem of
constancy of type it's a problem to understand what is the mechanism by which the embryo which
seems amorphous especially in the first phase of development shortly after fertilization it just
looks like if you'll excuse the expression a gooey mess how does it how how is it that it forms in
such a way that it preserves constancy of type well we may be more familiar with this expression as
species constancy how is it that species give birth to the same the same species it's as if each
species itself was a kind of an encapsulated unit and it propagated after its kind to use the
expression in in Genesis that everything reproduced after its kind and you didn't have apple trees
giving rise to orange trees they always gave rise to apple trees until human beings intervened and
hybridized in various ways so the issue of the constancy of species is also related to this
question of inheritance so the question of inheritance the problem of inheritance is a broad
problem it's one that deeply concerns us and we see this because even in antiquity there were
theories of inheritance because people people were concerned about this problem and as soon as they
started trying to understand nature one of the problems that was at the forefront of their
inquiries was how do we explain inheritance and so for example Hippocrates the the ancient Greek
physician Hippocrates Hippocrates had a had a theory that was called Pan Genesis that is
they was a kind of a common-sense way that the that the each parent within each parent
organism there is some process by which every every characteristic of the organism has its
representation in the sperm and in the egg that's why it's Pan Genesis it's all Genesis all
developed all all creation that the the fingers the hands the nose the eyes they all are represented
they're mapped on to to use a more modern locution they're mapped on to the sperm in the case of
the father they're mapped on to the egg in the case of the mother one or the other or both although
at the time people thought it was one or the other and that's why the embryo develops the way it
does because it is essentially fleshing out the material that it had acquired from from its
parents now this is somewhat analogous you may remember it when I talked about the atomic theory
of matter to annex agorus's version of atomism in which he thought that every natural object
contained lots of different kinds of atoms they were hair atoms blood atoms bone atoms etc and and
that the process of growth was explained by the extraction of the relevant atoms within each
particular organism so when human beings I think I said a bread so the digestion was a process in
which the bone atoms were extracted from the bread and blood atoms were extracted and that's how we
replenished our blood supply and that's how we we grew our bones and you can see how that would
play out Pan Genesis is a bit like that and in fact in the great poem by Lucretius on the nature
of things that I I mentioned as Lucretius being one of the means by which Epicurus's atomic theory
was propagated to to the future he has explicitly describes Pan Genesis in these annex agorian
terms Aristotle who spent a great deal of his scientific researches in in biology Aristotle
believed that the contribution of the sperm was was was to transmit the form of the offspring of
the parent of the parent the father obviously the form of the father to the egg which only was a
source of nutrient so that the form of the offsprings only came from the father and the role of the
mother was to nurture that form and to give it materiality so that is a view of that is a view
of inheritance that remained influential right right into the early modern period and we'll see
how as we go along so the the problem of inheritance moves into the early modern period together with
the problem of embryological development of the problem and and the problem of constancy of type
embryological development as I pointed out in an earlier lecture in the especially in the 18th
century when when the the root where we find the the roots of modern biology really taking hold
and and and sort of motivating Lamarck at the end of that century to to say to invent the word biology
to refer to the growing range of studies of the nature nature of life embryological development
had sort of left had sort of organized itself into two around two theories the theory of
pre-formationism which I had referred to that the that the that the embryo is fully formed fully
formed in a minute microscopic way scale within either the egg or the sperm of the parent and and so
they were ovists there were those those pre-formationists who believe that the embryo was fully formed
in each egg of the woman and so there's no mystery to development it's just a kind of inflation that
takes place and and others who believe that the that the embryo was fully formed in the sperm cell
and that again in an Aristotelian way that fertilization was the occasion for inflating the
the minute form of the embryo within the within the womb and then there was a separate group
altogether who held that this was nonsense and that the embryo was initially formless and that
acquired form through a process that was called epigenesis in which some force some vital force
some uniquely biological force associated with life selectively caused the the the and the embryo
to develop the specific form that it had the specific limb structure the specific skin color
etc and and that what we needed to understand was that process that selective process by which
form was added to the embryo as it gestated with within the within the womb in the case of mammals
for example within the egg and and that became the that became the key problem because for reasons
that I mentioned in earlier lecture pre-formationism became increasingly increasingly perceived to
be increasingly silly or at least certainly impossible to continue considering so we have
in the 18th century a focus one focus of biological research is on embryological development and
with a with a view to understanding how form is develops in the embryo and this is this is in
fact the question of the inheritance of characteristics inheriting the form characteristics
of the of the parents collateral there is a growing interest in this problem of the
constancy of type there had been in botanical and zoological circles especially since the
from the 16th century on a major major battles intellectual battles fought over what I will
call the taxonomy problem how can we organize the tens of thousands of new forms of plants
and animals that we are beginning to get specimens of as Europeans started traveling around the
world and bringing back to Europe specimens of plants and animals that did not exist in Europe
so all of a sudden old-fashioned ways of books in botany which just listed them all listed them
alphabetically that was a major achievement in the 16th century at least alphabetical ordering
now the books are so big and now we have so many specimens that we have the problem of how
are we going to organize them we talk loosely of genera and species for example later the
terms classes and orders were added and kingdoms and phyla do these represent natural classifications
or are they conventional is there really such a thing as a species or is that just a convenient
way of organizing a group of plants or animals that seem to be very similar to one another and
that breed true to type is breeding true to type a sign that there is a natural system
for classifying plants and animals that the type is a fact about each living thing what
each living individual is an instance of it's an instance of a specific species of a specific
genus of a specific order a specific class etc and this came to something like a head in the in
the 18th century one of the most famous people in this protracted battle over the taxonomy
problem was Carl Linnaeus the Linnaeus system of classification was based on the natural view
that there really are species and genera in nature and that they and that they can be identified
through characteristics of the individual and in fact Linnaeus picked sexual characteristics of
plants in order to identify the species and the genus believing that the sexual character is the
sexual organs of the plants were in a certain sense most fundamental in terms of the reality of
the individual they revealed the type that the individual belonged to at the at the very end
of his life Linnaeus seemed to have acknowledged that in fact his natural system failed and that
after all his organization was conventional not real this is important because if species are
not real then the transmutation of species associated with evolutionary theories is not
that radical the the transmutation of species is only an issue if you in fact believe that there
are natural types that individuals fit into this is analogous to what I early in an earlier
lecture I said Plato said the natural philosopher has to carve nature at its joints that's what
scientists have to do they have to find the natural joints that divide one form of life from
it for an up from another for example in our present context and they have to and then they
have to give names to those they have to give names those natural divisions of things so that
when you say that something is a mammal you're not merely saying it's convenient to call these
creatures mammals you're identifying something fundamental that they all have in common and
that distinguishes them from every other living thing in a way that's rooted in their being not
just convenient so in for example with regard to books we have such things as biology books
as a biography books we have history books we have books in in science we have books about
travel and the question is these categories make sense they describe something about the
books but they do not really distinguish a travel book from a book written in the 18th
century by a biologist who traveled from country to country so and and made observations about
the people and the and their institutions as well as the plants and the animals that in that
country so now we have a book that is historical that's biograph that's biological that's
historical and that's travel so what what category do we put that into so we begin to see that the
categories we generally use are typically conventional not natural now having having said that it is
also the case that these conventional categories do correspond to something in the real world so
this problem this taxonomy problem is related to the problem of inheritance and embryological
development and it raises it brings with it this notion of sexuality that's what Linnaeus had
isolated as the key to understanding the type that individual plants and later animals belong
to and so the question began to be raised in the 18th century is sexuality is the process of
sexual reproduction itself responsible for individual variation and that's the last piece of
the puzzle because in it was in the 18th century that the sexuality of plants was first proposed
by a biologist named Camararius naturalist called Camararius it was very controversial right into
the mid 19th century and and now we have in the 19th century we can see the context out of which the
gene theory the gene idea emerged as a way of of resolving this complex problem involving
embryological development inheritance of characteristics the whole question of the
constancy of types and and we have to add to that the growing sophistication of biological
research using increasingly powerful microscopes that gave biologists insight into the structures of
the cell of the structure of the structure of cells so that especially from 1860 the 1860s on
and increasingly after the 1870s with a new generation of improved microscopes biologists
where I were saying that as Ernst Heichel did in 1866 that that something in the nucleus is
responsible for the inheritance of characteristics that in the in the now in the 1870s in the 1880s
we have Walter Fleming saying that it's it's within the nucleus there's a structure called
the chromosome it's something on the chromosome in the 1880s August Weissman offers what came to
be called the germ plasm theory of disease he published that in a textbook about 10 years later
the germ theory plasm germ plasm theory of inheritance not of disease of inheritance in
which he specifically cites sexual reproduction as the source of of of individual variation that's
something on the chroma a substance on a chrome on the chromosomes is responsible for what we
call genetics and and and isolates the germ plasm that is to say there is some substance that comes
from the father the sperm in the sperm something that comes from the mother in the egg and that
these fuse informing the embryo and and provide and provide the key to the inheritance of
characteristics now everybody knows that Mendel invented genetics so where's Mendel in this story
well that's a really peculiar feature of the history of the gene idea between 1856 and 1865
this Austrian monk working in the city of Bernaud in what was once Czechoslovakia that
Mendel did breeding experiments in order to pursue if possible prove an evolutionary theory that
his biology professor at the University of Vienna Franz Unger had formulated and so he
designed these experiments not with a view to inventing genetics but with a view to exploring
his teachers tech confirming if possible his teachers evolutionary theory quite independent
of of Darwin's because it had not Darwin had did not publish until 1858 1859 so he did these
experiments and he used among other things but primarily 22 varieties of edible peas that
specifically reproduced with constancy to type and he picked the pea because a a Scottish
biologist named Thomas Knight had done a lot of hybridization experiments with edible fruit
trees and and so Mendel who stuck like the who liked Darwin carefully studied hybridization
and crossbreeding experiments that were done over the previous century by by a wide range of
biologists in order to test constancy to type so Mendel did these experiments collected his data
gave a report on them in 1865 to his local historic a natural historical society published them in
their journal which was distributed to a number of prominent people but very few read it and then
drops out of the story he he becomes administratively involved in his monastery and he drops out of
the story it was in the 18 late 1880s early and 1890s that a number of biologists sort of
rediscovered Mendel's work but after they had independently come to the conclusion that genes
were that there was something in the cell something on in the nucleus something on the
chromosomes on chromosomes that that was a discrete unit of inheritance that coded for
specific characteristics with the key idea being the idea of segregation that there is some
specific unit from the mother a specific unit from the father the fusion of these you the
union of these units gives rise to the characteristics that the offspring possesses the
key person was a Dutch biologist named Hugo de Vries and and de Vries published a theory in
1889 which was essentially Mendel's work three years before he discovered Mendel's paper in a
survey of hybridization experiments there was a footnote referring to Mendel and his results and
when he looked it up in 1892 he discovered that he had been he had been scooped so to speak by
Mendel and he gave Mendel full credit for this although obviously this must have been disturbing
to him he was in the course of the rest of the 1890s at least three other biologists also
accidentally rediscovered Mendel after they had formulated their own ideas perhaps Carl
Corinth is the only one who really deserves a parallel credit although de Vries did did more
of the work developed a more sophisticated genetic theory on his own and and a chair mark and Bates
also were studying the same problem and history books often talk about what an amazing thing is
that so many people rediscovered Mendel at the same time but it was really de Vries work because
he then built on this and and published a book on mutation theory in which he argued that mutations
in these genes were responsible for variation and that they were the key to Darwinian evolution not
natural selection and this became a serious debate in the in the early 20th century so now these
people were the ones who named Mendelian genetics they gave Mendel credit for really something
that he had no credit if Mendel had not existed it would not have made the slightest differences
nearly as I can tell to the development of genetic theory and that's a very interesting thing about
the history of science like Copernicus Mendel gets a lot more credit than he deserves in terms of the
actual development of the theory and so now we see how the idea of the gene emerges but in a very
complex form but with a hint that there is something on a chromosome a substance on chromosomes
that is responsible for inheritance and this something initially believed to be a protein
until right through the 1940s becomes in 1953 the DNA molecule of Watson and Crick which by
1957 Crick and Leslie Orgel following a hint from George the physicist George Gamow figured out
our the so-called genetic code as we as we know it we'll be talking more about the specifics of DNA
as the inheritor to what the gene is the the maturation of the gene idea in the in a future
lecture on molecular biology but here we see something of the gene idea as another instance of
the atomistic style of thinking
