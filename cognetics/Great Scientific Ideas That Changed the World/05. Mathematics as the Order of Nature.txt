The idea on which this lecture will focus is that mathematics is the language of nature,
that an understanding of nature entails using mathematics to describe natural phenomena.
Clearly, this is central to the rise of modern science in the 17th century and it is one of the
most fundamental features of what we call hard science today. The ability to express
the theoretical models that a science develops in mathematical language. We see, for example,
that the particle accelerator, a photo of which you see behind me, is a kind of hardware embodiment
mathematical physics. That is to say what the particle accelerator really generates is numerical
data. This is a tremendous machine physically and financially, but in the end what comes out
are strings of numbers that are interpreted according to theoretical models and lead to
the announcement that we have discovered a new constituent of matter, a new particle,
but what we have really discovered, of course, is a mathematical relationship
that we interpret as a sign of the presence of a particular kind of physical particle.
This idea, the idea that mathematics is the essence of nature, that the order of nature is
fundamentally mathematical, is an idea that found its expression and application in ancient Greece
and particularly, as I've mentioned in earlier lectures, particularly at the hands of the man
called Pythagoras, either directly or through the people that came to cluster around him in the
various schools and communities that the Pythagoreans founded and which lasted for centuries in the
ancient world. Pythagoras himself lived in the early 5th century BCE, but for example Plato 100
years later, more than 100 years later, went to a Pythagorean school and Pythagorean schools
continued to exist right into the Roman period. Pythagoras' insight and where he got this from
or what motivated him to do it, we don't know, there are various legends about it, Pythagoras'
insight was that the order underlying all natural phenomena was a mathematical order. Pythagoras
was also responsible in a certain sense for the idea of mathematics itself in the sense in which
we understand mathematics. That is, before Pythagoras, there was an extensive body of, let's call it,
number knowledge. There was an extensive body of Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics that
the Greeks were familiar with that don't qualify for what we mean by mathematics even though these
people knew a great deal about numbers in practical purposes and in specific illustrations.
So for example, there are extant Babylonian and Egyptian texts, Babylonian tablet, clay tablets
with the cuneiform writing that we talked about and Egyptian papyri with the evolved form of
hieroglyphics which moved to increasingly compact and more literary or language writing system.
So a text in which they give quite concrete mathematical problems and give concrete solutions
to them. So they knew very well, for example, that if you have a right angle triangle and two
of the sides are three and four, that the hypotenuse is five. What they did not have was the general
idea that we express as the Pythagorean theorem that for any right angle triangle, the sum of the
squares of the two sides is equal to the sum, the square of the hypotenuse. What we express
algebraically as a squared plus b squared equals c squared, the idea of a generalized mathematics
based on deductive proof that was the genius of the Pythagoreans in antiquity sometime in the
fifth century BCE, that idea transforms number knowledge into what we mean by mathematics.
That form of reasoning that we described as deductive reasoning applied to numbers and the
relationships among numbers leads to mathematics of a universal and general form. We find, for
example, in various Egyptian papyri. There's a one papyrus is called the Rind or Rhine papyrus,
Rhind, in which there are all kinds of examples of summing series and fractions and reducing
fractions and the kinds of problems that we all remember painfully from high school algebra.
For example, one problem in the Rind papyrus is if you have enough money to buy 100 loaves of bread
at 10 cents a loaf, how many loaves can you buy at 45 cents a loaf? Pretty simple. However,
what's called the Moscow papyrus, we find a calculation of the surface area of a hemispherical
basket, a much more sophisticated problem, but again for a concrete case, not a formula for
calculating the surface area of any hemispherical surface, a specific calculation. And in a
papyrus in the museum in Berlin, there's again a high school algebra kind of problem,
again with a specific solution, no attempt at a general solution. If you have a square
whose area is equal to the sum of two smaller squares and the side of one of the smaller
squares is a half plus a quarter the length of the side of the second square, then what are the
dimensions of each of those squares? This problem lends itself to a relatively straightforward
algebraic solution, but they didn't have algebraic solutions. They did have considerable number
of competency. After all, they did a great deal of surveying for the construction projects that
they engaged in. I'm talking about the Egyptians and the Babylonians. The difference was, it sounds
odd to say it, but let's say Pythagoras and mean by that the Pythagorean school, the Pythagorean
school created the very idea of mathematics as a kind of number knowledge in which the goal is
generalized proofs of theorems, which make statements about mathematical objects that are
universal, necessary, certain, timeless. So in that sense, Pythagoras created the idea of mathematics
as we have it, and he also created the idea that it is this kind of mathematical form,
mathematics of this sort, which is the essence of nature. The essence of physical reality is
mathematical form. And one of the ways that Pythagoras developed this idea was through his
discovery as the history books have it, that the distinction between music and noise is
mathematical form, that the distinction between mathematics, between noise and music is mathematical
form. Apparently somehow Pythagoras was moved to recognize that if you, that the difference
between two notes separated by what we call an octave is two to one in terms of the length of a
string that is required to generate that tone. If you have a length of string, that's if he
apparently built a monochord with a movable fret. If you have a string that's long enough
to when plucked to give you let's say middle C. If you then half the length of the string by moving
the fret so that it's exactly halfway, the string is half as long and you pluck now half the string,
you will get C octave higher. If you double the length, you get C an octave lower and similarly
for every other note. But much more than that, if you start with middle C and you vary the length
move the fret and you pluck the string, you will find that the notes of the octave correspond to
precise fractions of the original string length so that the difference between the notes of the
octave are all mathematical proportions. A fifth is three to two, a fourth is four to three.
The difference and you can in this way, using these fractions, you can generate all the notes
of the octave. This was a tremendous discovery, it really was, but it also had a tremendous
impact on Pythagoras and on the school of Pythagoreans for whom this was a concrete illustration.
This was a verification of the underlying idea that mathematics is the order of the world,
that matter would exist in a chaotic and formless state unless it were informed by mathematical
patterns. This leads to a kind of mathematical metaphysics, that mathematics which is utterly
orderly and completely rational from a Greek deductive reasoning perspective in the way
that we discussed in an earlier lecture, but it also generates serious problems,
problems that ultimately became very disturbing to the Pythagorean community and in fact reinforced
certain mystical and religious aspects of the community because Pythagoras and his followers
formed something like communes throughout the Mediterranean, the Greek Mediterranean,
and over a period of centuries these communes developed their own social structures and their
own school system in order to teach the Pythagorean blend of mathematics, mysticism, religion and
philosophy. The problem, it sounds funny to us, but the problem if you believe that the underlying
order of reality is mathematical, consider the following situation. Imagine that you have
a square, for convenience we'll say a unit square but it affects every square that there is.
If you have a square and the side of a unit square is one, one inch, one foot, one meter,
it doesn't matter, it's one, then the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem,
the length of the diagonal is the square root of two, one squared plus one squared is equal to two
so the the length of the diagonal of a square with unit side is the square root of two.
That would be okay except that the Pythagoreans were able to prove that the square root of two
is what was for them an irrational number, a non-rational number, it could not be expressed
as a ratio, as a fraction with whole numbers in the numerator and the denominator. They were able
to prove, deductively prove that that was the case but for them given their let's call it simplistic
mathematical metaphysics, the mathematical forms that they believed were the essence of reality
were based on whole numbers. Those were real numbers and in fact that name real numbers attached to
the integers for millennia and and other kind of numbers like imaginary numbers which were
developed in the late Renaissance and early modern period by mathematicians were called
imaginary, subsequently the name was changed to complex numbers because imaginary has pejorative
overtones, they could not be part of what made nature rational but you could build a square,
you could build a square out of copper, you could build a square and that means that the diagonal
of a physically square object is irrational but then the implication is that there's something,
even though it's it's subtle, there's something ultimately irrational about reality.
Furthermore, the paradigm of the order of the way that mathematics orders chaos,
transforming noise into into music also turns out to suffer from a similar problem,
the Pythagorean tuning system works wonderfully for generating octaves, so you've got the note C, D,
go through the notes of the octave, if you play around with the monochord and you double the
length you have, you'll get all the octave notes, perfect, it works perfectly but when you start
using the fractional notation in order to generate fifths and thirds and fourths etc,
then after you apply them several times, it turns out that the chords which
sounded harmonious and one octave no longer sound harmonious when you get up two or three octaves
higher or two or three octaves lower. Again, for those of you who are not into music, you may not
you may not have thought of this and it may take a while to take to understand how serious this was
but for 2,500 years now, tuning systems, the mathematics of tuning systems has been extremely
controversial in western cultural circles, people obviously who compose and perform and perform
music. There is such a thing as Pythagorean tuning which stays as close as possible to the Pythagorean,
the particular Pythagorean mathematical formulation of harmonies and then there's something called
mean tone tuning and just tuning and equal temperament tuning, Bach's well tempered clavier
is one episode in this continuing saga of trying to find a tuning system in which notes will remain
have the same harmonious relationship as you move from octave to octave and I will mention now in
anticipation of a later lecture Galileo's father Vincenzo Galilei was an active participant in the
late 16th century in what was sometimes a vicious controversy, in fact it was quite often a vicious
controversy in cultural circles over how musical instruments should be tuned and especially as
musical instruments became more complex when we had a wide range of string instruments and wind
instruments and organs later the harpsichord and the piano, how should they be tuned so that when
a composer writes out a string of notes that they will sound from the instrument as harmonious as
they were conceived in the mind of the composer, in fact this led to a distinction which was very
important for Kepler between what you might call theoretical music, music that was never meant to be
performed and an instrumental music which needed to be performed but which always had some kind of
imperfections if you tune to get perfect fifths then you're going to have slightly sour thirds
and sixths if you tune to get perfect thirds and sixths then you're going to have slightly off octaves
and and fifths you can't you can't have it you can't have it always in fact the system that we use
today eventually is one of equal-temperate tuning i won't go into the details of that but what's
interesting is that Galileo's father was an early champion of equal-temperate tuning back in the
late 16th century he wrote a book in 1580 came out in 1582 called a dialogue, remember Galileo
himself published a famous book that starts off with the word dialogue, dialogue considering the
turning of two great world systems, the one that got him prosecuted by the inquisition.
His father wrote a book called dialogue between ancient music and modern music
in which he argued against the Pythagorean system and against his one-time mentor and friend
Giuseppe Zarlino that we needed to shift to an equal-tempered system and in that book and in a
later book in 1589 Vincenzo Galilei actually used mathematical experimentation in mathematics to
prove that the Pythagorean school and tuning system which was based on this beautiful inside of
mathematical proportions was a myth that as a matter of fact unless two strings are absolutely
identical in terms of material composition and tension you cannot reproduce you cannot get the
same notes by simply making sure that that the lengths are the same so he did a very substantial
series of experiments very interesting that his father did this and Galileo did similar kinds of
similar kinds of experiments and he showed that he used experiment to show that the Pythagorean
tuning system was based on an idealization that cannot be realized so this to step back for a
moment what we're dealing with here is the idea of mathematical physics the idea that ultimately
nature is mathematical this idea in the 17th century took the form for example of Descartes
identification of geometry with physical space which is somewhat echoed in Einstein's general
theory of relativity in which geometry of space and geometry and space become identical and in
Galileo's our Galileo's claim that the language of nature is mathematical and its characters are
circle squares triangles etc this was a Pythagorean idea which Galileo called platonic because as I
suggested earlier by the Renaissance period Pythagorean teachings which had been revived in
the late Middle Ages and Renaissance became associated with mysticism with what's called the
Hermetic tradition and later with Kabbalah as that became translated from Hebrew into Hebrew
and Aramaic into Latin in the in the 16th and 17th centuries then mysticism picked up a lot of
Pythagorean motifs that somehow the secrets of nature were contained in number and that and this
was associated with various mystical teachings so Galileo this had all kinds of problems from the
point of view of the church and and heresy so Galileo and others called the mathematical
interpretation of physics of nature physics in the broadest sense of nature called it a
platonic interpretation rather than a Pythagorean interpretation now we already have discussed
the fact that this is kind of a this is sort of misleading because Plato in fact believed that
knowledge of nature was not possible because he did not believe that mathematical forms
could in fact exist within nature that they were they existed in in a kind of a non physical
spatial place at some some non-place physically speaking and and were independent of and superior
to nature they they were relevant to nature but they were not in fact the underlying stuff of
nature there was no mathematical metaphysics underlying science for Plato there was for
Pythagoras but nevertheless the revival of Pythagorean ideas right into the 20th century
there's Pythagoreanism is alive and well in string theory today for example and Roger Penrose is one
of the most is one of the most eminent mathematical physicists of the generation is pretty open about
being a platonist but really it's it's really being a Pythagorean Pythagoras and his school
were extremely active in the development of Greek mathematics and science over the next several
hundred years for example it was Pythagoras because of his mathematical metaphysics it was
because of this conviction that the underlying reality of nature was mathematics who argued
that it must be the case that all heavenly bodies including the earth are spheres because a sphere
is the most beautiful solid it has the most perfect symmetry and it has the perfection
notice this is a this is an aesthetic judgment which because it is mathematical is is identified
with physical reality it is that solid that contains the greatest volume for the smallest
surface area and this is a former perfection which which which Pythagoras just assumed
must be part of the physical world so the earth was a sphere in fact whatever you may
have been taught in high school no educated person in Columbus's generation believed that the earth
was flat and in the in ancient Greece it was a standard it was a standard teaching Aristotle
tosses off three different proofs that the earth is earth is a sphere but it was he had to prove it
because he didn't accept the Pythagorean idea that mathematics was the essence of physical reality
so he needed to give physical proofs for the sphericity of the earth for example looking at
the looking at the shadow cast by the earth onto the moon during a lunar eclipse onto the moon's
surface so you can see that the surface of the earth is a section of a circle which he said
shows that the earth is spherical he also gave a simple argument that when you see a ship sail
away from a port then what happens when the ship gets further and further away from you
it doesn't get smaller and smaller and smaller first the hull disappears then the lower sails
disappear and then the highest sail tops disappear which shows that the surface of the earth is
curved and that the ship as it's sailing away from you is dropping down so to speak below
below the horizon he also gives us somewhat more sophisticated proof having to do with the
change in the position of the stars as you move from let's say the equator towards the north pole
although of course he never went to the equator he never went to the north pole but they but
Greeks did compile the statistics about the positions of the stars in the sky as a function
of latitude as you move let's say from lower Egypt to to central Europe so the Pythagoreans
argued that the shape of each of a planetary body and all of the stars or the all they were
really concerned about was the earth and the sun and the moon and the and the planets they were
all spheres and they moved in circular patterns because a circle is the most beautiful line to
follow for the same reason namely a circle is that shape where you get you can close the largest
area for any given line length you cannot encompass as much area if you're given a line
to work with and you want to enclose the greatest possible area making a sphere a square or a
triangle or a rectangle won't do it a circle will do it so that's a perfection of the circle and
it seemed from a mathematical point of view that the planet should move in uniform at a
uniform speed I mean why should they slow up why should they why should they speed up so
slow why should they slow down why should they speed up so Pythagorean astronomy was based on
the idea that the planets move at uniform speeds in circular paths this ferricity is
relatively irrelevant for us now it says so what what's the big deal the big deal is that for the
next 2000 years right up to and including Galileo this became the central problem for astronomers
to us it's I once called this the chicken little syndrome in the history of science
why would you believe such a thing when in fact the Greeks themselves know Pythagoras himself
know that this assumption these assumptions do not match the way the star the planets actually
move across the night sky the outer planets for example at various times stop go backwards and
go forwards again which we understand because the earth overtakes them in there as the earth orbits
the sun but they believe the earth was stationary and so this is a really curious and for us
powerful reinforcement of the idea that that mathematical physics is an idea first it's not
a discovery because here we have an idea that flatly contradicts empirical experience and
nevertheless the math the mathematical problem that Pythagoras posed for astronomers was accepted
as legitimate for the next 2000 years and the task was how can you come up with a theory
how can you come up with a theory that in which the planets actually move around the earth at
uniform speeds in circular paths even though it doesn't look that way so you've got to match
the way the observational data to the underlying mathematical model of what's really happening
we see the planets moving at irregular speeds but really they're moving at regular speeds as you
can see on my mathematical model which has to be able to predict what we actually observe
and this is just incredible that people didn't step back and say wait a minute why don't we just
start with the data and make a model that matches the data with and without making these assumptions
even Galileo could not break the hold of sphere of you of circular orbits at uniform speeds
Copernicus's theory which lets the earth move retains circular orbits and uniform speeds
it's still Pythagorean and as a result after the first chapter of his great book of 1543
the next nine chapters are incredibly complicated because in fact circular orbits and uniform
speeds don't match what we observe so he has to invent a system in which the planetary bodies
including the earth move in much more complicated patterns that observationally generate the data
that we see and therefore his theory comes when you actually use it astronomically is not that
much simpler and no more accurate than the theory of Ptolemy in the second century who was so to
speak the perfect expression the ultimate the climactic expression of the Pythagorean problem
in astronomy was solved by Ptolemy in a using a mathematical model extremely complicated with
epicycles on epicycles and plant but in which the planets moved and at uniform speeds in circular
paths and and was able to predict with an accuracy that was reasonable before the telescope was
invented where you could expect Mars to be tonight tomorrow the night after where you could expect
Jupiter and Saturn and Mercury and Venus to be in the night sky work better for the outer planets
and that Ptolemy's theory which was central to the curriculum of the Islamic and medieval
Christian universities was the standard was the gold standard of mathematical physics until
Copernicus challenged it but using Pythagorean assumptions which were really only overthrown
by Kepler who said that you know they don't move in circular orbits they move in elliptical orbits
and they don't move at a uniform speeds planets change their speed as they go through their orbits
moving more slowly more slowly when they're further away from the Sun more rapidly when they're near
the Sun and Galileo found this ridiculous how ugly it was Newton who showed that Kepler's
version of Copernicus's idea was in fact correct because it follows directly from the universal
theory of gravity we'll be talking about that in a later lecture our focus here is on the rise of
the idea of mathematical physics I've I focused on the Pythagoreans and the Pythagorean schools were
of course they were not homogeneous in their ideas Aristarchus of Samos in antiquity
a sort of a late Pythagorean suggested that maybe the earth moves around the Sun and maybe it's not
the center and astronomy would be a lot more simple if we set recognize that the Sun was the
center not the earth Copernicus himself says he got the idea for his theory by reading about
Aristarchus of Samos's suggestion within the text of perhaps the greatest mathematical physicist of
the ancient world Archimedes who who lived in the third century BCE and who developed a mathematics
based methodology for solving problems in physics he was the founder of hydrostatics he wrote on
the theory of machines he invented the concept of center of gravity and calculated the center of
gravity of of pretty complicated mathematical objects which could then be built for example
the center of gravity of a ship and so that had an implication for designing the hull of a ship
once you understood that the center of gravity was important to the way that the ship responded
when it when it turned for example so Archimedes solved a wide range of problems in mathematics
he's generally considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all times anticipating the
integral calculus with a kind of a quick and dirty geometric solution to the to the problem
of calculating the area contained by a curve which is what integral calculus is all about
subsequently sort of invented by Newton and Leibniz at the end of the in the late 17th century
Archimedes was truly a mathematical physicist and his writings when they were translated into
Latin and published in the Renaissance period had a tremendous influence by their own admission
on Galileo and on Newton both of whom refer to Archimedes as in a certain sense the exemplar
of what a scientist should be doing using deductive reasoning and mathematics mathematical
reasoning of the deductive sort and mathematics in order to not just describe but to expose
the mathematical patterns that are the essence of physical reality so this idea which is so
central to modern science we find developed to a considerable extent as an idea within ancient
Greek culture
