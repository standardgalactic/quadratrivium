You may have thought it ironic that the humanists concerned with literary and aesthetic sensibilities
were the ones who introduced the idea of progress into modern Western culture, subsequently
incorporated by science and technological innovation, and it is perhaps even more ironic that the
renaissance, the rebirth of the idea of techno-science after approximately 1200 years from the Roman
period until the 15th century was largely the work of the great painters of the Renaissance,
that the great painters of the Renaissance in retrospect, we see that they exploited
a mathematical technique for depicting the content of the painting in a way that was
then and we still consider naturalistic, realistic.
It was that incorporation of mathematics into the production, if I may use that expression
of art that was associated with, contributed to the renaissance of the idea of techno-science
and it didn't leave after the 16th century with the maturation of this artistic technique
and the other forms in which mathematics became increasingly coupled to technological innovation.
So that's why the idea of renaissance of techno-sciences can be seen to be revived
in the renaissance and applied, it is manifested in the use of mathematics in order to develop
new kinds of technologies.
Now the orthodox art historical view is that in approximately 1415, somewhere around 1415,
the Florentine artist, architect Filippo Brunelleschi, after a trip to Rome, returned
to Florence with, having rediscovered somehow, the technique of central vanishing point perspective
drawing.
That's a mouthful but we all know what it means.
That means a technique for depicting, using foreshortening and the convergence of ostensibly
parallel lines in a painting so that the eye is fooled into seeing as a depth on the surface
of the canvas so that when you look at the surface of the canvas you see the scene depicted
inside the painting recede into the background although of course we know it's right there
on the surface of the canvas and the way that you do this is by applying a particular mathematical
technique.
Brunelleschi brought that technique back to Florence as I said and it was subsequently
used in a masterful way by Massaccio in a series of frescoes and it caught on to put
it mildly.
It spread at least as rapidly as the spread of printing of the printed book in the second
half of the 15th century.
This is now happening in the second quarter of the 15th century roughly speaking from
about 1425 which is I think when Massaccio painted those frescoes by the end of the century
everybody was painting in this style and the style is a fundamentally mathematical one
and we see this for example that in the fact that the great artist Piero della Francesca
who was also a mathematician wrote mathematical treatises but he also wrote a handbook for
artists teaching them the mathematical technique, the mathematical trick without meaning anything
pejorative by that of how to paint the content of a painting in a way that causes the viewer
to see depth and not just depth but to see objects depicted as the physical eye sees
objects depicted.
This technique, the mathematical basis of this technique was then the subject repeatedly
the subject of handbooks throughout the century notably by Leone Alberti and Luca Pacioli.
Pacioli was a great friend of Leonardo da Vinci who was a master of this technique but
by that time everybody was doing it and you had to be a master to stand out because everybody
who was painting was painting using this technique and at a certain level the technique is mechanical
especially nowadays with the tools that we have available for looking behind the paint
on a canvas to the underlying canvas we can see the grids of lines that the painters made
called pentamento we can see the grids of lines that the painters first laid down in
which each box of the grid as you go up the canvas becomes foreshortened in a strictly
mathematically proportioned way which in order to create this effect and then of course there
is the additional point you have to have central vanishing point in the painting that aligned
towards which the lines of the painting converge and painters displayed their talent in this
regard by often making paintings in which there were patterned tile floors let's say
in a cathedral or in a large room so that you could see alternate black and white tiles.
Now we know that at some level that these tiles all have parallel lines on their sides
and yet what gives it the impression of depth is that those ostensibly parallel lines in fact
converge on a point the point that the artist wants to depict the scene from and that the viewer
then responds to by sort of recreating the depth that the artist saw in the when he or she set up
that scene so this technique is just there's no argument about this Renaissance painting means
the exploitation of central vanishing point perspective drawing what's interesting about
this from our point of view in this course is that there is a real relationship between the
adoption of central vanishing point perspective and the rise of modern science and in particular
to the role that mathematical physics played within modern modern science because what's
happening here is we are seeing not just the dissemination of an artistic an artistic technique
what we're seeing is an identification of mathematics with reality and an identification
of reality with the material world with the natural world from writings and from the surviving
frescoes at Pompeii we have a very good idea that in the ancient Greek world and certainly in the
Roman world artists knew how to draw in this way Plato or his mouthpiece Socrates of and even in
the passage that I referred to that I read from earlier in this course Socrates refers to painting
as a simulation of reality that Plato and Socrates were critical of painters who who represented
scenes in a way that fooled the eye into thinking that they were looking at a real scene Plato refers
to the painter Zoixus for example a contemporary painter who was so talented that he painted a
bunch of grapes on a painting and birds dropped down out of the sky and tried to snatch the grapes so
Plato refers to the fact that well Socrates in the dialogue refers to the fact that people praise
Zoixus for this but Socrates thinks this is really terrible fooling people into thinking what is that
what is not real is real is a fundamental crime to a philosopher because what we really need to
understand is the nature of what is ultimately real and for Plato as you well know by now for
Plato the ultimately real is not natural cannot be captured in the natural it is super natural it
is these ideal forms and to be fooled into taking as real material objects that's not that's just a
trick and it's not a very praiseworthy trick at that from the references of Vitruvius in his book
ten book on ten books on architecture to the refers to scene painting in theaters for example and I
refer to the the discipline called scenography which is which seemed to rely on this kind of
naturalistic depiction but then we have concrete evidence from the frescoes that have survived at
Pompeii which was inundated with ash volcanic ash when Vesuvius erupted in August of 75 that the
frescoes with many of which are exist in museums today and certainly available for looking at in
books those frescoes are clearly painted using this kind of naturalistic representation in which
there is in which the eye sees a depth that of course is not there so that there is a question
that has to be raised about why between let's say somewhere around the second third century and
the 15th century when Brunelleschi rediscovered this technique why it disappeared what happened well
it just disappeared people forgot how to do it that's one response another is and I think Islam
what more plausible one is that the the society especially we're talking now about the Christian
society of Europe in the period from the collapse of the Roman Empire until the Renaissance did
like Plato did not attribute ultimate reality to the natural world so that it was not praiseworthy
to make paintings that depicted the material world in its materiality the rise of central
vanishing point perspective and not just the rise the immediate and almost total embrace of
central vanishing point perspective as truth in art reflects an identification of the natural
with the real and it tributes value to the real it says now I'm going to show things the way they
really are in business in Byzantine painting in Romanesque painting and Gothic painting there
is no attempt to fool the eye into thinking the surface is flat no attempt to fool the eye into
thinking that it is looking at a materially real object it's to get the mind to respond to the
symbolism in the painting and to think and and to recognize the religious value to think
thoughts that are associated with religious values and this is clearly reflected in the fact
that the faces of paint of people in these paintings are sort of generic faces and the and
the landscapes are generic landscapes there was no attempt by the painters in the 10th 11th 12th
13th centuries to to capture a specific landscape as you would see it if you went out and stood in
the spot where the artist stood or to depict the people in the painting in with with their specific
individuality when you identify the natural the real with the natural that means you're identifying
the real with the material then as we have seen right from the beginning of this course we're
talking about individuality it is the the forms are universal but individual but the objects of
our experience are all characterized by individuality the philosophical tradition thought that the
individuality could be glossed over because we want to get behind the individual to the universal
that allows us to have knowledge even of the individual thus an Aristotle for example we
talked about his theory that the mind has the ability to identify the universal within the
individual then you can forget the individual dog or tree or person and philosophize develop a
science based on the universals that you have abstracted from experience but when you identify
reality with with the material world then individuality becomes a value because that's the sign of
the the new realism and in fact this is the case in Renaissance painting that it becomes intensely
individualized on both sides of the equation that the content becomes individualized and we see
portraits and we see portraits of people who are who are depicted as they so to speak really are
often with their flaws they're not all made beautiful they are depicted in their individuality
landscapes are painted as if you could actually see that scene if you were sometimes they're
imaginary landscapes but they are depicted in a way as if you were looking out a window onto a
scene that by the way is why pictures develop paintings developed frames the frame of a painting
originally was supposed to be a window casement an example of so that you when you looked at the
painting you you could think that you were looking out the window onto a scene that you could reason
that you could see because it was it was the kind of thing that you did see when you looked out a
window sitting aside the specifics of the of the content of course so with what we're talking about
here is not merely an artistic technique it is the embrace of the artist just as it was the embrace
of printing with movable metal type that is the social phenomenon that is of interest to us and
that is associated with the power of the book in western society so it is the response to this
technique that needs to make us step back and we have to respond to that response the technique
per se is much less important than the fact that it was essentially universally embraced which
reflects now i'm returning to a theme that i introduced when we talked about the 12th century
renaissance the theme of secularism of attributing value to the secular the natural the material
depicting fabrics with loving accuracy depicting silks in rich colors and the folds of the silk
exactly the way the way fabrics drape over the body became an extraordinary skill this is the
way that artists showed how good they were leonardo's mastery of light and shadow the ability to
capture the shape of the human body exactly when when you bend an arm the wrinkles that form the
way the muscles respond this is a kind of this is a peon this is these are poems of these paintings
are poems of praise to materiality interesting and in fact it should start be startling to us
many of the great paintings of the renaissance many most of the great painters of the renaissance
if not all of them were subsidized were commissioned by church officials and very often not just
it was routine for these officials to commission paintings with pagan content
paintings of greek scenes from greek mythology for example are in all the museums
any museum you go to you go to see the renaissance paintings you will see religious paintings but
you will also see paintings of greek mythology and of course the individual portraits that we saw
now on that's on the content side of the equation there was this intense individualism
individuality to the content and the technique of central vanishing point perspective drawing
enabled that and there was and there was this embrace of the secular the natural and the
material again i do not i'm not denying that the surrounding culture was faith-based but within
that context we again see this aggressive assertion attributing value to the material
i mean it may seem like a small point but when you think of how much effort and genius is expended
on the depiction of the the the silk cape wrapped around a cardinal shoulder in a particular renaissance
painting then the the viewer is not responding oh what a holy man he is wow you you it almost feels
like you could touch that silk the eye it's almost if your eye is caressing the folds of
of that garment it's so realistic from the other side of the equation the artist side of the equation
we see the same kind of individuality georgio vasari and is and is very famous and influential
lives of the famous architect painters architect sculptors and architects vasari points out starts
off by saying you know something really incredible has happened to art in an hour time in the in the
15th century and that is that artists all of a sudden became what we will call i'm going to call
egomaniacs they wanted fame in the past artists made great religious paintings and sculptures
and nobody knows who did it nobody knows who built the gothic cathedrals for example by and large
they and and certainly many of the great paintings of the of the romanesque and gothic period that
have survived are simply called the master of x the master of this painting the master of that
painting they're not signed but when you get to the renaissance the painters want everyone to know
i painted this painting michael angelo was obsessed with getting credit for his paintings and sculptures
he was not a painter he was an artist michael angelo is expressing here this same
attribution of value to the individual that has subsequent political consequences and
but what we're concerned about here primarily is the identification of the real with the natural
and the identification of mathematics as the means by which the natural the real can be captured
the natural is the real mathematics captures the natural mathematics captures the real
mathematics is the language of reality now that's just it seems to be putting a very heavy burden
on painting after all that doesn't seem like a a a vehicle that can carry that particular
that particular burden but if that were the only case then it would be very hard to argue
but as a matter of fact contemporaneously reinforced by the legacy of the medieval
university curriculum at oxford and pat and university university of oxford and and the
university of paris and university of padua especially the idea of a mathematical of applying
mathematics to the study of natural phenomena that was part of the legacy of the educated
15th and 16th century person but there was the humanists that were feeding in texts of vitruvius
and not just ptolemy's astronomy which everybody knew about had known about before but now they had
rediscovered ptolemy's geography now ptolemy's geography which had been unavailable for a
thousand over a thousand years ptolemy's geography had a profound influence because in that book not
only do we see that the romans had what are described in the book because they didn't survive
because they didn't survive of detailed maps of the world extending from england to india
but ptolemy describes in there how to depict on a two-dimensional map the three-dimensional
surface of the earth in a way that preserves the spatial relationships so that when you look at
the relationship between london and rom on the flat map you can actually uh it it it it reflects
the actual relationship of london and rom on the surface of the earth which is of course a sphere
as i mentioned before everybody knew so that's an interesting technical problem how do you depict
accurately on the surface on a two-dimensional surface a flat map how do you depict three-dimensional
spatial relationships that too turns out to be a mathematical technique and in the 16th century
as ptolemy's geography book was disseminated and as the portuguese voyages of discovery
subsequently the spanish and the british voyages of discovery and the french and italian in the
early 16th century started people needed better maps and they needed maps of areas that nobody
knew about before so mathematical cartography became a cottage industry in the 16th century
the most famous illustration of that for us the one that we tend to be most familiar with
are the maps of gerard mercator the mercator projection is a a an adaptation of the um
ptolemy's technique for depicting the surface of the earth three-dimensional the curved surface of
the earth accurately on a on a two-dimensional surface now it turns out there's no one projection
that will satisfy everybody's needs in a mercator projection of course since you you've essentially
flattened out the the globe in a certain way so at the poles the relationships on the map there
are no connection to the relationships in on the surface of the earth but for the latitudes that
are most important to human beings who are traveling so between roughly speaking the
arctic circle and the Antarctic circle those are pretty accurate and uh and and so mercator's
projection became one of the standard projections for navigators for people who were traveling
and especially traveling by sea so mathematical cartography was another illustration of how uh
of how mathematics is capturing reality now mercator tried to keep his technique a secret
but eventually it uh it leaked out and and a technique of doing of doing this of of doing
this in a kind of a simple way of depicting the surface of a sphere on a two-dimensional surface
was developed uh very in the early 17th century was published in the early 17th century in England
and and that sort of took the whole trick away and then anyone could make could make such a map
mathematical geocartography goes together with mathematical navigation we're sailing all over
the world now the first round the world voyage was 1535 by Ferdinand Magellan uh 1522 by Ferdinand
Magellan now uh when you're going when you're sailing in the open ocean you're not coasting
along when you're not sailing along the coastline as before the centrally mounted stern rudder was
introduced when you're sailing in the open ocean you need navigational tools and the
navigational tools are mathematical they derive from astronomy in fact the the great 16th century
british or english voyagers of discovery were all trained the navigator the pilots of those ships
were all trained well many of them were trained by a man named john d who was one of these renaissance
humanists but who subscribed to the sort of magical tradition uh he was a one of the leading
mathematicians of in england at the time uh he was responsible for the first english translation
of euclid's geometry uh was paid for by a businessman named henry billingsley but but d was the guy
who actually did it and uh d who also designed machines for for theatrical performances along
the lines of the ancient greeks he recovered that knowledge of of uh that are described in heroes
pneumatica and other books by hero alexandria that i mentioned uh in an earlier lecture
and and designed such machines d trained was was was was known to the crown and was and was hired
to train uh navigators uh pilots to use the techniques of of mathematical navigation concurrently
concurrently there is a revival of mathematical music theory in the uh 15 16th and 17th centuries
so to the extent that we now have that we have a in during the renaissance period a a revival of
this pethagorean notion that that music and and the mathematical structure of music somehow reveal
the secret structure of the universe of of nature and ultimately of the universe and that is a
very real theme in in renaissance and early modern thought then of the the revival of mathematical
musical theory i mentioned for example galileo's father vincenzo was centrally involved in these
controversies which which were raging at the time and and almost everybody who was anybody
intellectually and scientifically and mathematically had something to say on this subject
kepler's greatest book by his own uh in his own eyes was his harmonies of the world of of 1619
in which explicitly tries to actually compose the musical chords that that are sounded by the
planets given their mathematically correct relationships so this was another way in which
mathematics borderline magical mystical but another way in which mathematics was perceived to be
connected to to reality concurrently concurrently there there was i believe stimulated by central
vanishing point perspective drawing a renaissance of machine design books remember in in antiquity
i referred to the fact from about the third century bce until about the third century c there was a
flurry of books by people like tessibius and and philo of alexandria and a strato of lamp seicus
who was associated with a book that that used to be attributed to Aristotle and and archimedes
vitruvius frontinas's book on the aqueducts of rome heron of alexandria's machine design book the
pneumatica that i read the opening paragraph from and pappas's book or try and sort of summarizing
the the machine design books of other of his predecessors they there was a flurry of these
machine design books and then the that particular genre sort of disappeared in the in the 15th 16th
centuries machine design books now using the new techniques of central vanishing point perspective
became popular again and and people that we would now call predecessors of modern engineers or
early modern engineers if you like people like augustino romelli and mariano tacola and dominico
fontana published books of machines with with with exploded and cutaway views so that you could
actually if you were a mechanic you could take that drawing and make a copy of that machine
because you could now see the machine in its three dimensionality this application of central
vanishing point perspective drawing to uh uh to uh engineering quickly became formalized
mathematically the idea that this is oh this is a mathematical technique that that engineers and
mechanics need in order to build the more complicated machines that technology was was capable of
allowing people to build became formalized as as as early as 1629 in what's called projective
geometry a mathematical theory of of of the depiction of three-dimensional objects so that
the complexity of a three-dimensional object can be depicted in in a series of two-dimensional
drawings so what we roughly mean by engineering drawing uh when blaze pascal and a uh and a
friendship another friendship named girard published books that gave the mathematical theory so to
speak of engineering drawing and then from then on that's what guided engineering drawing but that
emerges out of the application of central vanishing point perspective technique to uh to designing
and machines and and then you could invent all kinds of machines in your head
some of them maybe could be built some not look at leonardo i mean they're not as notebooks are
filled with imaginary machines the overwhelming but not almost none of which were ever built i
let's say effectively none of which were built some of them would work some of them wouldn't work
fact is nobody knew about them at the time so uh the uh this was another area in which mathematics
became coupled to the uh physically real things can't get much real than uh then
then machines that work in the society in which you live uh i mentioned dominico fontana uh for
example dominico fontana was given the contract to move and one of the greatest construction
projects in europe of all time was the creation of the vatican and the saint peter's cathedral
so one of the things that got in the way of building the uh the cathedral was a gigantic obelisk
that the roman emperors had had shipped from egypt where it had been erected in the in the
approximately 900 bce it weighs over 700 000 pounds they had it shipped to roam and put up in
roam the emperor caligula had it put up in in roam uh and uh and there it stood but now it
was in the way of saint peter's cathedral so it had to be moved it had to be moved approximately
seven uh 260 yards so let's call it 700 800 feet but it weighs 737 000 pounds approximately
so dominico fontana got the contract to do this and did it using uh a a series of machines that he
adapted to this purpose and without a knowledge of mathematics this this could not have been done
and we know from the book that he wrote describing this whole process how carefully he made his
calculations uh which involved in the end over 900 man and uh 40 windlesses pulled by uh uh it
seems approximately four horses per windlass and this had to be coordinated precisely because
that obelisk was if it breaks then there's no there's no second chance so what we uh um
sort of summarize what we see initiated by renaissance artists with the recovery of central
managing point perspective drawing by the response of the society by painters and the society the
value the values that they placed on this depiction of nature as the real we see the introduction
of an identification with mathematics with reality that flourishes that becomes a a foundation of
math of modern science in the 17th century
