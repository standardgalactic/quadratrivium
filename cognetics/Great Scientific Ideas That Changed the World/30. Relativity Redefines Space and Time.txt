In 1905, and again in 1915, Albert Einstein decisively altered the direction of physics,
which is why he has the reputation that he has.
It was not just because he told good jokes.
In 1905, Einstein published a paper on the Brownian motion, which I've referred to before,
which is the apparently random motion of tiny particles suspended in a fluid, and used that
analysis of the Brownian motion to make a case for calculating the size of molecules.
This paper, actually as part of a series of papers on the Brownian motion,
contributed significantly to the acceptance by physicists of the reality of atoms,
which you'll recall I mentioned that physicists resisted throughout the 19th and into the early
20th century, agreeing that it was a very useful hypothesis for purposes of doing such things
as the kinetic theory of gases and explaining chemical reactions, but that matter was not in
fact atomic. That matter was continuously divisible, and I mentioned that, for example,
Michael Faraday was among many physicists in the mid-19th century who rejected the reality
of the atomic theory of matter, but in the 20th century, Einstein's work was significant here
in shifting the climate of opinion to one in which atoms were understood to be physically real
entities, and I mentioned that when the French physicist Jean Perrin received his Nobel Prize
in Physics, one of the contributions to physics that he made was explicitly mentioned in his
Nobel Prize Award. It was mentioned that he had extended the work of Albert Einstein in doing
experiments that convinced the physics community that matter was discontinuous, that is to say,
it was atomic, or as we can now say, it was quantized, which is another way of saying that
it's discontinuous, that matter comes in the form of discrete packages. In that same year,
Einstein published the paper that I discussed in the last lecture on the photoelectric effect,
which in a sense gave an atomic theory of light. So Einstein was not merely saying that
matter is atomic, he's saying that in some curious way that in 1905 was still quite puzzling
and unclear, and to some extent is still unclear, electromagnetic energy is atomic also. That
electromagnetic energy occurs in the form of quanta, but these atoms have these atoms of
electromagnetic energy, which we call quanta, and then we're in the 1920s called photons,
that photons are both atoms, but they have a frequency and a wavelength associated with them,
which means that they have a dual character, that in discussing electromagnetic energy and
its interactions with matter, we have to use both wave concepts, frequency and wavelength,
and particle concepts, the quantization factor, as if they were sharply localized in space,
and this does seem very puzzling. How can there be something which is both a wave and a particle?
And one response to this is to say, oh wait a minute, we have now stumbled over the role that
our concepts play in describing our experience. We used to think that our concepts were transparent,
that our concepts mapped onto the reality behind experience, but maybe what we're seeing here is
that our experience is caused by entities that we do not experience, our concepts come from experience,
so our concepts can't map onto what we never experienced. We are driven by experience to use
both wave concepts and particle concepts in order to describe really fundamental phenomena,
whose ultimate reality, so to speak, is beyond any possible experiences that we can have.
So that became part of the philosophical underpinnings of quantum theory, but it launched,
of course, as I said in the last lecture, that photoelectric effect paper really launched quantum
physics and shifted attention away from Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and the electromagnetic
wave theory of light, which was one of the great triumphs of 19th century physics to a
quasi-Newtonian atomic or corpuscular theory of light, as Newton called it. Newton also recognized
that there was a puzzling, wave-like character to his corpuscles and also recognized that it was
conceptually illogical and puzzling for that to be the case, but nevertheless the experiments
indicated that that was the case. Again, in 1905, Einstein redirected the course of physics
with the paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies that founded the special theory of relativity,
and that's what we're going to be talking about now. The special theory of relativity
was the theory that undid ether physics, and in a way that is startlingly cool,
considering the investment that the physics community had in ether physics for the previous
approximately 50 to 60 years, Einstein simply announces that postulating the existence of
an electromagnetic ether in order to explain the phenomena of electromagnetism and electrodynamics,
the way that the forces that act on moving charged particles in electric and magnetic fields,
that was simply a mistake. There was no need for such an ether. Once you take into account
the role that measurement operations play in dealing with phenomena, once you take into
account the role that rulers, clocks, and light signals play in measuring spatial intervals
and temporal intervals, in determining what we mean when we say that two events happened
at the same time, or two events happened 10 seconds apart, or 10 days apart, it doesn't
matter. Whenever we talk about measuring spatial intervals, a length, temporal intervals, a time,
and you have to do that in order to measure motion, we tend to ignore the physical operation
of using a ruler, using a clock, and looking at the clock and seeing what time it is,
which means that a light signal has to travel from the clock to our eyes. Now, of course,
ordinarily, it's totally irrelevant. The light travels so rapidly that it is effectively
instantaneous, but when you're doing physics, effectively instantaneous has to be qualified.
Well, it isn't instantaneous. Light travels at a fixed speed, and in fact, that is one of the
principles of the theory of relativity. Einstein postulates it that it is a law of nature,
so to speak, that light travels at the same speed for all observers, and therefore, regardless
of their motion, and therefore, it is the only, so to speak, constant in the background of doing
physics. It does not change, the speed of light does not seem to be different depending on whether
you're moving towards it or away from a source of light, which is contrary to all our other
experiences of relative motion. But he says, if you make that assumption, which is experimentally
strongly suggested, then there's no longer any need for the ether, and I'd like to read
a paragraph from Einstein's 1905 paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies,
which is called that because what Einstein argues in this paper is that we can unite
mechanics and electrodynamics. We have to apply the same rules that apply to the motions of
material objects that even in the 17th century, physicists recognized that there was a principle
of relativity, of uniform motion, that when, for example, if you're doing an experiment
in your laboratory, which is on dry land, and somebody is doing the same experiment in a railroad
train that's moving uniformly, it's not slowing down or speeding up or going around a turn,
then you're going to get the same results that the person in the laboratory gets. The laws of
physics that you discover will be the same if two individuals are moving uniformly with respect to
one another, and Galileo and especially Christian Huygens had made this point explicitly in the
17th century, and this is built into the fabric of modern science. But what Einstein pointed out was
that in the case of electromagnetic theory, people have not been careful to apply the principle of
relativity to that as well, and they have not paid attention to the measurement operations,
and as a result, they felt they needed an ether in order to explain the behavior of
electrically charged objects in electromagnetic fields. An optical phenomena, whereas he shows
in this paper that all of the phenomena of mechanics, electrodynamics, and optics can be
explained by making some simple assumptions, and there's no need for an ether whatsoever.
Einstein notes that because of not taking the principle of applying the principle of relativity
to electromagnetic theory, certain problems have arisen, and one of the things that we discover
experimentally is that no one can find the speed of the earth relative to the ether,
and this suggests that there is nothing in nature that corresponds to the idea of absolute rest.
These problems suggest rather that as already been shown to the first order of small quantities,
the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference
for which the equations of mechanics hold good. The equations of mechanics are bound by the rule
that the equations stay the same for all observers in uniform motion with respect to one another.
That has to apply to electrodynamics and optics as well. We will raise this conjecture that the
principle of relativity applies to electrodynamics and optics and not just mechanics, the purport of
which will her after be called the principle of relativity, capitalized in quotation marks,
to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently
irreconcilable with the former, namely that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite
velocity which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. It seems contradictory
because first you tell me that the principle of relativity of motion has to be applied not just
in mechanics but to light and to optics and to electromagnetic phenomena generally, and then
you tell me that the speed of light is not subject to the principle of uniform motion, it is the same
for everybody. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory
of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell's theory for stationary bodies. The
introduction of an luminiferous ether, the electromagnetic ether, will prove to be superfluous
in as much as the view here to be developed will not require an absolutely stationary space
provided with special properties nor a sign of velocity vector to a point of the empty space
in which electromagnetic processes take place. By not having to assign what he calls a velocity
vector to every point in space, you don't need a field that is essentially some kind of materialization
of those abstract mathematical vector points, but since those points exert a force, we don't want
abstract mathematical points to exert a force on matter, that sounds mystical, so the field was
invented to explain how at every point in space a charged object in an electric field or magnetic
field can experience a force. Einstein says you don't need that, you get rid of all of those vector
points, all you have to do is pay attention to the operations that we perform of what it means
to say that we measure given the finite velocity of light, that two events happen at the same time
when we measure a length, when I am in my laboratory and I try to measure the length of an object
that's moving away from me, I will find that that object seems to be shorter than when that
object was in my laboratory and that's only puzzling if I don't realize oh it took time
for light to get from the tip of that object to me and a different time for it to get from the tail
of that object to me. Once I take that into account, now of course if it's moving 10 miles an hour,
100 miles an hour, 1000 miles an hour, it's not going to show up, but if it's moving 100 million
miles an hour then it is going to show up. The speed of light after all is 186,000 miles a second,
but once experiments become increasingly precise then you can start seeing that as in the case of
you remember Michelson and Morley's experiments to find the motion of the earth relative to the
ether, motion of the earth relative to absolute space, absolute rest as Einstein just called it,
then the machine that Michelson invented, the interferometer, to make that measurement was
capable of exquisitely sensitive measurements and as a result of not finding the motion,
you remember Lorenz and Fitzgerald came up with this idea that matter contracts in the direction
along which it moves because all matter is electrically charged internally and it interacts
with the electromagnetic ether because all electrically charged matter moving in an electromagnetic
field interacts with the field, so the interaction causes the matter to shrink. Einstein says it's
not shrinking, forget that ether, all you have to do is remember that light has a finite velocity
and if you make the assumption that that velocity is the same regardless of the state of motion of
the observer then it turns out that the measurement will be smaller exactly to the degree that the
Lorenz Fitzgerald contraction predicted the thing would shrink. It's not really shrinking,
it's the same length it was but the measurement at the very end of the paper, Einstein points out
that there is something puzzling however which is that while measuring the spatial interval only
appears the length of an object, a moving object moving relative to a stationary frame of reference,
I'm making the measurement in my laboratory but the object I'm measuring is moving with respect
to me then the length only apparently changes but if I have a clock on that object and I
synchronized it with a clock in my laboratory before that object started moving away from me
and that object comes back to me, the two clocks will no longer be synchronized.
I don't just measure that time is moving more slowly on the moving object relative to the
stationary object, it really has moved more slowly as reflected in the fact that while it's just as
long when it comes back as it left the time is different, time has apparently moved more slowly
on the moving object and again this is a minute effect in an ordinary experience but has been
verified over and over again experimentally so that it's quite true. So what emerges out
as far as we can say that anything that's experimentally confirmed is true. Now what emerges
out of this special theory of relativity is a very important reconceptualization of what we mean
by space, time, matter and energy because as by what Einstein called a happy circumstance
out of his equations, his now modified equations for the behavior of moving bodies
what falls out is the equation equal mc2 which implies that energy and matter are interconvertible
and that's interesting but it also applies that energy has inertia since matter has inertia and
energy and matter are equivalent or they are they are interconvertible one to the other then
energy must also have inertia just the way matter does and he suggested that this can be tested
by Marie Curie's experimental work on radium just published in the previous couple of years before
1905 and suggests that he expects that this will be confirmed that energy will turn out to have
inertia in the general theory of relativity published in 1915 it turns out that just as
matter becomes the source of a gravitational field energy is the source of a gravitational field
and that turns out to be important in the general theory but here in the special theory of relativity
what one of the one of the logical consequences of the theory is that space and time no longer
have the absolute character that newtons defined them to have at the beginning of so to speak the
beginnings of modern mechanics and in the principi and newtons principi of 1687 you remember i read
to you his definitions of space and time they are the absolute backdrops of natural events and
Einstein says there is no absolute space there is no absolute time there are only local spaces and
local times which are coordinated by strictly deterministic absolute laws is it the equations
of the special theory of relativity as this general theory of relativity are deterministic
equations it's it's kind of misleading to call them the theory of relativity because the relative
the term relativity of motion or as Einstein used the principle of relativity really is not
it's the measurement that's relative but but all the laws of physics are strictly deterministic and
Einstein was a deterministic kind of guy. Einstein to the end of his life resisted the
completeness of quantum mechanics because it turned out to have a fundamentally statistical
interpretation according to bohr and heisenberg and and and just about everybody else using the
theory quantum theory is a is a stochastic theory at the very most fundamental level what's going
on has a probabilistic character now Einstein says that can't be because you can't have statistical
laws he did not accept what we had discussed in an earlier lecture that there was such things as
statistical laws of nature he was a determinist these are deterministic theories which makes for
one problem with respect to reconciling the general theory of relativity which is a gravitational
theory the gravity theory of the gravitational force with the three forces that have been united
in the standard model of quantum theory one problem is that that's a deterministic theory
it the other is stochastic we would have to come up with a statistical theory of of gravity also
there are some more serious problems that we'll get to in a moment when we talk to about when we
talk about the general theory of relativity which we might just as well make the transition to
because the the general theory of relativity essentially drops the restriction that the
equations of motion of physics are are the same for all observers in uniform motion with respect
to one another uniform means they're not accelerating they're not decelerating they're either at rest
with respect to each other or they are moving uniformly uniform motion means no forces are
acting on the system and that makes a lot of sense because if you're doing an experiment and
there are no forces acting on you that are not acting on someone else so you expect the results
to be the same but if it turns out that someone else is doing this experiment while they are
falling freely from an airplane before they open their parachute then then you would do expect
that there will be a difference in the in the outcome of the experiment because one is being
subjected to a different a different set of forces than the other one than the other one is
if nothing else the force of the air that's rushing up rushing past you so what Einstein says in the
general theory of relativity is and Einstein says he worked on this for eight years from roughly
speaking 1907 to 1915 eight years that almost drove him mad because of the abstractness and the
complexity of the ideas underlying the general theory of relativity it was triggered by an
insight that is strictly analogous to what Einstein just did in the special theory of
relativity making a postulate out of something that that was experimentally recognized but
but had not been erected to the status of a principle of nature and then seeing what follows
from that what can we explain what can we predict what can we test experimentally in the general
theory of relativity Einstein says everybody knows that empirically some gravitational mass weight
is equivalent to inertial mass but and that's built into Newtonian mechanics also but no one
has asked the question why are these two equivalent and what Einstein concludes is this is a principle
of nature that gravitational mass and inertial mass what an inertial mass is the resistance of
matter to acceleration the gravitational mass is familiar to us as weight and and inertial mass is
more general so to speak it takes the form of say in order to move a material object you have to
apply a force to it and the force that you would have to apply in order to move it is a function
of its inertial inertial mass and it's measured by the equation f equals ma newton's famous equation
f equals ma that the force that you need to apply in order to get any particular acceleration
is equal to the mass of an object the inertial mass of an object times its acceleration you can
calculate what the inertial mass is by seeing how much does any given core force cause an object to
accelerate to move and how rapidly it moves over some period of time that gives you f over force
over acceleration and then that's the and that's that's the inertial mass. Einstein says we make
those equivalent then what we really have discovered is that there's no difference between between an
object moving in a gravitational field stationary I'm sorry there's no difference between an object
that is stationary in a gravitational field or an object that's accelerating independently of a
gravitational field the laws of physics will be the same whether you're in a spaceship that's
accelerating or whether you're stationary in an area of space where there is a strong gravitational
field that that so to speak mimics mimics the acceleration of your of your spaceship which
is why you can sort of have artificial weight in an accelerating spaceship even if it's far away
from any from any object that's exerting a gravitational force the the acceleration itself
exerts what is in this force that is indistinguishable from a gravitational force.
Now the general theory of relativity is conceptually even more revolutionary than the special theory
of relativity in part because it removes the restriction on uniform motion and means that
the laws of physics have a much more general character than they have in the special theory
of relativity it also means that space and time really are relationships that are a function
of whose reality is a function of matter and energy that matter and energy shape space and time
influence space and time and and there's no way that you can separate space and time matter and
energy newton thought you could and had been tacitly assumed that space and time was sort of
the absolute backdrop of events special theory of relativity challenged that but the general theory
of relativity dismisses that there is no background geometry to space and this is can make this can
give you vertigo we can understand what anstein meant when he said that this was driving him mad
that the the general theory of relativity said that the geometry of space is a function of
matter and energy that's in space if there were no matter and energy there would be no space
the curvature of space as we have come to call it is a function of how much matter how much energy
see because matter matter generates the gravitational field which shapes space space time matter and
energy are now reciprocally correlated in the general theory of relativity in ways that that
they never were before the general theory of relativity is a universal theory of gravity
that correlates space time matter and energy it is a theory therefore of the universe in the same
sense that newton's universal theory of gravity was a theory of the universe but in a much more
sophisticated and substantial way because now einstein is saying that the very shape of space and
time the very shape of space the character of time the flow of time are functions of the
distribution of matter and energy and so the general theory of relativity has cosmological
implications not in terms of an infinite backdrop of space uh that that newton thought on the
contrary the general theory of relativity implies that space is finite that i'm sorry that space
yes that space is finite that the universe is finite spatially newton thought that it was
infinite spatially whereas the general theory of relativity says that that the that the universe
is finite spatially and uh and that is the basic set of equations the the the equations of the
general theory of relativity give us equations for a gravitational field that is uh that that
describes the shape of space and the flow of time and the distribution of matter and energy
in a way that's coordinated so it's a really complicated set of reciprocal mutual mutually
dependent relationships einstein formulated the field equations and accepting from his
contemporary astronomers that from contemporary astronomers that the universe was stationary
which is what they thought at the time and the assumption at the time too was that
that the uh that the long term stability of anything implies equilibrium so einstein wanted
to university the universe to be in equilibrium and he formulated the field equations the
gravitational field equations from the general theory of relativity so that they would generate
a stable universe that was in equilibrium given the force of gravity which pulls matter together
einstein had to stick in a term in the equation which counteracted the force of gravity in order
for the universe to be stable this was in 1915 and shortly thereafter between 1917 and 1919
other physicists started playing with the general theory of relativity a dutch physicist named
villum de sitter in particular and then a uh and uh and uh a german physicist named schwarz schwarz
child and in russia in the early 1920s alexander friedman in 1922 1923 and they uh they pointed
out to einstein that the that the solutions to these equations were were very tricky that that
the way the equations were set up it looked as though the universe the universe was uh would
expand uh and that seemed quite incorrect so einstein was in that period of time playing with
the cosmological constant in order as as this fudge factor came to be called in order to somehow
keep the universe stable uh and not allow there to be solutions to the equations which uh which
would generate a universe which didn't look like what the astronomer said the universe was like
ironically of course uh he was doing this he was preventing the equations from predicting
the expansion of the universe exactly when the universe was discovered to be expanding
which in fact villum de sitter uh even in the uh late 19 teens was recognized that there was
some data that was accumulating uh had called the redshift of light that we'll be discussing in
in the next lecture that uh that strongly suggested that there was that the universe was not in
equilibrium that it was not stationary that was changing that star positions were changing relative
to one another and that we needed dynamic solutions to the equations of the general theory of
relativity friedman made this much more the case that dynamic rather than static solutions of what
are what the equation that the general theory is an intrinsically dynamic theory of the universe
and of course once the expansion of the universe was discovered einstein sort of
hit himself in the head and said it was the stupidest thing i ever did playing around with
my own theory uh because i thought that i needed to to make it uh match what the astronomers told
us about about the universe as if they knew what the nature of the universe was uh in fact the
general theory of relativity like the special theory of relativity has had extensive and
intensive experimental confirmation and has and has passed every such test including the most
recently correctly predicting the behavior of a pair of pulsars that orbit one another and
and what and and the claim from the theory that that space and time in the immediate vicinity
of the earth are in a certain sense warped or dragged by the the the rotational motion of the
earth there there's a satellite called gravity probe b which has tested this and and the prediction
is is confirmed as was the prediction of black holes and galactic lenses and the curvature of
of rays of light passing near a gravitationally dense body like the sun the only practical
application of general theory of relativity that i can think of is the global positioning system
which is now so precise that it has to take it has to take the general theory of relativity
into account in order to track the satellites that the global positioning system uses in order
to determine locations on the earth so that's very interesting all by itself the special theory has
had a number of practical applications not necessarily in consumer technology but this is a
something of a contrast between the relativity theory and quantum theory many practical applications
in the case of quantum theory semiconductor physics the transistor the laser to mention just a few
in the case of special theory we've got all the things associated with atomic energy and
and particle accelerators need to use the special theory of that's built into their design but from
the point of view of of let's call it consumer and industrial techno science the general theory
of relativity is conceptually revolutionary intellectually radical and revolutionary but
but it has not yet been translated into techno science for the consumer at least not not until
atomic energy becomes a consumer product
