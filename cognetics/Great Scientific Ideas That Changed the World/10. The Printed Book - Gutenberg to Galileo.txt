The subject of this lecture is the idea of the book, the invention of the idea of the
book.
But before we move on to the book, I want to hold on for a moment to the idea of progress
from the last lecture and make a kind of an editorial comment.
Well, it is self-evident that every improvement entails a change.
Not every change implies that we have made an improvement.
And it seems to me that the rhetoric of progress, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries
and now at the beginning of the 21st century, is often mindlessly, mindlessly identifies
change with improvement.
It is not clear how, in any particular case, we are supposed to evaluate whether a change
has become an improvement.
All we can see is that when we think there have been improvements, then they were always
precipitated by some change.
But let's refocus on the idea of the book.
On the one hand, you knew that this was coming.
You knew that we were going to be talking about the book because of my focus early on
in this course on how central writing is to science.
That writing is, I said, a necessary condition for the idea of science and for the practice
of science from the rise of modern science to the present.
So it was, in a certain sense, inevitable that somewhere along the line, I was going
to be talking about the book, about printed texts as the embodiment of writing in that
modern science was able to assimilate in the 17th century.
On the other hand, one can legitimately say, but what's the big deal?
I don't understand.
Who had to invent the idea of the book?
Since people have been writing texts since antiquity, since we talked about books and
correctly so in the context of Greece in the 5th century BCE, then how can you invent
the idea of the book in the 15th century?
So I hope that by the end of this lecture you'll see that we take the printed text,
I'm going to use book as a synonym for printed text, we take the book for granted and don't
appreciate the sense in which a book that we may hold in our hands, the book that people
held in their hands starting in the middle of the second half of the 15th century, the
kind of books they held in their hands were the most visible expression of a very complex
system that I'm going to call a socio-technic system, the kind of a system that became clear
in the 19th century.
It was in the 19th century that technological innovations driven by scientific knowledge
generated these very complex socio-technic systems of which artifacts and processes were
only the most visible elements analogous to the tip of the iceberg and the overwhelming
majority of the bulk of the iceberg being submerged and roughly speaking invisible.
I want to talk about the book in the context of being an illustration of a socio-technic
system and I'm going to obviously have to flesh that out but this will be telegraphing
a phenomenon that becomes really important in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The book itself as I say is only the most visible manifestation of a system that is
associated with the creation of books, the production of books, the distribution of books,
the marketing of books and the sale of books.
Those are roughly speaking invisible aspects of the system when you're just holding the
book and all you're interested in is the content of the book.
You're reading the book because you want to know what's inside the book or because someone
has told you that you have to read the book and then you'll be quizzed on the content
of the book.
That's what you're interested in and we tend not to be sensitive to the fact that there
is a vast system surrounding that book that enabled that book to be held in my hands or
for that text to be posted on the internet.
We all know that Gutenberg invented printing but Gutenberg of course did not invent printing.
He did not invent printing with movable type either but this is not to take credit away
from him.
We'll see what credit he deserves in a little while but the credit for the invention of
printing goes to the Chinese who were block printing text carving the language symbols,
written writing symbols into wooden blocks, inking the blocks and then printing block
printed text back in the 6th century.
From approximately the 500s the Chinese were producing block printed text and large numbers
of them.
It's not as if well they did one here, they did one there, some of the printed works were
massive encyclopedias and collections of religious and political writings, politically relevant
writings.
And in fact from somewhere around the 11th century they began using movable type, movable
type originally perhaps in clay and then in wood because the clay type tended to break.
So wood and this technology of block printing and printing with movable type migrated from
China to Korea to Japan into Islam and through Islam this text and using paper by the way,
the Chinese also invented paper approximately 2000 years ago and at that time they made
paper out of vegetable material, the debris of vegetable material which they compacted
and pounded and squeezed and flattened and pressed into paper.
Somehow between roughly 2000 years ago and 1000 years ago this morphed into using rags
and that technology was definitely carried by Islamic culture into Spain and from Spain
into Europe that was probably in the 13th century when we see rag based paper first manufactured
in Spain, I referred in an earlier lecture to the use of water mills to power the hammers
to pulp the rags in order to manufacture the paper, we find the first examples of such
paper mills in Spain in the 13th century.
So when we look at Gutenberg in the middle of the 15th century, they already existed
in Gutenberg's social milieu, printing shops that block printed text, some texts were hand
written and others were block printed and hand illuminated or illustrated and people
were also using paper as a basis for text, text were printed on paper, we weren't using
parchment anymore or papyrus and clay tablets had fallen out of use long before but the
what did Gutenberg do?
Well what Gutenberg did introduce was printing using movable metal type which turned out
to be much more effective and much more efficient than using ceramic or wood movable type and
the use of movable metal type required different kinds of ink than block printing required,
these kinds of ink were used were oil based, olive oil based and flax based oils and Gutenberg
by empirically developed such oils and you also could not just use a block printing press
for this new kind of printing using movable metal type and these new kinds of inks, you
had to modify the press and he did that too, so in effect Gutenberg and there's some argument
about whether he himself did all of these things or any of these things but I think
that it is reasonable to say that Gutenberg in the middle of the 15th century in approximately
1450 introduced this complex of technologies, of adapted technologies of printing using
movable metal type using new kinds of inks, oil based inks, it's interesting and we'll
talk about this in the next lecture a little bit that at the same time Jan van Eyck had
introduced oil based paints into Europe and oil based paints rapidly became almost the
universal standard for painters during the Renaissance giving up tempera egg based paints
using oil based paints so Gutenberg perhaps was reflecting an emerging craft knowledge
of using oil based paints for oil based inks and the modified presses and started printing
text using movable metal type.
Now what happened next is not something that Gutenberg could possibly have predicted or
anticipated and so this is another feature of technology that we need to set aside as
a generic feature of technology namely that its social impact is unpredictable in advance
that we cannot with confidence predict how a society is going to respond to a technology
so I said that's another illusory, what was the first one, the first one was recall Lynn
White's dictum about new innovations opening doors but not requiring not forcing a society
to go through them, that new technological innovations opened doors and furthermore
we cannot predict in advance what the response is going to be because what was the response
to Gutenberg's innovation, there had been books for centuries in the West, the university
system etc, schools, there had been printed books, block printed books but all of a sudden
between 1450 and 1500 at least 2 million books were published in Western Europe, Western
Central Europe, 2 million books, 40,000 different titles, perhaps as many as 10 million texts
but 8 million of them were pamphlets of various kinds.
Consider what the population of Europe was between 1450 and 1500, much much smaller than
today, consider what the literacy rate was at the time, maybe 5% as as close as I could
get by asking scholars of this period what they think the literacy rate was and that's
an incredible response, there's no way that Gutenberg thought that the printing with movable
metal type was going to trigger that kind of a market but now think, now get back to
the socio-technic system, I said the book is the most visible manifestation of the socio-technic
system, whoa, 2 million books, 10 million texts all printed on paper, where's the paper
going to come from, who's going to invest in the paper mills, who's going to be collecting
the rags to pulp into paper and then the papers got to be distributed to where, to print shops,
so that means that print shops have to spring up all over the place, someone's got to manufacture
presses, got to manufacture the ink, someone's got to manufacture, someone's got to train
the people who will build, operate, maintain the presses physically, plus someone's got
to oversee the process of printing this stuff and make sure that it's correct, let's call
them editors, now we haven't talked about the content yet, let's leave the content aside
because if you're going to print 2 million books, they can't be blank pages, you could
save a lot of money on ink and presses if you don't bother to put anything on the page,
but let's set the content aside for the moment and think about when you're printing large
numbers of texts, what are you going to do with them, obviously you need to sell them
in order to recoup the cost of the printing process so you can pay the people who sold
you the paper and pay the salaries, etc., so you've got to have a distribution system,
there had never been such a thing as having to distribute millions of texts, there has
to be a marketing system, there has to be a sales system, who's going to actually put
the text in the hands of the reader, there are no bookstores, how are you going to transfer
the books to the reader, the pamphlet, the newspaper eventually, how are they going to
be sold, so you need a sales network, but you also need marketing, why you need marketing?
Because when books were a luxury item, so then people could charge whatever the market
would bear and there was very little in the way of start-up costs, if you're a copyist
ascribe, so you buy some ink, you buy some paper and you try to get a customer who hires
you to make a copy of Aristotle's physics, but if you have invested serious money in
a paper mill and you need to sell umpteen pounds of paper a week in order to recoup
the cost, let alone make a profit, then you've got to make sure that the demand is always
at least equal to the supply, the demand has to pull that supply out, if you're printing
two million books, you need to be able to sell two million books, but in order to ramp
up the system to produce two million books, you can't afford for people suddenly to decide,
you know what, I don't need to read anymore, but you can't afford for there to be less
than let's say 100,000 books a year or 10,000 books a week sold, so now we begin to get
some idea of what it means, the socio-technic system means that this innovation, printing
with movable metal type, it doesn't really sound that revolutionary or that exotic, but
in fact the way that western society responded to printing with movable metal type required
elicited, provoked this socio-technic system, now here's another generic feature of technology
that we're going to become aware of only in the 19th century and in fact I would say only
in the late 20th century was it taken seriously, there was no central planning here, nobody
sat down and said oh well we're going to have to have three more paper mills here, we're
going to have to have an army of people collecting rags, very often by the way tragically from
battlefields, easy way to get rags, stripped them off the bodies of the dead and we're
going to have to have a system for collecting rags and shipping them to the paper mills,
we need 11 paper mills here and three paper mills here, we need distribute, we're going
to have to set up, nobody did that, this is a self-organizing system and this is another
generic feature of the kinds of socio-technic systems that underlay the technological innovations
that change the world and we'll see this repeatedly in the 19th and 20th century and it becomes
finally a branch of a new discipline in science in the late 20th century but that's down the
line for us in this course. Right now we're looking at the book as the highlighted, the
star element of a complex socio-technic system and what we're up to is content, so everybody
at the, all of a sudden everybody wants to buy books, 2 million in 50 years just for
the books, everybody wants to buy books, what are we going to sell them? Well Gutenberg
started off with the Bible, that's a good deal, it's actually not as good a deal as
you may think because when Gutenberg started printing Bibles, Europe was Catholic, the
Catholic Church vigorously opposed the private ownership of the Bible, it was you could
lose your life for printing, for distributing Bibles, the position of the church was that
it was the church that disseminated the word of God, it was a Protestant, it was part of
the Protestant Reformation which is a 16th century phenomenon that people, each family
must own its own Bible and must study the Bible every day. The study of Bible text, the daily
study of Bible text, the daily Bible reading within the family is a Protestant innovation,
it is a principle of Protestantism. So in fact Gutenberg's Bibles were luxury items,
they were not mass market items, well but given a sudden mass market for books, what
are you going to print? Well the easiest thing to do is to print the golden oldies, start
printing the great works of Greece and Rome because everybody who can read knows about
them, everybody knows Aristotle, everybody has heard the name Plato, everybody has heard
the fathers of the church, the founding fathers of the Catholic Church like people like Augustine,
volumes of sermons, that's perfectly okay, that's perfectly okay, you can print and distribute
those and what you want is stuff that's already available, so you don't have to pay anybody
to do it except you have to pay somebody who will obviously prepare the text to be set
in type, so with that you don't need an author for that, you just need an educated person
and so many, perhaps the bulk of those two million books were in fact sort of reprints
of golden oldies and isn't it interesting and what a coincidence from the last lecture
that the humanists now in the 15th and 16th century are flooding so to speak, are flooding
the market with new editions of classical texts of the golden oldies and so those become
those humanists become a source of classical texts that they have corrected and that they
are editing into original forms as far as possible and in fact in the 16th century we
have an example of the first person that we know of and who he claimed it anyway Erasmus
of Rotterdam who made a living solely as an author, he was a humanist scholar although
his own books which were mildly satirical criticisms of Christian life in western Europe
at the time were bestsellers and he was able to live from the fees that printers paid him
as an author and also as an editor because he was a legitimate humanist scholar so that
was one source, okay but now there's a limit to the golden oldies too because the market
keeps growing while there were two million books published between 1450 and 1500 that
was nothing compared to the volume of printing from 1500 on, it is a perfect illustration
of Lynn White's dictum of new technology only opens the door, there was no, the response
of European society to printing using movable metal type was totally different from the
response of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Islamic society to exactly the same technology.
So look ahead a bit, the response of European society and those of you who are critical
of capitalism may see this in a more negative light, I see it as quite positive, that the
socio-technic system, the investment in the production and distribution networks necessary
to sustain this kind of a market, whatever was the driver, the response of European society
was universal literacy, make a reader slash customer out of everybody, we see this already,
we will see in the second lecture from now that Francis Bacon, one of the founders of
modern science was not a scientist, he was a social reformer and an educational reformer
as his father was before him and as an educational reformer, Bacon championed the idea of universal
literacy in England, especially universal literacy in technology and secondarily in
science as he understood it and because that he thought would be the only sound basis for
British power and prosperity in the future, universal literacy. So of course the printers
love the idea of universal literacy, doesn't mean that they lobby for it or they paid anybody
off to get it and it took centuries to get to but there was unquestionably an increase
in schooling. We had another example of this positive feedback loop just as the invention
of writing somehow created a positive feedback loop in which all of a sudden in the third
millennium BCE and the second millennium BCE there was a flood of text, awkward as it was
to write on tablets in cuneiform with cuneiform symbols, awkward as it was to write pictographs
on papyri, there were hundreds of thousands of them, literally there are in museums hundreds
of thousands of texts that have survived of tablets and tens of thousands of papyri with
Egyptian hieroglyphics, many of which have not yet been looked at let alone translated.
So that the positive feedback loop here is that people wanted to learn to read, the more
people read, the more printing there was, the more printing there was, the greater the
pressure for more people to read so that universal literacy was a realistic notion in this broader
cultural context. Now let's get back to let's go further with the content idea. It became
until relatively recently almost a truism among historians of Europe that and especially
those who paid attention to print technology that the power of the printed text especially
for science and technology, science and engineering lay in the fact that now the content of you
could write a book and be sure that there would be no copying errors, you didn't have
to worry that some copyist was drunk when he or she did the copying and wrote things
that you didn't write or missed important terms, you could be sure that the text was
accurate, stable, that everybody who read your book would be reading the same word,
would be reading the words that you wrote and that especially in science and in the
burgeoning niche market for engineering machine design books that we're going to be talking
about in the next lecture, in the 16th and 17th centuries especially, that science and
engineering text with their increasingly good illustrations could be confident, you
could be confident that everybody was going to be reading the same thing that you wrote
and that this was part of the power of the book and it was also the reason why the book
became so central to science and to engineering. This view was articulated by the great historian
of science, George Sarton, the man who struggled very hard to establish history of science
as a discipline here in the United States against tremendous opposition from the historical
community at the time and more recently by Elizabeth Eisenstein, but I think that the
view of an author, Adrian John, is more correct in pointing out that as a matter of fact
an aspect of the socio-technic system underlying the book that has not been given enough attention
is the fact that there were real problems with the content of a book and especially
with scientific books, that the books were pirated, that they were plagiarized, that
cheap knockoffs were made almost immediately, that you could not be confident because your
book was printed that all the copies would say exactly what you had written, that might
be true for the printer where you personally stood over them and saw the book being printed,
but once, if you're a British, once some Dutch printer sees that the book is selling
well and makes a knockoff of it, then you have no control over what they did, you have
no control over the quality or the accuracy of the equations and the illustrations by
the time we get into the 17th century. For example, Galileo in 1610 produced a slim book
called the Sidereal Messenger or the Messenger from the Stars, that he carefully produced
with very good illustrations that he himself prepared and which he used as his ticket to
fame and fortune by, so to speak, manipulating the Medici family in Florence so that he would
get the cushiest academic position in Italy of his generation. Within that same year,
pirated versions of the text were appearing in Europe, outside of Italy, with increasingly
lousy illustrations. Now, there was no way that Galileo could control that. An even more
flagrant illustration that John's points out is Tico Brey, who was an astronomer, will
be talking about in the lecture on Copernicus, Tico Brey, the greatest observational astronomer
of all time, perhaps. Brey had a self-contained fiefdom on an island that he was given by
the Danish king. He had his own printing presses, he made his own paper, and in fact he was
unable to control the production and distribution of his own books. When they eventually were
printed, they were not printed by him for distribution and marketing. His attempts to
produce his own books and market them and send them to the people that he wanted to
have them, knowing that they would be reading what he wrote, failed, and the eventual printing
was commercialized. So in fact, an aspect of the socio-technic system that we don't pay
sufficient attention to is the copyright laws, the institutions that were created to control
the content, to prevent piracy and to prevent subversion. So there are censorship institutions.
It's just like the Internet. In one sense, there's nothing new under the sun. There is
religious subversion that you have to be concerned about in the 15th, 16th, 17th century. The
Catholics have to worry about Protestant, what became the Protestant religious teachings
getting out, and then even in the 17th, 16th, and 17th century, when the Protestants were
legitimated, so to speak, there were atheists who might publish criticisms of religion and
make fun of religion. You can't allow that. Politically speaking, you don't want people
making fun of the king. You don't want them making fun of the nobility. You don't want
them publishing seditious stuff. So creating censorship institutions, creating institutions
and laws that attempt to eliminate piracy and plagiarism. They also are part of the
socio-technic system, which implicates the broader society as a whole. Plus, of course,
institutions that protect the investments and the profit-seeking of the people who not
only print books, but the people who sell books to limit competition so that they can
make a profit on the sale of the books, and the people who are making the paper, and all
the way down to the people who are making the printing presses, who are making the oil-based
inks, who are making, you know, it's a complicated system, and we take it for granted. The book
unquestionably did become, and the illustrations that I give from Tico Bray and Galileo, and
we'll give more of in a subsequent lecture, reinforce this, the book did become critical
to the practice of science. That is part of my earlier claim that writing is a necessary
condition for science, the writing is captured in the text. The printed text, as we have it
in the post-Gutenberg era, is an essential ingredient for both science and technology,
and quickly became one of the cornerstones of the emergence of modern engineering in the 15th
and 16th century, and we will look into that in the next lecture.
