As I said in the last lecture, from the perspective of science as we know it today, science without
text, science without writing, without inscription, without capturing the thinking of scientists
and their data, of course, and their reasoning process in text is simply inconceivable.
No writing, no science.
This was already true in the 17th century, when the scientific revolution took place.
When modern science emerged, it was already inconceivable that the people who we now recognize
as the founders of modern science, it was inconceivable to them that they not write
what they were claiming to have gotten knowledge of.
It was inconceivable to Descartes that he could simply tell the people around him his
new methodology for gaining knowledge of nature.
Galileo used print technology brilliantly in order to disseminate his defense of the Copernican
theory that the earth moves.
Just telling that to a group of disciples who sat around him was not an option already
in the 17th century.
How did that come to be?
Because already in the preceding 200 years of the Renaissance period, humanist scholars
had made it the norm that all scholarship, all claims to knowledge, not just knowledge
of nature, that all claims to knowledge are captured in print.
Europe was effectively print drunk as soon as Gutenberg's movable metal type print technology
became available in the middle of the 15th century.
So why was Europe so ready to respond, Western Europe?
Why was Western European society so ready to respond to the new print technology when
it was introduced?
I believe because of the legacy of the university tradition, which already had captured the
Greek notion that learning is captured in books.
The Greek philosophers starting from around 500 B.C. at least wrote books and those surviving
books from the ancient Greek philosophers were the core texts that were studied at the
medieval university.
When the medieval university was invented, it was invented as a place where people went
to study text to acquire the knowledge of antiquity, to acquire what wisdom human beings
had acquired through the study of text.
That included theological texts as well.
It meant studying commentaries on the Bible, for example.
So learning, legal learning, medical learning was associated in the university with the
study of text.
Actually studying medicine clinically, which was another strand from the ancient Greeks,
was to a considerable extent separate from that as we'll talk about later.
So the tacit, the automatic assumption that science entails writing is a legacy that comes
from the ancient Greeks.
And so the invention of the idea of writing and how it got to ancient Greece and why the
Greeks responded to it in the way that they did is an important part of the rise of modern
science.
Note for now and again something that we'll be talking about in repeated lectures in
the future, that the connection between writing and knowledge as opposed to the connection
between writing and doing.
In the last lecture I closed with a description of the cumulation of know-how in the pre-literate
period of human history from about 10,000 BCE down to approximately let's say 3,500
or 3,000 BCE when a writing system became available and then spread that know-how is
not keyed to writing, knowledge is.
And I said then that this distinction, that the philosophical idea of knowledge that became
part of the essential part of the scientific tradition, that that idea of knowledge is
tied from the beginning to writing.
And I said that this distinction between knowledge and know-how is reflected in the distinction
between science and engineering and by the way the superior status that our society gives
to science vis-a-vis engineering, that understanding is rewarded and appreciated so to speak culturally
more than just doing that we think of engineering and technology as merely applied science that
means with subordinating know-how to knowledge but even as we will see in the 19th century
modern engineering education, the foundations of technoscience as I described it in the
last lecture are associated with coupling science to engineering and technology, technological
innovation and the key to that turned out to be scientizing engineering.
That means introducing science, math and laboratory courses as the key to engineering
education as opposed to machine shop to doing and this was a battle in the 19th century
that we will be talking about in a subsequent lecture.
So the idea of writing continually comes up as so to speak the common denominator here
and that's why I think we need to think about the invention of writing and its transmission
to ancient Greece and because that's what became the legacy that tied writing and knowledge
in a way that became a tool for not more than a tool, a core commitment of science.
Four quick points before we go any further.
First of all, writing is a necessary condition for modern science I believe but it is not
a sufficient condition.
The fact that a culture acquires writing and uses writing intensively does not guarantee
that it is going to generate the idea of knowledge that we find generated by the ancient Greek
philosophers or that modern science is going to arise in that society.
For example, China and Islam and somewhat later India all were very print intensive
societies, especially China and Islam were print intensive societies.
The number of books that were written and printed in China and Chinese used block printing
and then movable type printing centuries, print block printing probably a thousand years
before in the West and hundreds of years of use movable type hundreds of years before
in the West.
There were huge numbers of texts and massive texts that were printed in China but the idea
of modern science did not arise there.
Islamic science and technology, especially from about the 9th century until the 13th
century was far superior to what we might call the science and technology in Western
Europe but the idea of modern science did not arise in Islam.
So having writing is a precondition of doing science but having writing is not a guarantee
that science is going to emerge.
Not having a written language, not being literate, which sometimes has pejorative connotations
when we talk about that today clearly does not mean that a society or a culture is not
sophisticated.
That's why I spent so much time talking about the extraordinary sophistication of prehistoric,
preliterate human beings, how much know how they had accumulated, what they could do,
how they were already transforming the world around them, transforming plants and animals
and through irrigation and construction technologies, literally transforming the landscape around
them within the limits of their knowledge and capabilities, of course, their know how,
that they were quite sophisticated.
There is no, it is a mistake to think that a society that is not literate is therefore
not sophisticated and lacks sophisticated know how.
Third point, what we mean by science is a particular approach to the study of nature
and one of the key flow size of this course is to emphasize what makes it particular but
it is not the only approach to the study of nature.
For example, in Islam, especially as I said in the period from the 9th to the 12th, 13th,
14th centuries, in China and in India, there was serious and systematic study of nature
but it did not morph into modern science as study of nature in the West, in Western Europe
morphed into modern science in the 17th century.
Fifth point, the reason why writing is necessary for science, why it is a necessary condition
for science is because what we mean by scientific knowledge is an abstraction, unlike know how,
which can be embodied in things and processes and evaluated without needing writing.
You can look at, I think I used the illustration of somebody making a bronze pot or making
a bronze weapon or making a steel blade for a sword and you can see either it is good
or it is not good.
The person either knows how to do it or they don't know how to do it, how well they know
how to do it, etc.
So know how it can be literally embodied, can exist in and that is what makes it easier
to transmit and to disseminate without writing.
But science refers to what we mean by science and we see this, we begin to see this in the
17th century but it was already evident in ancient Greece refers to a reality that we
do not experience and that we cannot experience.
In principle we cannot experience quarks, we do not experience the microwave background
radiation that is for some a sign that the big bang theory of the origin of the universe
is roughly speaking correct.
We do not experience cells, we do not experience the base sequence in our DNA guiding the cell
metabolism and the metabolic processes of our body.
So scientific knowledge, its writing is what embodies scientific knowledge.
Okay, with that as a kind of a background, let's take a look at the invention of writing
which as a historical fact could change if new artifacts are discovered of course but
it seems as though writing was invented by the Sumerians in the mid 4th millennium BCE.
The Sumerians were a non-Semitic people speaking a non-Semitic language who moved into possibly
from Central Asia, moved into the southeastern sector of what we were all trained to call
the fertile crescent and to consider the birthplace of civilization and although the writing
was preceded by seals and tokens which have a symbolic character of course and we would
expect that because for thousands of years before writing appeared human beings were
living in fairly large social complexes and so there was some kind and with trade and
commerce and government and religion so there had to be some kind of systematic record keeping
but it is with the Sumerians that we get the first writing system that we know about and
we take this for granted.
Writing was an invention, writing was invented, writing is a symbol system, it's a system,
the whole thing hangs together, you can't just have one letter, well actually at the
beginning the Sumerian language system and as far as we can tell all the earliest language
systems were a logographic, that means that the sign stood for some idea, sometimes this
is called ideographic or pictographic, there are differences among these but we don't need
to concern ourselves with them.
The first writing system that we know of and in Sumer was the signs stood for ideas, stood
for what we might call a concept or an idea and it evolved eventually into an alphabetic
language, there's no need for a language of ideographic language to evolve into an alphabetic
language, we see that in Chinese for example, the Chinese language probably evolved about
1500 years after the Sumerian language ostensibly independently but there was enough contact
between let's say 3500 BCE and 1500 BCE between the Middle East and Central and Eastern Asia
that it is not impossible that the rise of writing in China was not independent but it
is generally considered to in fact have been independent, so the earliest Chinese written
inscriptions are from the middle of the second millennium BCE although there are, it is suggestive
that the signs in that language already existed in maybe 2000 BCE but that is somewhat speculative.
Egypt by contrast which is very close to Sumer, only a couple of hundred miles away and there
was considerable contact between the Egyptians and the Akkadian Babylonians who conquered
the Sumerians in the early third millennium BCE, that means in the late 2000s BCE, that
the rise of Egyptian hieroglyphics probably was a reflection of the dissemination of the
Sumerian writing system, the Sumerians inscribed their writing system on clay tablets so that is
called cuneiform, it has nothing to do with the language, the language was logo graphic as a type
of language, it means that each symbol stood for an idea and typically initially had a pictorial
character but that became clumsy when you wanted to write a long book so that fairly quickly in
both hieroglyphics and in Sumerian cuneiform the symbols became stylized and no longer had a
strictly pictorial character, you had to learn what the relationship was between the sign and the
idea represented or in time the sign and the syllable how you pronounced it or the sign and
so to speak alphabetic letter that let you put the string words together in the way that an
alphabetic language allows, note something very interesting about writing, once you develop a
writing system it's got to be taught, you have to learn it, there's no natural connection,
right the pictures start out with this natural connection but that turns out to be very cumbersome
and in fact even at the pictographic stage we see that in ancient Egypt and in Babylon there
were schools for teaching writing, people had to learn it and of course once it becomes
a syllabic or alphabetic then there's no, the signs are completely arbitrary and there's no
way that you can learn to read the language without being taught so there's a kind of school
that arises in a society that adopts language so cuneiform script in using, in which the
symbols were idiographic or logographic was introduced by the Sumerians, regardless of
whether the pictures made sense or not in Sumerian what happened next is quite interesting,
the Sumerians were conquered by the Akkadians who were a Semitic people who migrated east
from the land that in the Bible is called Canaan and they conquered the Sumerians and
established the first Babylonian Empire and they took the Sumerian writing system which was
invented for a non-Semitic language and they used it in their Semitic language, Akkadian is a
Semitic language, it is a totally different type of language from a totally different family of
languages, it's not like the relationship between French and English or even between French and
Spanish, the fact that the Akkadians adopted and adapted the Sumerian script meant that they
really did have to take those signs as arbitrary, you really had to learn what those signs stood
for because it was a totally different kind of language, that seemed, that happened sort of
seamlessly in the late 2000s BCE and somewhere around between 1500 and 2000 BCE that language
which was originally logographic in which fairly complicated pictured like symbols were used
became alphabetic and that seems to have happened in the land of Canaan which in fact is referred
to as Ugarit and there is a text that has been discovered from roughly speaking a 12 to 1500
BCE that is written in an alphabetic script and what's particularly important for us is that
Ugaritic, an alphabetic language, perhaps the first alphabetic language that the world has known
was adopted by the Phoenicians who lived in the Phoenicians lived in modern nowadays Lebanon
and by the ancient Hebrews later by the by the Arabs and so Phoenician, Hebrew and Arabic all
have very close common root and the alphabets in those languages have striking similarities among
them all being Semitic languages, the Phoenicians are of particular interest because they were the
master merchants of the Mediterranean for centuries starting somewhere around maybe 1200
1100 BCE and as they traded through the Mediterranean they disseminated their alphabetic
language to non-literate peoples I guess because it was good for business it made it easier to do
business with people who could who could communicate with you in writing and keep records that you
could use and rely on and in particular somewhere around the 9th century in the 800s BCE they taught
the Greeks their alphabet so alphabeta, delta in Greek, alethbed, gimel, dalit in Hebrew which is
the same as the Phoenician that that's not an accident, isn't that a cute coincidence the four
the letters of the Greek alphabet are similar to the Phoenician and Hebrew Ugaritic, Canaanitic
alphabetic language no it's not a coincidence at all they were taught that it is likely that an
earlier phase of Greek society back around 1200 BCE had had a written language or rather clumsy
one derived from Cretan as you may have read about linear A and linear B as to ancient languages
linear B was deciphered after many years and and seems to have been associated with the Minoan
civilization dominated by Crete that was destroyed by apparently by earthquakes somewhere around
1400 BCE and this the ancient Greek the Mycenaean Greeks the ones that fought the Trojan War
perhaps had some right written culture although there's almost no evidence and certainly nothing
like a text but the Hellenic Greeks the Greeks that that we so to speak know of from about 800
BC on that they were taught writing by the Phoenicians who also taught it to the Etruscans
because they traded with the Etruscans in Italy the Etruscans taught it to the Latins who we
know as Romans so the Phoenicians acted as a conduit for the first alphabetic language which
evolved directly out of the Akkadian assimilation of the Sumerian invention of writing now the
Greeks responded to writing in it with incredible enthusiasm and creativity the the Greek reception
of language of writing I'm sorry I'm sorry not of language of writing the Greek reception of
writing led to almost an immediate explosion of cultural productivity of poetry of drama of
philosophy of mathematics of medicine the Greeks started pouring out but by 500 BCE the Greeks
there was a subs obviously not the average citizen but the but there was a subset of Greek
society that for whom books were the production and reading of books were the norm and we can
see this very clearly for example in Plato's dialogues written in the middle of the fourth
century BCE where it's just taken for granted that that an intelligent person an educated
person reads the books by the philosophers of the of the preceding hundred or so hundred or so years
many of those books failed to survive but some did and so we have some idea of what those were so
since it was in ancient Greece that the idea of knowledge was formulated that became embedded
the cornerstone of scientific knowledge as we understand it and since the Greeks were
responded to writing by making writing books the norm for those who know there is a kind of a
direct line of descent from the invention of writing in Sumer through through the the morphing
of that cuneiform writing into an alphabetic language being taught by the Phoenicians to the
Greeks all the transmitted through the medieval university to Western Europe and as well as
as well as other places Islam for example so it is a it's kind of an interesting way of looking
at modern science that a core feature without which science simply can't be done has an ancestry
that goes back to the invention of writing by the by the ancient Sumerians has nothing to do with
the invention of writing in ancient China if in fact that that was independent or in the
Americas where in the the first millennium BCE their writing pictographic writing and a kind
of writing in which which with the symbols have a phonetic character apparently was developed
by the Olmec the Zapotec and the Mayans most notably by the Mayans and only relatively
recently deciphered the Mayan inscriptions but it's kind of unwieldy to inscribe texts on
stone as opposed to writing them on papyrus and and or on parchment and and copying and
distributing them and we know as a matter of fact that the that the ancient that in that in
ancient Greece there was a trade in books already in the fourth century BCE that people were
profession made their living as copyists for example copying texts for people Socrates
repeatedly refers to how many drachmas it costs to for someone to copy a book if they wanted one
etc so we need to recognize however that some very important things about writing that are often
taken for granted first of all that it is an invention and as such it is the incarnation of
an idea for thousands of years people got along without writing why did they all of a sudden need
writing who did it and why what was the mother of that particular what was the necessity that was
the mother of that invention what was that we say necessity is the mother of invention well
maybe it's true maybe it's not but let's suppose we take it for what necessity was it was it the
social that the intensifying socialization of life made government and trade made made
controlling a population and engaging in in in life as the population increased and you
had all kinds of activities going on that you needed to keep is was that the necessity well
we don't really know there are many different stories in antiquity people recognizing the power
of language and the glory of a power of writing and the glory of writing attributed sometimes
they attributed writing to a gift from the gods sometimes to ancient legendary heroes or legendary
wise people in China it was attributed to Changsie who was a minister of the legendary Emperor
Wang Ti the yellow emperor there's no evidence that either these two characters actually existed
but in subsequently in China look looking back to their glorious origins attributing to their
greatest emperor of old of and to his wisest minister the invention of writing the Greeks
sometimes attributed it to a god as Prometheus eschulis in his plays attributes writing to
Prometheus because he says well it was an aid to memory Euripides on the other hand disagrees
with that and and thinks that the ancient the Greek legendary Greek hero calamities invented
invented writing as a way of long-distance communication so you could send letters to
people and tell them and tell them news and gossip and and what you wanted them to do
Aristotle writing in the fourth century BCE late or somewhere around 330 340 writes that
writing is in the service of money making that it is particularly useful for keeping records
for the household so that you know exactly how much is coming in and how much is going out and
what you're spending your money on there the there there are many tales of of the origin of
writing but we don't know who invented it and we don't know what the motivation for it was so
one it's an I it's an invention and it involves an idea it's a system and as we will talk about
it's a symbol system that means that that's very important because symbols need to be interpreted
and to be understood I want to emphasize now something that is of fundamental importance
about technology and knowledge and that is that I already referred to this that there
is no guarantee that because a technology is introduced into a society that it will be exploited
or the form in which it will be exploited writing is a technology writing is an invention it's a
technological innovation it also has intellectual implications we wonder what the connection is
between writing and thought is writing merely a way of capturing speech or do you get a kind of a
positive feedback loop between writing and thought so that when you write things down you
start thinking differently because you can then read what you have written you disseminate what
you write people respond to what you write that prompts other people to think in different ways
so that's a very another interesting thing about writing it it it becomes more valuable the more
widely it is disseminated and we'll see this happening sometimes with technologies the telephone
system every new telephone makes every other telephone more valuable you don't get a law of
diminishing returns on the contrary the value of the internet goes up as more and more people
use it and just as we saw with the internet the more people there are the more new kinds of
goods and services that are invented by people to take advantage of the universality of the
internet the same thing was is true with writing but it's not automatic a new invention as Lynn
White said opens doors we'll come back to that quotation in a later lecture it does not force
any society to enter through that door and as a matter of fact as much as you may think well
writing is a gimme once you have writing you automatically accept it as a matter of fact
that was not the case Socrates did not write anything Plato wrote about his teacher Socrates
Socrates in fact in the dialogue called the Fidris gives a sustained argument against writing
and I want to read part of that because what Socrates says seems to me very powerful he
attributes the the invention of writing to the in Egypt he assigns it he assigns it to
Egypt and to the Greek God the Egyptian God thought who gives it to to the king I'm reading
from the text of Plato's Fidris now hero king is a branch of learning that will make the people
of Egypt wiser and improve their memories my discovery provides a recipe for memory and
wisdom but the king answered and said oh man full of arts the god man thought to one it is
given to create the things of art and to another to judge what measure of harm and of profit they
have for those that shall employ them a very prescient and insightful thing this is now me
of course for the king to say the people who invent who make new inventions who invent new
technologies are not the people who understand what the social impact of those technologies are
going to be and so it is that you by reason of your tender regard for the writing that is your
offspring have declared the very opposite of its true effect if men learn this it will implant
forgetfulness in their souls they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which
is written calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves but by means of
external marks what you have discovered is a recipe not for memory but for reminder and it
is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples but only the semblance of wisdom for by telling
them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much while for the most
part they know nothing and as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom they will
be a burden to their fellows socrates goes on and compares a written text to a painting the
painter's products stand before us as though they were alive but if you question them they maintain
a most majestic silence it is the same with written words they seem to talk to you as though they
were intelligent but if you ask them anything about what they say from a desire to be instructed
they go on telling you just the same thing forever the written text is dead is almost guaranteed
to be misinterpreted and therefore it's really not the gift that it looks like okay for record
keeping for remembering that so-and-so owes you fifty dollars and it's due next monday but a text
is not a substitute for direct face-to-face learning and the transmission of knowledge
which socrates believed was the only way that one person could communicate knowledge to another
