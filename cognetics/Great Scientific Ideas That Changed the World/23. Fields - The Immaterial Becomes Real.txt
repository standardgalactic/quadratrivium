The subject matter of this lecture is the idea of the field, a somewhat abstract idea,
but one that becomes concrete in terms of physical reality in the course of the 19th
century, but without ever becoming a thing in the classic atomistic sense.
The idea of the field is closely coupled to the idea of energy.
It is a natural response to the growing recognition that energy is a constituent of physical reality
without being a classical substance, without being a material thing.
It is something, but it is not a material thing.
The idea is that this is a serious problem for the dominant materialistic determinism
of 18th and 19th century science, whether Cartesian or Newtonian, the 18th and 19th century
natural philosophers were committed to a materialistic determinism that all natural phenomena can
be explained in terms of matter in motion.
This is what Laplace had given voice to, that idea that if we knew the position and
the momentum of every particle of matter in the universe at a given time, we could predict
the future and the past, retro-dict the past with unlimited precision, that is an expression
of this commitment to materialistic determinism, but here we have, in the case of energy, we
have a recognition that an immaterial something is also physically real as signified by the
fact that it exerts forces, it acts as a cause and therefore we have to attribute physical
reality to it and we cannot explain certain kinds of natural change without reference
to energy.
Indeed, today it is almost inconceivable to try to eliminate the concept of energy from
physics.
If you had a choice between either energy or matter, nowadays I don't think there would
be much of a debate that people would give up the ultimate reality of matter, physicists
would, in favor of the ultimate reality of energy if it really had to be an either or
decision.
The energy is a kind of packaged dynamism.
Energy puts a scientific bound around dynamism, action, scientific in the sense that we now
define energy in a way that action is describable in terms of equations for example, in terms
of observing a conservation law and so in a way this is I think quite literally a realization
of Heraclitus' claim that changes fundamental and that all change process, that there are
multiple logoi in Greek, logos is the singular, logoi is the plural, he said that there's
not just one logos that guides the universe, logos here standing for rule or law, that's
the way we would probably change it, we would translate it today, that there's not just one
law that controls everything going on in the universe but there are multiple logoi, there
are many rules that are characteristic of the multiple processes that are responsible
for change in nature and energy is a way of sort of capturing and packaging in a way that
modern science accepts the action, change, the logoi underlying natural phenomena but
the question has to be how is, how are the forces that are associated with electrical
energy, magnetic energy, gravitational energy, electromagnetic energy, light, how are they
transmitted, how are they disseminated, how do they transmit it within an electric, a
magnet let's say and how are they transmitted outside, how are they propagated through space,
now the man who played a pivotal role in this was Michael Faraday the very man who was responsible
through his researches for showing that electricity, magnetism and light are all intimately connected
and by the way through his invention of the dynamo created another instance of 19th century
techno science that became extraordinarily important in terms of its impact on society
namely the generation of electricity because although it took approximately 40 years,
eventually Faraday's dynamo built which was central to electromagnetic theory in the 19th
century, was commercialized and became electric generators that exploited the principle of
the dynamo to generate electricity and of course this was in the case of Thomas Edison built
the first central electricity generating station in 1882 and just taking advantage of the fact
that if you could mechanically rotate a magnet around a conducting wire current would flow and
then you could distribute that electricity and use it to activate Edison's incandescent light
bulbs. Now the question that Faraday increasingly became concerned with was how are these forces,
the ones that he worked with especially electricity and magnetism, how are they propagated and what
is the means, what is the process by which this takes place and in the 1830s and 40s especially
Faraday studied this and published in this area. So Faraday is an interesting character,
he came from a poor family, that was a particular sect within the Baptist Church in England,
a Sandamanian Baptist and he became enamored of science apparently having attended a public
lecture at the Royal Institute in London which was designed to disseminate scientific ideas to
the public and he eventually promoted himself to Sir Humphrey Davy as an assistant, became
self-educated and eventually became the head of, took over Davy's position when Davy retired.
Faraday was weak in mathematics because he was self-educated and he himself admitted that he
didn't seem to have much of a gift for mathematics which is odd given the increasingly intense
mathematician of physics in the 19th century but his qualitative understanding of the phenomena
that he studied made him a very powerful and innovative thinker. He was, although it sounds
incredible from our perspective, Faraday opposed atomism, he did not believe in the reality of
atomism, he did not believe that there was such a thing as a vacuum in nature and so he believed
like Descartes, he believed that matter was continuously distributed and infinitely divisible,
that matter was penetrable, that in fact two bits of matter could occupy the same space
at the same time under certain circumstances so that he was committed to ideas that are quite
cartesian even though at the time everybody considered, especially in England, considered
themselves to be Newtonian and what Faraday required was a medium for the transmission
of especially electric and magnetic forces and he proposed that there was in fact a new form of
matter that completely filled space and that's why there was no such thing as a vacuum up there
in interstellar space let's say, that the entire universe was filled with a form of matter that
was called the aether from a Greek term and that was in addition to the ordinary matter that there
was this background stuff that literally filled the universe and was the background to all natural
phenomena and manifested its presence through the transmission of such immaterial forces as
electricity and magnetism, electromagnetism and then the question comes up well how about gravity,
how about chemical that's set that aside for the moment and in 1845 Faraday introduced the term
field to describe the way that electric and magnetic forces existed within this material
medium, this aether, I'm going to call it aether not aether because it sounds pretentious,
the aether is the substrate that electric and magnetic forces exist in and the field is a way
of referring to the way that electric and magnetic influences flow through the aether the way they
propagate are transmitted through the aether and so Faraday supposed that that matter comes in the
form of polar electrically polarized molecules which in trance so how can you have molecules
without atoms that better not to ask the matter comes packaged in electrically polarized let's
call them molecules but they are not truly atom based molecules in the in the sense that we talked
about the atomic theory of matter and that's what gives rise to electric and magnetic forces and
that the fields surrounded through this through a what he called initially a dielectric medium
there's a kind of electric medium that sounds a surrounds electrically charged particles
magnetic medium magnetic field that surrounds magnets and the these are clearly immaterial but
they are real because for Faraday they are embedded so to speak in this material aether that fills
all of space and so it's not mystical he's proposing some kind of mathematical some kind of
mechanical material model here for what he called the electric field the magnetic field later when
we'll see it's also called it becomes more famous as the electromagnetic field when we unite
electricity magnetism and and optics Faraday proceeded along two lines of thinking sort of
simultaneously that is say he sometimes referred to these to these to the field in its physical
manifestation to electric and magnetic forces in the in a physical way giving a mechanical
explanation of them and then sometimes he just referred to them mathematically using a very
simple mathematical description and then he talked about lines of force that there are
mathematical there are magnetic lines of force there are electrical lines of force and that's
the way one electrically charged particle attracts or repels another electrically charged
particle depending on the charge and and the same thing for magnets and the way that magnets and
electrically charged particles interact is also through these lines of force which initially he
described magnetically but I'm sorry mathematically but in the middle of the 1840s he started
referring to these mathematical lines of force as as physically real and as manifestations of the
underlying structure of matter that these lines of force told us something about the internal
constitution of matter at the at the at the most fundamental level and he did an experiment which
clearly affected his thinking and and still affects lots of people's thinking which is
extraordinarily simple but it allows us to visualize these lines of force he he sprinkled
very fine iron filings on a piece of let's say paper you eat in high school we generally did
on a piece of paper and you hold a magnet underneath and you sort of move the magnet
around a little bit and what happens is that the the iron filings and I'm sure you've seen
this the iron filings line up and form visible manifestations of these lines of force sort
of football shape can a concentric roughly elliptical line so that the whole thing looks
like a bit like a football but they are very specific lines that are that are separated
from one another and and if you shake them up again and do the thing over again you'll get
those same things back so Faraday saw this as a physical manifestation of his mathematically
described lines of force and that reinforced his view that what we were seeing here in
fact was a was was a manifestation of the underlying mechanism by which within nature
electricity and magnetism propagated and and and existed in terms of the form of the structure
of matter so that matter had an intrinsically electrical structure on the outside it looked
electrically neutral but on the inside it had an electrical character Faraday is the
key player in in the development of the concept of the field into the 1840s when William Thompson
Lord Kelvin the same fellow who who sort of intervened in and jowls experiments on the
mechanical equivalent of the mechanical equivalent of work converting mechanical action into
heat and and brought Carnot and Clapeyron's ideas together with jowls and sort of redirected
them away from the specific form that that jowl put his results in Thompson intervened
here in Faraday's researches he was familiar being a mathematically oriented physicist
Thompson was very familiar with the work of Joseph Fourier a French physicist who after
many years of having problems getting it published finally published in 1822 1823 finally finally
published an essay of his called an analytical theory of heat and what Fourier did was to
say look I want to get away from this whole controversy that's ripping a part of the physics
community apart about whether heat is motion or heat is caloric I have come up with a set
of of equations that describe the flow of heat independent of of whether heat is caloric
whatever it is it doesn't I don't care what it is what I can tell you is how it behaves
my equations describe how heat behaves what Thompson noticed was that the form of those
equations was strikingly similar to the form of the equations describing the flow of electricity
and magnetism through these fields that Faraday was was developing and using mathematical
tools that Faraday did not have Thompson decided that there must be some kind of physical
analogy at work as well here that it's not just a curious mathematical coincidence that
these that these equations describing the flow metaphorically speaking of electricity the
propagation of electric and magnetic forces has a similarity in form to the equations
describing the flow of heat in a in a thermally conducting body there must be some physical
connection and that must they must that gives us some clue as to what the ether must be like in
order to support the transmission of of electric and magnetic forces what the field must be like
and he persisted persisted for for decades in attempting to come up with a mathematical model
that did justice to the increasingly sophisticated mathematical description of the ether and electric
and magnetic fields James Clark Maxwell great Scottish mathematical physicist of the 19th
century especially the second half of the 19th century one of the true one of the one of the
handful of the greatest of all of physicists of all times right up there with Archimedes and
Newton and Einstein Maxwell picked up on this problem and initially tried to advance Faraday's
and Thompson's work with within the framework of a mechanical or material model of the ether
trying to take this idea seriously that Faraday's electric and magnetic fields of existed within
and and were propagated through this space filling stuff called the ether which posed the
serious problems in terms of well the ether fills all of space but it can't slow down the
planets as it as they orbit the Sun for example so it can't interfere with the mechanical motion
of material objects it's got to explain electrical phenomena it's got to explain magnetic phenomena
and and it turns out that Faraday's hunch that light was an electromagnetic phenomenon it can't it
has to also explain electromagnetic phenomena and it can't and it must not interfere with the
propagation of light waves from the Sun to the earth for example so it can't slow them down or
interfere with them in any way and this was collateral with the development in the 19th
century of a wave theory of light replacing Newton's atomic theory of light that's a story in its own
right that Newton's atomic theory of light was discarded in the in the first half of the 19th
century in favor in the course of that 50 years in favor of a wave theory of light that's that light
was a wave what kind of a wave a wave has to exist in in a medium yeah it can't have ocean waves
without the meat without the ocean what happens if you take away the water that you can't have
any waves so again the ether became the medium that transmitted light waves from one glowing body
out into its environment let's take the Sun the light that comes from the Sun but anything that you
heat up so that it becomes glowing so then it's it's radiating light waves and and in the case of
the Sun we have what we believe is empty space of course if Faraday's point of view you don't have
empty space space is filled with the ether well well in that case we don't have to worry about
about what's carrying the the light waves but waves the light is a wave motion in the ether in 1865
Maxwell published a seminal work which was a mathematical description of the electromagnetic
field and this is perhaps one of the most important single works that in in the history of
modern science and a mathematical description of the electromagnetic field first of all the term
field occurs secondly the term electromagnetic occurs what we now have is a single field that is
responsible for electrical forces magnetic forces and it turns out within this essay that he's got
an account of that light is truly an electromagnetic phenomenon it is an electromagnetic wave it is
a combination of electric and magnetic waves that travel together that are coupled together and
that's what makes light an electromagnetic phenomenon Maxwell's equations allow us to
deduce from them all known electrical phenomena all known magnetic phenomena and all known optical
phenomena so this theory this electromagnetic this mathematical theory of the electromagnetic field
is unites it's an early instance of the unification of forces within physics we have the unification
of electricity magnetism and optics within mathematical Maxwell's equations in math of the
electromagnetic field in 1865 in that paper and in his a seminal textbook in 1873 called a
treatise on electricity and magnetism Maxwell insists that that the pursuit of a mechanical
model of the ether and the the attempts to identify the material structure of the ether taking
it seriously that they're that that all of the space of the universe is filled with this ether
stuff is hopeless and that all we can have is a mathematical model analogous to Fourier's
analytical theory of heat analytical in that title by the way refers to algebra so the analytical
theory of heat is an algebraic theory of heat which astues the whole issue of what heat is and
describes the process of flow of the flow of heat in a in a hot body and or in anybody that is
that's thermally conducting what Maxwell says is what we can have is a mathematical theory of the
electromagnetic field independent that it describes the processes of electricity magnetism
and light their behaviors but it does not tell us what electricity magnetism and light are nor
does it tell us what the field is that transmits and exerts electric and magnetic forces for
example so an electrically charged particle exerts a force on another electrically charged
particle across ostensibly empty space or through the ether it exerts a force on it and the size
of that force is described by the intensity of the electric field at any point in space notice by
the way that one of the things about the field idea that is fundamentally incompatible with the
atomistic style of thinking is that a field by definition is continuously distributed in space
a field fills space in principle the field generated by a single charged particle fills extends
throughout the universe and any other charged particle anywhere in the universe will experience
a force because it is in the electric field generated by our initial charged particle
atomistic thinking says that the causes of natural phenomena are sharply localized in
physical atoms chemical atoms cells germs genes member localization was one of the
keys to convincing people that atoms are real that germs are real that cell that that the
genes are real cells because of the mic of the improved microscope allowed people people were
able to actually see the cells so the the max and Maxwell insists on this because he says
echoing something that Descartes had written in his principles of philosophy namely that God there
are an infinite number of ways that God could have created the universe so what we have to do
is just find a way that allows us to deduce fight propose hypothesize a a set of principles that
God used and then we they are justified if we can deduce from them the way nature actually behaves
and that's the best we can do Newton rejected that idea because that kind of hypothesizing he said
was sort of like fantasizing and that we could in fact identify the true causes of natural phenomena
but what Maxwell says is there are an infinite number of potential mechanical models of the ether
and there's no possibility of deciding of picking one of these of isolating one of these as the
correct model there are an infinite number of models that can fit the observed behavior of
electromagnetic phenomena in spite of which Maxwell proposes a mechanical model everything
I've said before is correct in 1865 and 1873 he insists on a mathematical theory of the electromagnetic
field and after making it clear that that is what we need that is the that is the good science
nevertheless he proposes a mechanical model because he says after all there must be a mechanical model
there the ether is real and it must have some form and there can't be the electromagnetic
phenomena without the ether so let's see if we can come up with a a model that will that will be
satisfactory and of course it wasn't satisfactory in the course of the 1870s in the 1880s there was
an effectively universal commitment on the part of the physics community to the reality of the ether
virtually nobody nobody that I'm aware of doubted the reality of the ether there were quite strong
controversies as to the nature of the ether what the structure of the ether was but there was no
doubt that the ether was real that it was as as a famous physicist said as late as 1900 one thing
we can be certain of as all the theories of 19th century physics we look back on them and how
they're changing and how how they have changed and how they've been challenged one thing we can be
certain of as so to speak the conceptual the framework of physics matures is that the ether
is real that was around 1900 it would cease being real pretty soon but in the 1870s and 80s I mentioned
at the end of the last lecture for example that the Irish physicist George Fitzgerald in 1880
postulated an electromagnetic ether that produced what we call matter as a kind of a stable
knot of electromagnetic energy so that matter was not a fundamental constituent of reality
it was analogous to a molecule in relation to an atom so molecules are made up out of atoms
molecules are real of course but they are reducible so to speak to the atoms that compose them
in the in the case of Fitzgerald he's saying that energy is the ultimate reality and matter
is a peculiar package of of energy a stable knot of energy in in the greater electromagnetic field
which fills which fills all of space and whose character is such that it accounts for all
electromagnetic phenomena and then it actually accounts for all the phenomena of physics and
chemistry through those knots that we call matter and the particular properties that
different knots have if you've been a scout then you then you know that there are many different
kinds of knots and they have different properties so it's not as if there's only one knot matter
occurs in in a number of different forms with different properties and they then account for
all of physics and chemistry now this is quite an incredible turnabout from the atomistic style of
thinking what he's saying is that the electromagnetic ether is the ultimate reality the sole ultimate
constituent of reality concurrently lord kelvin the same william thompson was developed rejected
the idea of an electromagnetic ether and formulated another form of the ether what's called an elastic
solid model of the of the ether again the the problem with it is accounting for all of the
different things that the ether has to do in the 1880s albert michelson an american physicist the
first american to win a Nobel prize in physics albert michelson first alone and then with another
edward moorley built a really sophisticated device for detecting the presence of the ether
by measuring the earth's velocity relative to the ether and these experiments in the 1880s
performed at the at what is now the case western reserve institute of technology in cleveland
that these uh that these experiments all came out with a null result there was no motion of the
earth relative to the ether and this was really puzzling because after improving his equipment
mike everyone agreed that michelson's device called an interferometer would would be capable
of measuring the velocity of the earth through the ether and the fact that the velocity kept coming
up zero when the data are appropriately uh are appropriately massaged because for error because
no results are always exactly anything so the convergent result was zero this was a real puzzle
and george fitzgerald and the dutch physicist henrik laurance came up with an explanation
they came up with an explanation that goes back to faraday's idea that matter is ultimately
electrically polarized on the inside and they explained the null result of the michelson
moorley experiments by saying that because of the existence of the electromagnetic ether
matter when it travels through the ether since matter is electrically polarized internally
atoms are electrically polarized internally then out then they interact with the field in such a way
that they shrink in the direction of their motion by exactly the amount that would would reveal the
motion the absolute motion of the earth relative to the ether they actually become so shorter
as a function of their speed in such a way that it cancels out the measurement of that speed
this became known as the lorenz fitzgerald contraction or the fitzgerald lorenz contraction
depending on whether you're dutch or irish i guess and uh and uh and was a very important result
because it showed that there was an electrodynamic character to mechanics that electrodynamic a force
based electrical character and this sets the scene really for einstein's 1905 papers on the
photoelectric effect and the special theory of relativity it explains why the special relativity
paper is called on the electrodynamics of moving bodies einstein was going to be showing
that all of these phenomena can be explained without reference to the ether einstein never
disprove the existence of the ether he just offered a theories in which the ether simply
does not occur and the ether quietly disappeared from physics between roughly speaking 1905 and 1925
but we'll be talking about that in subsequent lectures
