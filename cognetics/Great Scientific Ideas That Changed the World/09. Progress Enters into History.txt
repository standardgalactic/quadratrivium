I said at the end of the last lecture that human history is not logical, obviously sort
of a personal commentary on the events that I was describing.
From a certain perspective, for example, those of you who are familiar with the philosopher
Hegel might say, oh no, according to one view of history at least, Hegel's deterministic
view, history does unfold like a logical argument in the nature of a deductive syllogism.
But for, I think, from a common sense perspective, most of us feel that the twists and turns
of history are not logical, indeed given the focus of this course and the idea of science
and in particular on the specific definition of knowledge that became incorporated into
the idea of science.
It was Aristotle's view that history could not have a science, that could be no science
of history because the individual events that make up history are particular and therefore
do not lend themselves to universalization.
If you can't have universals, then you can't have universal laws of history and so history
cannot have a science.
There can be no knowledge of history, you can have histories, of course, and they can
be valuable in guiding behavior, but there can be no true science of history.
Not saying that Aristotle's right, of course, and certainly not that Hegel was right, but
the idea to say that history is not logical was provoked by the reflection that it seems
as though modern science really ought to have emerged in the 14th century, sometime early
in the 14th century, out of the tremendous excitement and innovative intellectual and
social, technological, commercial, political ferment of the 12th, 13th, and early 14th
centuries, there in the early 14th century when you think now these views about nature
study, about mathematics, about experiments, about the autonomy of the intellect, etc.,
should now converge and we would see modern science emerge and if that had happened we
would have said no wonder modern science emerged, look, we can see its antecedents very clearly.
It would have seemed quite logical to us if modern science had emerged in the early 14th
century instead what happened was that there was a waning of the social dynamism that I
referred to as sort of the reason why we call the 12th century the 12th century renaissance,
that this broad based dynamism, the flow of innovations and the enthusiasm with which
these innovations were embraced, implemented in society, drove change in society, waned
in the 14th century. Why? Well I mentioned at the end of the last lecture that plague,
the outbreak of plague surely played some role in this but in spite of the glibness with
which we referred to the plague and its devastation in the 14th century especially and then episodically
after that. It's not exactly clear how devastating the plague was. The plague broke out in 1347,
1348 in Europe. According to attempts by scholars to reconstruct its damage somewhere plausibly
between 10 percent and 30 percent of the population was killed by the plague. These are of course
devastating numbers. Keep in mind that the flu epidemic of 1918 is supposed to have killed
somewhere on the order of 400 to 500 thousand Americans, a staggering number in absolute
terms but representing perhaps one half of one percent of the population of the United
States at that time, population being about 100 million. So if in fact the plague killed
even 10 percent of the population of Europe then that would be 20 times the number of
deaths, 20 times the percentage of the population that was killed and if it was 30 percent then
we see it's quite devastating but at the same time the 100 years war between England
and France which broke out in the 1320s and lasted until somewhere in the 1430s was being
prosecuted with vigor. And in fact there are almost no literary references of the day
to the plague. So how much we can say that it was plague that forced a kind of break
in the unfolding of the idea of science within European culture, it's not at all clear.
And what's really ironic and what makes us really I think feel that well history isn't
logical is that it was in the 14th century that we can see the first explicit expressions
of the idea of progress which is what this lecture is going to be concerned with. We're
going to be talking about the idea of progress. The idea of progress is not a specifically
scientific idea and yet it quickly became coupled to science that science became the
standard bearer of the idea of progress and it was the idea of progress that was underlay
the society's embrace of science and technology as drivers of social change as we will see
in the course of this lecture. What seems to us logical is that here is the 14th century
in which the dynamism of the preceding 250 years clearly wanes and at that time the idea
of progress is formulated. Furthermore the idea of progress is introduced explicitly into
European culture not in response to the innovations and the knowledge and the institutionalization
of new forms of knowledge and trade and commerce etc. the characteristic of the preceding 250
years but in a community of scholars who above all cherished poetry and literature and purity
of language. That seems quite ironic and illogical so to speak. If the idea of progress had been
introduced because someone wanted to stand up and say look things have slowed down but
look at what we have done over the past 250 years we are better off than we had been.
We are making progress then that too would have seemed logical but in fact the idea is
initially coupled with a movement called humanism and it was only in the 16th and 17th century
that the idea was transposed was you could say it was co-opted by those who argued that
oh no progress is being driven in western society by science and technology by new scientific
knowledge and by technological innovations. The author of the idea of progress not I mean
he gave voice to this idea was Petrarch. Petrarch was an Italian poet of the 14th century
and the generation after Dante whom he admired greatly and Petrarch was himself not particularly
interested in science and certainly not in technology he was a sensitive aesthetic soul
who wrote poetry and admired Dante but where Dante's comedy which Petrarch's friend Boccaccio
called the divine comedy because he thought that the poem that we know as the divine comedy
was divine you could not improve upon it while Dante wrote that in Italian Petrarch reverted
to Latin and Petrarch unquestionably loved at some very deep personal level loved beautiful
language and this is perhaps part of the poetic sensibility but Petrarch went way beyond that
I mean he was a broadly based intellectual and it was Petrarch who introduced this sort
of rough periodization of human history into the classical period of Greece and Rome when
cultural and especially linguistic excellence was had been achieved that is say the beauty
and the power and the grace of Greek and Latin literature Greek and Latin poetry Greek
and Latin drama the and history writing and philosophy writing the beauty of the language
as well as of course the power of the ideas this is what Petrarch admired tremendously
the middle medieval the middle or and dark period when there was a total collapse you
might think well he was concerned about health and wealth no total collapse of linguistic
purity Latin had been vulgarized and nobody spoke good Latin anymore and and Greek was
forgotten so what now Petrarch said he sees in Dante and in the generation of Italian
poets that is beginning to to emerge after Dante Petrarch sees the beginning of a rebirth
which has come to be called the Renaissance rebirth the a rebirth of what a rebirth of
linguistic excellence a ring a re re re a rebirth of cultural excellence we see people
beginning to recognize that beautiful language that beautiful poetry expressed in beautiful
language that beautiful literature is once again a value and and and he promoted this
value so on one side the this movement that he he he stimulated that he that he founded
called the humanist movement which for the next 250 years approximately maybe 300 years
exerted enormous influence in in western culture was a literary movement at at at at its heart
it was concerned with recapturing the beauty and the linguistic purity and power of classical
Greek and Latin which makes it seem as though these people were irrelevant to the rise of
science and in fact in the first half of the 20th century most historians of science dismissed
the humanist as people who prevented the earlier emergence of the idea of science or who actively
obstructed a focus on the what we would recognize as the scientific study of nature I think this
is completely incorrect and is being increasingly recognized as as incorrect and and for reasons
that you'll see very shortly I think Petrarch himself although the humanist have been accused
of being some sort of amateur esthete who merely wanted to go around reconstructing classical
Greek and Latin and then writing and speaking in ways as if they were still living in ancient
Athens and in ancient Rome that Petrarch himself clearly indicated that the goal is to recover
the linguistic beauty and purity of of classical Greek and Latin not in order to repeatedly
emulate the poems of the poetry of of Homer or the the dramas of Escalus or the poetry
of of of Livy and Ovid the the goal he says and he compares the the humanist to the bee
he says the bee draws the pollen from the flower but it transforms it into honey the goal of
the humanist is to return to the kind of cultural excellence characteristic of Greece and Rome
in order to move beyond that in order to improve on it and this becomes the first sort of the
first articulation of the idea of progress that the first expression that it is part of our
mission on earth so to speak to improve upon what we have been given and that it is possible
to do so but from Petrarch's point of view the precondition of doing that the precondition
of improvement is first becoming a master of the past of the best of the past once you had
become a master of the best of the past then you could improve upon the past now this is in the
14th century and and Petrarch's followers and he there were many of them over the next few hundred
years thousands of Europeans became participants over several as I said over approximately
300 years became participants in the humanist movement the why why were they called humanists
and and what was characteristic of the movement it's not that easy to give a simple answer to
it at one level people were attracted to the movement they were often young intellectuals
who objected to the university curriculum which was heavily loaded with a risk that studying
Aristotle's logic, Ptolemy's astronomy, Euclid's elements and and very did a very dry technical
exercises in grammar and and and and rhetoric and dialectic they were forced to study music
at a mathematical level and and master of the the existing arithmetic texts and what we
would call mathematical arithmetic geometry logic astronomy what they wanted to study was
literature and in fact that was not that was a small component of the curriculum the one that
came under the heading of grammar so there were those people that were humanists in opposition
to what they perceived to be the science and philosophy technical philosophy dominated
curriculum of the medieval university there were others who who were like like Petrarch
primarily interested in in recovering pure Latin and learning Greek so that they could
they could return at to get back to the at least the level that ancient Greece and Rome were at
and in that to that end those people for hundreds of years sought out manuscripts by scouring
the monasteries of Europe where often in monastic libraries here and there there was a text
there was a manuscript of a of an Aristotelian text of a text of Euclid of a text of Ptolemy
of course they weren't looking for those texts specifically very often they were not particularly
interested in science and mathematics they were interested in the literary text they were
interested in the poetry text they were interested in the drama text and we're interested in the
history text that but along the way they they were in love with everything Greek and Latin
and so along the way they did recover texts by Euclid and and text manuscripts of Ptolemy
almost all of these texts had been dramatically corrupted in the course of being transmitted
from their original language copied over for centuries translated into Syriac and into Arabic
translated from Arabic into Hebrew and then into Latin in the 1213 centuries and and the
texts were often copied by monks as part of their work ritual they were required to do
certain work and copying manuscripts was part of that and they didn't the monks that were
often barely literate themselves so that enormous numbers of errors crept into the the
copied manuscripts which the humanists became increasingly sensitive to and so they started
collecting as often as possible original manuscripts and they also attempted to learn
Greek and Latin of the classical sort based on their manuscript study so that they could
they could recognize errors in the manuscript so they studied Greek and Latin and inevitably
they also had to study Hebrew and Arabic and those became new courses of study in the in the
medieval university especially Hebrew added to Greek and in addition to Latin so that in
the 16th century you start getting the first professorships of of of Hebrew and Greek and
the expectation that an educated person is going to know at least Greek and Latin and a
scholar has to work with Hebrew ideally with Arabic as well as with various vernacular languages
by the time you get to the 16th and 17th century so there was a strong linguistic focus a strong
historical focus and in the course of of collecting these thousands of manuscripts what the
humanists did was to develop a set of critical tools objective critical tools for restoring
the original manuscript from corrupt copies effectively every copy is corrupt there is
no such thing as a clean version of Ptolemy's Almagest the core text in astronomy or Euclid's
elements of geometry or Aristotle's writings on logic there is no correct text that you can
recognize that oh this is the correct text throw out all the others what you have is maybe
dozens of of of partial or complete manuscripts all of which have errors in them what do you do
how can you restore how can you recover and an unavailable correct text and how will you
know when you have gotten there this is a non-trivial problem in in scholarship and the
and the humanists over a period of centuries developed very sophisticated critical tools
beginning with manuscript collation you start with collecting as many manuscripts as you can
of a particular text and you start comparing those texts and you can often recognize and
repair lots of mistakes just by collation very often you can't do that and you have to
amend the text because it may be that while you have 11 copies of a particular text all
11 come from an original source and they are repeating the same mistake in that source
and if you recognize the error then you need to be able to amend the text but you have to be
very careful with emendation you have to make sure that what you have recognized is an error
and that what you are going to insert is the correction because you don't know you don't
have the correct word or the correct phrase to available to you so what the what the what
the humanist scholars were doing was I believe doing something that was profoundly influential
on the rise of the scientific method in the 17th century they were developing critical tools
that allowed you to make overt to make available to you as a reader a correct version of the
original text that is covert that's hidden it's not available we don't have it and yet
they're bringing it to light they're bringing that they're teasing that text to light using
these critical methodological tools and that's very similar it seems to me well let's say
it's analogous to making visible to us the hidden processes of nature which are not available
to us to see even after the scientist tells you that matter is made out of quarks you cannot
now go back and look at the English muffin that you're having for breakfast and see oh yes
I can see them now there are the little devils whirling around inside the protons and neutrons
in the neutron you want to you the just as science makes visible to us at least makes
visible to the mind a reality that is otherwise invisible to the mind so the humanist scholars
were making visible to us giving us a text we could read with some measure of confidence
that this is the text that Plato wrote that Aristotle wrote that Euclid wrote that Ptolemy
wrote that humanists also did something else that was very influential for modern science
and that was that they that they constituted a community of scholars distributed all over
Europe who regularly communicated with each other who shared their work especially starting
in the late 15th century and throughout the 16th century sharing their printed work and
and getting critical comments back from others and founding societies where scholars got together
to discuss their shared work and and and and ultimately journals in which this work was
published all of which became a sort of precedence that became central to science in the 17th
century where societies of scientists communicating with one another a notifying one another about
their ideas and discoveries and claims to knowledge and being and getting critical responses yes
we repeated your experiments and indeed your work we can confirm this no we didn't get these results
that idea that science is a collective practice by a community of scholars with shared standards
those were in fact formulated by the humanists now in the by the time we get into the 16th century
especially as we will see in the next lecture by the time we get into the 16th century the
humanists were at the very core at work within the very core of a new dynamism a resumed dynamism
in in Western and Southern European and generally in European society that that we recognize as
the Renaissance and even in the 15th and 16th century certain already in the 15th century the idea
of progress which starts out as a literary and aesthetic idea becomes associated with science
and technology with technology with techno science because now what while in in the 12th
13th and 14th centuries the innovations that were transforming European society were not
techno science they were technological innovations that emerged out of craft tradition not by the
deliberate application of mathematics to to nature to natural phenomena the water mills
and the wind mills and and the stern post rudder etc. essentially mounted stern post rudder
that I referred to the breast harness for the horse the heavy plow these were not derived from
scientific theories and in fact scientific theories didn't have much to offer until we get to the 19th
century and they were not derived from the application of mathematics specifically so I would
I would not attach the term techno science to the 12th century Renaissance and its and its immediate
consequences but in the Renaissance we are going to see techno science emerging that is to say we
that Roman that Greco-Roman idea of knowledge driving technological innovation is going to
reemerge with with vigor in the in the 16th century especially but beginning in the 15th
century and the idea of progress is going to become attached to science technology and
techno science and ever after right from then on the idea of progress has been carried by and
has driven the embrace of science and science based innovations as a sign of progress there
there was in the fifth in the 15th and 16th centuries as to give you an idea that I'm just
not making this whole thing about progress up there were there were very many literary works
and popular entertainments that were called the battles of the ancients against the moderns
and these battles were of course mock battles in which either there was merely a debate
between intellectuals one of whom was defending the view that we are no better than they were in
fact we would be lucky to come close to the hems of their garments it was only in the old
days that people knew how to write it was only in the old days that people knew how to think
clearly that those were the golden old days and on the other side no don't be ridiculous
they didn't know about they didn't know how to do the things that we can do of course this has
to be now we're talking the 15th and 16th centuries they didn't have printing with movable
metal type they didn't have gunpowder they didn't have the compass they didn't have paper they
didn't have they didn't know about the world as we do we have circumnavigated the globe they
didn't know about the Americas they had never actually been to China they didn't understand
and it by the end of the 16th century there was so much novelty so to speak in European
culture that the battles were it was no it was a it was no longer a battle because the idea
of progress had won everyone recognized by the time you get into the 17th century by the time
you get into the generations of between Galileo and Newton the battle was was a memory it was
isn't it cute that people used to argue about this kind of thing and so when we get when we see
in the 18th century what in Europe was called the enlightenment then this is a direct expression
of the idea of progress having been co-opted by science as the living embodiment of reason that
the that the root to progress is through the application of reason to human affairs science
is the living embodiment of reason and so science becomes in the 18th century identified
with an agent of social reform and science and technology together in the course of the 18th
century even before they had the power to transform society in the ways that they did in the 19th
and 20th centuries science and technology especially in in Germany France England and
and in Italy are explicitly identified as the means by which the human condition can be
indefinitely improved this had been promised by Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes in the
beginning in the early 17th century when when when they were one of the two of the founders
of modern science but in fact the promise took quite a while to fulfill in the 18th century
the the idea that reason is the means by which human beings can achieve secular salvation
becomes a not just a prominent theme in Western intellectual life it becomes a powerful force
in Western society it underlies the American Revolution and under and underlies the French
Revolution it revel and under and underlies the desire to make a science out of everything
it was in the 18th century that we had the beginnings of this of a sustained serious effort
to make a science out of society the beginnings of the science that in the 19th century was
given the name sociology a science out of the mind of how to the mind of how the mind works
especially among the French French intellectuals a science out of economics a science out of
political life the application of mathematics to political policies political decision making
those are all rooted those are all expressions of the enlightenment they all are to be found
in the 18th century Adam Smith's the wealth of nations for example was published in 1776
a year of some consequence for us and the founders of of America were strong believers in this idea
especially someone like Thomas Jefferson that what we're doing here is based on reason
we hold these truths to be self-evident the Declaration of Independence specifically refers
to the idea that there are self-evident truths that are the basis for the rebellion against
the English king and the creation of a form of government that is rational that does that
does not merely perpetuate history but reflects the application of human reason to human affairs
so what we've seen here very briefly sketched but we're going to pick up on it in the next
lecture in the next lectures as we discuss the introduction of print technology into Europe
and the Renaissance the idea of technoscience and the Renaissance what we've seen here is
that the idea of progress begins to emerge in the 14th century through a group of poets
of intellectuals concerned that there is such total aesthetic decay in Europe at this time
and yet we have the example of the Greeks and Romans we can restore the glory that was Greece
and the grandeur that was Rome at least at the aesthetic level if we make our mission
to be as good as they were linguistically it emerges in that context not them saying look
at how much we accomplished over the last 250 years human beings are actually living better
and are superior to the way human beings were a thousand years ago they did not say that
and that idea then was pursued with vigor by this humanist intellectual community in the
14th, 15th and 16th centuries and in the course of the 15th and 16th century when as we will see
European society began to apply knowledge to technology and transformed itself once again
into what we now call modern society then the idea of progress became associated primarily
with science and technology in the 18th century emerging as the agent of social reform the basis
for social reform and then we will see how that translates in the 19th century into the driver
of social change that still shapes our lives.
