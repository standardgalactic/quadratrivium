In the very first lecture in this course, I called attention to the fact that scientific
ideas overwhelmingly changed the world through technological applications.
And I introduced the term technoscience to refer to those technological applications
that are explicitly dependent on derived from scientific knowledge.
The idea of technoscience first manifested itself, you'll recall, in the Greco-Roman
period, and especially I cited the work of the ten books on architecture by Vitruvius,
who specifically spoke to the superior kind of know-how that an architect slash engineer
would possess if it were based on knowledge rather than sort of the craft know-how that
had been accumulating for thousands of years, and that was omnipresent in the Greco-Roman
world through the very considerable technology infrastructure that existed at the time.
The idea of technoscience is therefore easily attributable to, let's say, the last 200 years
before the beginning of the Christian era, so roughly speaking from the time of Archimedes
and maybe some of his immediate predecessors through Vitruvius and into the Roman world,
but there was no scientific knowledge that could be used to generate technological applications
of a considerable sort.
So there was a certain amount of mathematical physics that was available that was used in
the design of weapons, for example, of ballistas and the catapults, but overwhelmingly the idea
of technoscience was an idea, and it's fascinating that that idea could have been part of the
Greco-Roman mindset, and it tells us a lot about the power of the idea of knowledge,
the idea of scientific knowledge, which was at that time a relatively new idea, and from
our perspective, did not have a great deal of accomplishment behind it.
In the 12th century Renaissance, as I called it, the industrial revolution of the 12th
and 13th centuries in which there was an explosion of technological innovation, there was nothing
that I would call technoscience.
It was, again, an industrial revolution based on know-how.
It was craftsmanly, it was superb, it was innovative, it was creative, it was clever,
it was powerful, but it was not based on knowledge.
In the Renaissance, we had an interesting intellectual development in that the idea
of progress in the 16th and 17th centuries was explicitly linked to technological innovation
and scientific knowledge as a source of technological innovation.
But the only technological innovations in the Renaissance period that one could point
to as based on knowledge were those that were based on mathematical knowledge.
So the applications of mathematics, as in central vanishing point perspective drawing
and in mathematical cartography, navigation, engineering drawing, etc., the examples that
I pointed to in that lecture.
We have been, for 300 years in effect, on a role of talking about the emergence of increasingly
powerful scientific ideas which with a clear focus on the 19th century as the time when
scientific ideas began to reach degrees of maturity and explanatory power that we recognize
as predecessors of the scientific theories that are in use today.
And now is the time when we need to look at not just the idea of techno-science but the
emergence in the 19th century, collateral with the emergence of this new generation
of increasingly powerful scientific theories, the rise of techno-science not just as an
idea but as a force of relentlessly transforming society.
And so in this lecture and the next lecture, I want to look at the emergence of techno-science
as a force in society.
It's transitioned from an idea, a promise, as Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes promised
that scientific knowledge of nature would give us power over nature.
That promise is delivered beginning in the mid-19th century.
But by then, the Industrial Revolution was already in place.
And what's interesting, the Industrial Revolution that we associate with steam power in the
early end of the 18th and the early 19th century, what's interesting is again, and I want to
write from the beginning, I've tried to do justice to this, that know how it was really
the basis of the innovations that initiated the Industrial Revolution.
The Industrial Revolution was not dependent on techno-science.
Piggybacked on an Industrial Revolution that had been precipitated by people who possessed
know how and often had little or no formal education or had been apprenticed and had
considerable crampsmanly know how, but again, were not formally educated and did not possess
what we have seen scientists of the modern stripe required in order to qualify as having
knowledge as being scientists, having the kind of theoretical understanding that we
associate with science as distinct from craftsmanship, know how, etc.
The Industrial Revolution is full of fascinating characters.
The origins of the Industrial Revolution are rich in fascinating characters.
The man Abraham Darby, born to a Quaker family and apprenticed out as a teenager, becoming
knowledgeable about the bronze, the business of machining bronze, of smelting bronze, of
casting bronze, and becoming a very successful businessman in bronze, but showing considerable
creativity in discovering how to smelt iron ore using coke instead of charcoal.
This is in the early 18th century, 1709, for example, in which iron works was in production.
At that time, wood was becoming increasingly scarce and it takes an enormous amount of
wood to be burned down to charcoal to be used as fuel in an iron forge, a blast furnace.
Darby figured out how to use coal, not directly, but by first converting coal to coke by burning
it in a closed vessel and getting coke out of it.
Then using coke as the fuel, this required modifying the blast furnace or the iron forge
in order to be able to use coke, and it was a trick that he and his colleagues in England
managed to keep a secret, so to speak, or it was an open secret, keep away from competitors
for over 100 years.
It was really illegal to export that kind of knowledge, especially to America, but eventually
a Welshman named David Thomas in the 19th century did come to America, settled in the
Lehigh Valley, and started building iron forges that used coal rather than charcoal as a fuel,
and that dramatically reduced the cost of iron and the volume of iron that could be produced.
So Darby, in some sense, a self-educated, but nevertheless highly intelligent individual,
really pioneered or opened the way to iron becoming a commodity, and it became increasingly
a commodity throughout the next 200 years as the production processes increased in volume
and the cost per pound of iron decreased.
So Darby really opened this way, and his family business flourished for over a century in which
successive generations of Darby's further pushed the production of iron, eventually
building the first iron bridge, for example, and initiating major changes in construction.
Darby is one example of how a critical piece of the infrastructure that erupted as the
industrial revolution at the end of the 18th, beginning of the 19th century, emerged out
of know-how.
Even more startling is the story of James Hardgreaves, who invented the spinning Jenny,
or who built the spinning Jenny based on an idea that he heard of, not exactly clear,
but Hardgreaves was basically illiterate, and he built a working spinning Jenny in which
eight spindles, a single operator turned one wheel, which spun eight spindles on which
thread was spun, and this was obviously a tremendous labor saver, and so his early machinery
was sometimes attacked and destroyed by workers who felt that they were going to be losing
their jobs.
He applied for a patent in this in 1760, I'm sorry, he built his first model in 1764,
and it had eight spindles.
Within 10 years, there were tens of thousands of spinning Jenny's in England alone, with
up to 80 spindles per worker, operate where a single wheel operated up to 80 spindles,
a tremendous increase in the volume of thread that was available, thread and yarn that was
available, and a tremendous collapse in the price of that thread and yarn, which eventually
filters through to a tremendous decrease in the price of the finished cloth.
So the beginnings of mass production come from an effectively illiterate workman who
had an idea, who translated it into a device, which was immediately picked up and copied
on an enormous scale, I mean tens of thousands of spinning Jenny's in England alone, as
I said, within 10 years.
By the time he got around to patenting it, somebody told him that you better patent this,
they wouldn't grant him a patent because it was already being used all over the place,
and so he died poor.
By contrast, Richard Arkwright, who is credited with having developed, but probably did not
invent, a water powered version of the spinning Jenny, called the water frame, or the spinning
frame, in which a water wheel powered a much larger version of the spinning machine, again
tremendously increasing the volume of thread that could be produced, and then developing
an automatic carding machine because they needed to feed the spindles, that we needed
much more raw material from the wood, from the cotton wool, or the cotton, in order to
provide the materials to be spun into thread, and then after that, somebody had to invent
and did invent automatic weaving machines in order to make fabric out of the cotton thread
and the wool yarn, because otherwise the stuff just piles up and what are you going to do,
how are you going to sell it, you sell it to people who make their own clothes, but you
can also now start making, instead of human weavers weaving by hand at a loom, you can
have automated weaving powered by water machinery, and again we have a tremendous increase in
volume, decrease in price of finished goods, which is good in some respects, but Arkwright
was much better businessman than Hargreaves and died very rich.
He patented from the beginning, he was an early adopter of the steam engine, but unlike
Hargreaves, Arkwright understood that in order to really benefit from this machine, it needed
to be embedded in a systematic framework, and so he developed a factory based system
of production that integrated the skills necessary for the water power translated into machine
power, the machines, the operators of the machines, labor policies, brutal labor policies,
avoiding child labor and discarding workers at a relatively young age, because he found
that they no longer, once they no longer possessed the nimbleness in their fingers in order to
operate and to produce the finished work that he needed, so he was one of the brutal examples
what William Blake the poet at that time called the dark satanic mills, seeing in this industrial,
in the first phase of the industrial revolution, a terrible, terrible impact on the working
class in England, and Arkwright's wealth is directly correlated with pressing down the
wages that workers own, with finding in a sense the minimum labor cost that you could
have in order to get people to work in these factories.
Interestingly, a Samuel Slater, a young Englishman, worked as an apprentice with one of Arkwright's
partners and collaborators, he escaped to America and at the end of the 19th century, arrived
in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, around 1790, and it was illegal for workers in these industries
to emigrate because of the knowledge that they carried in their heads, and without any
drawings whatsoever, because that would have been a serious criminal offense, Slater arrived
in Pawtucket and convinced local businessmen that he could build versions of the machines
that the Arkwright factories used, and that he was given the resources to do that, and
within several years had started what became a very large spinning industry here in the
United States. Again, Arkwright came from a very poor background, he was taught to read
by one of his sisters, very poor education, but tremendous, tremendous talent in the area
of know-how. James Watt improved an existing steam engine, Watt himself was a mechanic,
he was an instrument, musical instrument maker, as well as a scientific instrument maker,
he was apprenticed to learn that, but he got a very fragile constitution, he only served
as an apprenticeship for one year, then he moved back from England to Scotland, settled
in Glasgow and got a job at the university repairing scientific instruments, and one
of the things he was given was not a scientific instrument, but it was an old newcomer engine,
which was an early form of a steam engine, really a steam pump, extremely inefficient,
and Watt realized that this could be made much more efficient if the cylinder was kept
hot all the time instead of cooling it off in every cycle in order to get the piston
to fall down, the steam pressure pushed the piston up, and then they cooled the cylinder
wall in order for the steam to condense and then the piston dropped down and then the cycle
started over again, it was an incredibly inefficient device and only made sense if you were using
it to pump water out of a coal mine where the coal was basically free in order to fuel the engine.
Watt quickly saw how the efficiency could be at least tripled and in fact eventually increased
by a factor of 10, and that's what really launched the steam power-based industrial revolution,
but Watt himself had very little formal training except as he became more and more knowledgeable
through self-education, he was a good example of know-how that became one of the pillars of the
industrial revolution was of course the Watt steam engine, he worked on it for eight or nine years
initially supported by a physician who had a number of entrepreneurial interests, he owned
coal mines for example named John Robach, and Robach went bankrupt in 1773 and his interests
were bought up by a friend of his and someone who was acquainted with Watt named Matthew Bolton,
and Bolton together with Watt created the first commercial steam engine company using increasingly
sophisticated versions of Watt's improved steam engine. The first railroads were created by the
father-son team of George and Robert Stephenson, also workmen in the case of the father especially
with almost no education, no schooling and no formal education, I think that the father only
learned to read as a teenager for example, the father and son team Mark and Eisenberg Kingdom
Brunel were responsible for fundamental developments in construction technology, building the first
tunnel under the Thames River for example, building bridges, tunnels and railroads all over England,
and they too had the son Eisenberg Kingdom had some formal schooling but nothing like what we
would consider a college or university level education and did not possess scientific knowledge
but a tremendous amount of sophisticated know-how, systematic know-how that used mathematics, that
used that quantified relationships, and this is a very typical phenomenon at the time in which
people were responsible for major technologies in a sense without being indebted to anything
that we would recognize as scientific knowledge. Robert Fulton's steamboat for example, the first
steam powered boat was basically an off-the-shelf engine put on a boat, Fulton calculated how big
the boat would have to be in order for a steam engine to be able to turn the paddles
fast enough to paddle upstream and he was able to get backing when the support of Robert Livingston
and extremely politically well connected American sort of aristocratic quotation marks
who had the political connections to get the contracts from the government to do a prototype
and prove that they could go up the Hudson River and back down much faster than existing watercraft
and that started the whole steamboat, he was not the only person making steam engines for the boat
but what's fascinating is that Fulton had no special training whatsoever in engineering
but he got this idea and the idea was translated into reality by exploiting other people's
know-how and by accumulating the know-how to do what he wanted to do as if somebody decided
that they were going to build their own custom-made sports car but they bought a kit
and they put it and they put it together along the way having to do lots of cutting and trimming in
order to get it to work to work correctly so they bought an engine here and used car that
they used the chassis and the suspension from there etc and that's sort of what Fulton did
although he had he did it for the first time and he had to come up with the right calculations
so that he he could convince people that this thing would work this is a very familiar story
that that in the early decades of the industrial revolution the the key ingredients came from
know-how but things changed things clearly change when we come to the electric telegraph
which we associate with Samuel F. B. Morse an artist who went to England in order to try to sell
the monumental paintings he was making that he could not sell here in the United States
got the idea of an electric telegraph to replace the mechanical telegraph that had been
built starting in the 1790s in in France and then spread throughout Europe by Claude Schopp
and his brother got this idea that you could have a series of semaphores and the arms of the
semaphores at different positions would stand for would stand for different signals words or
letters and that with using a telescope a person could could look at a semaphore miles away read
the positions of the arm and then transmit the message to the next semaphore station down the
line and by by the 1820s or 30s there were thousands of miles of this kind of mechanical
optical telegraph in western Europe and of course there are problems in bad weather and you can't
do it at night but it did allow the transfer of information over long distances much more rapidly
than sending one sending somebody on a horse or on a boat out into no comparison but Morse got the
idea for the electric for an electric telegraph now while he was in England the physicist Charles
Wheatstone developed an electric telegraph which was actually built in England but it was a much
more complicated and cumbersome device than Morse's so Morse sort of has succeeds in getting the
credit for the first practical commercial electric telegraph but Morse didn't know any science
and Morse's telegraph would not work until through a young physicist that he was introduced to
who knew Joseph Henry at Princeton that Joseph Henry the physicist at Princeton had already
built an electric telegraph based on Faraday's researches on electromagnetism he had built he
had saw the seen the possibility of an electric telegraph built a one-mile line between his
laboratory at Princeton and his home so he could let his wife know when he was coming home for lunch
and and then took the thing apart he had no interest in commercializing it Morse needed the physics
knowledge that Henry possessed in order to make his electric telegraph work that knowledge needed
to be built into Morse's idea which refused to work and because he didn't understand the physics
of the situation and we can see in this an instance of techno science now beginning to emerge but it
be it now erupts on a scale that is of course colossal in the 1850s the American entrepreneur
Cyrus Field decided the time had come to build an underwater cable a telegraph cable connecting
America and Europe and what a wonderful boon that would be in terms of business and the transfer
of information particularly relevant to business but later of course for newspapers as well even
at the time the mass newspaper was just beginning to come into its own and mass circulation newspaper
and Field engaged an amateur telegraph enthusiast who thought that he knew how to do this and they
actually got the money together and built a cable which lasted approximately a month and then
collapsed totally and irretrievably and the successful transatlantic cable needed to be
based on physics and William Thompson Lord Kelvin who has appeared numerous times in
recent lectures Kelvin was called in as an authority and he was put in charge of what
became the first transatlantic cable in the 1860s the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the
United States and Europe and within several years that same knowledge was used to lay telegraph
cables that connected effectively all of the continents Japan and South Southern Asia and
Europe and the United States and Australia eventually the same knowledge the knowledge
based in physics of course the Faraday's work has already been mentioned Faraday I mentioned
invented the dynamo somewhere around 1831 when the 1830 1831 the dynamo was the basis of all
electrical generating machinery the whole all of the technology associated with the generation
of electricity is based on the dynamo principle until you get to the 20th century and such things
as photoelectric photovoltaic devices and the that technology was explicit when it when it became
commercialized especially from approximately the 1870s on and you could actually go in go into
a shop and buy or order an electric generator then that technology was based on the physics
of electromagnetism and and it was necessary to have that knowledge in order to build successful
machines and to use them as Thomas Edison discovered because he was a know-how guy if
ever there was one but as his as his device as his inventions needed to be translated into
commercial products Edison became increasingly dependent on physicists chemists mathematicians
who publicly he mocked all the time in order for the to have access to the knowledge that was
necessary in order to for his products to actually work a good example of that of course is his
introduction of the commercial central generation generation of electricity and its distribution
the pearl street plant in lower Manhattan that was the first example of centrally generated
electricity that was used commercially in order to to support his invention of the incandescent
light bulb and that unleashed the whole electrical appliance industry so that within 20 years you
had electric ovens and electric refrigerators and electric irons and electric toasters and
electric hairdryers almost all the appliances that we think of today as modern were laid down
in the closing decades of the 19th century the first decades of the 20th century in response to
the availability of electricity and this industry clearly based on the the physics as of of
electromagnetism and people who worked in this year engineers needed to know that in order to
design these devices especially the whole network associated with generating electric power
transmitting it a non-trivial distance and then distributing it to for example households and
stores and and offices the the systemic character of Edison's electric business is very important
that it's a whole system just like with the book there's an infrastructure of of of of subsystems
that are necessary in order to create and generate and distribute electricity the technology
associated with radio was developed by Guglielmo Marconi first commercialized by him explicitly
based on on on Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory and the prediction that there were such
things as free electromagnetic waves that travel through space with the speed of light and and
so there's another example where where physics is critical to a technology that has been very
powerful in changing people's lives subsequently television of course the the american telephone
and telegraph industry in the night of business in the 1890s needed to turn to physics in order
to solve problems in long-distance telephony that were making it impractical for telephone lines
to to essentially cross the cross the country we see the same thing and we saw on the lectures on
the germ theory of the of disease that biology the science of biology and especially biochemistry
became where a body of knowledge constituted a body of knowledge that was translated into new
technologies and a beautiful example of this is the invention of the first synthetic dye by
William Perkin an 80 18 and 18 year old english boy who was studying with a german chemist named
aw Hoffman who was teaching in london at the time he had been a student of justus Liebig
who rejected the whole structure business that we had talked about in the lecture on
on the importance of structure to the properties of molecules and uh uh perkin studied on the
hoffman was given the problem of looking into the chemistry of coal tar which is what's left over
when you when you burn coal in in a way that generates a gas that's flammable and was distributed
as illuminating gas or what we call gas light before there was electric light and then there's
this mess that's left over called coal tar and perkin discovered the first the synthetic the
first synthetic dye mauve and triggered a tremendous not just a tremendous change in the
fashion industry but true it triggered a kind of a silicon valley of chemical knowledge generating
new materials in uh synthetic dyes pharmaceuticals plastics artificial fertilizer explosives
propellants for artillery shells that generated an enormous amount of power and prosperity physical
power military power but also economic and political power and a tremendous amount of wealth
and uh initially william perkin benefited he and his family benefited he was he'd like like jobs
like steve jobs and steve osiniak dropped out of college in order to build this business and was
quite successful at it but hoffman went back to germany and germany snatched this proto silicon
valley away from uh england and germany for uh for uh from the 1860s and 70s until uh the i would
say until today but certainly up to world war two was the dominant factor in in world affairs in the
application of chemical knowledge to uh to important commercial products so we see here
that uh that that the idea of techno science is now not just an idea it is in fact all of a
sudden scientific knowledge is being used to change the world quite literally and i want to
argue here i want you to leave with the with the impression that something fundamental has changed
in the night about technology has changed in the 19th century that what we mean by technology
by what we mean by innovation is has changed qualitatively and in the next lecture i want to
describe how this new aspect of technology this new kind of innovation was deliberately
channeled into society by creating new social institutions to enable techno science to be
the driver of social change that it has been ever since
