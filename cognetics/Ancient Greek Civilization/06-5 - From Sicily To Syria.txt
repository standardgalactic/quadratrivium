Now I'm not saying that the Greeks started to speak Phoenician. Let's be clear about this. They're still speaking Greek
But what they are doing is deciding
Towards the end of the 8th century that it would be useful to have a system of writing their language down and
The system that they use for that is a system that originates as a Semitic language
Now the Greeks do something subtle here though. They make quite a change because they take words in
Semitic like aleph and bet things that mean
ox and house and
They drop the meaning of the word and instead
They simply take the sound aleph becomes the letter alpha, which is simply used to write down ah
Not a word not a meaning not an object simply a sound ah
Beth
Loses its meaning as a word and it becomes merely to the Greeks the letter beta which can be used to stand for the sound
but and
With that quite extraordinary step of taking an existing system
Dropping out the meanings associated with these symbols and making them purely phonetic
What the Greeks have done is borrowed someone else's writing system and very soon adapted it using only between
24 and 27 letters to write down everything in Greek a
System which does not require
Hundreds and thousands of ideograms or pictograms with only 24 to 27 letters
Approximately getting all the sounds of Greek you can write down all of Greek with those letters
Now that's quite a breathtaking step if you think about it really quite extraordinary
Now let's take this idea of the origins of writing a little further
I'm using it here to illustrate the notion that the Greeks really did acquire a great deal from their cultural contact
With the broader world in which they were trading and colonizing
but in relation to the
The acquisition of writing some scholars have recently argued what we should pay attention to is what the Greeks choose to write down first of all
What are the Greeks first write down once they have this alphabet and the answer is quite simply?
Homer
That's what Greek is being used for the first time we have Greek
So it's fairly clear once again that the Homeric poems have come to achieve an
astonishing status if the very first thing that your entirely new writing system is is
Used for is to record Homer to write it down
But I want to point out another aspect of the writing and that is not the question of what is written down
But rather where is the first Greek writing and the answer is that our first
Pieces of coherent Greek and lengthy Greek of any sort are not found in Greece. They're found in
Pithecusa the bow of Naples and Almena
Look at that
Trading emporiums places where the Greeks were trading and living right next door to the Phoenicians
Can we go any further probably not with confidence you might like to speculate on something like
Well, what happens when a Greek population and a Phoenician population lives cheek by a jail for a generation or two?
The answer is you produce bilingual children
Because men and women will have children and these children will grow up with both languages
and imagine a child growing up with both Phoenician and Greek
Phoenician and Greek
Being literate in Phoenician and using that system to write down Greek
It's I happen to like the theory of the bilingual child as the source of the Greek alphabet
We can't prove it of course, but I throw it after your delectation
If we go beyond writing with we use writing merely as the most concrete example of what the Greeks are getting from their
Exposure to the wider world of the ancient Near East and ask what comes with that?
Not just in concrete terms, but here intellectually
Spiritually culturally the more abstract level. I think we get a very interesting answer and that is this
The other poet of the 8th century whose work is of immense importance to the Greeks
Aside from Homer is he's he'd he's he writes two long poems the theogony and the works and days and
In the theogony he talks about the origins of the Greek gods
Later people would say he's he'd in a sense codified the Greek gods. He taught the Greeks who their gods were
Now when you read through the poems of he's here, you find something very interesting
We have for example the story of different generations of the gods originally
There is the god Uranos who was attacked by his son Kronos
Remember his genitals are cut off the later
We also have then Kronos being deceived by his son Zeus who feeds him a rock to eat instead of himself
Being cannibalized by his own father three generations of the gods each generation
Overwhelming the generation that came before one by physical attack and one by deception
