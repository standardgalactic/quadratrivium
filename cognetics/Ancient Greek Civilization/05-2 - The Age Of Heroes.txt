So we have to try to interpret that evidence in a slightly different way and one of the ways I would suggest is that
Many of the people who used to live at these Mycenaean sites
Let's say the workmen the perfume makers the shield makers who lived in the suburbs below the Citadel at Mycenae
For example when central authority breaks down when nobody can pay the bills when nobody can supply them with the food
They need they don't just starve what they do is they run away and become herdsmen
They take their flocks
shepherds
Less commonly cow herds and very commonly goat herds they take to the hills
And if you think about it for a moment, you might be able to see why it is that it's so hard to trace them
Archaeologically I thought of this once when driving towards Mount Parnassus
I pulled over and saw a Greek shepherd by the road who'd been on the road for months and at the end of the day
He was building a small lean-to made out of Wattle and Dorb out of bushes and branches that he'd cut and put together
and I tried to imagine what his
Ancestors would have been like
Thousands of years ago and it occurred to me that if you're talking about a man wearing animal skins
With a flock of goats and a bowl made of wood for milking these animals
Which he perhaps wears around his neck on a leather strap during the day and he lives at night in a lean-to made of thatch
Ask yourself this one hundred years after that man is dead and gone. What is the archaeological trace that he's left?
And the answer is zero
Absolutely nothing
So the life of the herder of the itinerant herder moving
his
His herds from pasture to pasture across the hills and up into the mountains and down into the plain
It's a type of lifestyle that makes sense during times of crisis because you are mobile
But at least very little record for the archaeologist and it's very hard to track down later on
now
Replacing the Bronze Age world this brilliant culture that we've been looking at a new type of society would soon emerge during the Dark Ages
The period from about eleven hundred down to about eight hundred and
This is a world which would be dominated not by the great kings of the Mycenaean palaces
But rather by chieftains they would still go by the same name they'd be called Basileis in the plural
But their domains rather than that of a great Mycenaean kingdom would be rather smaller
It would be a domain centered on a single household
The technical term for this in Greek is the Oikos
This Oikos is the central social unit of the Dark Ages in Greece
It's in a single long hut
Where a chieftain with his wife perhaps his aged parents his children his retainers
People who've attached themselves to his household for his protection his serfs his slaves
His property including his goats and his sheep occasionally being brought in
This is the unit of life that dominates in the Dark Ages and it is materially not nearly as
Sophisticated of course as the much more complex social life of the Bronze Age of Mycenae or of Minoan Crete
Nevertheless there's been a tendency in classical studies in archaeology to over emphasize the grimness of this break
To suggest that the world after the Mycenaeans was one that was quite literally dark for 300 years
Nobody had any lamps
The level of poverty was so grinding that the Greeks only very slowly clawed their way back to a full culture
That that picture is very easily over drawn
It's somewhat exaggerated and there is evidence and again here I rehearse evidence
That's really from the last generation and in particular from the last ten years
To suggest that the level of recovery was much greater and much faster in some parts of Greece than has ever been previously expected
There are three places in particular that have made archaeologists rethink what they sometimes called the Sub-Mycenaean period
10th and 9th centuries
The Dark Ages
At Lefkhandi for example on the island of Yubia
We have a monumental building an
Apsidal building that is to say a long building that has a rounded end
It has post holes all along the side and it was built in the 10th century sometime around 950 BC
Now it's quite a breathtaking structure
It's not really like anything Mycenaean so it's it's something new it's something different
And its scale the scale both of building at the scale of the burial goods found at Lefkhandi
Suggest that even as early as 950 people from Yubia were once again trading outside of Greece more widely
