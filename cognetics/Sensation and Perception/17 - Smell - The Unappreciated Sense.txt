Lecture 17, Smell the Unappreciated Sense
Hello and welcome to Lecture 17.
In Lecture 16 we talked about some of the factors that contribute to individual taste
preferences. I marvel at the fact that we all start life with little more than a preference
for sweet and an aversion to bitter and decades later we end up with the wide array of different
taste preferences that we see in humans. In Lecture 17 we're going to begin talking about
the second of our two chemical senses, namely the olfactory sense or smell. I call smell the
unappreciated sense because many people are really unaware of the importance of smell and I hope
that some of the information that I'll share with you in this lecture will convince you that
maybe smell is a little more important than we think. One interesting difference between smell
and many of the other senses is there are no smell primaries. I mean in taste we have sweet,
sour, salty and bitter and maybe umami and in vision we have red, green and blue and the skin
senses, touch and pressure, vibration etc but we don't have any analog in smell. There are no smell
primaries. We can identify, the human nose can actually identify and this has been demonstrated
in laboratories, 10,000 different odors so we have a broad range of sensitivities but sense
of smell is sometimes referred to as the mute sense because we don't have a vocabulary to express
these smells. When we refer to a smell we usually refer to it by referring to something else. We
say that smelled fruity, that smelled disgusting, that smelled medicinal, that smelled flowery.
We don't have a vocabulary to describe smells. We have 10 million smell receptors and these 10
million receptors are able to permit us to identify 10,000 different odors by having broad
ranges of sensitivity and by firing in patterns. So as a matter of fact this turns out to be
about the only way the sense of smell could work because most smells that we think of as being
clear and distinct are actually made up of a large number of separate volatile components.
Take the odor of coffee for example, so recognizable you would think that that's
kind of a unitary component but coffee, the odor of coffee is actually made up of
60 different volatile components. Now these 10 million taste smell receptors that I just alluded
to are located on a two and a half square centimeter patch of tissue high up in the
olfactory crypt way up in your nose on an area of skin called the olfactory epithelium.
The olfactory epithelium is out of the direct pathway of inspired air so when we breathe normally
our smell sensitivity is really not so good. If we want to maximize the opportunity to smell
something we must voluntarily produce a sharp distinct sniff because a sniff, a distinct sniff
sets up any currents and the molecules of the odorous substance are then caused to drift upward
and come into contact with the receptors on the olfactory epithelium. The stimuli for smell are
airborne and gaseous so they're traveling in the air and in order to get them in contact with the
appropriate receptors we have to take the initiative and sniff. Similarly if you are in the presence
of something that doesn't smell too good you can breathe through your mouth and you won't be setting
up those eddy currents and you're less likely to experience that unpleasant odor. Research
into the sense of smell has lagged. In fact there is less research on smell than there is on the
cutaneous sense. Now this is changing. Recently more interest has been shown by researchers
in the sense of smell for a couple of reasons. For example new data suggesting a connection
between smell and memory has caught the attention of researchers and some researchers are now
beginning to investigate in the laboratory some of the claims of a phenomenon called
aromatherapy. We'll get to that a little bit later but historically smell research has been
quite scarce and there are a number of reasons. I mean this is understandable. First of all
researchers like stimulus control. For instance a vision researcher if you want to turn the light
on you push a button and the light goes on. You want to turn the light off you push a button
then the light goes off. The same with hearing the same with the touch and the skin senses
but in the case of smell how do you turn a smell on especially when the subject has to give a sharp
distinct sniff and then when you're ready to try another stimulus how do you get the old odor to
dissipate and get it out of there. So there are in fact legitimate problems with stimulus control
that would give a researcher pause before specializing in smell. It's also the case that the
smell receptors are rather inaccessible. I mean they are not they're high up. You can't
reach them with your index finger as I've seen some people trying to do. The smell receptors are
actually way up in the olfactory crypt. This means that it's difficult to get electrodes
up there even in the nose of a rat or a rabbit or some animal that you might want to record
directly from the receptors. The receptors are rather inaccessible. The lack of an adequate
vocabulary is another reason. Scientists like to use precise terms to describe things that everybody
knows the exact meaning of. When you've got a sensory system where you have no primaries and no
names for the smells other than fruity and putrid and resinous and spicy and medicinal
that's not very appealing to somebody who is more comfortable with precise vocabulary terms.
Another reason that research on smell up until recently has lagged is the general belief that
in terms of the hierarchy of the senses smell is relatively unimportant.
Okay now the epitome of a good smeller the epitome of a creature that is known for its
olfactory sensitivity is the dog. The feats of bloodhounds are legendary. They can track somebody
by smelling the odor of an article of clothing this person wore. They can track somebody through
the woods hours or even days after that person has has made their escape or whatever has caused
them to run off into the woods. In the laboratory you can demonstrate the following. You can take
a good strong soap and you can wash your hands get all the greases and oils and anything that might
provide an olfactory cue. You wash your hands and dry your hands thoroughly then you pick up a stick
you hold it for about two seconds you put the stick down then you get in a lineup with other
people and the dog comes into the room smells the stick and walks over and points to you.
They are really quite good. I remember another story about the exquisitely sensitive olfactory
abilities of the dog. This took place back when Berlin was partitioned into East Berlin and West
Berlin. One of the problems was smuggling and the black market and one item that brought a high price
was real coffee. Apparently in those days it was very difficult to get real coffee and one of the
border dogs that was used to sniff for illegal contraband was named geisha and some people still
remember what geisha did one day that was so impressive as a feat of olfactory sensitivity.
Geisha was able to discover a bundle of contraband coffee wrapped in plastic covered with gasoline
soaked rags under a wagon load of coal. Geisha goes over there coffee and he was right or she was
right I guess geisha was a girl. At this point I guess I will keep a promise I made to you earlier
and tell you about my Halloween costume story that involved a dog I'll try and do this quickly.
It was in fact Halloween time and I decided to wear a Frankenstein costume so I went to a
friend's house and I put on a full head Frankenstein mask. I borrowed this guy's work boots his feet
were much bigger than mine so I could fit two balled up pairs of socks in the heels so I'm
standing several inches taller than I really am plus the work boots had heels to begin with so it
made me maybe four inches taller than I usually am. I put on an oversized jacket with shoulder pads
and I decided to go fool my wife so I come from the friend's house and I come back to my own house
and I think I'll ring the bell rather than just walk in so I ring the bell the dog hears the bell
and comes running to the front door barking I hear my wife's footsteps she opens the door the dog
immediately smells that it's me and wags its tail and sits down beside me my wife isn't quite sure
because I'm four inches taller than usual and I don't say anything and I see these expressions
change on her face is it him who is it is this some kind of a threatening situation she doesn't
know what to do finally I break the ice by saying and I tried to change my voice I said
lady I haven't eaten in three days and she recognizes my voice and she quickly comes back
force yourself this makes me start laughing that makes her start laughing and the dog is sitting
there looking back and forth see dogs have a great sense of smell but their sense of humor still
needs a little work anyway that's my dog's story and the fact that the matter is that if you compare
the sensitivity of an individual human smell receptor with the sensitivity of an individual dog
smell receptor they're of equal sensitivity why then does the dog have such greater olfactory
ability than we do well the reason is because the dog on its olfactory epithelium has one
billion that's a billion with a b one billion receptors whereas we have 10 million the dog has
a thousand times more smell receptors than we do and the dog's sense of smell is close to a thousand
times better than ours they are incredible by the way even though dogs smell have better olfactory
sensitivity than we do there are still some really impressive demonstrations of smell sensitivity
that humans have done now it turns out that most of these humans who have accomplished
incredible feats using their sense of smell are blind but i'm going to tell you right up front
that there is absolutely no basis for believing that when you go blind your sense of smell gets
better it's just that when you are blind you are forced of necessity to make more use of smell
information which is difficult it requires concentration and practice it's not as easy
as looking or listening but when you are forced to use your sense of smell it turns out to be able
to provide you with incredible information well let me give you some examples we've mentioned
hell and keller before and i may have mentioned that hell and keller was able to identify friends
and family when they entered the room on the basis of smell i may have told you that hell and keller
if she was driven through the countryside in an open carriage could identify trees and plants and
crops and and farm animals on the basis of smell hell and keller also reported that she was able
to identify the occupation of a stranger who was brought to to to see her she could tell what kind
of work people did by their smell because she said that we carry with us little bits and pieces of
odorous material from wherever we work so she claims she could even tell what you did for a living by
smelling you the other two instances of extraordinary human olfactory ability that
that i want to share with you have to do with two laundry workers these were both blind women
they didn't work in the same laundry they didn't know each other one worked in what was called
an insane asylum at the time the other worked in a long term care facility so they were both
dealing with the same clients day after day both of these women were able to sort the laundry of
individual uh residents in their facilities by smell after the laundry had been washed
they could actually smell and tell whose laundry was whose after it had been washed that's quite
remarkable now um if you and i had to and were willing to do the work and we were motivated to
do so we could actually learn to identify different people from different countries on the basis of
smell we could tell for example an eskimo from a japanese from an arab from a northern european on
the basis of smell that might take us a couple of weeks of practice practice practice learning
to pay attention to subtle cues that ordinarily uh we don't pay any attention to we in a much
shorter period of time we could learn to tell a vegetarian from somebody who was a meat eater
and the reason that we could do all these things is because the our diets the food
that we eat actually contributes to our particular body odor and it's subtle enough that you have
to look for it and you have to really be tuned in before you can smell this but people from what
we call primitive societies which is kind of a pejorative term they're actually from what we
might call non-industrialist societies they use their sense of smell more and they in fact
can discriminate where you're from by how you smell uh i spoke to some japanese people who were
candid enough to tell me that in general the japanese find americans to have an unpleasant
buttery odor that comes from the fact that we eat so much more beef with animal fat in it
than they do and we in fact have a characteristic smell to them we're not tuned in enough to olfactory
cues but we could get more tuned into olfactory cues it's also the case that research has suggested
we have smell capabilities right now that we don't even know we have and probably wouldn't
believe we had if somebody told us let me give you a couple of examples there have been experiments
done at universities where professors either hire or in some way coax students into participating
in experiments where the students will wear the same t-shirt for a week something like that under
their regular clothing so that nobody knows you're wearing the same thing every day at the end of the
week all of these students throw their t-shirts into a big pile and they're mixed up and then the
instructions are find your t-shirt and say how can i do that well just try and it turns out
that students on the basis of smell can in fact find their own t-shirt and then another
request of students who have worn these shirts and thrown them in a pile is
find t-shirts that were worn by males and find t-shirts that were worn by females and again they
think gee i can't do that but when they do it turns out that they are in fact able to on the
basis of smell identify t-shirts worn by a male from t-shirts worn by a female this type of experiment
has been done a number of times so it is a real phenomenon it's not just one fluke fluke thing
one thing i will tell you these experiments tend to suggest that women have a better sense of smell
than men this is a recurring finding that we're going to see throughout the age of human beings
that women are a little bit more olfactory than men um for example mothers of young children have
been tested uh the the mothers the clothing of the children is mixed up and mothers are told
even if the clothing is identical so you can't tell it on the basis of brand name or color or
what have you find your kid's clothing and so they can smell it and they mothers can find their
own children's clothing uh in a big pile of of other clothing men can't do that fathers can't do
that so here again we see an example of the female sense of smell being more acute than the male
now um there is also experimental evidence suggesting that odors can influence us and
influence our behavior without any conscious awareness on our part of exactly what is influencing
behavior one example of that is a phenomenon called the McClintock effect a psychologist by
the name of Martha McClintock made the following observation she demonstrated that women in college
who lived on the same dorm floor over the course of a semester exhibited synchronicity of their
menstrual periods at the beginning of the semester their periods were all at some different level of
the cycle but by the end of the semester all of their menstrual periods were were uh congruent
they had achieved uh uh synchrony so to speak now her suspicion was that this was based on some
chemical signal now chemical signals that people that animals give off are called pheromones most
people when they hear the word pheromone they think about oh sex pheromones the sex pheromones
are an example of one type of pheromone but territorial animals mark their territories with
pheromones also and Martha McClintock followed up on her initial finding of this uh synchronicity
and is credited in 1998 I believe with being the first person to demonstrate the existence of a human
pheromone so we have them too now um it's it's not a sex pheromone but it is a pheromone pheromones
are a odorous stimuli that can produce a physiological response in in some other
species member it doesn't always have to be a sexual response it can be obeying a territorial
boundary or it can be in this case somehow contributing to the synchronicity of some biological
process okay if we have all these smell abilities why don't we make more use of them well it turns
out that we are a non-smelling culture culture fact cultural factors are responsible for the fact
that we don't make more use of smell information as a matter of fact we are predisposed from birth
on to to use smell and to be uh more tuned into odors around us but our culture kind of breeds
that out of us in ways that I'll get to in a minute um there is data suggesting that
newborn babies are using smell to make decisions newborns can do this now how is such an experiment
possible well what happened was um in one uh experiment mothers of newborn babies had agreed
ahead of time that yes they were going to breastfeed and yes they would agree to have one of their
nipples washed so that it didn't have the odor of the mother on it and the experimenters used
the experimenters use the good experimental technique they would random on one mother they
would wash the right nipple and the other the left nipple so that it wasn't they were ruling
out the possibility that babies had a position preference of always turning right or left or
what have you and then what they would do is they would bring the newborn to the mother and they would
put the baby equidistant from either breast so the baby was not closer to one than the other and
what this experiment demonstrated was 75 percent of the babies went for the unwashed breast the
one that had the mother's smell uh uh still on it by the way um there is an analogous finding with
with baby rats baby rats of course by instinct crawl over and they begin nursing but if you wash
the mother rats nipples the babies don't attach so apparently it is smell that leads the baby rat
to the nipple and to nurse because if you wash the smell of the mother rat off the baby will starve
so it's it's not a an intelligent behavior it is apparently a what they call a species specific
behavior anyway my point is that at one hour or whatever of age a newborn baby is capable of
making a decision at some level based on smell one day old infants will show a facial expression
suggesting disgust at the odor of a rotten egg you you give a baby the smell of the mother and
it'll smile you give it the smell of a rotten egg and it it makes a face suggesting disgust
infants show disgust and distress at the smell of smoke and at the smell of acids now
acids are a caustic substance that can cause trouble and of course smoke means fire and babies
who have neither smelled acid nor smoke before show alarm and distress and are disturbed by the
smell of smoke and acid suggesting another one of mother nature's built-in defense mechanisms just
like we are programmed to approach sweet and avoid bitter because sweet is energy and bitter may
be poison so we are programmed to approach the smell of the mother and we are programmed to avoid
the smells of things like smoke and acid another interesting thing about infants and smell is
even though the myelin sheath is not fully developed until you're 12 years old
a child's smell sensitivity reaches its peak four years earlier than that children are excellent
at smelling by the time they're eight years old they're as good as they're ever going to get
why then are we not a more olfactory oriented culture because we come apparently equipped
to make decisions from birth on based on smell well for one thing we have made the decision
some time ago to mask odors that other cultures would find full of information so we use room
fresheners and we use underarm deodorants and so on plus we verbally chastise our children
for using their sense of smell what do i mean by that well um i've seen in restaurants a child
they take this child out for dinner and the the child has served a strange food that it's never
seen before i've seen a child pick up a piece of food and smell it and one of the parents will say
don't smell your food that's bad behavior just eat it it's not good manners to smell your food
i was in a doctor's office once and a woman had her young son on her lap and the the young boy
leaned over to the woman next to him and he said you smell funny the mother apologized profusely
and scolded the kid and told him how terrible that was and don't you ever say anything like that again
so we spray away odors and we punish our kids for for continuing to make use of
of smell information other cultures make use of information that we ignore or or or spray away
for example we talked about traditional chinese medicine as being a holistic health care system
that's over 5 000 years old there's another one that's twice as old as traditional chinese medicine
and that is the holistic health delivery system known as ayurvedic medicine from india now an
ayurvedic practitioner will in the course of examining a patient smell the patient smell the
patient's skin smell the patient's breath smell the patient's urine smell the patient's sweat
and it turns out that they use smell as an important adjunct to making a diagnosis
actually up until about 250 years ago western physicians used to use smell to help in making
diagnoses because there are certain medical conditions that are associated with a characteristic
odor let me give you a couple of examples phenyl ketone urea abbreviated pku this is an
inherited metabolic disorder in children that if not caught in time and corrected by a special
diet phenyl alanine free diet results in from mild to serious mental retardation well kids with
pku give off a characteristic odor that's been categorized as a horsey stale gymnasium odor
it's easy to distinguish diabetes these people have a special odor kidney problems digestive
problems all of these medical conditions are associated with a characteristic odor and could be
diagnosed or the diagnosis could be based in part at least on smells somewhere along the line
western medicine made the decision that using smell to diagnose diagnose medical conditions was
oh unscientific or perhaps not dignified enough or something like that so typically we don't do it
in spite of the fact that our culture does not seem to grasp the importance of smell per se we
we do use smells to enhance other activities for example the aroma of your meal is greatly enhanced
by the smell we use scented candles to enhance the mood of romantic interludes we use incense and
religious ceremonies use car dealers buy aerosol cans of new car spray to spray inside their used
cars and they can get a higher price for them realtors know that if a kitchen in a house that's
for sale has the odor of fresh fresh baked bread in it that people who look at that house are more
likely to buy it there are also neuro anatomical studies suggesting that smell is more important
than we typically give it credit for smell has the most direct connections between the receptors to
this ribocortex it doesn't have to first go through the thalamus like every other sensory system does
a smell stimulus will produce electrical activity in 20 different parts of the brain
and some of these parts of the brain are the parts of the brain that are known to be involved in
memory and emotional reactivity and in motivation i have a few more facts that i want to share with
you in the context of demonstrating the importance of smell even in animals that does see and hear
as well as we do it is the case that some animals with eyes and ears in a conflict situation will
go with the information provided by their sense of smell one example is seen on cattle ranches
picture this somewhat tragic event a mother cow gives birth the calf lives the mother cow dies
another mother cow gives birth she lives the calf dies so now we have a live mother and a
live calf but they are not related to each other can we take that calf over to the mother and she
will raise it as an orphan no she rejects it but what we can do is we can not we but the cattle
ranchers do is they will skin the dead calf and tie the skin of the dead calf around the live one
and now the mother cow will accept it and she will nurse it now the evidence of her eyes is saying
somebody tied my dead baby's skin around this strange baby calf i should really be in sense but
no she smells the skin and she permits the baby calf to nurse there's an example of the evidence
of smell overriding the evidence of one's eyes um another example occurs to me from a a a sailing
trip that i took that uh passed some islands off the coast of alaska one of these islands was
covered wall to wall with seals and seals were diving off the island into the water and and
crawling back onto the land and some of these seals were baby seals and i'm thinking to myself
how is that baby seal ever going to find its mother because all these seals looked alike to me
and i wondered do they call out and the mother answers or do they stand on a rock and look around
or what i had a biology professor with me so i asked the biology professor is this a problem the
baby's getting reunited with their mothers and he said no not at all they'll do it quite readily and
i said how on earth do they do that and he said the baby seals follow a scent trail and they go
right back to their mothers so we we find that smell is the preferred mode for uh uh
reuniting with a parent or recognizing an offspring over and above vision and hearing or
instead of vision and hearing um again suggesting that we need to take a a second look at our
preconceived notions about the importance of smell in our next lecture we will see more evidence and
examples of the importance of smell to humans this lecture deals with the consequences of
anosmia for those of you for whom that is a new term anosmia is the technical term for
either a loss or diminution of the sense of smell you can become totally anosmic or partially
anosmic one way to appreciate the importance of something is to see how your life changes when
you lose it so the lecture on the consequences of anosmia should make a believer of you if you're
not already convinced that smell is a very important sense thank you
