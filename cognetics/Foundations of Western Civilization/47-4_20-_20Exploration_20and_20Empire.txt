Well, Granada fell in 1492, and that brought the Reconquista to an end.
And there was also some growing concern in Spain about Portugal's successes along the
African coast.
It was thought, well, you know, these Portuguese may get above themselves if they're entirely
successful in these great ventures that they've been undertaking.
So Ferdinand and Isabella, but especially, more especially Isabella, financed a Genoese
sailor by the name of Cristoforo Colombo, we call him Christopher Columbus, born in
about 1451, died in 156.
Now, it's worth saying that we have all these wonderful stories about Isabella hocking
her jewels in order to support Columbus and so on.
In fact, leaving all that romantic stuff on one side, Columbus was supported rather stingily.
They weren't really willing to commit an enormous amount of money to him in the first
play.
Now, Columbus was a brilliant sailor.
There's no question about that.
He was also a very successful self-promoter.
I mean, he was an entrepreneur, but he had one chief product to sell himself, and he
did that pretty well.
He was also a keen, but we might say selective student of geography.
All right, that is to say, Columbus had the idea that he'd going to reach the east by
going west.
In other words, instead of going around Africa to get to the east, which the Portuguese had
done, he's going to get to the east by going straight west.
Now, it's an interesting question whether there ought to have been enough geographical
lore available in Columbus's time for somebody with experience of the sea as he had to know
perfectly well that there were impediments, let us say, for example, the North and South
American continents, likely between him and the east.
It's also an interesting question whether, particularly again in view of ancient geographical
lore, Columbus actually misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented the size of the globe.
In other words, thinking that the east was a lot closer than it was.
But maybe this was all part of Columbus's entrepreneurial abilities, his ability to sort
of put on one side and diminish a little bit the more serious aspects of what he had to
do and really sell his project.
Well, in any case, whatever we make of all of that, whatever we make of Columbus's capacity
to win support for his efforts, we must avoid temptation to romanticize his voyages.
One still occasionally hears really quite silly things, like that people then thought
the world was flat and so Columbus and his boys were ever so brave because they sailed
out there fearing any moment that might fall off the edge of the earth.
I mean, that's nonsense.
People knew perfectly well the world was round.
People had been sailing for a very long time.
Christopher Columbus was an extremely accomplished and gifted sailor.
So there is always a danger to go down to the sea in ships.
But we must not make romantic foolishness out of hard-headed, calculated voyages on Columbus's
part.
Well, in the end, the resources that he was able to generate on his own and from Ferdinand
and Isabella got him three small ships and about 90 men.
Columbus's first voyage was promising enough in 1492 that he made three more, in 1493,
in 1498, and in 1502.
Columbus in fact died wealthy.
He died famous, but he died far short of his own dreams, for he had not found the East.
The difference in the scale between his later voyages and his first one is quite striking.
One can really see here the way parties in Spain, the crown to be sure, but others as
well, were kind of taking a wait and see attitude with respect to Columbus and his efforts.
Remember the first time he goes with three ships and about 90 men?
On his second voyage to the New World, he had 17 ships and 1,700 men.
Obviously, people now figured this looks like it's worth backing.
Now, Columbus, part of the reason that he sort of died unfulfilled, that he died disappointed,
he always believed that he had discovered the islands lying just off the coast of Japan,
Chippangu.
Well, of course, he hadn't.
In 1501, Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian who was sailing along the coast of Brazil, came
to the very clear realization that Columbus had discovered a New World.
These were not islands lying just off the shore of Japan.
This was a New World.
In 1507, Martin Waldseemüller published a map.
Now, this was actually a very important and influential map for a period of years.
It remains today very famous in the history of cartography, but for present purposes,
I simply want to draw your attention to the fact that Waldseemüller labeled the two continents
that Columbus had discovered, America.
He named them, of course, for America Vespucci, who was the first to realize that here was
a New World.
