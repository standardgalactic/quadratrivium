But the point I'm really trying to make is not all of that trivia about calendars
But rather to say that this event the hijra was remembered as a decisive moment as a decisive moment in the history of
Muhammad himself and then of the faith which he taught that's important to say to he'd been invited to come to Medina by
Leading citizens of that city perhaps because they were rivals of Mecca
Perhaps because they thought that a great religious teacher like Muhammad might help them to compose some pretty severe problems
Some pretty severe rivalries inside their own city itself. There were indeed intense
Religious and social conflicts in Medina and it was hoped you see that Muhammad might be able to come and
Bring some measure of peace and order and stability to that troubled city
What then are these teachings what is it exactly that Muhammad was teaching well
We may say first of all that we know about his teachings
from three sources
From the Quran which are the scriptures of Islam will come to them in a bit from the hadith
The hadith are the sayings of the prophet things that Muhammad himself said he was thought to be a very holy man
He thought to be a very good man
And so his followers collected his sayings and these were collected in a body of material known as the hadith and these were also then
Not held on the same plane as the Quran among
Followers of Muhammad and Muhammad's teachings, but nevertheless thought to be very significant and we have collections of these hadiths
So for us as historians, they are another valuable source now
We may just briefly say that
Although all of the hadith are attributed to Muhammad himself. These are his sayings. These are his wise teachings
We know that the collections of hadith continued to evolve from the early 7th century well into the 9th and
Then the collections were more or less frozen. So it's a little difficult for us to say as
Historians concretely how much of this material actually goes right back to Muhammad himself
Certainly a good deal of it does but we can't say confidently it all does
Finally the Sunnah now the Sunnah is the good practice. That's what that means
And basically it was Muhammad's practice in other words how he lived his life his basic customs his basic habits his basic routines and so on
We're also noted by his contemporaries were taken down and also then regarded as important not as binding
But as important for members of the Islamic community. So looking back then as historians, we have Quran
Hadith and Sunnah
Among these in the Islamic world and then for those of us who would wish to understand that world
incomparably the most significant is
the Quran
now
the first important thing to remember about Quran is that it is a
body of
recitations
That is to say Muhammad was commanded by the angel to recite the word of God
The word of God was given him the word of Allah was given him by the angel and he gave it on to his followers
so
The point quite simply is that Muhammad is not the author of the Quran
Muhammad is not a person who sat down and wrote a book about his ideas about religion the
Quran is understood to be the very word of God himself now in that sense, of course
It bears comparison with the Hebrew scriptures the Old Testament as the Christians call it and with the Christian scriptures
The New Testament as Christians call it now with most of the books of the Hebrew scriptures
And again with the books of the New Testament the Christian scriptures although there are controversies here and there about exact
Identities of authors we can name the authors of the various books the great prophetic books Isaiah
Let us say or the gospel of John or of Matthew
Let us say but in the Quran you see what we have is simply God's word
Headed to us as it were straight Muhammad merely transmits it to us all right
So very important then not to regard the Quran as a book Muhammad wrote
But as the revelation of God which he handed on
All right now as I stressed a moment ago the hadith are collections of Muhammad's own sayings
Outside the Quran things that Muhammad said sometimes indeed about the Quran sometimes offering his views his interpretations
And sometimes just other comments that he had about social or religious or political or other
Conditions and then finally just to repeat once more the Sunnah the good practice the fundamental customs of Muhammad himself
And of course the Sunnah then becomes identifying the identifying mark of Sunni Muslims
To this day the largest number of Muslims in the world those who hold themselves to follow strictly the good practice of the prophet himself
