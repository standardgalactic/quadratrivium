This is interesting for instance in connection with the horses we were referring to a moment ago in most parts of Europe
Well, virtually everywhere in Europe horses eat oats, but in most parts of Europe people don't they do in Brittany
And they do in Scotland of course, but in most parts of the world or most parts of the European world in way people don't eat oats
Now if I've decided that I'm going to have a horse for my tractor. I have to grow that tractor's fuel someplace
Well, if I give over my estate or a substantial part of my estate to growing the fuel for my horse tractor
Well, then what's the fuel for me?
You see well if I'm dividing up my agricultural regime in such a way that I can set aside a certain amount of land to grow oats
To feed my horses
Then I have other land that I can use to grow crops that I will use to support myself
And and my family that I may be able to sell excess
If I if I can produce excess I can sell in local markets and and from the crops that I'm able to sell
I can make money with which to buy other kinds of things
So with a lot more land under the plow a much greater variety of crops
greater
insurance against individual seasons of bad weather
We also see accompanying all of that a
Growing tendency to agricultural specialization
People in particular regions
Understood perhaps very well how to grow certain crops
Let's say in areas of Europe where grape vines are tended
All right, viticulture is is a complex and sophisticated operation. Some people do this other places cereal grains are
Particularly cultivated well
This produces a situation where if a given region is going to concentrate on particular kinds of crops
then obviously those regions are going to rely on other regions and
rely on trade to get them the things that they do not themselves produce and
In turn they have to be able to move the things that they do produce to other places
This then starts to require improve roads it begins to require improve transport vehicles in order to move more goods
farther and faster
So again the use of horses as draft animals pulling wagons they can pull heavier loads. They can pull those loads farther
We begin to see the use of large four-wheeled wagons
Interesting manuscript pictures sometimes depict these for us the use of large four-wheeled wagons instead of two-wheeled carts
So that a great deal more can be moved sort of in one truck if you like
This then of course can provide for increasingly far-flung
Urban markets return talk about cities in just a few minutes with the point that I'm
Emphasizing at the moment is that cities are in some ways parasitical on the land around them that is say they don't grow their own food
As cities get larger and larger they're going to need more and more food that food is then going to have to come from farther and farther and farther away
So a great deal of this agricultural
Productivity out in the countryside that we've been talking about also permits the growth of cities the growth of urbanization
Now we notice also that both the church and also secular government worked to protect trade work to protect traders
Agricultural specialization was indeed one important impetus to trade, but there were others as we'll see in just a moment
growing prosperity more
Money at people's disposal a desire to have more and more products in
Increasingly through movements like the Crusades and so on
Becoming familiar with exotic products from other parts of the world that one wished to have either because they brought pleasure or because they brought a certain
Kind of prestige certain cache attached to having spices on one's table for example that sort of thing
So in any case the point is that that that in one way or another there is a kind of a mini
Transport revolution in the high Middle Ages you see which also
Folds into this whole set of processes that I've been alluding to and if you've been sort of
Thinking along with me here. You're noticing that all of these things are yet more of these
Qualitative indices of this rising population. You see is this all inferential? Yes
But it seems to me that the train of inferences is a pretty sound one
Now trade was facilitated to come back to the subject of trade by a number of things
There were fairs for example fairs in the Champagne region of France for example, which were perhaps the most famous one famous ones a
Series of fairs held over many months of the year not in the dead of winter
But over many of the other months of the year that moved around from town to town in the Champagne region
Merchants from the south of Europe came north merchants from the north of Europe came south
