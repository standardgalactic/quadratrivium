war took place. Now it almost certainly was a Mycenaean war against the Trojans, against
the people on the other side of the Aegean Sea. Alas, it was not a war launched by the
beauty of Helen whose face could send all these men off to fight and to die. It was
probably a grotty little trade war fought in the Aegean Basin. Probably it came at the
end of a long series of contentions in this part of the world and later on was remembered
in much grander, in much more heroic terms. All of this seems quite certain. So there's
lots of basic nuts and bolts of information, nuggets of information if you will, hiding
in the Iliad that are useful to us, along with the Linear B documents and the archeology
in reconstructing the Mycenaean world. But surely you'll say it's the ethical teachings
of the Iliad. It's the wrath of Achilles that we really want to think about. It is all
those remarkable people and the things that they did and said or failed to do. All of
that, all of that is almost certainly from the world of Homer himself and not from the
world of Mycenaean. And it's to that ethical world of Homer, of the Greek Dark Ages and
the Greek Archaic Period, it's to that that we'll turn in our next lecture.
