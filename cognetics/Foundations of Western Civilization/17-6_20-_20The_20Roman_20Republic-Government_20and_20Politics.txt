This was to the Romans their guiding light in all things. Did they ever change? Of course they did, but they never admitted to changing
This is how Roman speeches began. Here is what our ancestors did. What would our ancestors have done?
There was always this tendency, this sense, this powerful feeling the one must go back to the good old days
So the authority of eminent citizens and then more particularly the authority of eminent citizens from the past
Explained to the Romans how their system was supposed to work
Now perhaps the greatest critique and assessment of this system came from the Greek historian Polybius
He was born about 200 BC died in 118. He was captured by the Romans during their wars in the Balkans
We'll turn to those wars in our next lecture
It was very learned Greek and he set out to write a history of his time
Now he lived among influential Romans
He lived a very very elegant and graceful life, even though he was sort of a prisoner of war
He wrote a massive history of the Hellenistic world that world that we talked about a couple of lectures back and
Book six of this is a penetrating analysis of Rome's system
Polybius wanted to understand he was sort of a haughty Greek
He wanted to understand how a people so recently barbarian had come to conquer virtually the whole known world
He attributed their success to what he called their mixed
Constitution
He said the Romans had consuls who were very much like kings. There's a monarchical
dimension
The Roman Senate were like aristocrats. There was an oligarchical dimension
rule by a few and
The assemblies were like the day moths in a Greek city democracy the rule by the many
Now Polybius had a
Spectristically Greek view of the cyclical evolution of politics remember in antiquity people generally the Hebrews were different
And we'll see later on that the Christians were different
But among ancient peoples generally it was thought that life revolved in great cycles the wheel of fortune was not a television program in
Antiquity it was a philosophical way of talking about how everything works
There was a notion that there was a natural evolution of societies
Starting with monarchy the rule of a strong person
Eventually the monarch would have to share power with some number of people and we would move to oligarchy
oligarchs would then
Gradually have to share power with a larger number of people and we would have democracy ruled by the people a
Certain number of the people of the day moths would then begin to rule selfishly in their own interest
We would have mob rule
And mob rule would then be ended by the man on a horse by the strong man
By the monarch who comes in and brings order and in a sense brings us back round to the top or if you will the bottom of
The circle and the cycle begins again
What intrigued Polybius so much about the Romans was he believed somehow that they had escaped the cycle that their mixed
Constitution their balanced
Constitution had enabled them to break out of this vicious cycle of political change
Was Polybius right?
Yes and no
Now the Roman system was remarkably stable for a long time and
The mixed dimension of this Constitution was there for all to see and as I said it was admired very much by the founding fathers of the United States
There are a lot of things Polybius for example didn't tell us now
He lived among great people he ought to have known but he didn't tell us for example anything about the culture of deference
He didn't tell us anything about the senatorial aristocracy
He didn't tell us anything about the relatively small number of families who had monopolized
Political power over a very long period of time
So it's curious in a way you see that Polybius notes certain aspects very
Penetratingly of the Roman system and seems to ignore others, but finally at perhaps most ironic
Polybius lived at Rome at the very moment when the Romans were building a vast Empire
One of the things he didn't notice
Was the kinds of strains and tensions that the creation of this Empire produced for a small
face-to-face
deferential political system
That said the Roman system has been in terms of strict institutional structures and in terms of ideological ideas
Formative in the Western tradition in our next lecture will turn to the strains produced by the creation of the Roman Empire
