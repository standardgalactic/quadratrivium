Number seven was the codename that the British Diplomatic Service and Secret Service used to name
Alexander Hamilton because in fact he had been privately and secretly meeting with the British ambassador
unofficially behind Jefferson's back and
We have a statement a wonderful statement from Jefferson to
Washington of his deep resentment and frustration about having his hand tied by the secretary of the Treasury
In the case of the two nations with which we have the most intimate connections France and England my system was to give
some
Satisfactory distinctions to the former of little cost to us and return for the solid advantages yielded us by them and to have met
The English with some restrictions which might have induced them to imbate their severities against our commerce. I
Have always supposed this coincided with your sentiments yet the secretary of the Treasury
By his cabals with members of the legislature and by high tone
Declamations on other occasions has forced down his own system, which was exactly the reserve reverse
Well for his part
Hamilton believes that Jefferson is not engaged in diplomacy at all and
Indeed, there's some evidence of this his secret discussions with the British are in fact encouraged by Washington
Which suggests that Washington has in fact misgivings about the way Jefferson performs his secretary of state
and the reason is
Jefferson's diplomatic
Exchanges with the British are not in fact negotiations
They're diatribes that these long policy statements denouncing the British for their perfidy and Hamilton feels that Jefferson is betraying Washington in his administration
in fact, we have a
Record of a conversation Hamilton had with the British diplomat at the time George Hammond which Hammond sent back to his government. I
Have the honor of transmitting to your lordship a representation
Which I've received from Mr. Jefferson in answer to the statement that I delivered to the gentleman on the 5th of March last
The great quantity of irrelevant matter contained in this paper the positive denial of many facts
Which I had advanced upon the authority of the British agents and of other respectable persons in this country the unjust a viable
Insinuations thrown out with with respect to the mode of prosecuting the war and to the conduct of his majesty's ministers
Subsequent to the peace and the general acrimonious style and manner of this letter all contributed to excite in me
Considerable surprise I therefore waited upon mr. Hamilton and communicated to him very freely my opinion of this extraordinary performance
The gentleman treated me as he has done on every occasion with the strictest confidence and candor
After lamenting the intemperate violence of his colleague, mr. Hamilton assured me that this letter was very far from meeting his
Approbation or from containing a faithful exposition of the sentiments of the government
So both sides both Hamilton and Jefferson see the other as essentially
duplicitous and
the struggle between Jefferson and his Republican Party against Hamilton and his high federalists quickly becomes
Incredibly bitter and divisive and it emerges in the partisan press
Jefferson hires Philip for no as a translator in the State Department and sets him up as the head of a political newspaper
that will lambast Hamilton and the federalists charging them with corruption and
This I want to read a brief excerpt from the National Gazette for now for knows a
Newspaper from March 15 1792. He asks a series of questions one
Can those who are attached to monarchy and aristocracy be in their hearts friends to a Republican
Constitution and here he's clearly referring to Hamilton and presumably to Washington as well
Must not such naturally wish to make the Constitution by stretching its powers and aggrandizing a few the stocking horse to hereditary government
the charge that
Hamilton is trying to make Washington the king of America
Finally have not many public circumstances indicated such a disposition and design
What Washington was absolutely furious at furno
Jefferson records the following reaction he got from Washington
He stated he'd rather be on his farm than to be made emperor of the world and yet that they were charging him with wanting to be a king
That that rascal for no sent him three of his papers every day as if he thought he would become the distributor of his papers
That he could see in this nothing, but an impudent design to insult him
Well, there were two sides to this debate Hamilton for his part writes his TL American and Catalyst essays
which denounced Jefferson for a supporter for no and
Questions the support of the Constitution and the Washington administration that he was in fact a member of
He writes in the Gazette of the United States whose editor was mr. Fennel was opposed to Fennel
