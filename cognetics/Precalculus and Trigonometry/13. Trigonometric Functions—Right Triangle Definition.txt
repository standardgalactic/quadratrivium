Hello again and welcome to our lecture on the trigonometric functions.
Last lecture we looked at angles and we talked about how to measure an angle and I pointed
out there are really two important ways to measure angles, either using degrees or using
radians. And we also learned how to convert from one to the other. In applications problems
will often be in degrees or in radians and we have to know how to go back and forth.
Well today I'm pretty excited because we're going to define the six trigonometric functions.
And if you've never seen trigonometry before this will be an eye-opening experience I think.
The six functions will be defined using what we call a right triangle definition.
If you pick up a textbook on algebra and trigonometry or a trigonometry textbook or a
pre-calculus textbook about half of them will use this approach for beginning to define the
trigonometric functions and the other half of the books, other books will use a different technique
which we'll actually do next lecture. But right now I think the triangle definition
is a little bit simpler to understand. So let's do it. And to see how this works
we have to recall a very famous theorem, the Pythagorean theorem. Here I've drawn a right
triangle and I've labeled the two legs A and B and the hypotenuse is labeled C and the Pythagorean
theorem says that A squared plus B squared equals C squared or if you want C is the square root
of A squared plus B squared. In fact this is an if and only if theorem. If you see a triangle
that satisfies that equation then it's a right triangle. It kind of goes both ways. Some simple
examples. If the sides are three and four then the hypotenuse is five and it's a right triangle
three squared plus four squared nine plus sixteen is twenty-five. Another right triangle is has sides
five, twelve and hypotenuse thirteen and there's an infinite number of right triangles having integer
sides. Let me pause here and talk about a related equation related to the Pythagorean theorem,
a very very famous mathematical problem. The Pythagorean theorem says A squared plus B squared
equals C squared for right triangles and in fact there are integer solutions to that equation.
A equals three, B equals four, C equals five. Let's change it. Instead of being squared try
cubed. A cubed plus B cubed equals C cubed. Are there any solutions to that equation where A,
B and C are positive integers? Well mathematicians have tried for hundreds of years to find solutions
to that equation. It's even worse. They changed the exponent not to three but to four or five
or six or any integer and they never found a solution and this is called Fermat's Last
Theorem. Fermat declared, hypothesized, that you would never find such a solution. That the equation
A to the N plus B to the N equals C to the N where N is bigger than two has no solutions
and this problem was finally solved in 1995 by a mathematician named Andrew Viles at Princeton
University. The proof took hundreds of years of many many mathematicians working on it
and they finally showed there are no solutions to that equation. Okay enough culture back to
trigonometry back to the important topic. How do we define the trigonometric functions?
Well let's look at our right triangle again and the way you define it is you assume one of the
angles is labeled theta and then we have the adjacent side the side next to theta we have
the opposite side and then of course I've labeled the hypotenuse and here are the definitions of the
six trigonometric functions. Sin theta is defined to be the length of the opposite side divided by
the length of the hypotenuse opposite over hypotenuse cosine adjacent over hypotenuse tangent
opposite over adjacent those are the first three trig functions I like to say trig sometimes
instead of trigonometric it's a little shorter and then we have three more trigonometric functions
cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite secant is hypotenuse over adjacent cotangent is adjacent
over opposite okay six trigonometric functions those are the six notice some properties already
the cosecant this is the reciprocal of sin secant is the reciprocal of cosine and cotangent is the
reciprocal of tangent so if you know the first three trig functions you can get the other three
by just taking reciprocals let's do a quick example let's compute some trigonometric values
and how about the following triangle it's the 3 4 5 right triangle so the angle theta is in the
corner and the adjacent side has three units and the opposite side is four units and of course
the hypotenuse now is five because it's the square root of three squared plus four squared
it's our famous 3 4 5 right triangle so what's the sign of theta well it's opposite over hypotenuse
so it's four over five what's the cosine of theta adjacent side over hypotenuse so it's three over
five how about tangent well tangent is opposite over adjacent four over three let me point out
something here look at sine and cosine sine divided by cosine is also four over three isn't it in
fact tangent can be defined as being sine divided by cosine that's equivalent to our definition
and then the other three trig functions are pretty simple they're the reciprocals of what we just
calculated so cosecant is the reciprocal of four fifths so it's five fourths secant is the
reciprocal of three fifths so it's five thirds and cotangent is three fourths well congratulations
you just calculated trigonometric functions you just calculated trigonometric values way to go
if you've never done it before it's um it's kind of feels good I think
we've noticed those reciprocal relationships knowing a few of the trigonometric functions
you can get the other ones using those first few and I've also pointed out one of the key
facts that tangent is sine over cosine well let me point out something else that's really
fundamental very very important go back and look at sine theta it was four fifths and cosine theta
was three fifths well what's four fifths squared plus three fifths squared that'll be 16 plus nine
in the numerator 25 in the common denominator it's equal to one what do we have here we have sine
squared plus cosine squared equals one that is the most fundamental identity in all of trigonometry
if there's one fact about the trigonometric functions you want to take away after this lecture
it's the fact that sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals one now there's a
notational issue that comes up here if you look at a textbook on trigonometry you won't see sine
theta squared with the parentheses around the whole thing and then squared what you'll see is
you'll see sine squared theta and the same with cosine etc powers of the trig function they put the
power right next to the word and before the angle that's just that's just the way it is don't blame
me that's just the way it is clearly both methods are correct you can write either one you want but
most most scientists will write it that second way sine squared theta not sine theta squared okay
that's just a little notational device what's the history of trigonometry well it has a you know
long long history but it seems that Hipparchus in the second century BC a Greek mathematician
was the first one to sort of develop trigonometric ideas and he constructed tables
similar to the trigonometric tables you'll see in backs of of some textbooks and he used these
tables to track the planetary motion the movement of the planets in the sky and speaking of these
tables of trigonometric values if you have an old textbook on algebra and trigonometry
look in the back of it and you'll see tables of trigonometric values in fact you'll also see
tables of logarithms because in the old days there were no calculators so if you had to calculate
the logarithm or the trig function of some obscure angle you had to use these tables when I was a
student we didn't have calculators and we became very proficient in using these tables to estimate
values of trigonometric functions and logarithms that world has ended textbooks are skinnier now
because they've removed those tables all right let's do an example let's try another important
triangle that occurs a lot let's find the sine cosine and tangent of a 45 degree angle remember
45 degrees is the same as pi over four radians and we can work in either units so how could we find
the sine cosine and tangent of 45 degrees well let's draw a triangle it'll be a right triangle
and if the angle we're interested in is 45 degrees then the other acute angle is 45 degrees
because the sum is 180 degrees and if we make each side each leg length one then we know the
hypotenuse would be the square root of two one square plus one squared all square rooted so
this triangle looks like the picture the two legs are one and one and the hypotenuse is the square
root of two so let's do the computations the sine of 45 degrees is the opposite over hypotenuse
one over square root of two cosine is the same isn't it adjacent over hypotenuse one over square
root of two and how about tangent oh that's just opposite over adjacent or one or you could say
sine of 45 divided by cosine of 45 and that's the same it's one let me point something out here you
might have noticed as we've been going along the sine of any angle or the cosine of any angle
is less than one in absolute value isn't it and why is that true because it's a quotient of a leg
divided by the hypotenuse and the hypotenuse is longer than the leg so that fraction is less
than one isn't it that will always be true okay good going um how could you verify that answer
you just calculated we just calculated that sine of 45 degrees was square root of two over two
and suppose you're taking a test or something and you want to see hey did I get that right
well one way to do it would be to use your calculator as I said the trigonometric functions
the the keys are built into all scientific calculators and if you punch in sine of 45 degrees
you'll get the following decimal number approximately 0.707106781187 and it might go out even longer
depending on how many digits you want to show is that is that the right answer did we get the right
answer well calculate square root of two over two on your calculator surprise you get the same decimal
wow now this brings up a kind of a funny thing that happens in in classes sometimes a student
will be asked what's the sine of 45 degrees and the student will use a calculator and get that
decimal expansion but that's only an approximation and remember I'm one of these mean teachers that
requires the exact answer but my students are so clever now they recognize that number as being the
square root of two over two it occurs so much so they get that decimal and they go oh yeah that's a
square root of two over two I bet and then they write down the correct answer good okay so that
was kind of a nice way to verify well let me show you a you be the teacher problem now that I've
probably seen a hundred times in my whoa I've been in the teaching business almost 40 years
when you count a graduate student Peace Corps and the University of Florida so I've been out there a
long time and I see this problem or this question this issue all the time here it is you're teaching
the class and you've just calculated the sine of 45 degrees and everybody's happy in the classroom
and then suddenly after class a student runs up to you and goes professor I didn't get sine of 45
degrees to be what you said it was my calculator said that sine of 45 is 0.8509035 professor
you must have been wrong because the calculator never lies what should I tell that student
nicely of course well the calculator was in the wrong mode it was in radian mode and we were
calculating sine of 45 degrees and hence we had to be in degree mode so be very careful on this
this is a common pitfall being in the wrong mode radian or degree and as I said earlier if you go
on to take a calculus course you'll set your calculator in radian mode all right let's do another
example another very important triangle here and some very important trigonometric value these are
worth memorizing we're going to calculate the sine and cosine and hence all the others as well
but I'll just focus on the sine and cosine now of a 30 degree angle and a 60 degree angle let's see
how to do that and here's a nice way of doing it take a equilateral triangle of side length two
and so the sides are two two and two and each angle measures 60 degrees and now drop
the altitude from the top vertex down to the base and that forms a 30 60 90 right triangle
doesn't it the base angle is 60 degrees and the angle up up at the top is 30 degrees now if the
hypotenuse is two we started with the side being two then that lower side is length one and what
about the height the altitude how long is the altitude well the Pythagorean theorem says that
it has to be the square root of three because the square root of three squared plus one gives four
which is two squared so in this 30 60 90 right triangle I know the sides two is the hypotenuse
one is the short leg and the square root of three is the longer leg all right so given this situation
we can now calculate the sine and cosine of 30 degrees and 60 degrees it's very easy what's the
sine of 30 degrees well look at the picture 30 degrees is up at the top and it's going to be
opposite over hypotenuse so it's one over two or a half how about cosine of 60 degrees well let's
look at the picture again there's 60 degrees down at the bottom what's cosine it's adjacent over
hypotenuse whoa it's also equal to a half isn't it isn't that curious the sine of 30 is the cosine
of 60 what's the cosine of 30 well let's find that let's find out 30s up at the top cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse so it's square root of three over two what's the sine of 60 same thing opposite
over hypotenuse square root of three over two curious isn't it cosine 30 is equal to sine of 60
do you see a pattern here you see a pattern what relationship do 30 and 60 have with each
with each other what's their relationship yes there are complementary angles aren't they and
here's another fact about trigonometry co-functions co-function like sine and cosine tangent and
cotangent secant and cosecant co-functions of complementary angles are always equal
for instance you can check this on your calculator calculate the tangent of 50 degrees
and the cotangent of 40 degrees they'll be the same because 50 and 40 are complementary
the secant of pi over three will be equal to the cosecant of pi over six because pi over three
and pi over six add up to pi over two or 90 degrees if you convert back to degree mode
so that's kind of a nice little fact about trigonometry
study tip here something to that i encourage my students to do please memorize the values of the
sine and cosine function for 30 and 60 degrees in other words pi over six and pi over three
they're really important let me reiterate those formulas using radiant measure the sine of pi over
six pi over six is 30 degrees the sine of pi over six is a half and the sine of pi over three is
square root of three over two and conversely the cosine of pi over six is the square root of three
over two and the cosine of pi over three is a half those values come up all the time
all right we've computed some values we're just getting started with trigonometry
um let me talk a little bit now about that identity i said that was so important sine
squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals one that's the fundamental identity from that
identity you can massage it a bit and get a couple more identities that occur quite a bit in
calculus classes and of course in precalculus here's what you do start with the original
identity and divide both sides by cosine squared okay so on the left you'll have sine squared theta
divided by cosine squared theta plus cosine squared theta divided by cosine squared theta
and on the other side you have one over cosine squared theta all right simplify what's sine
over cosine tangent so the first term is tangent squared theta how about cosine squared over cosine
squared duh that's one and how about one over cosine squared ah that's secant squared remember
one over cosine equals secant so here's a new identity tangent squared plus one is secant squared
and you can do a similar trick divide both sides by sine squared and you get a third identity
one plus cotangent squared equals cosecant squared so the moral the story is that first
identity gives rise to two more identities that are also you know quite uh use quite a bit in
calculus and precalculus let's do another example uh this is kind of a fun example i think um
because we'll be able to check it with a calculator a bit let's find the sine of the acute angle theta
if it satisfies the following property its cosine is known its cosine is point eight
so we're trying to find theta the sine of theta knowing its cosine so knowing the cosine can
you find the sine that's what we're asking well we can use that fundamental identity can't we
sine squared plus cosine squared is one so cosine is point eight so sine squared plus
point eight squared is one and now solve for sine theta you obtain sine squared theta one minus
point eight squared that turns out to be point three six and then takes square roots and we get point
six so the sine of theta is point six when the cosine is point eight and then we could
calculate the tangent and the cotangent if we so want it but a lot of times students will say
wait a minute um we have this answer that knowing the cosine is point eight we're able to get the
sine but what is the angle i don't care what the sine is i mean that was the problem to find the
sine but what if i really want to know what the angle was what angle theta satisfies the property
that its cosine is point eight well we don't know how to do that yet but i'll show you anyway if you
have a calculator there's a key called the inverse cosine it's right above the cosine key and if you
use that button you'll discover that the value of theta such that the cosine of theta is point
eight comes out to be about point six four three five radians and if you do it in degree mode you'll
come out to about thirty six point eight seven degrees now that skill will come later when we do
inverse trigonometric functions so don't panic yet this is getting ahead of ourselves but again
people are sometimes curious can i actually figure out the angle knowing its cosine and you can
all right um let me talk a little bit now about simplifying trigonometric expressions later on
as we go through the trigonometric lectures we'll come across equations or expressions involving
trigonometric functions and you'll often want to try to simplify them make them look a little
bit neater let me show you a one that really simplifies a lot suppose you're you're doing
some work and you come across the expression secant theta plus tangent theta all times the other term
secant theta minus tangent theta can you simplify that well some magic happens here it's kind of fun
we can play with those identities and get some nice simplifications multiply it out secant plus
tangent times secant minus tangent turns out to be secant squared minus tangent squared good
so far we got it a little bit better but now remember that tangent squared plus one is secant
squared that was one of those identities so i can replace the secant squared with tangent
squared plus one and the tangent squares then cancel and i finally get down to one that big
expression i started out with collapses to one amazing isn't it really simplified i find
there's no doubt in my mind that one is simpler than the original expression
okay let's talk about calculators a moment early on when they came out the University of Florida
actually had a course on trying to teach students to use calculators because we were using them in
some of our math classes and science classes and then of course we immediately discovered that the
students know much more than we do as professors on how to use calculators in my experience as a
teacher i've really never had students come up to me and go professor i just bought a calculator
can you help me use it now they might make some subtle mistakes like that degree and radian mode
issue i've talked about but generally speaking students are really good with calculators but
let me point out some things in trigonometry that'll be useful to you first of all how would you
calculate say the secant function you look at your calculator there's no key for the secant
it's not there in fact there's only really a sign a cosine and a tangent ah but cosine is the
reciprocal of secant so to calculate secant all you have to do is one over cosine okay so
and that's the same thing with cotangent that will be one over tangent and the same with
cosecant good i also invite you if you have a graphing calculator to practice calculating some
values we did a sign of 60 degrees a few minutes ago do that also on your calculator see if you
get the same answer i think it builds up a lot of confidence when you see your calculator getting
the same answer that you're getting using pencil and paper some calculators give decimal approximations
of the answer and others actually give the precise answer i have a fancy calculator that
when i punch in sign of 60 degrees it spits out square root of three over two the exact answer
pretty impressive okay let's do an application this is one of sort of the standard applications of
trigonometry these are some of the first applications that were ever developed i think
uh suppose you're a surveyor and you're you want to measure the height of that tree over there
there's a big tree over there and you're say 50 feet away from the base of the tree and you have
an apparatus that's called a sextant that can measure the angle that the ground makes with
the top of the tree and suppose it that angle is 71.5 degrees how tall is the tree don't make me
climb up the tree and measure it i can figure it out with trigonometry all right let's do it well
in that picture what trigonometric function should we use well how about tangent because
tangent of 71.5 degrees is opposite over adjacent y over 50 isn't it and y is what i'm interested in
so with that equation multiply through by 50 and you get y equals 50 times the tangent of 71.5
degrees i punch that in my calculator in degree mode and i get approximately 149.43 feet that's
the height of our tree good let's finish off with some true false questions these are kind of fun
as i i think i've said earlier i love this kind of question on an exam very easy to grade so true
or false is sine of 60 degrees times cosine of 60 degrees equal to one what do you think
sine of some angle 60 degrees say times cosecant 60 degrees i hope i said cosecant sine 60 times
cosecant 60 is that equal to one well yeah it is because cosecant is one over sine and they cancel
so that's a true statement here's a trickier problem is sine of 45 degrees plus cosine of 45
degrees equal to one that kind of looks like the fundamental identity doesn't it but it's
it's not squared in fact that's a false statement sine of 45 is square root of two over two the
cosine is also square root of two over two that does not add up to one and finally why if we said
earlier that the sine of an acute angle is always less than one or the cosine of an acute angle is
always less than one you remember why that's true it's pretty important it'll come up again in the
in future lectures it's less than one because it's adjacent over hypotenuse or opposite over
hypotenuse and the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the longest side all right good going we've
finished our first real lecture on trigonometry and we've defined the six functions using this
right triangle definition next time we'll define the functions a little bit differently and we'll
discover that we can define the six trigonometric functions for any angle positive or negative
and in fact these trigonometric functions will then be thought of as functions of a real variable
just like we had the exponential function or the logarithmic function
we now will have the trigonometric functions so see you next time thank you
