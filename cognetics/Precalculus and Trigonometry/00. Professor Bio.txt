Dr. Edwards has co-authored a wide range of mathematics textbooks including Leading Texts
in the Areas of Calculus, Applied Calculus, Linear Algebra, Finite Mathematics, Algebra,
Trigonometry, and Pre-Calculus. Dr. Edwards is also the author of the Great Course Understanding
Calculus, Problems, Solutions, and Tips. Dr. Edwards was named the University of Florida's

him the Distinguished Service Award in 1995 for his work in mathematics education for the
state of Florida. His textbooks have been honored with awards from the Text and Academic
Authors Association. In addition, Professor Edwards has been a frequent speaker at research
conferences and meetings of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The course workbook
that comes with these lectures includes summaries of each lesson, lists of formulas, theorems,
and other useful reference tools, a glossary, a bibliography, and supplementary problems with
detailed solutions to accompany each lesson. To get the most out of this course, you may
