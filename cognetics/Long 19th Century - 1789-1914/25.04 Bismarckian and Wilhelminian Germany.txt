Bismarck had no real choice but to resign in March of 1890, bringing a very distinctive
era in German history to a close.
Bismarck was the victim of the very system he had created and defended with all of his
focus, all of his brilliance and all of his might, and in a final crisis all the Kaiser
had to say is sorry we're not going to do these things anymore this way, I believe I
know what I'm doing, I wish you adieu, and Bismarck had to resign.
aptly inciting her chapter on Wilhelmenian Germany quote-unquote, Neroism is in the air,
Barbara Tuchman captures the essence of the tragic 25 years in German history leading
up to World War I.
As the industrialist and philosopher Walter Ratinal commented, these years represented
dilettante foreign policy, romantic conservative internal policy, and bombastic and empty cultural
policy.
And indeed I would urge you to get a hold of Barbara Tuchman's little paperback or not
so little paperback but paperback nonetheless called the Proud Tower in which she shares
a series of short 60 page vignettes on many of the major powers and issues before World
War I, it's a joy to read.
Indeed the contrast between Germany's efficient bureaucracy, industrial, scientific and technological
precociousness and that's the appropriate word, and its overall educational achievements
and the continued immaturity and aristocratic exclusivism of its political culture at the
top including the emperor, the upper reaches of government and especially the military
could not have been more striking.
Notably, except for calling off the anti-socialist campaign in the Reichstag in 1890, one is actually
hard pressed to identify a single piece of truly dramatic domestic legislation either
because occasional attempts by chancellors were blocked by Kaiser Wilhelm II or because
even more right wing conservative aristocrats and their allies blocked occasional progressive
legislation to which the Kaiser might have given his consent.
Incredibly, the second greatest industrial economic power in the world had accumulated
a large deficit on the eve of World War I because it's elites supporting a massive arms
buildup including both the army and a very, very powerful navy, the second greatest navy
in the world by 1914, but these elites were unwilling to pay the inheritance, land and
income taxes necessary to cover a greater portion of the expenses.
By that time, it was also increasingly difficult to control the Reichstag where the socialists
already had one-third of the votes and over a hundred seats in parliament, while a number
of extra parliamentary pressure groups such as the Agrarian League, the Colonial League,
the Pan-German League and the Navy League also made their feelings evident as powerfully
as they could. Now, many of these groups existed during the final phase of the Bismarckian
era. What Bismarck tried to do as best as he could was to struggle against them as much
as he could, not always totally successfully, but far more successfully than the Kaiser would
do because the Kaiser frequently agreed with many of their programs.
Meanwhile, the Kaiser who had a great special knack for political and diplomatic gaffes
and affairs that are certainly more well remembered today than the names of the first two of his
four pre-war chancellors who were part of his government until 1900, the Kaiser took
a lead in exacerbating the Nationalists and Darwinian and bombastic tendencies already
unfortunately so powerful in many of the aforementioned leagues and in other domestic
pressure groups often scandalizing responsible but nearly powerless parliamentary opinion
while causing extreme consternation among the powers surrounding Germany and those especially
not allied with her who finally came together to protect themselves from her.
