In the face of the obvious cruelty of working-class life, which was the source of England's power as well, the Industrial Revolution,
but was also cruel and devastating, especially for women and children who were easier to repress,
revealed in commission reports and public debate in Parliament, and we have all these commission reports and these debates, which are magnificent,
the largely wig or liberal upper middle-class industrialists yielded somewhat as their self-interest and laissez-faire faith against government intervention,
accepting the beginning of regulations aimed at ameliorating the worst industrial abuses.
Now this was a very clear infraction of laissez-faire, Adam Smith, government non-intervention, no regulation.
What do you do when commission reports find that children of 6 and 10 and women, including pregnant women, are working 10 to 16 hours a day,
often in incredibly unsanitary conditions under harsh taskmasters?
The government has to intervene and the wigs accepted that in a series of factory acts.
They don't all become very effective right away, the implementation is tougher than passing the acts,
but during the course of the 19th century, increasingly, they take on a momentum of their own.
In other words, the upper middle-class industrial elite had compromised on one of their major areas of concern.
Shortly thereafter, in 1846, following the beginning of the potato famine in 1845 in Ireland and some other parts of Europe,
the largely Tory conservative aristocrats accepted the abolition of agrarian tariffs known as the corn laws,
as free trade lowered the price of essential foodstuffs, notably grains, for the working class and the poor.
This is an area in which the tariffs protected the interests of the larger landed aristocratic conservative elite,
but they were forced to give way, not only were they forced to give way,
the aristocratic Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, broke with his party over the issue,
maintaining that the needs of the nation took precedence over those of party or class,
temporarily and immediately losing his job thereafter when he did this.
Meanwhile, in 1833, slavery was abolished in the British Empire, although certainly not repression there,
while the slave trade itself had been abolished in 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars.
Having suffered with others the severe agrarian urban crisis of 1846-1847,
which also brought on the peak years of runaway starvation in Ireland,
and the view of many Brits, many Protestant Brits, was if they had not been so lazy and disillute,
they could have worked for food too just like we do,
and one wants to stop for another moment to talk about that famine,
because the lowest estimate is that about a half a million people starved to death,
other estimates place it at a million or more,
and then another million Irish went across the ocean to the United States,
more than a quarter of the people in Ireland either died or migrated because of government non-intervention,
not that there was a radical amount of extra food in Britain at that time
because they had also difficult conditions, but the government could have intervened and done much more.
Quakers went to Ireland and attempted to give out food, finally leaving Ireland to try to force the government to intervene,
which it didn't do, and I think part of the issue there was the religion of free trade,
and part of the issue there was cultural racism.
Following this horrendous experience, however, the British celebrated their unique fortune in having sat out 1848
and their industrial preeminence during the Great Hyde Park exhibition of 1851,
and this was quite an experience because the British were aware of all the devastation that had occurred in Europe
in 1848, 1849 and 1850, and of course this led to their smugness
because the rest of Europe is going wild with disruption,
and England, which also had both harvest failure and severe urban recession, escaped most of that,
and then on top of that they hold for over 140 days the first universal exposition
that was realized by the huge crystal palace built to hold most of the events,
making it so incredibly clear how much further ahead the British were from the rest of Europe,
except for those large crop metallic materials that showed up in that expo as well,
showing that German industry was also beginning to really come online.
