The French would have been upset no matter what happened they lost their primary status in Europe
But taking Alsace-Lorraine
rubbed salt in
to the wound
Some historians have said it was worse than something unethical. It was a tragic blunder and
Indeed it made another war or some attempted French revenge
Likely although not necessarily in the very near future
It just was there permanently and and no Frenchman no Frenchmen of consequence could admit the final loss
They just couldn't bear it
Speak of it never but think of it always they would say
In reality and even somewhat in structure
The unification of Germany quote-unquote
Was far more the prussianization of Germany
than the immersion of Prussia in
Germany
The modified Prussian constitution became the constitution of the German Empire
while Prussia with 17 out of the 43 seats in the upper chamber and
And two-thirds majority required to pass legislation there could always effectively veto
objectionable bills now not all of the smaller German states had had
Constitutions or parliaments so for some this was
Progressive but in general it didn't guarantee shared governance between Prussia and the rest nor between the various
forces within Prussia
Although the Catholic federal states in the south maintain their own armies
They all came under the control of the Kaiser Emperor in time of war
While only he had the power to declare war
Moreover
since all military forces
were outside of parliamentary jurisdiction
Except for the need to have parliament pass the military budget every five or every seven years
depending upon the particular procedure in play in a decade and
Since the aristocracy
continued to dominate the military
The military remained a separate
caste a
state with an estate
It's sometimes quipped that most states have armies
While the Prussian army had a state
The parliamentarians had virtually no control over the army or the Navy
once they passed military budgets and
Bismarck was a genius at fomenting an international crisis every time it came
Term to pass a military budget so you could either vote for the budget and be duped or
Oppose it and be considered a traitor. He knew how to play the game
Although Bismarck had employed limited constitutional forms
He had succeeded in
emasculating much of the reality of German liberalism and
Bismarck had absolutely no
intention of
permitting
meaningful shared
governance
Shared governments the parliament the constitution these were tools to be used against the liberals and the Democrats and
Worse than against socialists these were not mechanisms that he felt had any legitimacy
What so ever in and of themselves and if need be he would have abolished the whole structure to maintain power
But he would prefer not to have to do that because it's easier to maintain power by duping your opponents and playing with them
Then it is by repressing them militarily
In other words in that sense. He was the worst of all things a
brilliant
autocrat
Who knew how to use the tools of the game and the vocabulary while doing something else altogether?
It doesn't mean he didn't try to improve the conditions of the German people we'll see in future commentaries
He tried hard to do those things. He believed in government
Responsibility from the top down and not from the middle up let alone from the bottom up
Even civilian ministers were not responsible to the parliament to the Reichstag
Needing only the support of the Kaiser to govern
So the parliament had no control over the Kaiser
No control over the army and actually very very little control over the civilian ministers
