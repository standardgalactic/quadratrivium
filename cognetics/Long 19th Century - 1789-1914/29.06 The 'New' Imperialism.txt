While the imperialism often brought modern medicine and it certainly brought railroads and it brought schools
it brought Christianity and
these things were sometimes dispensed by
dedicated
colonial ministers and
selfless missionaries
several well-known African Proverbs seem to speak more to the point
This one actually has more to do with Asia and earlier colonial
Expansionism when the Europeans arrived they had the Bible and we have the land
Now we have the Bible and they have the land
or
One of the Proverbs taught by Kofi Apoku a Ghanan professor at Lafayette College the Europeans who brought the pencil
also brought the eraser
Surely this last imperial phase
Continued after world were won by means of mandates in the Middle East formally under Turkey
radically accelerated the creation of a global community
But they did not answer the question as to what type of global community it would be and
That's one of the reasons our world is so destabilized and without easy answers to
radically
complicated problems many of which go back of
120 years minimally
In short, I would need to amend the following statement that MS Anderson offers in his concluding comments
concerning imperialism in an otherwise really powerful and judicious study called the ascendancy of Europe between
1815 and 1914 and in fact
I would have used it a supplementary reading except it's so difficult to cut up and excerpt
So it's in the bibliography. It's been reissued after 20 years and it's a wonderful wonderful book and therefore
I was shocked when I got to this particular
Portion having used the book recently in a course in which he says it's almost equally difficult
However, for a European not to feel pride in the sheer energy and
confidence which underlay the increasing
Europeanization of the world during this period or in the faith and idealism which in part
inspired it and
Of course Anderson does talk about the mistakes that were made as well
If a measure of pride is perhaps
Understandable it needs to be balanced with an equal measure of shame and sadness
That the process of European expansion was also so callous
so unreflective in many cases and so
destructive
Perhaps it could not have been otherwise given the imbalance of power between these civilizations
But Western modernist triumphalism is surely not called for here
It might also be added that some recent historical
historians of imperialism have begun to see the roots of the Holocaust
Partly in the callous disregard for the humanity of the other whatever that other would be so blatantly
manifested in this phase of European social Darwinian
expression
While others link it to the barbarism of World War one itself
Indeed, these are not mutually exclusive developments and they surely merit further reflection and analysis
Looking back on the long span of European colonial expansion and then European imperial expansion
One has to wonder what would have happened if the Chinese in the 14th and 15th century
Who could put a fleet of a hundred and more ships into the water at any time?
Had run across the pinta and the Nina and the Santa Maria heading for what they thought was India
But turned out to be the New World
Ironically one of the reasons the Chinese did not take that route is
Because they were not in a competitive state system
They were the celestial Empire the center of the universe
No one had anything else to teach them and they had virtually everything that they needed
So in a sense it was their arrogance that led them not to be imperialist at that particular
Moment in time because they also got as far as the tip of Africa
What would human history have been like if they had taken a different course?
Thank you
