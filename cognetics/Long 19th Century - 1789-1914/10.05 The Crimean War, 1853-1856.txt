Both Prussia and Austria, almost not invited to Paris, were not only concerned about their great power status, but at odds with each other, even more so.
In the case of Prussia, what this led to was the Prussian recognition that its great power status was in question, requiring it to do something about its internal structure.
And this led to the recognition that the Prussian army had better be reorganized and updated.
And it was in fact the attempt to organize and update this Prussian army that brought the monarch into conflict with his own parliament that came into being directly as a result of 1848 through the Constitution, which gave the Diet the parliament some control over expenditures.
In fact, the issue was so important that several elections were held, and the liberals continued to get more power, and the king was almost going to resign, and at that point, the minister of war convinces the Kaiser to bring Bismarck into office as chancellor because only he could save the issue,
but before that, he was so dangerous, so conservative, so reactionary, they thought, that you would never want to bring him into power, that's throwing down the gauntlet to liberals, unless you absolutely needed him.
The Prussians were really concerned about their great power status, they were not particularly pleased, that's an understatement, that the Austrians tried to pressure them into a war with Russia that would have done them no good, and they would have faced Russian armies potentially also,
because the Russian armies could have gotten to Austria and Prussia much more easily than they could have gotten to the British and the French deep in the Crimea.
Austria faces the same situation worse because Austria has upset Britain and France, Austria has really upset Russia, Austria has upset Prussia, Austria economically has not kept pace with Britain or France or Prussia,
Austria does not have the wherewithal to totally modernize its military because it has not kept pace economically and not even fully technologically, so they have to do something, however, to reestablish their great power legitimacy.
Where will they go for that? Well, they'll go back to that same Germanic confederation to try to reestablish their own power there, and they will be continuously blocked there by Prussia, and it's during this time period in the 1850s that Bismarck, who was going to be the man of the hour, the next hour in the 1860s,
during the 1850s, Bismarck, initially so respectful of the Austrians because of their conservatism, came to believe that Germany just wasn't big enough for both Prussia and Austria, and since he was Prussian, it would be Prussia that would predominate,
and that itself was of considerable importance, so the Austrians will go back, try to tie up their power base internally in their own empire, try to expand their base of power in the Germanic confederation, and be blocked there further by Prussia.
Our friend Napoleon III, having gotten much of what he wanted by a process of gamesmanship, was encouraged to play again. He obviously got legitimacy, holding a major peace conference among all the great powers, the concert of Europe, meeting in your presence when you have been denied even acceptance by your brother,
and other emperors and monarchs is quite a feat, especially since your army did pretty well at a cost that was acceptable. Napoleon III, getting away with it, had his appetite wedded, even a military action of some consequence in terms of the loss of life,
and Napoleon III, unlike his uncle, was not bloodthirsty, totally different kind of individual, didn't go to war just for the sake of going to war, he had a choice between war and peace, all things being equal, he would have preferred peace in most cases, which is interesting because he goes to war so many times because all things weren't equal and he could make gains.
