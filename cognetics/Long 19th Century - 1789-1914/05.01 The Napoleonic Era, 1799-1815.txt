Lecture 5, the Napoleonic Era, 1799 to 1815.
Having just recently traveled with the French through the many phases of the first ten years
of their revolution and wishing that somehow they could possibly have stopped somewhere
between 1792 and 1793, we enter on to another roller coaster together with Napoleon from
1799 to 1815 with all of Europe being in one of the cars.
Napoleon Bonaparte's rise to power was based on a combination of opportunities presented
by the disruptions of the French Revolution and by his outstanding political and military
talents and his powerful ambition.
Born into a poor Corsican noble family in 1769, just after France acquired the island
from Genoa, named Napoleone Bonaparte, he received his military training in France prior to the
revolution specializing in artillery and being embarrassed by his name and his accent
and his lack of wealth and changing his name and his affectation along the way as best
as he could.
Always somewhat out of place and needy and therefore on the make, he was influenced however
by Enlightenment thought and he quickly threw in his lot with the revolution, even joining
the Jacobins in 1792, placing a good bet because they were about to take power and to have
their run.
Napoleon quickly showed unusual talents in a series of military engagements, especially
in lifting the British siege of Toulon in December of 1793 with his use of artillery
and he also made excellent political connections, switching his support to the Thermadorians
and marrying the well-placed Josephine de Beauharnais who was a mistress of one of the
director's barra.
He then became one of the youngest generals in the French army, changed his name fully,
won significant military victories against the Piedmontese and the Austrians in Italy
in 1796 and in 1797 and did what he did best in a sense went off on his own going beyond
his orders negotiating treaties on his own accord but gaining considerable fame and notoriety
in Paris as well both from elites but also from the masses.
This was followed by a dramatic campaign in Egypt when he went back to Paris they wanted
to send them off because he was dangerous in a sense in Paris but soon Napoleon's daring
military victories were undermined by Admiral Nelson's destruction of his fleet which would
become a recurring theme for the next part of his career as well because Nelson would
to do the same thing in 1805 at Trafalgar and one can wonder what would have happened
if the French fleets were not destroyed and what would have happened to Great Britain.
Napoleon returned home from Egypt in October 1799 just in time to join our old friend Abbas
in overthrowing the directory in a move that the other conspiratorals thought would lead
to them being in the seat driving and Napoleon following however iron willed ambitious a
general popular holding better cards if he chose to play them which he did Napoleon quickly
assumed overall control of France's political and military destiny increasingly expanding
his power and achieving considerable success during the four plus years of what was called
the consulate he was the first consul among the three making himself such he made himself
consul for life in 1802 and then he took the crown from the hands of the pope pious the
seventh in May of 1804 and crowned himself emperor rather than having the pope crowned
him emperor as Charlemagne had allowed himself to do centuries and centuries before.
