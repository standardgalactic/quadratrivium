In 1543, he wrote a pamphlet in which he said the following,
Concerning the Jews and their lies,
What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews?
I shall give you, the princes and civil powers, my sincere advice,
First to set fire to their synagogues or schools,
And to bury in cover with dirt whatever will not burn,
So that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them.
This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom.
Second, I advise that their houses should also be raised and destroyed,
For they pursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues.
Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings,
In which idolatry lies and cursing and bluffs many are taught,
Be taken from them.
Incredibly, Roland Bainton in one of the most wonderful biographies of Luther,
And Bainton was a great Protestant theologian writing after World War II,
Roland Bainton in a magnificent little book which I strongly recommend,
Entitled Here I Stand, said in writing,
It would simply have been better if Martin Luther had died before he wrote these essays,
Because the opportunity to have taken a turn was lost,
And therefore traditional anti-Semitism entered into the soul of Protestantism,
As it continued to be part of the soul of Catholicism during this Renaissance and Reformation era.
However, in another way, Reformation paved the way for tolerance,
Because the inability of either dominant faith to destroy the other,
After about 150 years of intermittent murderous religious wars,
Mandated the beginning of a functionally more tolerant attitude,
Simply for the sake of survival.
So that by the middle of the 17th century,
There was essentially a general acceptance of the religious status quo on some level.
Significantly, Jews began to gain greater acceptance in Protestant Holland,
And Protestant England during the 17th century,
Which was then transferred in stages to the 13 colonies,
To give you a sense of what this meant in the sense of the religious ideology of the 17th century,
In which virtually everyone still believed there was only one truth,
Catholics believed they had it,
Muslims believed they had it,
Jews believed they had it,
Muslims believed they had it,
And that truth contained the secret of how to get to heaven,
Which was after all the real purpose of life,
Not life on earth.
Oliver Cromwell, when he ruled England in the middle of the century,
Allowed Jews to come back to England because of one hoping they would help England develop economically,
But even more so,
Jews as part of Protestant eschatology,
Needed to live everywhere in the world before Christ would return to earth,
So bringing them to England would further that procedure.
This man who began to introduce toleration to Jews in mid 17th century England,
Then went ahead and murdered 3,000 Catholics after the battle of Drugs and Wexford in Ireland,
Because when they wouldn't surrender,
He saw them as being anti Christ and the devil,
Just as the Jews were pictured in the medieval world as the anti Christ and the devil,
And the font of everything evil in society.
So the same individual who could begin to be tolerant of Jews,
Would massacre men, women and children in Ireland,
Because they were Catholic and they would not submit.
Meanwhile, the 17th century scientific revolution,
The age of reason we've talked about,
And the 18th century enlightenment,
Began to undermine the very foundation and basis of religious bigotry and superstition,
And clearly call for toleration,
Even of despised religions,
Often based on the doctrines of an AIW human rights,
And in more progressive cases,
A deeper appreciation of what the Jews were,
Or what they would become or could become,
If they were allowed to integrate into society,
And how society might benefit from that,
As well as how the Jews might benefit from that.
Now it still should be recognized that many of the people who believed in this,
Still wished that the Jews would convert,
After coming into contact with a tolerant Christianity,
That they would change, that they would cease to be what they were,
Because many of these people, even among the French Revolutionary,
Still had very, very prejudicial views of what the Jews were,
And what their role was, except now they based it partly on the persecution and mistreatment
They had received over the centuries.
