So, the parliament is really more of a debating society, except when it votes on military budgets,
and that it does every five or seven years, and it's very easy to have a foreign policy
crisis emerge right before voting for a military budget, forcing even people who are critical
of the regime to vote that military budget.
The combination of a kind of feudalistic romanticism that actually mirrored some of
the worst militaristic, social Darwinian and racialist excesses of late 19th century Germany,
its elite and popular culture, and the encirclement psychosis that the German elite began to have
once the French and the British and the Russians came together in agreement to try to balance
Germany out, brought about largely by the self-destructive nature of German diplomacy
itself, forced Germany to rely ever more heavily on unstable Austria-Hungary, her only reliable
ally, and also led her geostrategically to make a commitment to a military plan predicated
on a two-front war should war come, the Schlieffen Plan.
These proved to be a lethal combination during the final crisis leading to World War I, and
even though we'll talk about this later, this Schlieffen Plan initially was one of a number
of potential plans, but by 1912 refined it had become the only plan updated in operation,
either the Schlieffen Plan in a war against France and Russia, or no action, a truly dangerous
combustible and foolish situation.
It is no wonder that many great scholars, including many Germans, rightly or wrongly,
see the primary cause of World War I emanating from Berlin, either in what they perceived
to be Germany's drive toward domination in Europe, and that's the work of Fritz Fischer
in the 1960s and all of the people who have followed his line of thinking since then,
or in the effective collapse of the German system of government, and here you have L.C.B.
Seaman, who I hope you're looking at from time to time, who takes this position, really feeling
that German policy was not coordinated because in fact the German system of government had
virtually collapsed and that Germany had no real goals because the only real goals other
than pure defense were the goals of demonstrating its power, or thirdly, and Volker Berghan
and a school of thought around him have taken the position that German policy had reached
a gridlock domestically, especially as the left continued to grow and strength, and that
the only way of breaking that gridlock was by some dramatic foreign policy success so
that there are scholars who actually believe that World War I broke out because of domestic
pressures as much as anything else.
And we're going to consider all of these ideas in great detail as well as a number of other
ideas when we begin to talk about the origins of World War I. They all need to be considered
seriously.
I'm not particularly wedded to any of them, but they all need to be considered because
they all have some weight to them.
Indeed, some of the same forces exacerbated and radicalized by World War I, and under
the far more traumatized environment of the Russian Revolution and then the Great Depression
finally brought Adolf Hitler into power in January of 1933 in one last attempt of the
elites to prevent the real democratization of German politics and the economic redistribution,
and particularly during the depression that would have come along with it had that democratization
occurred.
But that's another story.
Thank you.
