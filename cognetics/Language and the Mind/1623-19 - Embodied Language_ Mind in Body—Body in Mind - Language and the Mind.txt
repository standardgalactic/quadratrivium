you've now had two lectures on hand gestures one on how they complement speech and the other on
when they replace it and that's broaden the focus if the hands are so closely tied the language
what about the rest of the body we touched on this in the social brain lecture but in this one i want
to go much deeper what can communication in its most embodied form tell us about language and the
mind to appreciate this question think back to our definition of the mind the mind emerges from how the
brain interacts with the environment through the body in this way the body isn't just some mere
vessel for the mind it's actually part of the mind
this is the idea of embodiment and it has roots in a number of different fields
let's focus on the big three philosophy psychology and neuroscience starting with philosophy the body
has always been viewed as a central feature of the mind in many eastern traditions like buddhism
for example zen buddhism has long rejected the notion that the body is just a shell for the mind
in zen body and mind mutually comprise the self but until recently the body hasn't gotten nearly as much
love in western philosophy for example dualism has been particularly unkind to the body consider
descartes he saw the body as a sort of automaton as just a machine that mechanically takes care of
basic survival functions and for descartes when the mind interacts with the body the body is always in a
position of subservience to help you picture this a film reference might help have you ever seen disney's
inside out if so then you've seen an animated modern version of descartes dualism the movie centers on
a young girl facing some personal struggles but the real stars of the film are the tiny little beings
that inhabit the girl's head these little homunculi represent the girl's mind and they totally run the
show they they pull levers turn knobs and press buttons to control the girls every thought feeling
and action just like mini navigators of a giant robot now this makes for great entertainment but not
great philosophy contemporary philosophers have rejected dualism as a model of the mind for many
reasons but one of the biggest is that the body is much more than a mere automaton we can trace this
revamped view of the body back to the birth of phenomenology in the early 20th century
phenomenologists were an ambitious bunch of philosophers who grappled with big and thorny
questions like the subjective nature of consciousness it's from this philosophical tradition that the
father of embodiment emerged most now credit the french phenomenologist maurice merlot ponti as the first
western philosopher to give serious attention to the body in human subjective experience for merlot ponti
the brain does not rule over the body nor is the body a slave to its environment no the body is much
more actively involved it serves as a constructive mesh between the brain and the environment and this
blurs the distinction between the inner mind and the outer world you're probably familiar with
descartes famous dictum i think therefore i am well contrast this to merlot ponti's much more corporal
mantra i am my body for merlot ponti the repeated actions of the body on things in the world become
habit and these habitual actions are a form of knowing in and of themselves have you ever heard of the term
muscle memory well that's basically what merlot ponti was talking about in much more philosophical terms
embodiment is now a thriving sub-discipline in philosophy and we'll be coming back to it in later lectures
but this influence was not just confined to philosophical speculation merlot ponti's ideas have had a big
impact on scientific theories as well this is most directly evident in the mid-20th century psychological
work of the husband-wife team james j and eleanor gibson like merlot ponti the gibson saw the body as
creating a mesh between the brain and the environment they explored this interconnection through very
naturalistic scientific studies where people interact with objects in everyday contexts in these studies
they observed that people don't seem to perceive their environment directly instead they experience it
according to certain affordances an affordance is an aspect of the environment that lends itself to a
particular way of physically engaging with it this idea fits well with the more general concept of an
umwelt which was described by the german physiologist jacob von achskel umwelt means environment or
surrounding but it has a further connotation it stands for the perfect fit between a particular organism
and a particular environmental niche all organisms have evolved sensory systems to fit the environment
and for different species this causes some aspects of the environment to be more or less meaningful than
other aspects in all um belts affordances abound for example in the human umwelt stairs afford climbing
chairs afford sitting and sticks afford grasping this means that we don't passively take in information
from the environment our bodies actively constrain perception of things to make some aspects more or less
salient to us and this in turn feeds backwards shaping how our minds perceive the world
this embodied way of thinking led to a new psychological field called ecological psychology
which has been summed up by this catchy aphorism ask not what's inside your head but what your head's inside of
this view was controversial because it challenged the two dominant psychological theories of the time
on one hand it rejected behaviorism which viewed the environment as directly forcing itself on the brain
regardless of the body and on the other hand it rejected cognitivism which viewed the brain as a
computer that processes the external world in an abstract and disembodied way the gibsons were not the
only prominent psychologists to emphasize the body another was someone we've already discussed the great
developmental psychologist john piaget actually just as merlot ponty was leaving the university of paris
in 1952 piaget arrived as a visiting scholar piaget had been developing a theory called constructivism
and this theory emphasized how children actively constructed their knowledge over development so how do
children build this knowledge well as we've discussed piaget theorized that they act like little
scientists who physically tinker with the world they use their bodies as tools to test all sorts of
hypotheses about things around them like the physics of objects and the consequences of actions
this is no abstract enterprise these little empiricists are as hands-on as any scientist in the lab
for piaget this physical experimentation is necessary in order for children to construct more abstract
knowledge piaget's work has been criticized on many methodological grounds but his central claim about
how the body constructs knowledge has endured modern psychological models like dynamic systems theory owe a
great debt to piaget's emphasis on the body as shaping learning and development
shifting over to the field of neuroscience we've already discussed theories that place a central
importance on the body in neural processing for example many see simulation theory as a neural
pillar of embodiment this was evident in our apple example remember thinking about eating an apple
activates very similar neural network as actually eating an apple and even just hearing the word apple
activates much of the same network in a similar way risolati's work on mirror neurons is seen as
support for embodiment and perspective taking for example when you see someone in pain christian kiesers
argues that you understand that pain by putting yourself in the person's shoes and feeling it yourself
this way of thinking has become so well established that it's now almost cliche to say that the way we
understand another's emotions actions and thoughts is by neurally reproducing those raw experiences in our
own brains this widespread acceptance of neural embodiment makes sense when you consider what it was
reacting to before the 1990s there were two competing views on the brain one saw the brain as a general
purpose device like a computer which neurally computed and solved problems in a highly abstract and binary
way think about it series of zeros and ones doesn't get much more disembodied the other view of the brain
saw it as a complex machine with many specialized parts for solving very particular problems these so-called
modules were functionally isolated from one another which highlighted a sharp distinction between
the body and higher level thought in other words there were brain modules for sensory and perceptual
processing and these were structurally and functionally separate from modules for things like attention
emotion memory planning and of course language both of these views waned in popularity during the rise of
embodiment but now they're actually making a comeback and adding an important nuance to modern theories of embodiment
so where are we today despite the current popularity of embodiment many scientists are pushing back on the idea
especially in its more extreme forms let me walk you through some of these critiques before i try to
strike a balance between these two competing views one radical view of embodiment is that because humans have
evolved minds in the ubiquitous context of bodies over millions and millions of years all thought and all
feeling is constrained by the body in some way there are three big problems with this extreme view the first
critique is that embodiment is not all in an all-encompassing mechanism for the mind research in cognitive
neuroscience has shown that not every concept memory or feeling is embodied some are represented in the brain
in purely abstract ways let's go back to our apple when you think of an apple not only does your brain
neurally simulate interacting with it but it also engages in more conceptual abstract processing for
example you know that an apple is a type of fruit that comes from a tree and there are many varieties
including fuji empire and golden delicious this sort of knowledge is called semantic memory and it has its
own unique brain mechanisms carolyn patterson and her team at the university of cambridge have shown that
this type of memory can be wiped out by disorder called semantic dementia but interestingly these patients have
no problem perceiving or appropriately acting on objects and in many cases they can remember interacting
with them in their past so if given an apple these patients may know that it should be eaten or even that
they've eaten it before but they still have no idea what it's called or even that it's a fruit not a vegetable
the damage for these patients is located in the anterior temporal lobe or atl which is located along the
ventral stream of language comprehension this has been corroborated by dozens of neural imaging studies on
healthy brains too we use this neural mechanism all the time the next time you remember someone's name
the title of a song or any fact about the world you have your atl to thank now consider the flip side of
this disorder motor apraxia this is a specific deficit in knowing what to do with objects and it's caused by a
different sort of damage mostly to the motor network of the brain what's interesting is that apraxics
retain semantic memories of what objects are so for example if shown a comb an apraxic patient could
easily define it but once he picked it up he wouldn't know what how to properly use it they can think of
this as a dissociation between semantic and embodied knowledge and it suggests that embodiment is not the
only neural mechanism in town all right the second critique jumps to the other causal side of the
3d framework it highlights the functional limits of embodiment for understanding concrete things like an
apple or a comb it's obvious how neural embodiment is useful but what about more abstract things what
about understanding concepts like good and evil sane and insane or success and failure or how about
mathematical reasoning how do you embody the number 13.7 or pi or square root and when it comes to
language specifically how does embodiment help with syntax and morphology here are three of the most common
free morphemes in the english language the be and of how does the brain embody those words i think you get
the point just as we discussed with the advantages of arbitrariness versus iconicity in language there's
some real benefits of abstract neural processing here are three one as our examples have already shown
abstract neural codes can handle many things in a body ones can't two abstract codes are built for speed
think about how quickly you can multiply five times a hundred once you master the concept of
multiplication you can quickly do such calculations in the blink of an eye if you had to solve that
problem by imagining objects or simulating actions think how long that would take and three abstract
processing is extremely flexible picture the color of an apple now focus on the shape now it's texture
that was pretty easy wasn't it what you just did is called cognitive flexibility and it's controlled
largely by neural mechanisms in your frontal lobe and even though this network coordinates with neural
simulations as it just did with you the coordination itself is very abstract and freed from the constraints
of the physical body okay our final critique of embodiment is best illustrated through an example
if you haven't seen the documentary alpha go i strongly suggest you check it out it's about the
ancient chinese board game go and it features a match between the 18-time world champion korean player
lee sadal and a computer program called alpha go the program was created by google's deep mind division
in london and it learned how to play the game go through deep learning basically this means that alpha
go was fed massive amounts of data from previous go games while also training itself by playing actual go
experts after training it was 100 in control of its own moves during each game with sadal so how did it go
go well sorry for the spoiler but alpha go beat the world champ four games to one during the match all of
the commentators yes there are go commentators all of them remarked about the creativity of the machine's
moves and here's what leader sadal said himself about one particularly innovative one this move was really
creative and beautiful this move made me think about go in a new light regardless of whether you're willing to
attribute creativity to alpha go you at least have to admit that it sure can play the game since its match with
sadal more advanced versions of the program have been undefeated against humans now here's the main point alpha go has done
all of this with nothing but some silicon chips and an abstract code of zeros and ones if a computer
can manage to accomplish this without a body doesn't that raise doubts about how much humans must use
their bodies to think so which of these views is right disembodied or embodied many now believe that the
answer is both the evidence suggests that some aspects of thought lend themselves best to an embodied
form and other aspects are best suited for more abstract representations and processes for example
the neuroscientists bradford mahome and alfonso caramaza they present a hybrid view that they call
grounding by interaction the idea is that all thinking has an abstract component but when possible
the way it gets instantiated is through embodied perceptions and actions in this way abstract thought is
grounded in how the body interacts with the environment when viewed from this perspective the mind has
the best of both worlds it can quickly and flexibly process abstract concepts without any limits while also
materializing and exploring that abstract information through concrete bodily experiences or here's another
way to think about it the brain creates concepts and the body brings them to life
so given that the mind is both embodied and disembodied so to speak it's worth asking how this
plays out in face-to-face communication how do the arbitrary and abstract elements of language interact with the
iconic and concrete expressions of the body the key here is to recognize that language originally evolved within face-to-face
context we already talked about the gestural theory of language evolution and now is a good time to expand
on that in addition to the hands the early forms of human language most certainly used other aspects of
the body like eye gaze body posture facial expressions lip movements and tone of voice in 1872 darwin wrote an entire
book on these bodily actions he called it the expression of the emotions in man and animals
his argument was that the mental states and processes are tightly tied to the body often in universal ways
and human communication evolved to be increasingly sensitive to these things for darwin humans were like
any other animal where attention to bodily communication was a matter of life and death now that's a bit dramatic
when it comes to modern day language use but the point is well taken in languages natural face-to-face habitat
the body is an extremely important tool for communication think about all the misunderstandings
you've had over the phone or in texting or in reading emails non-face-to-face communication is rife with breakdowns
i would argue that the main benefit of face-to-face interactions is that the body can help us understand
what communicators mean
brains are built for this sort of multimodal processing and this can be seen at every neural level
from individual cells to whole brain regions to the entire connectome
for example in the primate brain the modalities of vision and audition synergistically interact to help
differentiate important things like threats versus non-threats or mates versus non-mates language was built
on top of these multimodal mechanisms so it's no surprise that humans depend on the body so much when
we communicate in the last part of this lecture i'd like to outline how different parts of the body
affect comprehension of different parts of language let's start with the smallest linguistic unit phonemes
i want to try a little experiment i'm going to play an audio clip of a syllable repeating
and i'd like you to identify what it is okay here we go ba ba ba ba ba ba if you heard ba that's good
that's what i played you now let's try again but this time i'll present some visual information for those of
you watching this if you're just listening you're the control group here we go ba ba ba ba ba ba
those of you just listening should have heard the exact same thing but if you are watching you may
have heard something different something like da or tha and the reason is that the lip movements you saw
were actually forming a ga syllable and when that is combined with what you actually heard a spoken ba
syllable it caused your brain to fuse them together into a third syllable like da or sometimes tha
this audio illusion is called the mcgurk effect and it works for most people what's amazing about it
is that even if you know it's coming it still works i personally have done this literally hundreds of
times and every time it fools me this goes to show just how much we rely on the lips when trying to
understand speech and face-to-face interactions okay let's move on to semantics we've already talked
about how hand gestures affect language comprehension and learning but we know that other bodily actions
can have a big impact too perhaps the most studied are facial expressions a hundred years after darwin the
psychologist paul ekman launched an ambitious research program investigating how facial expressions may
universally display emotions across cultures although there's a lot of debate most scientists generally
accept that certain basic facial expressions like happiness anger and fear are universally used and
differentiated across cultures and they serve as reliable social signals for most people on the planet
but emotional expression does not stop at the face
the cognitive neuroscientist beatrice de gelder is an expert on how emotions conveyed through the face
and the body combined her work has found that the brain perceives emotional messages quickest when the
face and the body posture are emotionally congruent how about when the face and body express the same thing
but the conflict with an emotional tone of voice in the content of the speech in that case people go with what
what they see and not what they hear i experienced this firsthand in my first job out of college after
i graduated i worked in a child psychiatric unit at children's memorial hospital in chicago during our
training we were explicitly taught to pay attention to how children said things with their bodies more than
what they said with their words and it really worked ever since then i've noticed this all around me and it's been
very helpful as a teacher to understand when my students are struggling but aren't willing to admit
it okay let's move on to syntax in an earlier lecture we already did one example showing the power
of prosody let's do another consider the two different meanings of these sentences colgate accepted kiana
and jose and jill got rejected colgate accepted kiana and jose and jill got rejected same word different
meanings just a small shift in timing and stress changed the syntax of the sentence and significantly
changed the message we learned earlier that this type of prosodic processing is lateralized to the right
hemisphere homologues of broca's and wernicke's areas damage to these areas produces a very particular
disorder called aprisodia which is an inability to produce or understand prosody to guide syntax and meaning
this again highlights the network property of the brain as our left hemisphere mostly handles the content of speech
the right hemisphere mostly processes the overall structure and tone
finally let's jump up to pragmatics pragmatics is all about assessing the social intentions of a communicator
and as we know the body is perfectly suited for that job let's consider how we respond to one
particularly salient social intention detecting threats it's well known that our fight-or-flight response
is triggered by threatening stimuli like aggressive postures and eye contact and angry facial expressions
and tone of voice according to the eminent neuroscientist joseph ladue these threats are processed by two
simultaneous pathways in the brain he calls the first one the low road of threat processing this low road is
based on evolutionarily ancient direct connections between sensory receptors like the eyes and ears and the
amygdala which is one of the oldest structures in the animal brain the function of this pathway is to
quickly alert the organism of immediate danger and this happens within milliseconds at the same time
the high road of processing involves a much slower route on the order of seconds the high road involves the
primary sensory cortices like v1 and a1 and the hippocampus to do a deeper and more thorough assessment of the
threat in context this is yet another example of a dual pathway in the brain serving two functions
the low road maximizes immediate survival in a kind of better safe than sorry sort of way and the high
road allows for reanalysis and memory updating and this is useful for adjusting the original knee-jerk
response to a potential threat now thankfully most everyday language is not brimming with bad intentions
but language is always full of some sort of social intention
and attending to the body is extremely useful in detecting them
there you have it the body influences all parts of language so what's this mean for us
well if both abstract thought and embodied experience comprise language in the mind then any attempt to
understand them must take the body seriously from this perspective old-fashioned dualism just will not do
this fresh perspective is gaining converts even in the one place where you might least expect it
in the field of artificial intelligence the binary and abstract world of zeros and ones
there's growing interest in embodied ai traditionally the field of ai mostly steered away from emulating real
brains and real bodies computer scientists and engineers alike often make reference to da vinci's failed
attempts at building a flying machine as the cliche goes airplanes don't flap their wings and it's true for many
applications of ai bodies don't matter all that much but if the goal is to model the human mind and truly
master complex functions like language there are those who believe that the body must be taken seriously
and for good reasons back to our cliche did you know that in building the first airplane the wright brothers
actually spent a lot of time studying birds using a wind tunnel they carefully modeled different speed
aspects of a bird's flight like wing shape and tail guidance this gave them many insights towards their
initial design for an airplane but it goes beyond just looking at bodies for ideas or inspiration
a growing number of ai experts now believe that machine learning itself must be embodied
rather than force feeding abstract data files to ai programs the future of ai is for programs themselves
to collect their own data by physically exploring the environment and in that regard you might say the
future is now consider self-driving cars or autonomous combat drones these things don't have human-like bodies
but they are definitely embodied they start with a basic abstract program housed in a mobile unit and
then they change their own code based on direct interactions with real environments years from now we may
look back on these technologies as early steps towards putting ai into more humanoid robot forms and if some
visions of the future prove true robot bodies won't just be mere vessels for a silicon mind
they'll actually be a key part of it
