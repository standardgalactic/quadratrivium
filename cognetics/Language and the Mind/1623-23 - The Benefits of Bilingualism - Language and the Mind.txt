I want to start with a quote from the bilingual author, Eva Hoffman.
Hoffman's native language is Polish, but she was thrust into the world of English as a 13-year-old
when her family moved from Krakow to Canada in 1959.
Here's what she said.
River, in Polish, was a vital sound, energized with the essence of riverhood, of my rivers,
of my being immersed in rivers.
River, in English, is cold, a word without an aura.
It has no accumulated associations for me, and it does not give off the radiating haze of connotation.
This comes from Hoffman's 1989 book, Lost in Translation, A Life in a New Language.
In it, she describes how her worlds don't feel the same in her two different languages.
Now, this isn't quite the same thing that we've been discussing in the last two lectures.
Linguistic relativity asks, how do specific linguistic differences between particular languages produce specific psychological effects?
Hoffman's quote touches on something much broader.
It suggests that having more than one language might influence the mind beyond distinct linguistic structures.
So, possessing multiple languages, any languages, might do something more general to multilingual minds compared to monolingual ones.
This is getting closer to what I meant by capital L effects of language.
A few lectures ago, we discussed mechanisms for multilingualism, or in other words, what occurs in multilingualism.
In this lecture, we'll ask a new question.
What occurs as a result of multilingualism?
To answer this, we first need to make a distinction between the intended function of speaking more than one language
and its many unintended consequences.
In strict Aristotelian terms, the functional purpose of multilingualism is clear,
to increase the number of people you can effectively converse with.
However, as the eminent biologist Nicholas Tinbergen points out,
just because a behavior is designed for one thing doesn't mean it can't also do other things.
Consider a lion chasing its prey.
Even though the intended function of the chase is to eat,
this activity produces many other things for the lion,
like strengthening muscles, honing senses, and exercising the heart.
With this in mind, we can ask,
what are the potential byproducts of speaking multiple languages?
This is a relatively recent scientific question.
It started to become a field all its own around the turn of the millennium,
and it was inspired by research that didn't necessarily have anything to do with language.
Recall that the 1990s were the decade of the brain,
a time when neuroscience research was reaching a wider scientific audience?
One of the most exciting topics during that period was how experience and plasticity changed the human brain.
We've already talked about this at length in the context of faces and the fusiform expertise area,
but there are all sorts of other nice examples, too.
Like,
becoming a virtuoso cellist expands the size of your somatosensory cortex in the playing hand.
Or,
novices of the video game Tetris have more neurally diffuse and disorganized visual motor networks than expert players.
The size of the posterior hippocampus where spatial memories are encoded and retrieved
is positively correlated with years of being a London taxi driver.
This neuroscience work dovetailed with another research area that has been around since the 1980s.
It was known that actively learning new things, especially at younger or older ages,
was good for brain health.
This is sometimes called cognitive reserve.
The term has taken on many different meanings,
but the basic idea is that your brain is like a muscle,
and like any other muscle, when it becomes exercised,
it becomes stronger and more resistant to fatigue and decline.
Seeing the link between these two areas,
researchers in the late 1990s started to think about learning languages
as a way to induce plasticity and boost cognitive reserve.
This connection should make sense if you think back to our lecture on multilingual mechanisms.
Recall that speaking multiple languages requires a beefed-up prefrontal cortex, or PFC,
presumably to control and monitor which language is being used at what time.
This executive functioning role of the PFC is a classic domain general skill.
It's not specific to just language.
Given that, might this consistent linguistic flexing of the PFC affect other aspects of cognition, too?
This was the question that made Ellen Bialystok of York University in Canada famous.
In her 2001 book, Bilingualism in Development,
Bialystok introduced the general public to the idea that being bilingual
enhanced cognitive control in children and adults.
Cognitive control is a metacognitive ability of the PFC
that involves deploying attention to what is relevant while ignoring what is not.
For example, when I'm trying to speak Japanese,
my cognitive control system attempts to lock onto Japanese
while inhibiting English as much as possible.
This is a lot of work for me,
but true bilinguals become pros at this skill.
How would you even quantify such a thing?
Bialystok cleverly used a well-known measure of cognitive control called a Stroop task.
Stroop tasks require you to focus on one dimension of a stimulus
while actively ignoring another dimension.
For example, imagine seeing the word blue written on a computer screen.
And suppose that sometimes it is written in a blue font,
but other times a red font.
Now suppose that your task is to identify the color of the font,
red or blue, while ignoring the actual meaning of the word.
On average, people are much slower at doing this
when the word and font differ.
You can think of this delay as an index of how hard it is
to tune out irrelevant information.
The slower you are, the harder it is.
Bialystok did a variation of this Stroop task,
and here's what she found.
Compared to monolinguals, bilingual children and adults
showed much smaller timing differences,
suggesting that they could more easily focus on the relevant piece of information
without getting distracted by the irrelevant piece.
One explanation for these findings is that
because bilinguals have a lifetime of experience
activating and suppressing different languages
and switching back and forth between them,
they are constantly flexing their cognitive control muscle.
This allows them to become very good at using cognitive control
for all sorts of metacognitive activities,
not just ones related to language.
But isn't it possible that people who are already good at cognitive control
are just the ones that eventually become bilingual?
That's a fair question,
but most people don't choose to become bilingual.
They're just born into it.
Not only that, the effects of being born into bilingualism
seem to show up very early in life,
even before babies utter their first words.
For example, Bialystok and colleagues had six-month-olds
learn to look at an object that produced a reward.
Then the reward shifted to a new object,
and babies needed to learn to switch their old-looking behaviors
to get the new reward.
Some of the infants had only been exposed to one language
for their first six months of life,
and some had been exposed to a second language
for that same period.
The main finding was that infants who had been exposed
to a second language could more easily,
more successfully, and more quickly switch
their looking behavior when given this new information.
This suggests that even mere exposure to a second language
may contribute to enhanced cognitive control mechanisms
in the developing brain.
On the other end of the developmental spectrum,
Bialystok and our colleagues have also found
that multilingualism may offer protective effects
for normal age-related memory loss.
For example, in one study, Bialystok reported
that memory loss is delayed by four years in multilinguals
compared to monolinguals.
And in another study, multilingualism was shown
to offer protective effects for people with Alzheimer's disease.
That is, even with comparable neurodegeneration,
multilinguals showed fewer symptoms of the disease.
Bialystok and others' research on cognitive control
has opened the floodgates for all sorts of studies
on potential positive effects of multilingualism on the mind.
But before we explore a few of these different areas,
I need to address a legitimate concern.
Starting in the early 2010s,
the entire scientific community has been rocked
by what some call a replication crisis.
This has hit psychology particularly hard
because studies about human behavior and the human mind
are among the most covered in the media.
Given the splashy nature of the cognitive control
and bilingualism research,
many have tried to replicate these basic findings,
but attempts have produced mixed results.
There have been some replications,
but in other studies,
the cognitive control phenomenon has disappeared
when different definitions of bilingualism are used
and when certain confounding variables are controlled for,
like subject education levels and lifestyle factors.
Another limitation is sample size.
Much of the original work on cognitive control
and bilingualism used very small numbers.
For example,
in one early study by Bialystok,
there were only 10 participants per condition.
A recent trend in psychology and neuroscience
is to use very large samples
to ensure more statistically reliable findings.
In one ambitious study,
Anthony Dick and his team
at Florida International University
tested 4,500 participants across 21 sites
around the United States
and they found no evidence
for a cognitive advantage for bilinguals.
In fact, they found if anything,
bilinguals were at a disadvantage in vocabulary size.
Now, it's still early days for research
on the cognitive control benefits of bilingualism
and time will tell which findings are robust
and which are more fragile.
Personally, I don't see this as a crisis,
but rather as a perfectly healthy situation
where the scientific method
is doing its job
of separating the wheat from the chaff.
Despite this uncertainty
surrounding cognitive control,
there's been an absolute explosion of research
investigating all the other possible byproducts
of speaking more than one language.
And with over half of the world's population
being multilingual and so many monolinguals
trying to learn a foreign language,
the topic's just too relevant to ignore.
Many of the exciting research questions
I'll share with you
weren't being asked prior to the new millennium.
So most of these studies
have only a short track record,
meaning they don't have the luxury
of collecting giant samples
and having multiple replications.
For this reason,
we'll need to interpret
much of this new work with caution.
Here are the three topics that we'll consider.
Personality, decision-making, and social skills.
I'll start with personality
because it has its roots
well before the neuroscience boom in the 1990s.
The pioneering sociolinguist Susan Irvin Tripp
was one of the first researchers
to empirically study how people change
when they speak different languages.
According to Irvin Tripp,
her dissertation at the University of Michigan
in 1955 was inspired
by her college best friend at Vassar,
a budding poet named Jacqueline Frank.
Frank was a French-English bilingual
who used to say that she felt
like two different people
when speaking French and English.
If you have friends or family
who are multilingual,
you should ask them if they also feel this.
In my experience, it's quite common,
and people seem to enjoy talking about it.
Irvin Tripp had French-English bilinguals
perform a well-known psychological assessment
called the thematic apperception test, or TAT.
The TAT involves pictures of ambiguous scenes,
like a man pulling away from a woman's embrace
with the woman looking directly at the man.
These evocative pictures are designed
to produce diverse stories
about what is happening in the scene,
what people in the scene are thinking and feeling,
and what's going to happen next,
just very evocative images.
One group of bilinguals was shown a set of pictures
and asked to tell a story about them in English.
Then they were shown the same set again
in a different order
and asked to tell the stories about them in French.
In a second group, the bilinguals did the same thing,
but they started in French and then switched to English.
The main findings were that
when bilinguals were speaking French,
they had more descriptions
that mentioned verbal arguments.
But when they were speaking English,
they had more themes that included physical violence.
Interestingly, when talking in English,
people were also more likely
to describe the women in the scenes
as being supportive as wives,
helping their husbands achieve their goals.
Now, it's not clear that the people
were actually changing their personalities
or whether the languages just primed them
to think about different things,
but this work was instrumental
in putting the question of personality changes
and language on the map.
More recently, Michelle Coven
of the University of Illinois
has done some interesting ethnographic analyses
of French-Portuguese bilinguals
speaking their two languages.
Through qualitative analyses of the speech,
Coven has found that the speakers
seem to activate what she calls their two selves
when speaking the two different languages.
She has situated this in anthropological theories
claiming that identity is not a fixed construct,
but rather something fluid that shifts
when reactivating previous social contexts.
So, according to Coven,
when a bilingual speaks in one language,
that language reactivates all the past experiences
that are unique to speaking that language.
Not only that,
all that past experience
becomes temporarily part of the present identity.
Now, this is all pretty theoretical,
but there are some nice physiological data
to support these claims.
Boston University psychologist Catherine Caldwell-Harris
and her team published a paper in 2003
investigating how emotionally charged words
in different languages
affect Turkish-English bilinguals'
skin-conductive responses.
This autonomic activity is similar
to what is measured with the lie detector test
and is thought to reflect
the amygdala's low-level emotional processing
of charged stimuli.
Past research has shown
that hearing emotionally charged language
produces a much higher autonomic arousal
than neutral language.
Caldwell-Harris replicated this
and also found something novel.
She discovered that native Turkish speakers
who learned English later in life
had much lower skin conductance
when listening to emotionally charged language,
like taboo words,
in English versus Turkish.
The explanation was that childhood
is an emotionally fraught time
and that certain words and phrases
used in a family context
have a particularly raw and charged meaning.
In contrast, when emotional language
is learned and used later in life
in a classroom setting, for example,
it has more neutral and abstract connotations.
Here's another way to think of it.
Emotional language learned early on
is more emotionally embodied
than language learned later in life.
Now we'll jump to a related
and much newer area.
If speaking a foreign language
reduces the emotional connotation
of some words,
it's interesting to ask
how bilinguals make decisions
when processing emotionally charged information
in each of their languages.
After all, we know from psychologists
like the Nobel Prize winning Daniel Kahneman
that emotions can bias people
to make irrational decisions.
For example,
when information is framed
in an emotionally negative way,
people are often irrationally risk-averse.
But when framed in a positive way,
they are often irrationally risk-seeking.
In fact,
these biases are strongly correlated
with amygdala activity,
which suggests that they are built
on evolutionarily ancient mechanisms
for emotion.
By the way,
if this sort of thing interests you,
you should really check out Kahneman's book,
Thinking Fast and Slow.
I think you'll really like it.
All right,
so how does language fit into these decisions?
This was the question asked by Boaz Kesar
and his students at the University of Chicago.
In 2012,
they published a paper entitled
The Foreign Language Effect,
Thinking in a Foreign Tongue Reduces Decision Biases.
This study comprised multiple experiments
that tested intermediate learners
of a foreign language.
In one experiment,
native English speakers
who were taking Spanish as a foreign language
played a gambling game
where they could win or lose real money.
Subjects were given real $10
and told that they could choose
to place 10 separate $1 bets
on 10 flips of a coin.
If they chose not to make any bets,
they would take home all $10.
But if they did bet,
they were told that winning and losing
would produce different things.
If they bet and lost,
it would cost them $1.
But if they bet and won,
they kept their dollar
and made an extra dollar and 50 cents.
It doesn't take a mathematical genius
to see that the odds are stacked
against the house
and in the subject's favor.
Not betting guarantees $10,
but betting and winning
only half the time,
which are the odds of a coin flip,
would yield $12.50.
The rational decision
is to bet every time
because even if you're winning at chance,
you'll make more money than you lose.
So what happened
when participants did this task
in English versus Spanish?
The subjects who did it
in their native English
gambled only 54% of the time,
whereas subjects who did it in Spanish
gambled 71% of the time.
This finding was consistent
with the five other experiments
reported in the paper,
testing different forms of risk-taking
in different bilingual languages.
And they led Kesar and company
to conclude that
a foreign language provides
greater cognitive and emotional distance
than a native tongue.
And this distance allows people
to do a more objective analysis
of information during decision-making.
This distancing mechanism
has fascinating philosophical implications.
Consider this classic ethical question.
If you could throw a switch
to divert a trolley car
from one track
where it would kill five people
to a side track
where it would kill only one person,
would you pull that lever?
Now, suppose I asked you
that same question
in a foreign language.
Assuming you understood the question,
do you think your answer
would be any different?
Turns out it may be.
Albert Costa and his colleagues
asked a variation of this question
in a 2014 experiment
on various types of bilinguals,
including English-Spanish
in the United States,
Korean-English in Korea,
English-French in France,
and English-Hebrew in Israel.
Replicating previous research,
subjects in all languages
across the board
were much less likely
to choose the utilitarian option
of pulling the lever,
which from a purely rational
and objective point of view
saves the most lives.
But interestingly,
people were particularly reluctant
when doing the task
in their native languages.
Only 20% said
they'd pull the lever.
But they were much bolder
when doing the task
in a second language.
On average,
they were over 50% more likely
to flip the switch.
These findings further suggest
that using a foreign language
helps to cognitively distance people
from emotionally charged issues.
And in case you think
these laboratory findings
are just too far away
from real life,
it's worth pointing out
that psychotherapists
have long noted
that their bilingual patients
often work through
hard emotional problems
better in their non-native language
than their native one.
I've even heard
of a few case studies
reporting that auditory hallucinations
in a bilingual schizophrenic
second language
are less scary
and intimidating
than ones in their first language.
Let's switch gears a bit.
If learning multiple languages
gives people access
to two different worlds,
could exposure
to more than one language
enhance certain social abilities
in multilinguals?
For example,
take perspective taking.
As a monolingual child,
I grew up with
a uniform linguistic common ground.
Everyone I knew
spoke the same language
and that led me to believe
that we all shared
something major in common.
Growing up with multiple languages
is different.
Having linguistic variety
may cause children
to work harder
to keep track
of what is mutually known
and relevant
at any given time.
The cognitive science team
of Dan Sperber
and Deidre Wilson
theorized that
this mechanism of relevance
is the key to success
in all social communication.
When you're exposed
to one language,
one major type
of common ground
is relevant.
But when you're exposed
to multiple ones,
relevance is much more fluid.
Zoe Lieberman
and Catherine Kinsler
and their colleagues
have explored these issues
with children and infants.
For example,
in one 2015 experiment,
four to six-year-olds
growing up
with just one language
were compared to children
exposed to multiple languages
in a game
that required
social perspective taking.
The game involved
an adult speaking
about some objects
that the adult
and the child
could mutually see
and some other objects
that only the child
could see.
If children were considering
the perspective
of the adult speaker,
they should tune out
information
that only they could see.
That's where
common ground was absent.
But they should perk up
when communication
shifted to objects
that they could both see
where common ground
was present.
So, for example,
if there were two bananas
in front of the child
and the adult could see
only one of them
but not the others,
the child should look
at the banana
that both the child
and the adult could see
but not the one
only the child could see.
That make sense?
The main finding
was that monolinguals
looked at the two objects
equally,
whereas children exposed
to a second language
looked primarily
at the object
that both could see,
suggesting a greater sensitivity
to the adult's perspective.
Interestingly,
it didn't matter
if those successful children
were proficient
in their second language.
True bilinguals
were no better
than monolinguals
merely exposed
to multiple languages
from like a family member
or a nanny.
This suggests
that simply being around
multiple languages
gives children
the pragmatic insight
that not everyone
linguistically knows
what they know.
The research team
has gone on
to replicate
this basic finding
in 14 to 17-month-olds,
so this boost
to perspective-taking
really starts
very early in life.
Could it be
that both sets
of findings
are explained
by the basic mechanism
of executive function?
If that were the case,
you would expect
that the more
a monolingual child
was exposed
to a second language,
the more practice
they'd have
suppressing
their own language.
Someone like Bialystok
might say
that this linguistic suppression
would spill over
into suppressing
one's own perspective
to consider
the perspective
of others.
However,
the data
from both experiments
suggest a different mechanism.
First,
tests of executive
functioning
showed that
while 4- to 6-year-old
bilinguals
scored higher
than monolinguals
merely exposed
to a second language,
there were no differences
in their performance
on the perspective-taking task.
Both were equally good,
and both were better
than monolinguals
were not exposed
to any second language.
And second,
for the infants
exposed to a foreign language,
there was no correlation
between amount of exposure
and ability
to successfully
take the perspective
of the adult.
So it seems
that even just
minimal exposure
to a second language
is enough
to spark the insight
that you can't
always assume
that others share
the same common ground
as you do.
Now,
let's switch
from perspective-taking
to group affinity.
If language creates
different worlds,
how does living
in each of those worlds
affect the perception
of others
who do and don't
also live in those worlds?
Have you ever heard
of the Implicit Association Test,
or IAT?
It was created
by Anthony Greenwald
and colleagues
in 1998
to investigate
automatic associations
between various types
of stimuli.
For example,
one version of the test
requires people
to make judgments
about faces
after very brief
presentations of a word.
If the words
match the stereotype
of the faces,
people are faster
to process the faces,
but if they mismatch,
people are slower.
In this way,
speed of performing
this task
reflects the extent
to which people
have different stereotypes
of the faces.
Okay,
in 2010,
there were a couple
of published papers
that investigated
whether bilinguals
have different associations
for stimuli
depending on what language
is most active
in their minds.
For example,
the Harvard psychologist
Mazarin Banaji
explored how Moroccans,
fluent in French
and Arabic,
perform the IAT
in both of their languages.
In the experiment,
participants were asked
to do two concurrent tasks
at a computer.
The first task
was to press one button
when they read
a common French proper name
and a different button
when they read
a common Arabic proper name.
And the second task,
and this is the key part,
the second task
was to press one button
for positive words,
joy and paradise,
and a different button
for negative words,
sad and terrible.
In half the trials,
the same buttons
were used for positive words
and French names,
but in the other half,
positive words
had the same button
as Arabic names.
In this way,
the experiment manipulated
the implicit association
between names and words.
The idea was that
if people have
a positive association
to, let's say,
French names,
they would be faster
to identify French names
when it used
the same button
as identifying
positive words,
but they should be slower
when it used
the same button
as the negative words.
This is basic priming.
Does that make sense?
Here's the main finding.
When bilinguals
performed the task
in Arabic,
they made more
positive associations
with Arabic names
than French names.
But when the same bilinguals
performed the task
in French,
those associations
disappeared.
It's not clear
why the effects
held only when doing
the task in Arabic,
but it could be
that the associations
are weaker in French
because it's not
the official language
of Morocco.
Banaji interprets
these findings
by making an interesting
connection to Wittgenstein.
I quote,
In this sense,
speaking a language
is a form of cultural
and linguistic affiliation.
As Wittgenstein
famously asserted,
a language
is a form of life.
The present experiments
support this claim
by demonstrating
that language
gives life
to social entities
by influencing
evaluations of groups.
It's not clear
if Wittgenstein
meant what he said
in precisely this way,
but Banaji
captures his general gist.
Language is not
an abstract process
that can be detached
from its social use.
People infuse languages
with social values,
and these are just
as much part of
any utterance
as grammar
and vocabulary.
So where are we
with all this?
Moving past Worf,
it appears that
speaking more than one language
has consequences
beyond specific
linguistic structures.
Having multiple languages,
any languages,
opens up different
emotional, cognitive,
and social worlds.
An experience
with these different worlds
may help the mind
fluidly travel
back and forth
between them.
In the final lecture,
we'll explore
this effect of language
at the highest
possible level.
What sort of world
is opened up
for our species
just by virtue
of having language?
In other words,
how does capital L
language allow
human beings
to be human?
In other words,
how does capital L
language allow human beings
