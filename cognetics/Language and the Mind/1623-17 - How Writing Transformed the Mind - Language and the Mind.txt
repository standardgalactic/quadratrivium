The scientific study of language has changed considerably over the last century.
Early on, there was a relatively narrow focus on speech as the primary form of language
and monolingual monologues as the main model of study.
Now, there's nothing wrong with such a tight focus.
It can be very productive to carve out and thoroughly explore a niche.
However, over the last several decades, our understanding of language and the mind
has benefited tremendously from taking a much broader perspective.
In this course, I've tried to capture this more holistic view.
I've tried to present language as a complex system that transcends speech
and one that goes beyond just solo speakers and a single language.
In this next set of four lectures, I want to dive deeper into these different areas
to celebrate language and all its forms.
To introduce the first form, let's go back to where we left off last time.
I asked you to think about a technology that's changed brains, elevated minds, and transformed civilizations.
By now, you've probably already figured out that the technology in question is the written word.
In this lecture, you'll learn that even though our brains are not specifically designed for this technology at birth,
prolonged and explicit exposure to it can repurpose parts of the brain intended for other things.
And in the end, these cobbled together parts combine to create a neural network
that eventually becomes dedicated to reading and writing in our mature brains.
But first things first, is writing really a technology?
I mean, it's obvious that airplanes and computers and clocks are technology, but writing?
Well, why not writing?
Writing is an external tool created by humans to solve a specific problem.
Isn't that what a technology is?
The problem to be solved is how to record what's in our heads and preserve it across space and over time.
Speech is local and fleeting, but writing travels and lives on.
This technology has revolutionized how humans communicate with one another.
Never before could people from the past or from distant lands
articulate their thoughts with such clarity and precision
and then share them with so many other people.
That changed everything.
Most scholars trace the invention of writing independently back to at least two different civilizations.
Mesopotamia and Egypt.
The Sumerians of Mesopotamia are often credited with being the first writers.
This is based on intact archaeological evidence of symbols inscribed into clay tablets
dating back to about 3400 BC.
And here's something to give you a sense of just how relatively recent that is.
Some of the earliest and best preserved examples of these tablets are inscribed
with written records of beer rations for Sumerian workers.
To appreciate just how recent writing is,
here's a nice analogy from the linguist John McWhorter.
Remember, if humanity has existed for 24 hours,
writing came about at 11.07 p.m.
That's pretty close to midnight.
For the first five millennia,
writing was restricted to only a minority of individuals,
elite individuals scattered around the world.
It wasn't until Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the printing press in 1439
that the written word started to get much more accessible to the masses.
But that's actually nothing compared to what's happened with literacy in the last 70 years.
Data from UNESCO shows that in 1950,
the world literacy rate was 56%.
But in 2016, it was up to 86%.
That's incredible progress over a relatively short period of time.
And the quantity of writing per individual has gone way up.
Between the internet, social media, and texting,
people are reading and writing more than ever.
And texting has given birth to an even newer form of writing.
In 2015, the Oxford Dictionary named
the emoji depicting a face with tears of joy
as its word of the year.
Before our very eyes,
people are getting quite skilled with this evolving form of communication.
Ever heard of the Chinese artist Xu Bing?
His 128-page novel, entitled Book from the Ground,
was published in 2013 as the first original tale
to be told entirely in emoji.
Okay, let's back it up.
Let's focus on good old-fashioned reading and writing.
And let's talk about how this technology has rewired our brains.
Do you remember when we discussed
how the fusiform face area isn't really a face area per se,
but more of an expertise area?
That example showed us something
that clearly looks like an innately specified brain structure
is different.
It's actually a product of general genetic mechanisms
interacting with specific experience over development.
Well, reading and writing tell the same story.
There are two main parts of the story,
and both of them take place in familiar brain regions.
The first part of the story, coincidentally,
involves the homologue to the fusiform face area.
Here's what I mean by homologue.
If you recall, the FFA is located in the fusiform gyrus,
which spans the ventral part of the occipital and temporal lobes.
It's a bilateral structure,
which means it traverses both the left and right hemispheres.
In the case of face processing,
the FFA is right lateralized,
which means that the right hemisphere does most of the work.
This should make sense,
given what we know about the right hemisphere
being more specialized for global and holistic processing.
So what's going on in the corresponding hemisphere
in the left side of the brain?
Stanislaus Dehane has dubbed that region
the visual word form area.
And from its name,
you can tell that it's specialized
for processing written words.
Let me just take a moment to clarify
what is and what is not meant
by these homologues being specialized
for different things.
Both hemispheres are still involved
in processing faces and words.
It's just that the two sides approach them differently.
And because faces benefit
from a more global and holistic approach,
the right hemisphere does more of the work.
And because written words benefit
from a more sequential and componential approach,
the left hemisphere does more of the work.
By now, this sort of neural distribution of labor
should be familiar to you.
But here's an analogy to drive it home.
Imagine a boxer facing two different opponents.
One is known for speed, the other for power.
The best boxers would use all their skills
for both opponents,
but they'd focus on a subset of those skills
for one opponent and a different subset for the other.
The visual brain does the same thing.
Depending on the stimulus it's up against,
it engages the whole visual system
while emphasizing specific parts
that are best suited for the job.
That's why the FFA works harder for faces
and the visual word form area works harder for words.
Make sense?
Okay, back to our story.
In addition to the left lateralized visual word form area,
the second part of the reading network
also takes us to familiar territory,
the ventral and dorsal route for language processing.
When children are learning to read English, for example,
they spend a lot of time
trying to sound out the letters of words.
We know this from brain damage and neuroimaging studies
that this overt sounding out during reading,
it activates phonological mechanisms
running up and down the dorsal string.
And even after children stop overtly reading aloud,
they continue to covertly simulate this production
in the same region.
So here's how the two parts of the network
get established in adult brains.
Bradley Schlager of Washington University
and Bruce McAndalus of Stanford
explain that through massive repetition
and neuroplasticity,
this sounding out process
gradually helps the ventral and dorsal streams
of speech processing
connect up with the visual word form area.
Of course, other areas are getting involved,
but even the simplified model makes the main point.
The neural network becomes established
at different times for different people,
but nobody comes into the world with such a network.
It's not innate,
and it requires experience with written objects to shape it.
In this way, our reading brain
is truly a technological transformation.
Now, even though this neural network for reading
is not innate and must be built over time,
that's not to say there are no genetic components.
One big reason why we know that reading
is partly genetic is dyslexia.
Dyslexia is common
and is thought to affect at least 3%
of the world's population.
It's a very specific disorder
that appears unrelated to overall intelligence.
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
define dyslexia as
difficulty with phonological processing,
spelling, and or rapid visual-verbal responding.
Putting aside spelling,
note the two familiar pieces,
sounding out words
and visually mapping letters to sounds.
That's our reading network.
The heritability of dyslexia
is estimated to be around 60%.
What this means is that
in the entire population of readers,
60% of the variance
in the phenotype of dyslexia,
in the behavioral manifestations of dyslexia,
60% of that can be explained
by variation in genes across individuals.
Let's use a more concrete example
to try to understand this better.
In industrialized countries,
physical height is about 80% heritable.
What that means is that
only 20% of the variability in height
is caused by variability in things
other than genes,
like the environment.
Does this mean that the environment
has minimal impact on height?
No, it doesn't.
Here's why.
Because nutritious food
is relatively plentiful
in industrialized countries,
there's not much variation
in nutrition levels to begin with.
It's pretty constant across people.
In that way,
the environmental stability
helps the genes
to fully express themselves.
But let's say
there's a global climate disaster
and there's a major food shortage
lasting for decades.
And suppose that
only relatively wealthy people
could afford to eat nutritious foods.
In this dark scenario,
the heritability of height
would go way down
because there'd be
much more variation
in access to healthy food
than there was before.
Sadly,
this is actually a reality
in the world today.
It's why the heritability of height
is lower in some
less fortunate countries
that have highly variable access to food.
What this means
is that the genes for height
across countries
are probably more similar
than we think.
But because the food environment
is so uneven,
the genes can't live up
to their potential everywhere.
So,
assuming a relatively stable
and shared environment,
you can see
a strong genetic contribution
to things like height
and dyslexia.
But what does that really mean?
Strong genetic contribution.
Does it mean
that there are specific
gene networks in place
that are adapted
specifically for reading?
Again,
not quite.
By now,
you should know
that for complex behaviors
like dyslexia,
genetic mechanisms
are almost always designed
for more general purpose functions.
Let's come back to height.
Suppose we discovered
that being good at basketball
was 80% heritable.
Would you want to conclude
that there are genes
specifically designed
for playing basketball?
Of course not.
Just like we don't have
specific genes
for making arrows,
we don't have specific genes
designed for complex things
like basketball.
Now,
there are genes
for more basic things
like height
or hand-eye coordination
or muscle mass,
and these things
are definitely heritable
to some extent.
But they're not
evolutionarily designed
for basketball.
They simply get co-opted
for it.
This is how we think
dyslexia works too.
There are genes
for motor control
and visual processing abilities,
and genes for linking up
those two systems.
When confronted
with the technology
of the written word,
the brain does its best
to wire up
the reading system.
But in the case
of dyslexia,
there's some genetic malfunction
with parts of that network.
But again,
this doesn't mean
there are genes
for dyslexia,
just genes that get co-opted
for the system.
Most of the dyslexia
gene candidates
are involved
in prenatal
cell neural migration.
We've talked about that.
That's where there are
genetic plans
for what cells
go to which places
in the brain.
This means that
signs of the disorder
should be identifiable
at birth.
I was lucky enough
to be part of some research
exploring those
early precursors,
and I want to share
that experience
because it's just
so interesting.
After I received
my PhD in developmental
psychology
from the University of Chicago,
I wanted to learn
more about the brain
because most of my
graduate training
had focused on
the psychological
and social levels
of analysis.
In particular,
I really wanted
to learn more
about ERPs
because they would
allow me to answer
questions about
the timing of the brain's
processing of language.
This led me
to a postdoctoral
research position
at the University
of Louisville
to work with
one of the world's
leading experts
on brain
and language development,
Dr. Dennis Molfes.
Dennis had published
some amazing work
on how newborn brain waves
could predict dyslexia
later in life,
and my job
was to follow up
on that promising finding.
Basically,
the study involved
going to the neonatal unit
at the University
of Louisville Hospital
and playing audio recordings
of English phonemes
to newborns
in their cribs.
While they listened
to the phonemes,
we had them hooked up
to our baby ERP nets.
That's 128 electrodes
on an object
roughly the size
of a large grapefruit.
It's quite a sight to see.
Dennis' past work
showed that
after just 20 minutes
of ERP testing,
it was possible
to tell
if newborns
had problems
perceiving the difference
between the phonemes.
So, for example,
their brain waves
would not distinguish
BA from GA.
That's pretty interesting
by itself,
but here's
the really cool thing.
These neural profiles
of phoneme processing
at one or two days of age
could be used
with 85% accuracy
to predict
the children
who would develop
reading disorders
like dyslexia
a full eight years later.
That's amazing.
And by the way,
that number
is now up
to nearly 99% accuracy.
Finding such
early neural predictors
of dyslexia
strongly suggests
a genetic mechanism
for reading.
Of course,
the prenatal environment,
through diet
and lifestyle
of the mother,
that also plays
an important role.
And these environmental
variations may trigger
genes in the child.
The hope in doing
this work
is that spotting
these predispositions
so early,
it may be possible
to redirect development
to get it back
on the right track.
The idea is that
at-risk children
have an auditory system
that does not distinguish
sounds in a neurotypical way.
And this has consequences
later in life
of not being able
to link those sounds
to stable motor representations.
This lies dormant
for many years
and then manifests
when the child
is taught to read.
At that point,
they really struggle
to link the motor representations
to the written forms.
This is sometimes
referred to
as a breakdown
in connecting phonemes,
speech sounds,
to graphemes,
written letters.
One type of early intervention
focuses on helping
at-risk children
to correctly differentiate
speech sounds
in the first year of life.
The idea is to present
audio recordings
of exaggerated
phoneme contrast
to help induce plasticity
and establish
clearer distinctions
among the phonemes
in the native language.
This coincides
with the inference
natural babbling stage
and ultimately strengthens
the motor representations
of the native phonemes
in the dorsal stream.
Another intervention
targets older children
right when they're
starting to read.
Back when I was a postdoc
in Dennis' lab,
we had a three-month visit
from a Finnish scientist,
Dr. Heike Lutinen.
The visit was funded
by the Finnish Ministry
of Education and Culture,
and the mission
was to learn and borrow
our lab's neonatal ERP techniques
with the goal of developing
a national screening program
for dyslexia in Finland.
The visit was a success,
and it led to many innovations
in dyslexia treatment.
The intervention developed
in Finland took the form
of a simple video game
that involved reading
Finnish letters
and mapping them on
to the appropriate phonemes.
The idea is that
by repeatedly asking children
to pair graphemes
and phonemes,
it would induce plasticity
and strengthen the network
between the left fusiform area
and the dorsal production stream.
A number of experiments
by the Finnish team
have shown that
by about seven years of age,
playing this game
can nearly close
the achievement gap
between at-risk
and typically developing readers.
The program has been
so successful
that the Finnish government
has started to provide it
for use free of charge
to all Finnish children.
And the game is now exported
to over 30 different countries
to combat dyslexia
around the globe.
This is super interesting.
We've developed
a computer technology
to help us better use
a written technology.
We humans are into technology
pretty deep.
If we're going to talk
about reading in the brain,
I just can't resist mentioning
one of my favorite
little quirks of the mind.
If I were to present
a written word
printed in all black font,
a small percentage of you
would not perceive that word
as written in black.
Instead, you would see it
as a rainbow of colors
with each letter
having its own distinct hue.
This phenomenon is known
as graphene color synesthesia
and is part of a larger phenomenon
in which the brain
has unusual crosstalk
during certain sensory experiences.
This crosstalk
comes in many forms.
Some people with synesthesia
hear colors,
others smell sounds,
some feel numbers,
and a few even taste words.
Synesthesia is pretty rare
in the general population.
Conservative estimates are
that only about 1 in 2,000 people
have some version of it.
But interestingly,
there seems to be
a much higher incidence
among artists
and other creative people.
Here are a few examples.
Wittgenstein was a synesthete.
For him,
the spoken vowels
produced different colors.
Apparently,
the vowel E
was distinctly yellow.
The brilliant
and flamboyant physicist
Richard Feynman
experienced mathematical formulas
as vivid color combinations,
and he often wondered
what they looked like
to his students.
And the great singer
Stevie Wonder
has a surprising form
of synesthesia.
Amazingly,
even though Stevie Wonder
is blind,
he sees different colors
when playing different notes
on the piano.
And although not famous,
here's an even more
extraordinary example.
V.S. Ramachandran
describes a case
of a man
with face color synesthesia.
So,
various facial expressions
evoke different hues.
That's interesting by itself,
but it gets better.
The man also has
color blindness
caused by a genetic condition
that severely weakened
specific photoreceptors
in his eyes.
That means that
he can't see
certain colors
in the world.
Yet,
despite this,
he can sometimes
experience those colors,
but only when evoked
by certain facial expressions.
This raises
the fascinating question,
how can the mind
experience something
that the body's
never sensed?
I'll let you ponder
that one on your own.
One of the most
common types
of synesthesia
is the example
I gave earlier,
letters evoking colors.
Often,
these color combinations
are experienced
emotionally
or seen by the synesthet
to be beautiful
or ugly.
I once had
a wonderful student
who was very open
about her synesthesia.
She was actually
quite proud of it.
Her name was Emily,
but she didn't like
the way the colors
looked at the front end
of her name.
So, at some point
as a child,
she found that
if she added a T
to the front of E,
it completely changed
the overall color effect
and it looked
absolutely lovely to her.
From then on,
instead of Emily,
she liked to be called
Temeli,
and that's what
we called her.
So, what's going on
in the brain
that allows this sort
of thing to happen?
One well-established theory
by Ramachandran
and Hubbard
is that there are
crossed wires
in the fusiform gyrus
connecting to the
visual word form area
and also to the
nearby V4 area.
V4 is a secondary
visual cortex
specialized for
color processing.
There are clusters
of cells dedicated
to processing
every color
a person can experience.
The theory is that
in infant brains,
there are exuberant
connections
between this area
and the neighboring
visual word form area
and over typical development,
plasticity prunes them away.
But for whatever reason,
according to the theory,
this does not happen
in synesthetes
and the cross-wired
connections remain.
Other theories
downplay structural plasticity
and focus more
on functional plasticity.
Even in neurotypical brains,
there are connections
between the visual word form area
and V4
and many other areas
for that matter.
In fact,
there are many,
many silent connections
between adjacent areas
of the brain.
These are called
latent synapses.
In neurotypical brains,
high-level inhibitory mechanisms
dampen communication
along these latent synapses.
But some scientists think
that things are different
in synesthetes.
The psychologists
Peter Grossenbacher
and Christopher Loveless
argue that a synesthete's
inhibitory mechanisms
are weakened.
And this is why
there's cross-talk
between adjacent areas.
Some compelling evidence
to support this
is that hallucinogenic drugs
such as LSD
decrease inhibitory mechanisms
in the brain,
which can induce
massive synesthetic experience.
The logic is that
because these drug effects
come on so fast,
it would be impossible
that new neural connections
are created on the spot.
Now, one problem
with both of these theories
is that they can't really
explain synesthesia
involving links
between non-adjacent
brain areas.
For example,
some people experience
certain words
with particular smells.
And because the brain areas
responsible for both
of these senses
are so far apart,
it's hard to see
how they got linked up
in the first place.
There's some promising evidence
that some of these links
are genetic,
but researchers have not yet
been able to map
specific genetic mechanisms
onto specific types
of synesthesia.
One more cool thing
about synesthesia.
There's some evidence
that people who have
color grapheme synesthesia
can use it
to help them remember things.
I had another student
who openly shared
with the class
that she used
her color grapheme synesthesia
to help her learn new words
in a foreign language.
She said that the different colors
made the new vocabulary words
easier to encode and recall.
Given that she had already
been speaking three languages
and was working on two more,
I think she was definitely
onto something.
I could go on and on
about synesthesia,
but let me wrap up
and tie it back
to my overall message.
Both synesthesia
and dyslexia
nicely illustrate
the network property
of the brain.
While dyslexia shows
how the wiring
between typically connected regions
can be too weak,
synesthesia shows
how the wiring
between atypically connected regions
can be too strong.
And just like
typical reading development,
both show how genes
and experience
combine with plasticity
to ultimately create
neural structures
dedicated to the written word.
Once you appreciate
that writing
is a powerful tool
that really does
change brains,
it's not hard to see
how it also expands minds
and even transforms
civilizations.
In the final lectures
of the course,
we'll talk much more
about language's impact
on the mind
and culture.
But for now,
to finish up,
let me give you a taste
of where we're heading.
The written word
provides a tangible sense
of unlimited freedom,
freedom of thought
and expression.
The idea that there are words
which can be combined
to create infinite meanings
makes what is possible
much more concrete.
To explain what I mean by this,
let me share with you
one of my favorite short stories
by one of my favorite authors.
It's by the great
Jorge Luis Borges,
the boundlessly creative
20th century writer
from Buenos Aires.
The story is called
The Library of Babel.
Here's the gist.
Imagine a library
of incomprehensible scale
containing a labyrinth
of rooms
with stack upon stack
of books,
all exactly 410 pages long.
Each page contains
exactly 40 lines
and has 80 characters
per line.
And finally,
there are 25 possible characters.
22 letters
from the Roman alphabet
plus a space,
a comma,
and a period.
Now, here's the interesting thing.
The library
is composed of books
in no particular order
with every possible combination
of these 25 basic characters
and there are no duplicate copies.
Even without duplicates,
that's more books
than our brains can fathom.
But if you want to try,
here you go.
Picture the number 2
followed by 1.8 million zeros.
Just to give you some perspective,
here's the estimated number
of atoms in the known universe.
Picture the number 1
followed by 80 zeros.
That means for every atom
in the real universe,
there are over 22,000 books
in the imaginary library.
Even if this number
is impossible
to get your head around,
I bet you can quickly figure out
that most books
will be filled
with utter gibberish
like pages and pages
of random letters
and meaningless punctuation.
It's actually fun
to picture one book
filled entirely with commas
or the nearly identical book
with all commas
but punctuated
by a single period.
Of course,
occasionally,
you might stumble
onto something
much more interesting
like a recipe
for the perfect gin and tonic
or a passage
from the Quran
or an uncanny description
of what you are
currently wearing.
This also means
that there are
some true gems
to discover
like the story
of your life
up to the present moment
or the story
of your life
from that moment forward.
The possibilities
are virtually limitless.
The genius of Borges
in creating
this fantastical place
is that it makes concrete
the idea
that the right words
are out in the world
just waiting
to be discovered.
It's all there.
It's all possible.
Think about it.
Amongst all the gobbledygook,
there exists
a complete text
beyond our wildest imaginations
that beautifully describes
how humans can live
in peace and harmony
someday.
That absolutely blows my mind.
And here's
the really weird thing.
The library actually
does exist
in a sense.
It exists
in the potential
of language.
The truth is out there.
We just need
to put it into words.
Now that's
a powerful technology.
