Language is the ultimate human invention, the tool that makes all other tools.
But what gives the human mind the ability to use language?
Where did it come from and how did it develop both in our species as a whole
and within each one of us as individuals?
I'm Spencer Kelly, Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Colgate University.
And I invite you to explore these questions in my 24 lecture course, Language and the Mind.
We'll survey a broad range of findings from linguistics, psychology and neuroscience
to discover how language and the mind emerge from a synergy of our genes, our brains and bodies and our environment.
Plus, we'll see how embodied elements like gesture may have given rise to language in the first place.
And we'll move beyond the study of individual languages by considering bilingualism and multilingualism,
as well as other forms of language, including sign language and writing.
Join me and learn more about this unique ability, not just what it is, but also how it defines us as human beings.
