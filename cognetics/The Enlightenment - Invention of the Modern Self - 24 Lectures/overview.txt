Processing Overview for The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures
============================
Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L01 - Changing Idea of the Self.txt
1. **John Donne's "No Man Is An Island":** John Donne, a poet and cleric, reflects on the theme that individuals are interconnected, much like the phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes. In modern times, individualism has led to people seeing themselves as separate entities, each potentially a new phoenix.

2. **The Threat to Traditional Worldviews:** Donne acknowledges that traditional views on life and belief are under significant challenge in the contemporary world, and he cannot simply dismiss these changes by relying on outdated certainties.

3. **Individualism as a Double-Edged Sword:** The course will explore how thinkers have approached individualism, aiming to transform it from a potentially negative condition into something positive.

4. **Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and Human Nature:** The play presents Hamlet as a complex character with an inner mystery that resists external manipulation, suggesting the existence of an inner core that is both crucial and enigmatic.

5. **Mimesis vs. Expression in Art:** Hamlet exemplifies the tension between two artistic theories: the traditional mimetic view, which sees art as a reflection of objective reality, and the emerging expressive view, which sees art as a means to express a personal vision of life.

6. **Hamlet's Uncertainty and Isolation:** Hamlet struggles with making his words and actions align, reflecting his own frustration with the inability to fit into a coherent worldview. His skepticism about religion and death underscores the play's themes of uncertainty and isolation.

7. **The Shifts in Worldviews and Religion:** The lecture sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how the traditional religious worldview was challenged and contested during the 17th century, and how thinkers attempted to defend or reinterpret it.

8. **Secular Responses to Religious Doubts:** In the next lectures, we will examine secular responses to these shifts, as writers sought new ways to address existential questions and grapple with the implications of modern individualism.

1. Blaise Pascal's view of nature and humanity is pessimistic; he believes that due to original sin, our inherent nature as humans is corrupted, leading to selfishness, jealousy, and treachery.

2. According to Pascal, the self or "moi" is fundamentally flawed—it is unjust in its self-centeredness and uncomfortable for others, as it desires to dominate them.

3. Pascal argues that any philosophy or religion that makes us feel good about ourselves is misguided because our nature is inherently negative.

4. He emphasizes that only Christianity offers a solution to this inherent human hatefulness by acknowledging and embracing the concept of a God who suffers, as seen in the crucifixion.

5. Pascal's God is "hidden from knowledge," a "deus absconditus," reflecting humanity's distance from divine presence—a stark contrast to the more immediate relationship with God in the Garden of Eden.

6. The modern scientific worldview, which includes an infinite and silent universe, as described by Pascal, can lead to existential dread.

7. Pascal's solution to human unhappiness is a radical act of faith—a leap into acceptance of Christianity despite the despair it initially evokes.

8. Pascal's ideas stand in stark contrast to the emerging Enlightenment philosophy that would later gain prominence, advocating for optimism about human nature and finding value in the natural world and the self.

9. Voltaire, among other Enlightenment thinkers, critiqued Pascal's pessimistic and theologically focused approach, setting the stage for a philosophical debate that would continue to evolve through the centuries.

 In this lecture, Professor Bloom continues his exploration of the theme of power in 17th century literature by examining John Dunn's "The Character and Reign of King Charles the Second." Unlike Thomas Hobbes, who peered behind the scenes into the private life of Charles II, including his interactions with his wife and mistresses, Dunn focuses on the public image of the king.

Dunn illustrates how Charles II had to be constantly vigilant about his public persona due to the potential threats from those who could use any perceived weakness or personal preference against him. The king's face, according to Dunn, often betrayed secrets to those who knew how to read it, revealing a man who was meticulously controlling his expressions to maintain power and avoid being compromised by those who might exploit his personal feelings or desires.

The lecture emphasizes that even in relationships where one might expect freedom, such as with mistresses, the king was actually more constrained because any sign of displeasure could lead to loss of power. Thus, he had to feign greater affection and happiness than he genuinely felt to keep his partners from turning into potential enemies after a breakup.

Professor Bloom also reflects on the nature of biography and the limitations of 17th-century approaches to understanding individual personality. He notes that while specific details about an individual's life, like Charles II's singing habits or his interactions with his wife, can provide insights into his character, a comprehensive understanding of inner life was not yet possible in this era.

The lecture concludes by highlighting the importance of the novel as a literary form for capturing the nuances of an individual's inner life, which is something that both drama and earlier forms of biography could not adequately achieve. This sets the stage for the next lecture, where Professor Bloom will discuss "La Planceste de Cleves" by Madame de Lafayette, one of the earliest novels and a seminal work in the development of the psychological novel.

In summary, the lecture underscores the idea that power dynamics, especially as they relate to personal relationships and public personas, were central concerns in 17th-century literature. It also prepares the audience for a deeper dive into the psychological complexities presented in early novels, which offer a more nuanced view of individual character than biography or drama alone can provide.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L04 - Lafayette - La Princesse de Clèves I.txt
 In Balzac's "The Unknown Masterpiece," the protagonist, a painter, strives to create a work that will demonstrate his talent, which he has yet to realize or prove. His wife supports him and believes in his genius, even as they live in poverty. The novel's central theme revolves around the nature of love, creativity, and the complexities of human emotions.

In "The Mistress of the Arthur Gasté," we explore similar themes through the characters of the Princess de Cleve and Monsieur de Nemours. The Princess is in a seemingly happy and stable marriage but feels a bond with Nemours, who is attracted to her but uncertain about her feelings. The novel delves into the emotional complexities that arise when honesty and trust are put to the test.

The Princess, recognizing her feelings for Nemours, tells him that if she were to fall in love with someone else, she would tell him the truth. Nemours, upon hearing this, becomes obsessively jealous and suspicious of any potential infidelity. When he discovers an opportunity to take the Princess's portrait without her knowledge, he does so, believing it will reveal whether she loves him. The act is symbolic and intensifies their secretive connection, as both are aware that such a gesture could be interpreted as an affront to her marital status.

The incident with the portrait heightens the tension between Nemours and the Princess, who must navigate the precarious balance of her emotions, loyalty to her husband, and the fear of being hurt by love. The story illustrates the destructive potential of jealousy and the complexities of human relationships within the rigid social structure of the court.

In the next lecture, we will explore how the plot unfolds, leading to a resolution that addresses the themes of desire, jealousy, and the consequences of love as depicted in the novel.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L05 - Lafayette - La Princesse de Clèves II.txt
 The "Preciosa" section of Madame de Lafayette's novel "The Princess de Cleves" explores themes of passion, love, and the complexities of the human heart within the rigid social structure of the French aristocracy during the 17th century. Unlike later views on love that emphasize companionship and sexual enjoyment, Lafayette presents a stark view where love is a form of imprisonment, a power struggle between men and women. The heroine, the Princess de Cleves, ultimately chooses to retreat from court life to a convent, rejecting the conventional plots of romance and marriage for an independent self-understanding that remains negative and incomplete by modern standards.

The novel raises questions about the nature of self-knowledge and the acceptance of a solitary life without love. It provides a deep analysis of passion's impact on individuals but lacks the exploration of individual complexity and evolving personality that would later become central to literature and psychology. Additionally, the absence of female perspectives in the enlightenment and their marginalization in literary history is notable, as women writers were not at the center of the intellectual currents of the time.

As we move forward in this course, we will see a shift from the aristocratic world to the middle class, and from anonymity to the recognition of women's voices in literature. The cultural and literary landscape will change significantly as we progress through the 18th century and into the 19th, with female writers becoming more prominent and central to the narrative of intellectual and literary history.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L06 - British Empiricism and the Self I.txt
 In this lecture, we explored the limitations and shortcomings of empiricist psychology, particularly focusing on the works and struggles of Samuel Johnson, who was a deeply troubled individual despite adhering to John Locke's empiricist philosophy of the mind. Johnson's own experiences with obsessive thoughts and anxiety about his mental state led him to question the idea of a normative state of sanity that empiricism presumed. He argued that no human mind is ever entirely in its right state, as our imagination often overpowers our reason, and we cannot always regulate our attention or call our ideas at will.

Johnson's perspective challenges the notion that there is a baseline of mental health from which deviations are abnormalities. Instead, he suggests that because everyone has unwanted thoughts or daydreams, to some extent, we are all somewhat "crazy." Johnson's views on the human mind were quite advanced for his time, as they acknowledged the pervasive and sometimes disruptive nature of our inner lives.

Despite the empowering aspects of empiricism in its own time, it is clear with historical hindsight that this approach had its limitations, particularly in understanding the complexities of the human mind and the social context of the self. In the next lecture, we will examine how David Hume attempted to address some of these issues by providing a more nuanced account of the self within societal frameworks.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L07 - British Empiricism and the Self II.txt
 In this summary, we discuss the limitations of Enlightenment thinkers like David Hume in addressing the complexities of human psychology and emotions, particularly when compared to the insights of later psychological theories. Alexander Pope, an 18th-century English poet, is highlighted as a figure who grappled with these inner conflicts and the inadequacy of empiricist philosophy to explain them.

Pope's work often reflects the intricate and mysterious nature of human behavior, which he found to be beyond the reach of rational explanation alone. His poem "An Essay on Man" and other writings reveal his belief that while reason can analyze human actions, it cannot fully capture the essence of what it means to be human. Pope's use of the heroic couplet form in his poetry serves as a testament to our attempt to impose order and structure on chaotic inner experiences.

The passage from Pope's work emphasizes that our motivations are complex and not always accessible even to ourselves, with our internal mechanisms operating in ways we cannot fully understand or control. The dream state is used as a metaphor for the unpredictable and enigmatic nature of human thought processes. While Hume found comfort in skepticism and focused on the empirical aspects of human experience, Pope's introspective reflections underscore the profound emotional and psychological challenges that many individuals face.

The contrast between Hume's more detached and rational approach to life and Pope's deep engagement with the tumultuous inner world illustrates the broader limitations of Enlightenment thought in addressing the full spectrum of human experience. Later developments in psychology would offer more nuanced insights into these issues, but at the time, poets like Pope were left to grapple with these complexities using the language and tools available to them.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L08 - Voltaire - Candide.txt
 In this lecture, Professor Johnson discusses Voltaire's novel "Candide" and its exploration of the theme of cultivating one's garden as a metaphor for personal contentment and the limitations of utopian ideals. The novel follows the journey of the protagonist, Khandid (Candide), through various settings, each representing different philosophical perspectives on life and happiness.

The first garden in the story is Westphalia, where Khandid and his beloved Kunigan live in simplicity until they are separated by war. The second garden is El Dorado in South America, a place of abundant gold where people live in contented ignorance. However, Khandid finds this utopia too passive and eventually returns to Europe.

The third and final garden is a commune in Turkey, where Khandid and his companions attempt to live outside the influence of politics and history. They are inspired by an old man who is indifferent to worldly news and focuses on cultivating his garden. This lifestyle leads to the famous phrase from the novel, "Il faut cultiver notre jardin" (We must tend to our garden), which emphasizes the importance of engaging in meaningful work and finding contentment in the present.

Throughout the novel, Voltaire critiques the idea that everything happens for the best, as exemplified by the character Pangloss. Instead, Voltaire suggests that individuals should focus on their immediate surroundings and actions rather than seeking grand narratives or external sources of meaning. The novel concludes with a diverse group of people living together in harmony, rejecting the aristocracy and institutional religion, and finding their roles within this communal garden.

The lesson from "Candide" is that true love doesn't necessarily lead to happiness, and that personal contentment can be found through the act of cultivating one's own space, whether it be a literal garden or metaphorically in one's actions and attitudes towards life. This reflects the broader Enlightenment philosophy of focusing on tangible, practical improvements rather than abstract psychological problems. In the next lecture, Professor Johnson will explore how this empiricist approach to understanding human behavior is further reflected in biographical works.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L09 - Boswell - The London Journal I.txt
1. **The True Language of the Heart**: In this lecture, we explore James Boswell's psychological experience as he grapples with his true inclinations versus societal expectations. Boswell, who was destined by his father to pursue a career in law, finds himself deeply drawn to the military life. He experiences an intense moment of ecstasy upon hearing the drums of guards, which confirms his desire to join the army, despite it being at odds with his familial obligations.

2. **Narcissism and Self-Image**: Boswell's actions can be interpreted through the lens of narcissism. As a person with an insecure self-image, he constantly seeks validation from others to affirm his worth. His purchase of an expensive sword and the subsequent interaction with the sword cutler, Mr. Jeffries, serve as a reflection of his desired social status and demonstrate his need for external acknowledgment of his honorable standing.

3. **Role Playing**: Boswell is deeply engaged in role playing throughout his life. He stages interactions to confirm his place in society and to reassure himself of his identity as a gentleman. His desire to be seen as a man of civility and honor is evident in his account of the sword purchase, where he carefully crafts the situation to validate his self-image.

4. **Mental Illness**: The threat of mental illness looms over Boswell's life, a concern that was hereditary according to his understanding. He constantly tries to reassure himself that he will not succumb to insanity, as it was perceived at the time. This underlying fear is something Boswell is anxious to keep out of his journal but is always present in his thoughts.

5. **Authenticity**: The question of whether one can ever be authentic or if roles are all that individuals play is raised. Boswell's attempts to live up to certain societal expectations and his own self-image suggest that the concept of an "authentic self" might be elusive, and that our personas could be nothing more than elaborate acts.

6. **Sincerity as an Illusion**: The notion that sincerity may be an illusion for those who are taken in by their own acts is introduced. This perspective suggests that Boswell's quest to understand his true desires and his efforts to live up to them might be nothing more than a sophisticated form of self-deception.

In the next lecture, we will delve deeper into these themes and further explore Boswell's life and writings, particularly how he navigates the fine line between role playing and authenticity, and how he deals with the shadow of mental illness that hangs over his personal narrative.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L09 - Voltaire, Johnson, Gibbon - Some Lives.txt
 In this lecture, Professor Marrinan discusses Edward Gibbon's account of his early life and sexual awakening as described in his "Autobiography." Gibbon recounts his infatuation with a minister's daughter who was learned, lively, pure, and elegant. Despite his initial desire to marry her, he eventually gave in to the reality that his father would not accept their union, leading him to yield to his fate and transform his love into friendship and esteem.

Gibbon's presentation of these events is generalized and objective, reflecting the Enlightenment's emphasis on understanding psychology through a more detached perspective. This contrasts with a modern biographer's approach, which might delve into Gibbon's background—his sickly childhood, his loneliness, and the significant influence of a kindly aunt—to provide a deeper understanding of his motivations.

Gibbon found empowerment and intellectual pleasure in his study of history, particularly in the subject of the Roman Empire and its decline and fall. His work allowed him to exert a safe, vicarious power over historical figures like Commodus, who was once powerful but is now overshadowed by Gibbon's authorial voice.

The lecture highlights how Gibbon's approach to his life story and his own psyche differs from the more subjective and penetrating ways of thinking about the self that emerged later in the 18th century. These newer approaches, which we will explore starting in the next lecture, represent a shift towards recognizing the complexity and chaos of human experience, and a suspicion of overly simplistic pattern-finding in history and psychology.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L11 - Boswell - The London Journal II.txt
1. The lecture begins with a discussion of James Boswell's struggles with hypochondria, a condition where a person is excessively concerned about their health, as documented in his diaries and "The Life of Samuel Johnson." Boswell's hypochondria is described as both physical and psychological, reflecting the mind-body problem that intrigued 18th-century empiricists.

2. The lecture notes that modern medicine has returned to a chemical imbalance theory for conditions like bipolar disorder, which Boswell also experienced. His account of hypochondria is profound, highlighting the struggle between indolence (laziness) and shame, and the exhaustion from acting against one's own inclinations out of fear of being despised.

3. Boswell found relief and a sense of self-worth through his relationship with Samuel Johnson, who enforced morality while also appreciating his playfulness and spontaneity. This dynamic allowed Boswell to feel forgiven and affirmed.

4. The lecture suggests that Boswell's narcissistic tendencies were met through his attachments to powerful figures like Johnson, and that Johnson may have been drawn to Boswell for similar reasons—allowing Johnson to engage in vicarious transgressiveness.

5. The lecture concludes with an anecdote about Richard Brinsley Sheridan and his play "The School for Scandal," which featured a character named Joseph Surface, a con man whose name plays on the idea of appearances being deceiving. This anecdote serves as a metaphor for Boswell's life, where role-playing is central to one's identity. The story also illustrates the theme that roles and personas are inherently part of human interaction, as seen through the life and work of both Boswell and Sheridan.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L12 - Diderot's Dialogues.txt
1. Simone Weil's observation that real goodness is varied and satisfying, while real evil is ugly and hateful, contrasts with our often greater fascination with imaginary evil and the stories of villains and crooks. This insight is significant for understanding our attraction to such narratives.

2. In "Jacques the Fatalist," Diderot includes stories about con men that highlight their audacity and cleverness, which can be entertaining despite the immoral nature of their acts. The narrative reflects the tension between being fascinated by these tales and the moral unease they provoke.

3. Diderot's "Paradox on the Actor" explores the idea that actors detach their personal feelings from the roles they play, learning to simulate emotions convincingly. This paradox underscores the distinction between genuine emotion and its simulation, which is a central theme in understanding the Enlightenment's approach to sensibility and art.

4. Actors, like the characters in society, often act—conning or flattering as needed. This role-playing can reveal the hollowness and inauthenticity of social interactions, yet it also represents the perfection of art when executed by a skilled performer.

5. The character of Ramo's nephew in "Jacques the Fatalist" embodies the anxiety of self-consciousness that Hegel saw as characteristic of modernity. The uncle, who can compose beautiful harmonies despite his hateful nature in real life, illustrates how the artificial truth of art can be more concrete than the elusive wisdom and truth claimed by the moi or the philosophers.

6. Diderot's work critiques the enlightened belief in reason and progress by showing that human behavior is often driven by self-interest, manipulation, and role-playing, rather than by sincere pursuit of truth and wisdom. This self-critique reflects the underlying despair within the confident public face of the Enlightenment.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L13 - Diderot - Jacques the Fatalist I.txt
1. Boswell reflects on the idea of life being random, with meaning not derived from a source but by our minds finding patterns and similarities for comfort. He notes the repetitive nature of the dualists' fights in Diderot's stories, comparing them to cartoon characters like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, which highlights their automatic behavior influenced by external stimuli rather than an inner self.

2. The recurring duels in Diderot's narratives serve as a metaphor for the broader irrational behaviors driven by societal norms, such as the spirit of chivalry that dominated Europe for centuries. Diderot suggests that understanding human behavior is better achieved by examining larger social forces and cultural contexts than by delving into individuals' psyches.

3. In the next lecture, Boswell will explore further the concept of determinism in human behavior and the idea that despite the artificiality and conventional nature of stories, they remain influential and enjoyable forms of expression. People use narratives to convey messages and influence others, as seen in Ramon's dialog with his uncle, where he adeptly manipulates the narrative flow with his captivating tales.

4. The narrator of Diderot's work engages with the audience not as a distant storyteller but as a lively, humorous character who encourages readers to see stories as performances rather than windows into the soul, reflecting Diderot's skeptical view that appreciates wit and humor. Skepticism allows one to enjoy life despite its limitations, and Diderot's work exemplifies this amused, tolerant attitude.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L14 - Diderot - Jacques the Fatalist II.txt
 In this part of the lecture, the speaker discusses the complex nature of power dynamics and self-perception during the Enlightenment era, using John Locke's "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" and the character of Jacques in Denis Diderot's work as examples. The speaker highlights the paradoxical nature of human understanding and social interactions, where individuals often find themselves in roles of dependency or domination, as illustrated by the master-servant relationship between Locke's master and Jacques.

The speaker then references Alexander Pope's clever couplet about a dog belonging to the Prince of Wales, which humorously encapsulates the notion that everyone in society is subject to someone else's authority or influence, whether explicitly contracted or not. This reflects the Enlightenment thinkers' skepticism about the authenticity of the self and the pervasive nature of social construction in human identity.

The speaker also notes the contradictory sentiments of the time: a yearning for an authentic self alongside a suspicion that society's competitive dynamics lead to exploitation rather than mutual benefit. The speaker sets the stage for exploring how these conflicting insights were resolved or advanced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was both a servant and a philosopher, and had a deep understanding of social roles and the human heart.

Rousseau's unique contributions to the Enlightenment discourse on self and society promised a new way of reconciling the individual's desire for authenticity with the socially constructed nature of identity, which would be examined in more detail in the following lecture. Rousseau's insights, shaped by his own experiences and deep reflections on human nature, offer a path to understanding how individuals might achieve a true self amidst the complex social dynamics of their time.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L15 - Rousseau - Inequality and Social Contract.txt
1. **Volonté générale (General Will)**: Jean-Jacques Rousseau introduces the concept of the "volonté générale," which represents the collective interests and decisions of all members of a society when they unite as one. It's not merely a majority vote, but a shared commitment to the common good that transcends individual desires.

2. **Critique of Representative Government**: Rousseau argues against representative government, where elected officials might make decisions that do not reflect the true will of the people, or are influenced by factors other than the public's interest.

3. **Small City-State Model**: He believes the social contract must be legitimate only if all citizens participate directly in decision-making, as seen in ancient city-states like Athens or a contemporary example like Geneva.

4. **Forced to Be Free**: Rousseau famously states that those who oppose the general will should be compelled to conform by the collective body. This controversial idea is meant to ensure that everyone is truly committed to the common good, rather than their own interests.

5. **Legitimating Chains**: Rousseau argues that if we cannot overthrow the chains of social and political obligation, we should at least strive to legitimate them through a system where each person feels they are part of a larger whole.

6. **Concerns About Individualism**: He is skeptical of individualism, which he sees as leading to selfishness and competition for personal advantage. He yearns for a sense of belonging and shared purpose within society.

7. **Influence on Modern Thought**: Rousseau's ideas set the stage for modern discussions about personal development, social conditioning, and the nature of power and governance. He also is credited with inventing the autobiographical genre, where individuals can explore their own responses to societal influences over time.

In essence, Rousseau's political philosophy is a radical call for citizens to actively engage in the collective decision-making process, ensuring that their society reflects their shared will and common interests, rather than the interests of a select few or the tyranny of the majority.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L16 - Rousseau - The Confessions I.txt
 In this part of his "Confessions," Rousseau describes an incident from his time as a servant in Turin where he took a silver ribbon belonging to Marian, a young cook, which was later missed and attributed to him after being found among his belongings. The household conducted an investigation, and under questioning, Rousseau implicated Marian, causing her distress and tears. He recounts this event to illustrate the workings of human emotions, particularly shame, which drove him to confess to a crime he did not commit.

Rousseau reflects on the incident and sees it as an example supporting his theory that our actions are often influenced by emotions like shame, which arise from the fear of being scorned or despised by others. He acknowledges that this event has haunted him for 40 years and caused him guilt and remorse.

He also touches upon the concept of memory and how associations can lead to certain recollections, as Marian's name came to mind when he was accused, leading him to incorrectly assign blame to her. Rousseau's retrospective analysis suggests that there might have been unconscious forces at play in the situation, which he could not fully comprehend or articulate using contemporary psychological theories of his time.

The Marian story is a pivotal moment in "Confessions" because it demonstrates Rousseau's deep introspection and his pioneering exploration into understanding the complexities of human behavior and the role of the unconscious mind, which would later be formalized by psychoanalysts like Sigmund Freud. Rousseau's narrative is significant not only as a personal confession but also as a foundational text in the study of self-interpretation and psychological analysis.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L17 - Rousseau - The Confessions II.txt
 Jean-Jacques Rousseau's life was marked by a profound search for authenticity and a yearning to return to a state of natural man, free from the constraints and artificialities of civilized society. This quest is particularly evident in his time spent at Les Charmettes, where he experienced moments of profound inner peace and clarity, which he idealized as a remedy for the ills of modern life.

Despite his international fame in the 1750s and 60s, Rousseau felt increasingly uncomfortable with his status as a celebrated intellectual. His success, as recounted in the "Confessions," was almost like a dream that eventually came to an abrupt end. He grew tired of the social and intellectual demands placed upon him and sought to escape back into solitude and simplicity.

Rousseau's relationship with Madame de Veyron was strained, and his loneliness at Les Charmettes was profound, often compounded by her absence and eventual infidelity. His reading during these periods was intense and led to his groundbreaking ideas on the social contract and education.

After a period of immense popularity, Rousseau consciously decided to reject public life and fame, choosing instead to live authentically according to his own terms with his companion, Thérèse Levasseur. Their life together was focused on achieving a state of 'sentiment de l'existence,' or the feeling of being present and alive in the moment, free from the pressures of societal expectations and personal ambition.

In his final years, Rousseau expressed this philosophy of living in the present in his last work, "The Reveries of the Solitary Walker," which explores the concept of finding contentment in solitude and simple pleasures. This theme of seeking authenticity and simplicity in life is a central aspect of Rousseau's thought and legacy.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L18 - Rousseau - Reveries of the Solitary Walker.txt
 Jean-Jacques Rousseau's achievements in philosophy and social thought have had a profound impact on the way we understand personality, identity, and the human condition. His ideas laid the foundation for concepts such as the divided self, identity crises, alienation, and inauthenticity that are prevalent in contemporary discussions of psychology and culture. Rousseau's critique of civilization and his emphasis on the natural self versus the socially constructed self challenge the Enlightenment's view of civilization as a progression towards rational governance and scientific advancement.

Rousseau's work "Emile" and his autobiographical "Confessions" revolutionized the way we think about childhood and personal development. He argued that education should be tailored to an individual's natural inclinations and that children should be shielded from premature socialization, which he believed could distort the natural personality.

In "Reveries of a Solitary Walker," Rousseau presents a vision of wholeness and peace, suggesting that humans can find contentment by living in harmony with their natural selves. However, this vision is counterbalanced by a negative dropout philosophy that sees society as inherently corrupting. Rousseau's solution to the ills of civilization is to advocate for personal freedom and autonomy, emphasizing that true human freedom means never doing what one doesn't want to do.

Rousseau's influence extends into modernity, shaping how we approach issues of self-realization, psychic wounds, and the pursuit of happiness in a society that has come to be known as the Therapeutic Society. His legacy is evident in our ongoing discussions about individual rights, the role of education, and the tension between personal desires and societal expectations.

In summary, Rousseau's work represents a significant departure from the rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment, offering an alternative perspective that values the inner life and natural human instincts over societal norms and structures. His ideas about individualism, self-realization, and the critique of civilized society continue to resonate and influence various aspects of contemporary culture and thought.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L19 - Franklin - Autobiography.txt
1. **Benjamin Franklin's Influence**: Franklin's autobiography, which he read as a young boy in rural Connecticut, influenced him significantly. It taught him that individual circumstances do not have absolute control over a person's mind and character.

2. **Franklin's Social Milieu**: Franklin was raised during a transitional period in Boston, where the influence of Puritanism was waning and Yankee values were emerging. His father was once part of Cotton Mather's congregation, but Franklin himself approached Mather's work from a secular perspective.

3. **Max Weber's Thesis**: Max Weber's "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism" posits a connection between certain Protestant attitudes towards work and the rise of capitalism in northern Europe. This thesis has been widely debated, but Weber makes a compelling argument for the role of these attitudes in shaping modern commercial society.

4. **Protestant Work Ethic**: Weber highlights the secularization of the calling in the Protestant tradition, where all work was seen as done in God's service. This led to the idea that diligent labor could be a sign of divine approval and that frugality was a moral virtue, even among those who became wealthy.

5. **Franklin's Contradictions**: Although Franklin espoused and promoted these values, his own life was not a simple embodiment of them. He retired early to live as a gentleman of leisure, and he refused to patent his inventions, preferring they be available for public use.

6. **Rousseau's Views**: In contrast to Franklin's ethic, Jean-Jacques Rousseau praised idleness and the "dolce farniente," advocating for a simpler life in tune with nature.

7. **Upcoming Lectures**: In future lectures, we will explore how Franklin deliberately crafted his persona and examine Adam Smith's contributions to both economics and psychology, which provide context for understanding Franklin's approach to self-improvement and discipline.

8. **Franklin's Autobiography**: Franklin's autobiography is a testament to his life achievements rather than an in-depth exploration of his inner experiences. He was reticent about personal matters, and his way of thinking about the self made it less relevant to his narrative.

9. **Franklin as a Self-Made Man**: Franklin's account of how he became a self-made man will be examined, focusing on the methods and philosophies he employed to shape both his character and his career.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L20 - Franklin and Adam Smith.txt
 The text discusses the contrast between Rousseau's and Franklin's/Smith's views on the self, as well as the broader cultural narrative that oscillates between these two perspectives. While we tend to talk about living authentically and being true to our inner selves (Rousseau), we live out the pragmatic and empiricist ideals of Franklin and Adam Smith, who emphasize rationality, cooperation, and a concern for how others perceive us.

Rousseau's struggle with guilt over falsely accusing Marion of stealing a ribbon illustrates his belief in an ideal pre-civilized state where individuals could live without the burden of social expectations. In contrast, Adam Smith argues that we should work with our socialized expectations and strive to be the kind of person a judgemental spectator would approve of.

The text highlights the tension between these two opposing views of the self: Rousseau's focus on inner authenticity versus Franklin and Smith's emphasis on societal roles and external validation. The course also previews the next two lectures, which will explore the critical perspectives of William Blake and Honoré de Balzac on the Enlightenment, delving into their skepticism about the Enlightenment's confidence in reason and progress.

 In this lecture, you discuss the themes of passion, commitment, and morality as they are explored in "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. You highlight the characters of Valmont (Merteuil's lover) and Tourville (a young woman who is initially married to the latter's husband).

Valmont, a man with cynical and self-serving views, sees an opportunity to manipulate Tourville, who is deeply religious and naive. He plans to seduce her and then abandon her, which he eventually does after using her for his own ends.

Tourville's commitment to Valmont is total and sincere, but it leads to her downfall when she learns of his betrayal. This reflects the novel's exploration of the destructive nature of passion and the complexity of human emotions.

You also reference Friedrich Nietzsche's critique of Christianity, which he viewed as a "poison" that led to the degeneration of human passions into mere vice. The 18th century was an era where there was a significant effort to redefine passion in a positive light and to separate it from power and selfishness.

The novel challenges the idea that moral actions are driven solely by good intentions, as Valmont's actions demonstrate that even seemingly virtuous acts can be motivated by self-interest and manipulation. This raises questions about the true nature of feelings and whether genuine emotions can coexist with immoral behavior.

Valmont's actions in the scene with the poor family are a prime example of this complexity, as he pretends to be moved by their plight for the sake of impressing Tourville, even though he despises them. This highlights the artificiality of emotional responses that can be engineered for specific purposes and the difficulty of distinguishing between real and fake emotions.

In summary, "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" presents a nuanced examination of the relationship between morality and emotion, showing how sincere feelings can be manipulated and how genuine affection can lead to ruin when misguided or exploited. The novel's exploration of these themes continues to provoke thought and debate in contemporary discussions on ethics and human nature.

 In this analysis, we compare two film adaptations of Choderlos de Laclos' novel "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," which explore the complex and morally ambiguous relationship between the characters Valmont and Merteuil. The first adaptation is a 1988 film directed by Stephen Frears, where Jeremy Irons plays Valmont as a nihilistic and self-serving seducer, while Lindsay Duncan portrays Merteuil as a calculating and cold-hearted woman. The film's ending clarifies that Valmont sacrifices himself to avenge the wrongs done to a young innocent, Torval, aligning with the novel's ambiguous ending, but providing a more conventional tragic conclusion. The final scene shows Merteuil's fall from grace as she is exposed and left alone, which is a powerful and memorable cinematic moment.

The second adaptation is the 1989 film "Valmont," directed by Milos Forman, with Colin Firth as Valmont and Annette Bening as Merteuil. In this version, Valmont initially comes across as a roguish Tom Jones type, and Merteuil is portrayed as a smiling tease. This adaptation diverges significantly from Laclos' original characters, with Merteuil being depicted as a cartoonish villain who heartlessly breaks Valmont's heart. In this film, Valmont dies in a duel, and the women who loved him mourn his death by placing flowers on his tombstone.

The analysis also mentions an older 1950s adaptation directed by Roger Vadim, and a modernized version titled "Cruel Intentions," set in a contemporary American prep school, which captures the cruelty and treachery of the original story effectively. The discussion highlights that while film adaptations can bring new interpretations to the characters, they may also oversimplify or alter the moral ambiguities inherent in Laclos' work. It concludes by noting that the novel's enduring complexity and depth are such that no film adaptation can fully capture its essence.

Checking The Enlightenment - Invention of the Modern Self - 24 Lectures/L23 - Blake - Songs of Innocence and of Experience.txt
 In this segment, William Blake's poem "The Tiger" is discussed as a counterpart to "The Lamb," both of which explore themes of divine power and provoke questions about the nature of god, particularly in contrast to the traditional Judeo-Christian view. "The Tiger" challenges the notion that a deity capable of creating everything, including a gentle lamb and a fierce tiger, would also choose to punish what was made. The poem raises questions about the morality of an omnipotent god who inflicts suffering, suggesting a critical reflection on the idea of divine authority as a projection of human guilt and insecurity.

Blake's work is significant because it represents a shift from the orthodox Christian narrative to a more romantic and philosophical inquiry into the nature of reality, morality, and the sources of our beliefs. Unlike the image of the tiger in the poem, which is often depicted as benign in Blake's illustrations, the themes convey a sense of awe and dread that provoke deep introspection and challenge readers to question their own belief systems.

Blake's poems "The Lamb" and "The Tiger," with their mirrored structures, reflect the romantic movement's return to broader philosophical questions, echoing the work of Enlightenment philosophers who were revisiting the ultimate questions of existence and morality, moving away from narrow epistemology. The tiger's 13 question marks within 24 lines symbolize the poem's purpose to unsettle and provoke thought rather than offer simple answers or dogmatic beliefs.

1. **William Blake and the Enlightenment**: William Blake was an English poet, painter, and printmaker who lived during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He is often associated with Romanticism due to his focus on imagination, mysticism, and a critical view of industrialization and society's structures.

2. **The Contradictions of Human Nature**: Blake believed that human beings are born free but are conditioned by society to act in specific ways through mechanisms like the "mind-forged manacles" (Songs of Experience). These societal conditions create a conflict between our natural selves and the roles we're forced into.

3. **Blake's Prophetic Books**: Blake's collection of poems, "Songs of Innocence" and "Songs of Experience," illustrate how innocence and experience can be in opposition but also how they complement each other. He uses these contrasting states to critique society and its institutions, including the family, government, religion, and the military.

4. **"The Garden of Love"**: In this poem, Blake describes a chapel where "thou shalt not" is written over the door, symbolizing how religious institutions can suppress human desires and lead to unwholesome outcomes like prostitution.

5. **Blake's Critique of Empire**: "London" is a powerful poem that responds to news articles Blake read about the slave trade and the British Empire. It criticizes the exploitation, oppression, and violence that underpin the empire's expansion.

6. **"The Proverbs of Hell"**: This section from "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" contains aphoristic statements that challenge conventional morality and encourage people to think beyond societal norms. It advocates for a more liberated and open approach to life, where "everything that lives is holy," and the limits of excess are not clear until one understands what lies beyond those limits.

7. **Blake's Legacy**: Blake's work offers a unique blend of incisive social critique and an optimistic vision of spiritual renewal. He presents the idea that within each individual lies the potential for transcendence despite the repressive forces of society.

8. **Final Thoughts**: The course emphasizes the importance of understanding Blake's work in its historical context and how it reflects the tensions between individual freedom and societal constraints, a theme still relevant today. The lectures encourage viewers to explore Blake's works further and consider their implications for our own times.
