Lecture 22, Les Liaisons d'Angereuse, Part II
In this lecture, I want to focus first on the tragic implications of what happens to
Tourvelle. She falls ill and dies in shame and despair after she learns that Valmont
has utterly used her and betrayed her. After that, I'll return to the relationship between
Valmont and Mertoy, with the questions it raises about human motives and authenticity
of behavior. And then at the end, I'll offer some comments on two fairly recent movie versions
of the story, which I think can help us to appreciate what La Claude has accomplished
with this magnificently disquieting novel. At one point in the book, Valmont very challengingly
poses a question that had troubled theorists ever since Aristotle. Why is it that we enjoy
seeing suffering acted out in the theater that would horrify us in real life? And Valmont
says, this very spectacle that you rush eagerly to see in the theater that you applaud furiously,
do you think it's less affecting in reality? Well, La Claude is implicating us too. We
know that Les Liaisons d'Angereuse is only a novel, so we're enjoying this story just
as if we were sitting in theater seats, but inside that novel it's all too horribly real
for poor Tourvelle. And by making Valmont speak in this self-satisfied way, La Claude
is forcing us to ask, what do we gain when we vicariously enter into other people's
suffering? Well, of course, stories about human suffering in those days normally took
the form known as tragedy. And in connection with La Panceste de Claude, we noted the great
prestige of the tragedies of Racine, in particular in the French literature of that time. In
England likewise, Shakespeare's tragedies were held in the highest esteem. Richardson's
novel Clarissa, the one that helped to suggest La Claude's plot, was explicitly modeled on
stage tragedy. Now, if Tourvelle's story does take the form of a tragedy, what does that
suggest about its meaning? Well, in my opinion, tragedy is not a universal form at all. In
fact, it's a very specialized one. Suffering and loss are ubiquitous, of course, but everything
depends on how we look at them. Why the events in Voltaire's Candide would be tragic if they
weren't transposed into farce. And in actuality, the kind of tragedy that Aristotle and other
theorists have written about is a very specific genre. And I think it's reached its full potential
only in a few times and places. And the two great ages of tragedy were the 5th century BC
and Athens, at a time when religious questions still seemed crucial, but the traditional answers
were breaking down. And then again in the late 16th and 17th centuries AD in England and France,
when in fact a rather similar process was taking place. Now by La Claude's time in the late 18th
century, skepticism was increasingly acceptable. And tragedy really had become an artificial
literary form. It was still admired, it was still performed, but it wasn't really alive. And La Claude
is making a very imaginative move by creating a novel in which one of the characters finds
herself living as a tragic heroine. Only now the unjust gods controlling her fate aren't
Aphrodite or Artemis, as they were in that tragedy by Euryphides that Racine adapted as
Phaedra. The gods here are Valmau and Mertoy, who are well aware they're acting like gods. They
talk about it. They relish the power it gives them. And this novel as a whole absolutely
refuses to find meaning in suffering, which is what classical tragedy was for. In fact it's
because they have godlike power that Valmau and Mertoy are able to warp what looks like it's going
to be a comic plot into a tragic one. There are quite a few instances of potential comedy subverted.
Here's one. The naive girl Cecile starts sleeping with Valmau. She finds it enjoyable but upsetting
because she knows she's supposed to be in love with her nice young music tutor Donsany. And on top
of that her mother is still expecting her to marry some boring older man she's never even met. Well
her mother never finds out about Valmau, but she does understand perfectly well that Cecile wants
young Donsany and she starts feeling sorry for her and she just about makes up her mind to
relent and let her have Donsany instead of the fiance. But just to make sure the mother writes
a letter to a dear trusted friend to get advice. And unfortunately this trusted friend is the
Marquis de Mertoy who has been playing both sides all along. She's been coaching the highly
impressionable Cecile to get into bed with Valmau and at the same time she's been giving the
mother sober advice about bringing up her daughter. Well you see if this were comedy allowing Cecile
to marry young Donsany would be the normal happy ending. It's a standard plot. There's a parental
blocking figure preventing the young lovers from being united. Now the blocking figure is
neutralized, they live happily ever after. But in Les LÃ©liers en Don Charest, Mertoy
diabolically counsels the mother to harden her heart and force Cecile to reject Donsany. Well
this Cecile is never anything more than a minor character but she gets to experience her own
disaster in the novel, totally loses her reputation when the truth comes out, spends the rest of her
days exiled in a convent. Here's another example of a comic perspective that gets steam-rollerd by
the increasingly tragic plot. Seeking guidance in her distress, Tourvelle confides in an elderly
lady named Madame de Rosamond who happens to be Valmau's aunt and has quite kindly feelings
toward her ne'er-do-well nephew. Now this Madame de Rosamond is the type of the worldly wise,
tolerant, savvy older person who if this were a comedy would help to smooth down the rough edges
and bring about the happy ending. But here her non-judgmental worldliness contributes to the
disaster. Well in this world of amoral game playing it's Tourvelle who stands out as something alien.
Her religious faith is totally real but so is her passion for Valmau and emotionally she's prepared
to go all the way. And incidentally she's only 22 years old, she's not much older than Cecile
and she's sexually and emotionally inexperienced given her pallid marriage. Now just because her
commitment is so absolute it staggers Valmau. He begins to wonder if something new is actually
happening to him. This guy has thought he'd seen it all and in a letter to Mertoy that he
writes three quarters of the way through the book he's reporting Tourvelle's long post-pwn
surrender and he says this, I'm still too full of my happiness to be able to appreciate it but
I'm astonished at this unknown charm that I've experienced. He's actually using the word happiness.
He's describing a state of feeling that's not at all the same as that brief intensity of pleasure
that was Mertoy's fundamental principle. He's also acknowledging it's unknown that something
has never happened to him before but Valmau cannot allow himself to surrender to this feeling because
that would entail mutual giving on both sides and of course also he's well aware he's writing this
to Mertoy who is certain to jeer at him if he gives into this emotion. So for the rest of this
letter he talks himself into quelling the hitherto unknown feelings and he says I admit I would feel
a sweet pleasure in yielding myself to this if it didn't cause me some uneasiness shall I be at my
age mastered like a schoolboy by an involuntary and unknown emotion no it's necessary above all
to study it and combat it and pretty soon he's convincing himself that he doesn't really feel
love at all it's self satisfaction in his own cleverness he says the excess of pleasure that
I felt at my triumph and that I'm still feeling is nothing other than the sweet sensation of glory
I'm holding on to this way of seeing it because it saves me from the humiliation of thinking
I could depend on anyway on the very slave I had subjected to myself and that I might not have the
fullness of my happiness in myself alone. So now happiness is translated back into pleasure
and the pleasure is not mutual joy with this woman who adores him it's the self-contained
smugness of knowing he's adored but successfully withholding himself. So what he's calling the
fullness of happiness is really entirely solipsistic. For Tourville it's very different we see the moment
of her surrender entirely through Valmont's eyes we have no way of knowing what exactly it means to
her at the time especially since she's overwhelmed by her feelings and collapses and near unconsciousness
but once she recovers we get an unexpected reversal in her values. Now Valmont's happiness
is the only thing she wants from now on he's going to have to struggle to free himself from this
he wanted her to adore him now he's finding it's hard for him to stay detached in fact in the
formulation that I mentioned in the last lecture he's become the slave of his slave and Mertoy
in increasingly hostile letters to Valmont finds this intolerable. Tourville may be the victim but
she's got a kind of power over Valmont that Mertoy herself never had because they had the
libertine relationship of opposed independent equalities. After a while we do get a chance to
understand Tourville's feelings she writes a letter for example to Old Madame de Rosamond
and defiantly acknowledges Rosamond's nephew Valmont has taken the place of God in her heart
and she says it is dear nephew I have consecrated myself it's for him I have undone myself he has
become the sole center of my thoughts my feelings my actions insofar as my life can be necessary to
his happiness it'll seem valuable to me if someday he decides otherwise he'll hear no
complaint or reproach from me well wise tolerant old Rosamond responds with an account of feminine
psychology that tends to encourage Tourville and what she's doing she says don't believe my dear
child that men's love is similar to ours they feel the same intoxication all right
often they're more carried away by it but they don't feel that anxious attentiveness that produces
such tender and constant care in us whose sole object is always the one we love a man enjoys the
happiness he feels a woman enjoys the happiness she gives well considering this female character
speaking words written by a male novelist it would be easy to accuse la clo of being sexist
jock's master said jock you've never been a woman but we still do hear all the time
men are from mars and women from venus and really the analysis is quite subtle
cecile is nearly in love with love as Mirtoye contentiously says so when cecile is in bed with
Valmont she's surprised to notice she's totally forgotten donsanated she's supposed to care so
much about Tourville truly is in love with Valmont it's total it's absolute now at this point in
the novel we're faced with questions which as I have been saying another kind of novel would answer
but this one won't is Valmont really and truly now falling in love with Tourville that's one
question and here's another does Mirtoye still care about Valmont is that the problem is she
motivated by jealousy well it seems to me the reason this novel won't answer these questions
isn't in order to be mysterious it's to force us to real realize how crude and reductive terms
like that are of course Valmont falls for Tourville to some extent how could he not but how much and
what does it mean that he does is it somehow more authentic when he does that than his predatory
behavior was or is it like when he was helping that poor family than I mentioned in the last
lecture the emotions were real enough but they were artificially stimulated and easily dispelled
same thing for the other question is Mirtoye jealous well of course she is but in what way
is it just that her power is being challenged does she really care about Valmont well let's say she
does really care about and what does that prove does it make her less cynical and self-absorbed
well as far as Valmont's feelings go Mirtoye analyzing him with her usual icy clarity gives
a very telling analysis she says okay I can see that you're in love but only in a very narrow sense
it's the love of someone who finds charms and qualities in a woman that she doesn't actually
have who puts her in a class apart with everyone else in second place and who stays attached to her
even while he's abusing her well it was inevitable that Torvel's passion would excite some kind of
response from Valmont but what Mirtoye is saying is his response is pathetically limited and weak
what he's calling love is really just his projection onto this perfectly ordinary woman
of qualities she doesn't really have the whole thing then has been artificial from the very start
Valmont was able to make Torvel fall in love with him by exploiting her loneliness and her
emotional need and by skillful prompting when she does her love is perfectly real but the process
that generated it was completely artificial and a point that's easy to overlook it's not even
clear in this novel that Valmont is wrong in his belief that love is always about power because he
figures out very shrewdly that the way to tempt Torvel is to appeal to her own unadmitted desire
for power and that's the tremendous appeal Richardson's character Clarissa shares that
that the woman should be able by her virtuous goodness to convert the profligate rake to true
love in one of his letters where he's breaking down her resistance Valmont is canny enough to say
I hope you will consent to some demands which however I want to obtain only through complete
submission to your will well that's what she needs to hear and allowing herself to believe that it's
her will that's governing his that's how she falls into his power but then Valmont in turn finds
himself affected by her his phony role starts to feel real so why doesn't he just go with it the way
the characters in the medundula pomeray story did it's because what he fears most is losing his
self-image as the masterful seducer and maritouille knows that very well so she finishes this letter
to him in which he analyzed his behavior by presenting a shocking bomb which she recommends
that he drop on the unsuspecting Torvel she gives him the text of a letter that he can write which
goes like this one gets bored with everything my angel it's the law of nature it's not my fault
so if i'm now bored with an affair that occupied me fully for four mortal months it's not my fault
well to keep up his self-image of the heartless seducer valmont sends that appalling letter to
Torvel and when she reads it of course she reacts with despair she realizes it can't have been written
by the man she thought she knew and it's true in a double sense he's certainly not the man that
she thought he was but he didn't even write it himself it was written by maritouille well the
denouement of this novel comes when in the aftermath of all this anguish maritouille and valmont
finally turn on each other their alliance was never more than a very unstable non-aggression
pact it was doomed to fail the libertine has to be self-enclosed as valmont said dependent on no
one it's not enough to cooperate against third parties as they have been doing in the end they've
got to defeat each other maritouille says herself at one point in single combat maritouille taunts
valmont by telling him she set up an assignation for herself with young donsony of all people
cecile's lover valmont is deeply insulted at being rejected in favor of this mere kid so he
gives her the ultimatum renew our affair once and for all she refuses to do it and she writes at the
bottom of her reply a bm lug air very well war these people make war not love well valmont then
goes to maritouille's house and it's the first time he's actually seen her face to face in this
entire novel and there's donsony coming out the two men fight a duel valmont is beaten as he lies
dying he gives donsony all of maritouille's incriminating letters and that is not so much
an act of you know generosity at his end as a final revenge from the very grave he can pull maritouille
down with him because her reputation will be ruined when those letters are known not only that
maritouille then comes down with smallpox and her good looks are devastated so in any case
her career as a seductress is over but again it's ambiguous it's not quite clear this is appropriate
punishment for what she's done in fact she escapes to amsterdam with a lot of jewels that will permit
her to start a new life with a good financial nest egg and what about the smallpox we look for a
moral sign but are we justified in doing that or just gratefully reacting to a conventional
novelistic ending madame de rosamond says it's poetic justice that was a concept from traditional
tragedy bad characters get punished in the end she certainly has a stake in believing it's poetic
justice it's her own nephew valmont who created such havoc but why is catching smallpox a consequence
of anything maritouille did in many novels right through the victorian period catching smallpox
is a sign of saintliness an unfortunate victim and for sure there's a big difference between maritouille
succumbing to this infectious disease that damages her outside and tourvel wasting away from within
as a consequence of a broken spirit where is la clo in all of this well we can try to speculate
about his views though the novel itself totally conceals them and as i mentioned in the last
lecture we do know from other sources la clo greatly admired rousseau's work and he had a
rousseauian belief in the importance of the family he himself made a very happy marriage with a woman
he met one year after he wrote the liaison now tourvel is destroyed by her emotional openness
that's clear but it doesn't prove openness is bad just it's vulnerable to diabolical deception
we know something else about la clo that's very interesting at his death he left an unfinished
essay that he put a lot of work into on the subject of female education and he agreed with
rousseau that in the state of nature men and women would have been equal and he was much more
disturbed than rousseau was rousseau quite notoriously said women in society have got to accept the
subservient role that they're taught well like rousseau la clo granted that love is indeed the
great consoler of socialized humanity but like rousseau he holds women have been taught to be
flirtatious and withholding as a way of exerting power this is what rousseau describes at great
length in a meal and la clo expresses it in this essay of his in remarkably clear language she says
women learned to veil their charms in order to awaken curiosity they practiced the painful
art of refusing even when they wanted to consent thus beauty and love and jealousy were born these
three illusions have totally changed the respective condition of men and women and in the end they
are the sole source of our passions what an astonishing formulation love and beauty and
jealousy are illusions they're created by the social game that men and women play
women get power from playing hard to get even when they don't want to and since our very passions
are artificial because they're generated by this social game then there's no point talking about
spontaneous emotion so what la clo seems to share most deeply with rousseau is a conviction
that socialized human beings the only kind we know could never be truly natural
and as i read it this is just my interpretation his novel is challenging us to find a moral
perspective for ourselves to find some space for mutuality in a world where everything seemingly
is based on power but it offers no basis to do that unless you step totally outside it the society
within the liesson dangereuse is so hermetically closed and profoundly amoral that the predatory
meritoy and valmont i think it's accurate to call them sociopathic they're able to infect it like
viruses it's a society with a fatally weakened immune system so that good people just can't
survive in these shark infested waters so this book is ambiguity all the way down which is so
disconcerting because we thought art would liberate us from ambiguity at one point meritoy
within the book expresses contempt for formulaic phrases which he says you can find set forth in
the latest novel a nice irony on la clo's part as he's writing those words he's writing the latest
novel and this is one novel that insists on being just as baffling as life itself that's certainly
true of its moral implications which are deeply thought-provoking but corrosive in their effect
modern playwright Jean Giro du had a wonderful comment on this novel he said there should be
a label on the cover for external use only and my belief is la clo wanted us to be so shocked by
that corrupt culture that we would look for a moral place to stand completely outside it but
it's also true within the novel there's no suggestion that moral goodness could ever really hold up
because predators like valmont and meritoy i said at the beginning i'd like to offer a few
comments on some modern film versions of the story which you may well like to see they're well
worth thinking about both are the choices they make in bringing this novel to the screen and in
the larger lessons they can teach us about the differences between film and prose fiction it's
my firm belief it almost never works to translate a good let alone great novel into a movie and that's
because the fundamental languages of those two media are so different a movie has to be primarily
visual showing not telling and it has to give the characters embodiment in real life flesh
and blood actors who very probably are already familiar to you from other roles in this particular
novel is a further problem the epistolary method means you can never be sure what's true and what's
false but a movie unless it's exasperatingly already has to show you so most of the ambiguity
gets leached away and that means losing what's great in lock closed novel and also there's the
problem of costume drama which attempts period faithfulness it always seems unreal jack warner
once said i never want to see another movie where people write with a feather there's a lot of writing
with feathers in modern versions of lily's on don't start with a highly praised one called
dangerous liaisons was directed by steven frears in 1988 adapted from a very successful play by
christopher hampton in the novel as i mentioned belmont meritori only ever see each other face
to face one single time the rest is all long distance negotiation in this movie john malkovich
and glenn clothes are hanging out together right from the start the problem of casting in any movie
the choice of real actors a lot of people like glenn clothes is meritori i think she's much too
arch and complacent i don't want to see a lot more attention at least when she's with belmont alone
as for malkovich he seems unhappy and limp all the way through that movie i think indiana jones
is 10 times sexier a more dubious casting choice is torvel they chose michelle pfeiffer torvel should
be repressed and cold and utterly unaware of this potential passion insider pfeiffer is so fragile
and sweet you just can't believe in the repression that would make the character interesting but in
any case whoever the actress could be what we're not going to see is her inner struggle and that's
the inevitable problem movies always have with subjectivity but my criticism certainly goes
beyond casting choices i think they've been very reductive with motivations so in this film version
meritori is simply jealous of torvel but as i tried to explain in the novel laklo wrote there's
certainly an element of jealousy but it's not as simple as that her motivations are so much more
complex and disturbingly hidden what movies do best is visual effects and this version succeeds
in that at many points summer subtle it's a wonderful moment when valmont has just delivered
his wounding rejection to torvel and he pauses outside her door and his hand starts moving back
toward the door handle and he forces himself to pull it away a very effective touch laklo would
have loved it but i think it's needlessly brutal to make him denounce torvel to her face
in the novel he did it with that letter which was actually written by meritori and that seemed more
in character for him and more hateful for her valmont's duel at the end with don sony is wonderfully
done it's in deep snow they're hacking each other like beasts but valmont's ending is disappointing
the movie makes crystal clear what in the novel it's very ambiguous that he let don sony kill him
according to the movie because he's so guilty about what he did to poor torvel
and he gets to make a noble last speech which goes on and on while he lies in the snow
which indicates a conventional tragic ending very unlike the disturbingly laklo leaves us
just hanging in mid-air and a more important point is this cinematic ending is built on the
ideology of romantic love that we've had occasion to ponder in this course and laklo himself
questioned in that essay of his why does our culture want to believe that true love is always
the ultimate guarantee of meaning la rushfoucault madame lafayette didn't think that laklo has a
lot in common with them it's not inconsistent at all with his desire to make a happy marriage for
himself the movie does end wonderfully well though it makes up for a lot meritori goes to the opera
there's a dead silence with every eye fixed on her and then a chorus of booing begins and she
realizes her secret is out her reputation is in ruins and then you see her at the very end back
in her house in utter silence no more vivaldi violins we see her slowly wiping off her makeup
that's truly cinematic it's a memorable image to carry away and the movie fades out on meritori's
space well as you can see i'm not altogether crazy about that version now another i'm not crazy
about it's called valmont directed by milosh foreman in 1989 almost the exact same time as the
other movie malcovich played valmont as a self-absorbed brooder and this one call in first is a roguish
tom jones type and at benning plays meritori as a smiling tease i have no idea why torvelle is
played by meg tilley as far as i'm concerned i can only speak for myself she is totally adorable
so i have a lot of trouble believing she's moralistic and repressed and it's also hard not to
believe that valmont really is honest to god falling in love with her as indeed to add a bit
of gossip callin first did with meg tilley in real life well um so this is nothing like
law clothes conception and neither is the outcome because here we gather the only person valmont
ever really loved was meritori who however turns out to be a cartoon villain a callous bitch who
screams with hysterical laughter after breaking his heart so here too he lets himself be killed
in the duel of gonson eight and then the film cuts to his pathetic corpse and the women who
loved him come up one by one to kiss his dead face his seal and meritori and at last torvelle
puts a rose on his tombstone so in this version it's valmont the irresistible the bad boy loves
them and leaves them but they can never get over him that's why this movie has his name as the title
and you really do need the 18th century costumes and the music by sir neville mariner it's a
classic bodice ripper there's an older version very dated now but better directed in the 1950s
by roger vaudin with the great john morrow as meritori or the character modernized from meritori
in french but you can get it with english subtitles the most brilliant stroke just to mention one
thing is that the rejection letter becomes a telegram which meritori dictates into the phone
while valmont looks on helplessly it's an inspired transposition of la claude's concept of you know
giving him the letter to write into a modern idiom there's also a very free adaptation called cruel
intentions which sets the story in a modern american prep school and actually does catch the
cruelty and treachery surprisingly well but this is where all clothes ambiguity isn't necessarily
good in itself far from it but la claude is interested in issues that are by their nature
ambiguous and in lately is how does your is he's achieved a masterpiece of writing
that does some things that no movie will ever be able to do
