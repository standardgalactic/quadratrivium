Lecture 11, The London Journal, Part II
In the last lecture, I presented the London Journal, basically from Boswell's own perspective,
except for briefly invoking modern concepts of authenticity and narcissism.
In this lecture, I want to look more extensively at the evidence he gives us from a modern
point of view.
At one point in the London Journal, Boswell admits he doesn't really want to become a
lawyer, however dutifully he's been trying to accept it, and then he says,
I wished my journal to contain a consistent picture of a young fellow eagerly pushing
through life, but it serves to humble me, and it presents a strange and curious view
of the unaccountable nature of the human mind.
By his own frank admission, he is often puzzling and even unaccountable to himself.
So, let's see what a more modern psychological approach might make of what he tells us.
A good place to start is his relations with women, which need to be divided into two
types, fashionable ladies, his drawing rooms he visited and his patronage he hoped for,
and lower class women, usually prostitutes, with whom he had his only sexual experiences
at this time, with an invariable result of shame and anxiety.
During the course of the London Journal, there's only one involvement that doesn't fit either
of these categories, and that's a flirtation he conducted with an actress whom he calls
Louisa.
It seems that her real surname may have been Louis, but she's otherwise not known to scholarship.
From the start, the whole thing is very carefully calculated on both sides, and it's amusing
to see Boswell pretending to believe he's in the throes of an irresistible passion.
He chatted pretty easily, he says, we talked of love as a thing that could not be controlled
by reason, as a fine passion.
I could not clearly discern how she meant to behave toward me.
This night, I made no visible progress in my amour, but in reality, I was doing a great
deal.
I was getting well acquainted with her, I was informing her by my looks of my passion
for her.
Well, that's calculated enough, but Boswell, you remember, needs to see himself as a man
of feeling, so the very next night, he's writing like this.
I engaged in this amour, just with a view of convenient pleasure, but the God of pleasing
anguish now seriously seized my breast.
I felt the fine delirium of love.
Well, when he's describing experiences as they really feel, like having his feet washed
with milk warm water, Boswell writes superbly well, when he's trying to convince himself
of something, the cliches come pouring out, the God of pleasing anguish, the fine delirium
of love.
The night after that, he calls again at Louis's, and by now his attention to his self-image
is fully engaged.
He thinks he should resemble digs, that dashing actor he admired, and he adds, I acquired
confidence, confidence was something he was always simulating but really lacked.
I acquired confidence by considering my present character in this light, a young fellow, a
spirit in fashion, heir to a good fortune, enjoying the pleasures of London, and now
making his addresses in order to have an intrigue with that delicious subject of gallantry
and actress.
That's the key.
In the 18th century, actresses were considered easy women, who might be a cut above prostitutes,
but not very much above.
Boswell is a bashed and inhibited with women of his own class, but he can feel free with,
as he says, that delicious subject of gallantry and actress.
Come back to this point in just a moment.
First let's follow out the progress of the Amour.
A few weeks go by, during which, Louisa gets Boswell to lend her quite a lot of money,
in effect a financial transaction, though they don't call it that, and at last she agrees
to spend the night with him at an inn.
So they go there and register under the names of Mr. and Mrs. Diggs.
It pleases Boswell to borrow the name of his role model, Rake, and Louisa modestly asks
him to withdraw while she's getting undressed, and he complies.
He says, I took a candle in my hand and walked out into the yard.
The night was very dark and very cold.
I experienced for some minutes the rigors of the season.
It was mid-January.
I called to my mind many terrible ideas of hardships that I might make a transition
from such dreary thoughts to the most gay and delicious feelings.
That's pure Boswell, alert to his own sensations, recording them, eager to relish them to the
full.
But once he gets back indoors to Louisa, there's just a downpour of cliches.
It reads like third-rate fiction.
It's completely empty of descriptive power.
Which is too long to read in full, but let me just string together a few of his phrases
and you'll get the idea.
In a sweet delirium, I was clasped in her snowy arms, milk-white bosom, amorous dalliance,
luscious feast, godlike vigor, noble game, supreme rapture.
Well, of course, sex is notoriously hard to write about.
Vladimir Nabokov once said pornography is the copulation of cliches.
And after this goes on for a while, though, Boswell turns the volume down and says two
things that reveal a much more canny awareness of what's really going on.
In my own mind, he says, I was somewhat proud of my performance, yes it was, a performance
on both of their parts.
She pretending to be modest and hard to get, he playing the role of the passionate lover.
Then he says this.
Louisa had an exquisite mixture of delicacy and wantonness that made me enjoy her with
more relish.
Indeed, I could not help roving in fancy to the embraces of some other ladies, which
my lively imagination strongly pictured.
At the moment when he's finally in bed with this woman he's been assiduously courting,
his fancy, or imagination, he uses both words, conjure up other ladies.
And that's no accident, for as he says to himself a bit further on, he was attracted
to Louisa, he says, as an actress who had played many a fine ladies part.
But the sequel alas turns out to be disastrous.
And a week later, what happened, as Boswell tells us, well he resorts now not just to
cliche but to euphemism, by this day began to feel an unaccountable alarm of unexpected
evil.
It was a little heat in the members of my body sacred to Cupid, very like a distemper
which Venus, when cross, takes it into her head to plague her votaries.
Well what Venus did was give him an attack of gonorrhea, which he had already suffered
from in the past, he knew what it was.
Now modern medical experts have had a look at his account and they suspect it was just
a recurrence of his old condition, probably not a new infection that Louisa gave him.
But he assumed it was, he was furious, he demanded his money back, he broke with her,
he had to resign himself to a couple of months of being grounded while he waited for the
illness to subside.
Perhaps the most interesting thing about this whole episode is what his modern editor
Pottle was able to deduce from the original manuscript.
Boswell actually wrote the whole thing down after it was over, that is he told the story
the way a novelist would.
Instead of saying right at the start, oh I'm going to describe something awful that happened
to me, he gives us the anticipation in the cold courtyard and the supreme rapture and
only afterwards he caps the story with the shocking De Numeau.
And the fact is he's seen himself throughout in a whole series of roles, he was the honorable
gentleman caller, then he was the respectable husband, Mr. and Mrs. Diggs, then he was the
virile lover praised for his performance and finally the repentant invalid which in fact
was a standard penalty for misbehavior in the novels of the time.
Well to some extent he understands of course very well what was happening to him and that's
what allows him to retell it in this artful way and all the way through we can sense a
degree of self-awareness that amounts almost to detachment from himself.
Pottle says at one point in his biography of Boswell that he's like a naturalist observing
a sectioned ant hill when he watches his own emotions, so very much as an empiricist
theory and we'll come back to that in later lectures, there's a constant doubleness between
the Boswell who acts and the Boswell observing himself acting and in fact keeping this diary
seems to have been psychologically necessary to him in that way.
It was as if experiences weren't fully real until he got to write them down.
The entire entry for one day which comes when he's stuck in his apartment because of his
illness, the entire entry goes like this, nothing worth putting into my journal occurred
this day. It passed away imperceptibly like the whole life of many a human existence.
On the other hand in this symbiotic relationship between Boswell the man and Boswell the book
the job of keeping up with himself could be exhausting and he writes on another occasion
I sat up all last night bringing up my lagging journal which like a stone to be rolled up
a hill must be kept constantly going. He's thinking of the myth of Sisyphus, that symbol
of endlessly repeated labor that never gets anywhere.
So yes he does show a good deal of self-knowledge when he relates to the Louise's story but
as I suggested we can use modern ideas to throw further light on it.
Freud has a powerful essay called the most prevalent form of degradation in the erotic
life much more prevalent one hopes in turn of the century Vienna than it is today.
Freud describes the phenomenon of men who were unable to achieve sexual gratification
with women of their own class. Ladies is what Boswell calls them and they would seek out
lower class women either servants or prostitutes for that.
Freud couldn't have read Boswell's journals they weren't even discovered yet when he was
writing but Freud's essay could be a picture of James Boswell and for that matter of Jean-Jacques
Rousseau a point we'll return to in a later lecture.
The explanation that Freud gives as part of his own technical theory it has to do with
the Oedipus complex the man is inhibited because he identifies ladies with his mother and the
incest taboo makes him impotent with them we don't need to follow Freud there we can
certainly say Boswell does exhibit the pattern he's talking about and the reason Louisa was
erotically available was she seemed like a lady but he knew she wasn't one and of course
that's exactly why he had to fantasize about other fine ladies when he finally did get
her into bed.
It's particularly interesting that he called himself Mr. Diggs because the role he most
admired Diggs in as I mentioned in the last lecture was Captain MacHeath the dashing highwayman
in John Gay's musical play The Beggar's Opera.
The Beggar's Opera was intended to be a trenchant satire on political corruption and the idea
was to show that the prime minister and all the rest of the politicians behaved in a way
that was indistinguishable from organized crime but everybody who saw the play depending
on their sex either fell in love with the young heroine his name was Polly or else with
the hero whose name was MacHeath and just as an aside I think this tells us something
about the escapist potential of the theater and Boswell adored the theater.
In the 20th century the socialist playwright Bertolt Brecht rewrote The Beggar's Opera
as the three penny opera and what he meant to do was to expose the corruption of modern
capitalism and sure enough Mac the Knife went right to the top of the hip parade and
looking back Brecht himself said quite ruefully the theater features everything down.
Well with this in mind here's a superbly vivid account in the London Journal of an
evening on the town.
It's May four months after that midwinter disaster with Louisa and Boswell is out having
fun again and he says I sallied forth this evening in rich flow of animal spirits and
burning with fierce desire.
I met two very pretty little girls who asked me to take them with me my dear girls said
I am a poor fellow I can give you no money but if you choose to have a glass of wine
and my company and let us be gay and obliging to each other without money I am your man.
That is pure Boswell he doesn't want to admit he's picking up a couple of teenage prostitutes
something he did addictively no he wants them to love him for himself just like he wanted
the sword salesman to trust him without money.
Well it works they agreed with great good humor so back to the Shakespeare tavern I
went a waiter I said I have got here a couple of human beings I don't know how they'll
do I'll look your honor cried he and with inimitable effrontery stared them in the face
and then cried they'll do very well what said I are the good fellow creatures bring them
up then we were shown into a good room and had a bottle of sherry before us in a minute
that's pure Boswell too he's happiest when he's improvising getting other people to join
him in a playful performance and of course it tickles him to have the waiter address
him as your honor he may be playing the part of a roguish poor fellow with no money but
he needs to know that his real status is well understood so now they're in the private room
with the open bottle of sherry I surveyed my sororaleo and found them both good subjects
for amorous play I toyed with them and drank about and sang youths the season and thought
myself captain Mack Heath and then I solaced my existence with them one after the other
according to their seniority solace his existence is right it's when he's openly playing a
role being captain Mack Heath singing one of his heirs from the beggars opera teasing
and joking with the waiter and the two agreeable girls it's then that Boswell can relax and
let himself go and just be himself except as he's revealing so clearly that self is
really a composite or collection of roles there's the dutiful son the prospective law
student the witty guest at fashionable salon the potent lover of Louisa the jolly dog who
picks up willing girls and entertains them at taverns maybe even the sultan of turkey
he uses the term sororaleo or harem apparently this was a common metaphor among men in the
18th century the fantasy of choosing at will among a troop of compliant women as we'll
see in a future lecture for someone like Diderot that's all there is a person is nothing more
or less than the sum total of their roles and if the role sometimes look contradictory
we'll get used to it but Boswell is made very uneasy by signs of inner dissonance he wants
to be a stable character even though he fears it's not working for someone like him a new
and different kind of understanding is needed and that's the kind that empiricism not only
didn't try to give it actively didn't want to give and for that we'll need to wait for
the radically new approach that was being worked out at the very moment that Boswell
was keeping his journal by Russel at other times encounters with prostitutes are more
degrading and Boswell knows it he often takes them down dark alleyways there were no street
lights in London in those days for a shilling or even six minutes one street walker picks
his pocket of his handkerchief makes you realize how poor they were linen handkerchief was worth
something Boswell is disgusted after that episode and he starts to reflect on it quite soberly
so he quickly returns to the language of euphemism when I got home I was shocked to think that
I had been intimately united with a low abandoned perjured pilfering creature I determined to
do so no more but if the Cyprian fury Venus was the goddess of Cyprus if the Cyprian
fury should seize me to participate my amorous flame with a genteel girl you see the trouble
he's in he has a problem with genteel girls but the alternative is mean and humiliating
and moreover he's only very dimly aware of the larger problem of prostitution at that
time the victimization of young girls who came to London looking for jobs as servants
and got trapped at one point only in the London Journal Boswell shows some awareness of this
just a brief entry but a moving one she who submitted to my lusty embraces was a young
Shropshire girl only 17 very well looked her name Elizabeth Parker poor being she has a
sad time of it well clearly it has been some conversation he's learned her name and Boswell
shows some awareness at least of the plight of these unfortunate victims but it's not
a subject he's much interested in pondering and I mention it now because we'll return
to it at the very end of the course in a magnificent protest poem by William Blake
that does try to understand the social basis of what he saw as the institution of prostitution
now I've said that Boswell needed to believe he had a stable core of self and as I mentioned
at the end of the last lecture there was a very good reason for that he was deeply afraid
he might have tendencies to insanity the term he used which was still the standard one was
melancholy but in modern terms we can say with certainty that Boswell was a manic depressive
or in our latest terminology suffered from bipolar disorder even then it was known to
run in families he was well aware his grandfather had it as did his brother John who was in and
out of confinement all his life so that a major incentive for keeping the journal is
to amass evidence that he's the kind of person he hopes he is confident attractive successful
lovable and just at this moment by great good luck he encountered the perfect role model
a term I keep using but again a modern term that then didn't exist Samuel Johnson whom
we've met several times already was the most famous English writer of the time immensely
accomplished Boswell had already formed the habit of reading Johnson's fable Rassilis
once every year so he managed to arrange a meeting with the great man and they soon took
to each other quite an odd couple really 50 year old literary lion and this charming young
Scott and what Boswell soon came to understand was that Johnson too was tormented by melancholy
that is by fears of losing his mind and Johnson's example was immensely valuable in helping
Boswell to deal with his fears and not least because in Johnson at last he had a really
satisfactory father figure use another modern concept Johnson was more than ready to give
him stern advice when he needed it and he wanted it but also to make it obvious he enjoyed
Boswell's liveliness and playfulness the very things his grim father back in Scotland was
always criticizing him for so with Johnson in fact he could be himself and that's the
greatest gift anyone could possibly have given him but Boswell wasn't just a sort of dependent
or lapdog to Johnson the way people used to think before his diaries came to light but
we see from the diaries is he was a gifted writer in his own right and even when he has
trouble understanding his own nature he's asking the kinds of questions that still seem very
worth asking his journals are readable today because they're not just a collection of 200
year old gossip they're a vivid picture with real perceptiveness of the psychological struggle of
a complicated person trying to find himself and what they really are is works of art the role they
play in Boswell's own life is very much what Freud said art does for the artist and Rasselis
remember Johnson lamented the tendency of the imagination to invent pleasing fantasy worlds
Johnson put it in moralistic terms he said the mind feasts on the luscious falsehood whenever
she is offended with the bitterness of truth but as we've seen Boswell defiantly embraces
fancy and imagination and this is where he fits Freud's theory of art according to Freud the
artist like a neurotic can't accept the renunciation of instinct that reality demands so he transposes
his desires into a fantasy realm he creates a new reality the work of art which gives him the
mastery that he wants and unlike the neurotic creates something permanently valuable that can
be interesting to other people also doesn't know it but while he's staying up nights keeping up the
London Journal that's what it's doing for him it's his unacknowledged work of art possible with
always reproaching himself for weakness of willpower because it was so hard to make himself do what he
believed he ought to do stop drinking stop picking up women so on but it would be at least as true
to say he had plenty of willpower it just wasn't directed where he thought it should be so he's
constantly trying to stamp it down and this is where the diary was invaluable it gave him a chance
to rework and order his experience given an artistic shape the way he did when he retold the
Louisa story from a retrospective point of view and I think this made the diary a safety valve a
release from the intolerable repression he tried to impose on himself it's the kind of repression
that Johnson it was a much stronger personality really did impose on himself Johnson had urges
that were least as strong as Boswell's but he went cold turkey on alcohol and never touched it again
for decades he totally gave up on sex after his wife's death and here I think Freud's concept of
repression is a permanently valuable contribution to psychological understanding what Boswell is
experiencing though he has no way to grasp it is the damage that the divided self can do if it's
determined to stamp out its own deepest desires and as we think back we realize how invisible this
issue was in La Planceste de Cleve we were led to believe there that it's yielding to desire that's
always destructive and that retreating into a convent would bring peace of mind in that older
psychological system the self was the enemy and even a secular writer like La Rochefoucault could
sound very much indeed like the religious writer Pascal the challenge now at the middle of the 18th
century is to come to terms with the self to understand its contradictory impulses and if
possible find a way to accept them in other words the task for modern psychology will be to find
ways to deal with the dynamic nature of psychological life to think of contradictions and conflict in
constructive ways and that issue will be right at the center of our inquiry from here on out but as
I say the need was just beginning to be formulated the language and the concepts to analyze it
didn't exist the best possible and self could do was to see himself as a hypochondriac that's
another word that had a much larger meaning than it does today it meant an excess of spleen you
remember produced black bile melancholy it was thought of as a physical imbalance as in the old
humor theory too much spleen then produces mental illness so hypochondria was exactly the opposite
of its modern meaning we mean only in the mind they meant something profound and threatening coming
up from a serious imbalance and remember empiricism had no way at all of understanding mental illness
it saw it as just the brain computer adding up the memory data wrong now about 15 years after the
London Journal Roswell wrote a series of essays that he collected under the title the hypochondriac
and at their best they're extremely uneven and deservedly forgotten but at their best they
give a poignant sense of how much he suffered from this condition he did not explain or deal with
and he says in one of these essays the mind may be sick it may be full of scorpions or have a pale
cast of thought altogether unconnected with the state of the body there are two quotes there from
Shakespeare Macbeth says his mind is full of scorpions Hamlet says he can't carry out revenge
because he's inhibited by the pale cast of thought well here again is the mind body problem the
empiricists were so baffled by if hypochondria is the mental reflection of physical causes then how
come Boswell is full of energy and health but also feels sick in his inmost consciousness so it's
interesting to note the most recent medical theory seems to have returned to something like the old
humor theory that is whereas psychoanalysis would have said bipolar disorder was the result of some
traumatic experience in early life we now believe it's essentially a chemical imbalance well at
any rate Boswell knows what it feels like and he gives us this superb description the hypochondriac
is distracted between indolence and shame every kind of labor is irksome to him that he has not
resolution enough to cease from his accustomed tasks the habitual current of his feelings
obliges him to shun being despised he acts therefore like a slave not animated by inclination
but goaded by fear quite a profound statement and you couldn't ask for a better description of
inauthenticity acting passively as he himself put it in a phrase i quoted in the last lecture he
keeps trying to do what other people want and to deny what he himself wants and the struggle is
exhausting what a wonderful relief then to find in johnson a father who could enforce morality
but also make him believe in himself and by appreciating his playfulness his gifted improvising
could make him feel his spontaneous feelings were actually good and if we think of boswell as a
narcissist it's very relevant that the narcissist shores up his insecure self-image by attaching
himself to powerful charismatic figures and of course johnson served perfectly for that
and i believe it must have cut both ways um people don't always ask why did johnson like
boswell so much most of his friends couldn't figure it out well i think one reason was
in boswell johnson got to experience vicarious transgressiveness he could then solemnly
reprove boswell but in such a way that would show boswell was really forgiven
so we'll leave boswell with this thought the paradox that he's wrestling with is that he
wants to be sincere that old term that it's now losing its force it's his way of talking about
being his authentic true self but it's at moments of overt role playing as when he's with louisa
or even more when he's being captain mac heath with those two girls at the tavern it's at times
like that that he feels all there fully alive and it's rousseau again who will see this paradox
and state it explicitly and find new ways of making sense of it but before we go there we'll
turn to a writer who emphasizes the opposite side of the paradox also a very brilliant writer and
that's deed row who explores the possibility that when you get right down to it role playing is all
there is and here i'll close with an anecdote i've always appreciated that i think applies very
well to boswell an 18th century playwright named richard brinsley charidan his father actually
turns up in the london journal some years later wrote a hit play called the school for scandal
and the central character in that play is a total con man named joseph surface you get the idea if
you could see beneath the surface you'd find out what a hypocrite the guy is and the part was written
in fact typecast for an actor named john palmer who was known widely by the nickname plausible jack
and after the school for scandal became a huge hit this guy palmer decided to desert charidan
and start a theater of his own but it failed so he had to come crawling back and grovel and beg
charidan to hire him again and so palmer said solemnly mr charidan if you could but see my heart
and charidan answered by jack you forget i wrote it
