Welcome back. This lecture is going to follow on our introduction to semiconductors and
how they work and look now at a more complicated device than the diode, namely the transistor.
The transistor is arguably the most important invention or certainly one of the most important
inventions of the 20th century. Invented in the 1950s and came into full-scale use in
electronic circuits in the 60s and beyond and quickly replaced those clunky old vacuum
tubes that were used. Now think back to my first lecture when I talked about what electronics
was really about. Electronics was about allowing one circuit to control another and I introduced
the several devices that we've used to do that, the vacuum tube and then the transistor
and I talked about how we put transistors on integrated circuits. Well transistors are at
the heart of all modern electronics and what they do is allow one circuit to control another.
So in this lecture I'm going to give you an introduction to how transistors work and again
in keeping with the spirit of this course it's kind of a zero-th order introduction. I'm not
going to go into all the details, I'm not going to describe some of the subtleties of transistors,
I'm going to ignore the fact that they have some resistance, that they have some capacitance,
that they have some other properties that make them less than the ideal transistors I'm going
to talk about here. If you were an electrical engineer designing real important circuits you
would take all those things into account. But even with this basic introduction to how transistors
work we'll be able to build and understand rather simple circuits and in fact by the end of just
this lecture we'll build what's probably the simplest non-trivial application namely using a
transistor as a switch. Later we'll move on to use transistors as amplifying devices and then
we'll go back in the later part of the course when we get to digital electronics to use them
as switches. So a brief introduction to the several different kinds of transistors. Before we get
there I have a conceptual diagram that suggests roughly what any kind of controlling device is
like and so I have this device here and you'll notice it has three connections to it that's the
minimum number of connections you could make to have one circuit control another and that's what
the transistor has. And because there are only three connections the two circuits you're controlling
the controlling circuit and the controlled circuit need to have at least one point in common and
in this diagram that point is at the bottom of that arbitrary device I have that's going to do let
one circuit control another and that device is now going to become for us the transistor. There
are two main kinds of transistors. There are transistors called field effect transistors,
FETs and they're actually a little bit easier to understand so I'll introduce those first although
we won't use them very much till the later part of the course and I'll reintroduce them when we get
there. Then there are bipolar junction transistors which are gradually getting obsolete by field
effect transistors although they're still widely used and they're particularly used in amplifier
applications audio amplifiers that sort of thing. So we will spend a good bit of time on BJTs
although increasingly electronic devices use field effect transistors rather than BJTs and
that's particularly true of digital electronics. So let's plunge in and begin to look at some
simple descriptions of how transistors work. Before we get there let me just remind you what
we're talking about are the change from vacuum tubes to these little tiny transistors and then
the ability to put many many many transistors on a single chip and before we actually look at how
transistors work let me remind you that we can really cram today billions of these transistors
on a single circuit on a single chip like a microprocessor at the heart of a computer
and here's a diagram that shows a microprocessor chip much like the one I just pointed to.
I enlarge photograph of what the thing looks like looks like just a mess but that mess is
individual components built onto one piece of silicon mostly transistors but some resistors
and other components as well and on the far right is a micrograph showing the nanoscale size of the
individual transistors that make up that integrated circuit. This particular one is field effect
transistors and so let's begin by talking about field effect transistors. So there are actually
two kinds of field effect transistors there are metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors
also called MOSFETs widely used in today's semiconductor electronics digital circuits your
your cell phone is full of them your digital TV is full of them your computer is full of MOSFETs
there are also junction FETs junction field effect transistors or JFETs and we'll look quickly at
both kinds of field effect transistors to see how they work and again remember these are voltage
controlled devices they're a little easier to understand than the current controlled bipolar
junction transistors you'll see in a minute what that distinction is so here's the basic
block that makes up a MOSFET a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor it's a
block of p-type this particular one is a block of p-type semiconductor and embedded in it are two
little inserts of n-type material now remember from the previous lecture I emphasize that the p-n
junction is at the heart of almost all semiconductor electronic devices and here we see two not one
but two p-n junctions in this field effect transistor and I show a battery connected with
its positive terminal on the right and because the positive terminal is connected to the n-type
region of the right hand p-n junction the junction being where that insert of n-type material joins
the surrounding p-type material that junction is reverse biased and no current can flow the other
junction on the other hand with the minus connected to the n-type material would be forward biased but
that doesn't do us any good because the right hand junction is reverse biased and so no current can
flow through this device so what good is it well we could try reversing the battery if we reverse
the battery it's the same picture now the left hand junction is reverse biased and the right hand
junction is forward biased and still no current can flow so what good is the MOSFET well the MOSFET
is a lot of good because I haven't shown you the rest of it remember a transistor is a three terminal
device it has three places it connects to the outside world and I haven't showed you the third
place and to get to the third place we grow and grow is the right word this is how it happens in
the semiconductor manufacturing plants we grow layers of material one by one to make these
complicated circuits we grow an insulating layer and it turns out wonderful feature of silicone
that silicon dioxide silicon the second most abundant material on earth and oxygen the most
abundant material in earth's crust joined together to make silicon dioxide you know it is glass or
quartz and it is a very very good electrical insulator so just diffusing a little oxygen and
silicon into here makes a beautiful insulating layer that's the oxide part in metal oxide semiconductor
we've already seen the semiconductor part down below and then we're going to put a thin coating
of metal on top of that oxide and that thin coat of metal is called the gate it's completely
insulated from the semiconductor by this insulating layer and that's going to be important in
describing one of the virtues of MOSFET transistors metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors
because they have a very very very high resistance between the metal gate which is where you put
in the weak signal that's going to do the controlling and the rest of the circuit and so they draw very
very little current from the circuit they're connected to and that's a virtue in many applications
as you'll see so here's our semiconductor material now we are full of holes mostly because it's p
type but there are a few electrons in there remember there are always a few so-called minority
charge carriers that got bopped out of the crystal structure by random thermal motion so there are
a few electrons and then I've shown some of them probably more than there should be in proportion
to the holes but the p type material is mostly holes but with a few electrons and now I'm going to
apply a positive voltage to that insulated gate I'm going to connect positive voltage connected to
the positive end of the battery and it's going to acquire a positive charge well that positive
charge can't flow anywhere because there's that insulating material but what's going to happen
is that positive charge attracts negative charge and there are a few negative charges in the p
type material not very many but they will be attracted into that region below the gate and
that's the region between the two n type intrusions into the p type material and all of a sudden we
have a situation in which we have a significant number of negative charge carriers in the region
it's called the channel between those two intrusions of n type material so effectively what's happened
is that whole channel including the two intrusions has become n type and now there's no junctions
we just have a piece of semiconductor and semiconductors are conductors maybe not
great ones but they're conductors and that transistor can now conduct by putting positive
charge on the gate of that transistor we've turned the transistor on we've enhanced the
conductivity of that channel this particular field effect transistor this particular MOSFET
not only are there two kinds of FETs there are two kinds of MOSFETs there are n channel MOSFETs
and p channel MOSFETs and this is an n channel MOSFET because the channel becomes n when you
put positive charge on the gate now if you think about it you can control the amount of positive
charge on the gate i could have put a different voltage on there or something and i can control
that amount of charge and that will control the number of electrons that are drawn into the channel
and that will control the conductivity of the channel so you can almost think of this field
effect transistor as a voltage controlled resistor equivalently you can think of the
current that flows in that circuit as being controlled by the voltage you put on the gate
and so there is the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor the particular one is
an n channel transistor we can turn it on and off by putting charge on or off the gate or we can
vary the current that flows through it varying its resistance by varying the amount of charge we put
on the gate that's how a MOSFET works and fairly easy to understand in this context and so current
is flowing through the MOSFET now as we've got that charge on the gate the symbol for a MOSFET
actually there is unfortunately not a completely standardized way of drawing MOSFETs this is the
simplest symbol and it's the one i'm going to use it shows two parts the two places where those
intrusions are they're called the drain and the source for slightly obscure reasons we won't go into
the important electrode is the gate and you'll notice the little arrow going outward on the right
hand side of that symbol that tells us this is an n channel MOSFET because it shows that the junction
between the n type intrusion and the p uh the junction between the p type material and the n
type intrusion is going in the direction shown unfortunately the symbol is upside down in some
ways relative to the diagram but if i turn the symbol upside down then the gate would be on the
wrong side so that's just the way it has to be so that was a n channel MOSFET we can also make a p
channel MOSFET its symbol looks the same except that little arrow goes the other way and it's just
the same except we reverse the n and the p type material and that's one of the wonderful aspects
of semiconductors is for every kind of transistor we have a complement which uses p where the other
one uses n and vice versa so there are p channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors
and here's one of them and finally the last type of of field effect transistor we'll talk about one
we won't use much but i will use some amplifier circuits start with one of these so i wanted you
to see them is a this is an n channel junction field effect transistor and what you see is a
chunk of n type material and i'd like to you to imagine that this material is cylindrical
and that that intrusion you see of p type material is a band that wraps all around this
cylindrical structure it doesn't have to be cylindrical but that's the easiest way to think
about it so that bottom piece of p is in fact connected to the top piece of p because they form
a donut like intrusion around the n type material okay and we have two junctions here two diodes
basically they're actually part of one diode because we have this p type material going all the way
around there's the circuit symbol for a junction field effect transistor it doesn't have quite
that insulating quality that the MOSFET did because there is a junction and junctions
pass a small amount of current in the reverse direction and now let's imagine connecting a
battery across this n channel and current can flow no problem because the semiconductor is itself
a conductor not a very good conductor but it's a conductor now what happens if we apply a negative
voltage to the p type material that causes the material to become those junctions to become
reverse biased remember that grows the depletion region so now there's a depleted region around
those junctions which has gotten bigger and the depleted region is depleted of charge carriers
no charge can flow and we've turned this JFET off so the JFET becomes also an on off switch or by
varying the amount of that depletion it becomes something that controls the effective resistance
of the channel and so with both our field effect transistors we have devices in which applying
a voltage to one electrode the gate electrode results in variation in the current flow in the
second circuit so the transistors become devices that control that allow one circuit to control
another so those are the two field effect transistors and we have metal oxide semiconductor
field effect transistors we have junction field effect transistors and we have them in both
kinds because we can make alternate p and n we can reverse the order of those two okay field
effect transistors somewhat okay to understand I mean they're not trivial but now we want to look
at the bipolar junction transistor and that is a lot more difficult to understand so I'm going to go
through it carefully and I'm going to use the big screen here because I'd like to be able to point
out what's going on and do some animations so here we're going to talk about the bipolar junction
transistor BJT this is an NPN BJT because it consists of three regions an n region a p region
and an n region their names are collector for the upper n region base for that p-type region and
notice that p-type region is really narrow that's crucially important to operate really thin it's
separating the collector and the emitter the bottom most n-type region but it's really really thin
and that's going to be the key to transistor operation we have wires connected to each of those
so again we have a three terminal device that we can connect to the outside world and what we're
going to do is connect positive end of a battery to the base we'd also have some resistors to keep
the current from being too big but I won't show those and here we have then a forward biased p-n
junction between the base and the emitter and so in that configuration current will flow and the
current consists of electrons flowing around backwards from the direction that the current
goes because electrons are negative so if I just connected the circuit up like that I would have
a current flow through that forward biased base emitter junction is enough now let's do some more
circuitry let's take a beer battery perhaps and connect its positive end to the collector
and its negative end to the emitter so it becomes the controlled circuit so here's the
controlling circuit here's the controlled circuit let's see how that works
remember that there's an electric field established by that diffusion of carriers charge carriers
holes and electrons across the junction and the electric field points from the n toward the p
because the n has become a little bit positive because holes have diffused into it and the p has
become a little bit negative because electrons have diffused into it so there is this electric field
in there now what happens well if you were an electron and you came around and into this n type
region you would want to keep going happily around like that but because that base region is so thin
you might kind of overshoot the mark and get into the region of that electric field and if you do
that electric field will grab you you're a free electron you're negative so you want to go opposite
the direction of the electric field and you'll be whisked up into the collector so even though the
collector to base junction is reverse biased we've got the battery connected the wrong way
to make that junction conduct nevertheless if we inject or emit and that's why it's called the
emitter free electrons into that base some of them will be caught in that electric field and
they'll be whisked across and they'll make a current and if you make that base region thin
then most of the electrons that get in there get in there because of the current in the base
circuit will in fact be whisked into the collector and they will make a current and a much bigger
current in the collector circuit so that's reverse biased collector junction and here is what it
looks like there go those and now most of the electrons are going around in the collector
circuit and we have a current flowing in the collector again opposite the direction of the
electrons from the positive terminal of the battery and it's bigger than the base current
it's typically a lot bigger than the base current it's typically on the order of 100 to 200 times
the base current maybe 50 times but somewhere on the order of 100 here's the circuit symbol
for the bipolar junction transistor the base is this middle piece the collector is the piece with
no arrow on it and the emitter is the piece with the arrow and the base current flows in the base
and out through the emitter by the way that arrow tells you the direction of the base emitter diode
the diode from the base to the emitter points that way if you drew it with a diode symbol
so we have a base current ib which we establish isa b for base which we established with some
external circuit and as a result there is a big collector current much bigger and it's bigger by
a factor which is called beta the greek symbol beta the greek letter beta and beta is typically on
the order of as i said 100 or so so what the bipolar junction transistor does is it multiplies
currents it takes currents and makes them bigger it takes a small base current which you can control
by whatever you put on the base circuit and it turns it into a much bigger collector current
that beta is called the current gain that's what characterizes the transistor and i'll be using
beta a lot and i'll often assume it's about 100 although it need not be exactly 100 so that's
the workings of the bipolar junction transistor and now we'll move on to figure out what we can do
with bipolar junction transistors and look a little bit more at how they work so let's first
begin trying to characterize a bjt in the same way we characterized other electronic devices
namely by drawing their current voltage curves i'm just going to draw this in one quadrant
positive for both because you can only make a bjt work by connect connecting it the right way
with an np and bjt you want positive to the collector so that we only have positive voltages
and positive currents here now the problem is we've got a device here that has a third terminal
and what the collector current is depends on that base current and so for every base current
i have a characteristic curve so here's what the characteristic curve looks like approximately
for a transistor and actually this is not a bad approximation this is for 0.6 milliamps of base
current and i'm assuming a beta of 100 in this case so 0.6 times 100 is 60 and we have a collector
current of 60 milliamps and that says unless you're getting at very very low collector to
emitter voltages you're going to have 60 milliamps of collector current flowing no matter what
you want to make the base current a little smaller make it 0.4 milliamps you'll get 40 milliamps of
collector current you make it smaller still 0.2 milliamps you'll get 20 milliamps 80 you'll get
8.8 you'll get 80 and 1 milliamp you'll get 100 milliamp those are the bjt characteristic curves
and there are many of them because the bipolar junction transistor has not one but many
characteristic curves one for each in fact infinitely many for each possible level of
base current that flows in the device now i described in detail the workings of the npn
bipolar junction transistor just as with the field effect transistors there's a complementary device
a pnp transistor its base is n type material its collector and emitter are p type material
works the same way but everything is reversed the batteries are reversed the currents go in reverse
and will come across a very clever amplifier circuit that exploits this complementarity
between two kinds of transistors okay well that's an introduction a whirlwind introduction to lots
of different kinds of transistors but basically the two kinds the voltage controlled field effect
transistors and the current controlled bipolar junction transistors and i want to end by talking
about a particularly simple application of the bipolar transistor bipolar junction transistor
as a switch so here's the application we're going to make a transistor switch
and we're going to i'm going to assume something slightly artificial i've got some actual manual
switch it's very delicate it's capable of handling at most five milliamps of current
before it burns out you know it gets damaged but i need it to switch on a light bulb that
use draws 100 milliamps 20 times as much as the switch can handle and it's a 12 volt light bulb
how can a bipolar junction transistor help us with that well it can help us by building a
simple transistor switch circuit so we're going to start with our bipolar junction transistor
shown there and i'm going to assume it has a beta of about a hundred i'm going to connect the light
bulb as a resistance in the collector circuit of that transistor i'm going to connect a battery or
power supply it's 12 volts because it's a 12 volt light bulb and then i want to figure out
how i can get a five milliamp current or maybe even less to make that light bulb light well this
transistor has a beta of a hundred so if i passed a base current of only one milliamp that would
give us a collector current beta times that this current gain of 100 milliamps and we light our
light bulb completely satisfactorily so we have to figure out how to do that so here's our switch
and i'm going to connect the switch back to the 12 volt power supply and i'm going to use the switch
to control the current that flows through a resistor and then through the base
emitter junction and we want to figure out how big to make that resistor
so let's find that resistance we need 100 milliamps of collector current
that's what it takes to light that light bulb if we get that we will have 12 volts across the
light bulb and essentially zero volts across the transistor beta is a hundred so we need a base
current of only one milliamp now the voltage across the resistor is almost the 12 volts not
quite because remember and we're going to use this to design carefully here remember that there is
about a 0.7 volt drop across a forward bias diode junction which is what the base emitter junction
is so the base emitter junction has about 0.7 volts so so the base emitter diode takes away
0.7 volts we have 11.3 volts across that resistor r ohms loss as r is v over i 11.3 volts over 1
milliamp is 11.3 kilo ohms so if we have a resistor of that much we'll get 1 milliamp
and i'm going to use a slightly smaller resistor in a circuit i'm actually going to build so let's
actually go and look at a real version of that circuit with just a few minor modifications
so here we are using the circuit board arrangement that we're going to be using sometimes called
a breadboard by the way and over in this region i've wired a version of that simple transistor
switch i just described here's the transistor you'll notice it's a transistor with a kind of metal
case around it that's a slightly beefier transistor that can handle bigger currents
dissipate a little more power than some of the tiny transistors and i chose that because this light
bulb draws significant current and i wanted a beefier transistor so it wouldn't heat up
my light bulb is in the collector leg of the circuit and there's a little resistor which is
the resistor going to the base and this circuit is very much like the one i just described for you
and what we would like to do to understand this circuit is to understand what the currents are
through the collector part of the circuit and through the base part of the circuit because
that will show us that this transistor is in fact doing this current amplification which is its thing
to do this current gain beta will actually be able to measure it now remember from the third lecture
i talked about electronic instruments and how to make measurements and making current measurements
was a little trickier than making voltage measurements because to make current measurements
you have to break the circuit place the ammeter in series with whatever component you want to
measure the current through and go from there and so i want to know the current through the light
bulb which is also in our diagram the current through the collector of the transistor and i
also want to know the current through that little resistor which goes to the base emitter junction
because that's the base current so i need to measure both those currents so i'm going to come
out of the power supply now on these boards this yellow terminal is a positive power supply that
can go from almost zero up to about almost 20 volts and it's adjustable with this knob so i've
got it adjusted to about 12 volts because that's what our bulb wants we've also got a fixed 5 volt
power supply and i'm actually going to use that for the base current and i'm in fact going to my
delicate switch i'm talking about it's going to be simply me plugging this wire into there i've
tried to color code things to avoid confusion the red wires represent current in the collector
circuit and the black wires are carrying the current in the base circuit black for base
so let's look at what happens let's trace the wiring so out of the positive 12 volt supply
we come with current flowing in to the input of the upper meter this is the ammeter set to
measure milliamps dc milliamps we go through the ammeter which remember is basically like a piece
of wire like a short circuit zero resistance effectively if it's a good ammeter we go out
through the red wire and into the top of the light bulb through the collector through the whole
transistor and to ground that's where that loop of circuit goes the other loop is going to start
with the 5 volt power supply once i connect it it's going to flow through the lower ammeter
the black wires be for base black for base it's going to flow out of the common wire there it's
going to flow into this resistor through the base emitter junction and to ground both of these power
supplies are referenced to ground that means when i say there's 12 volts here that means 12 volts
with respect to ground and there's ground available all over this place including at that black post
and any of the places that are marked here in black are ground and we're connected back to ground
through here so i'm going to now demonstrate this device and i'm simply going to turn the power on
the power is on but nothing's happening there's no current in either meter but now i'm going to
close my little delicate switch and we're going to look at what the current meters read first of
all we close the switch and the light bulb lights so our transistor switch is working because that
switch was not switching the current to the transistor to the light bulb it was switching
the current to the base of the transistor not to the light bulb and so let's take a look at what
we see here here is the upper one that is the red curves and that's the collector and we see
0.223 amps 223 milliamps flowing there the meter has auto adjusted it's scaling so it's in amps
so 223 milliamps is flowing there look down on the lower meter it says 2.80 but look carefully
it's 2.80 milliamps so there's 223 milliamps in the collector circuit and only 2.80 milliamps
in the base circuit and if you think about how those are related 223 and 2.80 well they're
differed by a factor of not quite 100 because if i multiplied 2.80 by 100 i'd get 280 i've only
got 223 so this tells me i've got a transistor whose beta is on the order of but a little bit less
than 100 okay well let's wrap up we've seen a whole variety of transistors we've kind of
understand how those different transistors work we've developed a transistor switch and seen how
to design it and if you're interested in doing the project for this lecture your project will
be very similar it will consist of designing a switch which is supposed to switch on a light
light automatically and you'll have to go through the same design procedure i did for this simple
transistor switch
so lecture seven emphasize the bipolar junction transistor here's our project it's an automatic
nightlight it's basically a bjt switch but here's the situation we've got a photo sensor
that outputs zero volts until the ambient light gets too low decreases below a certain level
and after that it outputs five volts now that's probably a little bit unrealistic it would have
to have a little more circuitry in it to do that abrupt transition and you'll learn about that
circuitry a little bit later but let's say we've got that photo sensor and you want to use this
signal to turn on a light bulb that draws a quarter of an amp 250 milliamps and is a 24 volt light
bulb design a transistor switch to accomplish this and simulate it assign your light bulb the
appropriate resistance and verify that the circuit works and so here we're going to begin by doing
the design and then we'll build the circuit the solution i came up with was a situation that
looks like this we want 250 milliamps as our collector current i've got a symbol there for a
light bulb which is basically a resistor we need ic to be 250 milliamps beta is 100 on our transistor
so we're going to assume beta is 100 and you could set that in the simulated transistors so we need
2.5 milliamps of base current so that's going to determine what the base resistance is going to be
when the sensor is producing five volts so that's sort of what the situation looks like
the voltage across that resistor at the input the one that we the base resistor that we don't
know what its value is is not five volts but five volts minus the 0.7 volts across the diode
when we're working at this low level of voltage that probably important to take that into account
so that's 4.3 volts we want 2.5 milliamps to flow ohms loss as r is v over i
so that comes out 1.72 kilo ohms and as long as we pick something a bit lower will be okay
so i'm going to pick 1.2 kilo ohms which is a standard resistor value i also need to decide
what my light bulb resistance is because i was supposed to pick that so let's go to do circuits
our circuit lab first and let's look at what we've got so here is the circuit wired in circuit lab
i've got the light bulb now the light bulb drew 250 milliamps a quarter of an amp at 24 volts
and if you figure out ohms law from that r is v over i 24 over a quarter is the same as 4 times 24
and that's 96 so the light bulb ought to have 96 ohms and circuit lab actually has a light bulb
component it's just a resistor but it looks like a light bulb so we've got that in there
i chose a 2n22222 transistor because it happens to be able to handle several hundred milliamps
but you probably would have been okay going with a generic transistor in your simulated circuit
whether you would be okay in a real circuit depends on whether the transistor you picked
could handle that current i chose a 24 volt source for the power supply for this circuit
because the light bulb requires 24 volts and i'm representing the photo sensor when it's in
the condition where it's telling you you need to turn on this light as being a 5 volt source
and there's the 1.2 kilo ohm resistor that i decided i ought to put i've put another component in
here which is an ammeter circuit lab has ammeters and voltmeters you can stick them in and notice
i've stuck the ammeter here just like we know an ammeter is supposed to go that is in series
with the component through which we're measuring current i put the positive end of it to the positive
part of the power supply and it reads 247.1 milliamps which is our 250 milliamps close enough
i should point out one thing about circuit labs meters you can decide what kind of meters they
are you can discern their resistances and this one is ideal it has zero resistance but if you
wanted to see the effect of a non ideal ammeter you could put a resistance in there and then
there's a box that says show current and the default is not to click that and if you don't
click that you'll just see the ammeter it'll be there and it'll have whatever resistance it's
been assigned but it won't show anything but if you click show current then as soon as you simulate
the circuit the ammeter will show you the current through it and i've already done the simulation
so i'm getting that 250 milliamps so there's the solution to that project in do circuits
here in circuit lab here it is in do circuits exactly the same thing i'm going to run a dc
simulation on that run a dc without the sweep
and the ammeter comes up with a value of 0.248 amps that's our 250 milliamps again so in both
circuit simulators the circuit does exactly the same thing so there we are having solved that
circuit and built a bipolar junction transistor switch and had to work out some values and
understand how the bjt works
