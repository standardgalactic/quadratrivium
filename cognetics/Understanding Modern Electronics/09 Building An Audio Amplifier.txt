Welcome back to our ongoing exploration of audio amplifier circuits.
Let's begin by looking at the circuit we developed last time, which was a single transistor common
emitter amplifier.
I'm showing it now, I'm calling it stage one because we're going to develop here a two
stage common emitter amplifier.
Now the amplifier I have here is almost identical to the one I showed you last time.
If you look at it carefully you'll see the only difference, it's configured exactly the
same way.
The only difference is the resistors have larger values and that's because this is the
very first stage of an amplifier that's going to end up at the far end powering a loud speaker
but that's to come by the end of the lecture and this particular stage doesn't need to
handle much power and so we don't need very large currents flowing in it.
So there's stage one of what's going to be a two stage common emitter amplifier.
Stage one, well the idea that there's stage one suggests there's stage two.
Stage two looks identical in configuration almost, I don't have an input here yet and
notice the resistor values are all considerably lower.
They're lower because there are bigger currents flowing in this stage.
Now both of these common emitter amplifiers are what we'd call voltage amplifiers.
Their primary purpose is to take an input voltage and make it bigger.
Now in the process they also make the power available bigger but their primary function
is to amplify voltages.
Get them up so they're out of the level where they might be subject to electrical noise.
Get them big enough to feed into a real power amplifier that can deliver power to a loud
speaker.
So it's a two stage amplifier at this point.
Each of them is connected to a 10 volt power supply and we could connect them to exactly
the same power supply although if we were really sophisticated we might isolate the
power supply slightly so that a heavy current flow in the stage two amplifier doesn't lower
the voltage to the stage one amplifier.
A lot of sophisticated things if you were designing a real amplifier that we aren't
doing here.
Now the question is how are we going to join them?
I can't just take a wire from the output of the stage one amplifier to the input of
the stage two amplifier and the reason I can't do that, remember we have this operating point
established.
For both these amplifiers if I've picked the resistors right it ought to be about five
volts so that output ought to be sitting at five volts when there's no input and it ought
to swing maybe one or two volts above five volts and one or two volts below five volts
more than that and we're likely to have distortion.
So we want to capture those swings in the output of stage one but we don't want to capture
the five volts steady operating point level.
Well what device will let us do that?
What device will let us do that is the device that blocks direct current, doesn't let DC
through, doesn't let zero frequency through but let's variations through and that is of
course a capacitor.
So we're going to couple these two circuits with a capacitor, I put a one microfarad
capacitor which is good enough for audio work probably in this situation.
Maybe it'd have to be a little bigger if we wanted to get to really base frequencies because
they're changing rather slowly but there is now our coupled amplifier and I've joined
the two power supply connections to one power supply in this case probably not the best
practice but it will do for us.
So they're now coupled and I have a two stage common emitter amplifier.
Let's look at what this amplifier does and let's add one more modification to this amplifier.
I mentioned in the previous lecture that those resistors from the emitters to ground have
multiple functions, they help stabilize the transistor against thermal runaway and things
like that but they also establish a gain that's independent of the beta of the transistor
to some extent.
So they mean you can take arbitrary transistors out of the off the shelf and put them in basically
the same circuit and they'll work the same.
But as we saw last time we had started with a gain that was of 150 or something when we
put those resistors, that resistor in, that gain dropped to about 20.
So we kind of lost gain.
Well you can get some of that gain back, you can gain back some of that gain by putting
capacitors because again the capacitors are like the resistors for the AC for the audio
frequency voltage variations and so they'll act as lower resistances and since the gain
is the load resistor over that emitter resistor there will be a higher gain for those time
varying signals that we're interested in.
So this helps boost the gain.
So that's why those capacitors are there.
So let's now see how this device works.
Well again I'm not going to wire up the whole thing on my board but I wired it up in circuit
lab and by the way if you would like to pause right now and do this in circuit lab if you're
planning to do the project or circuit lab or do circuits if you're planning to do the
project for this particular lecture this is going to be the first part of it but you're
going to have to do more.
So if you want to explore the circuit right now you could press pause, do that and come
back and we'll look at the output.
So here's the output from my circuit lab simulation of the two stage common emitter amplifier.
You can see that the voltage is swinging about roughly 5 volts that's my operating point
came out 5.1 volts in this case close enough to the middle between the zero and the ten
my two stage common emitter amplifier.
The swing is from the zero level up to about 1.7 volts above it so we're going from about
5.1 volts to 6.8 volts but the important thing is that swing that's the amplitude of the output
variations so we've got an output amplitude of 1.7 volts we've got an input amplitude
I set that input voltage to 0.01 volts peak and so we've got a gain I'm putting the absolute
value sign around it because we've got to think about the sign we've got a gain whose
magnitude is 170.
So the input voltage variations going through this two stage common emitter amplifier have
been boosted by this factor of 170 well that's about what we had with our first one stage
amplifier but we didn't have that emitter resistor in there that stabilizes things and
makes the gain basically independent of the individual characteristics of the transistor.
So with two transistors we've got back that high gain but we have a much more stable circuit
and it doesn't depend on what particular individual transistor we put in it.
So there is our two stage amplifier well I cautioned you last time we got to take into
account the sign of the gain is the gain positive or is the gain negative is it a non inverting
amplifier or is it an inverting amplifier so let's look now at the input and the output
graphs from circuit lab we would see the same things on an oscilloscope if we had a real
circuit here and this now is a non inverting amplifier why is it non inverting because
we started and went through one common emitter amplifier which we know from the previous lecture
inverts turns the sine wave upside down when the input goes high the output goes low and
now that output that's going low is fed into the second stage when the output of the first
stage goes low the output of the second stage goes high and that's when the input of the
first stage went high so it's say it's a double negation it's minus one times minus
one it's two negatives make a positive this has a positive gain and in this case the gain
is a hundred and seventy so we built a two stage common emitter amplifier here with a
gain of a hundred and seventy now this amplifier is missing something we would probably like
to have and that's a volume control we might also want to have tone controls base and treble
controls we already know how to make those we would make those with filters and we could
insert those filters at various points in the circuit but it'd be awfully nice to have
a volume control by the way what we have here is what would probably in the old days be
called a preamplifier and you might have actually in a stereo system of the 1960s or 70s or
even 80s you might have bought a separate preamplifier and then a power amplifier and
the volume control probably would have been in the preamplifier so how do we add a volume
control well let me show you a device that we're going to use to add a volume control
here I have a device which is called a potentiometer now don't worry you're not going to see a big
clunky thing like this with a ceramic base and all this heavy-duty stuff in a audio amplifier
this is an ancient and very heavy and very power handling capability potentiometer what's
a potentiometer well a potentiometer is another kind of resistor what kind of resistor is
it well it's basically a resistor and what we have here in fact is coils of wire around
around a piece of ceramic and they start here and they go all around here and the resistance
in this particular case just happens to be a hundred ohms so between this terminal and
this terminal is just a hundred ohm resistor but what we also have is a middle terminal
and that middle terminal connects through this mechanism to this adjustable slider and that
slider can move and so it contacts different parts of this resistance so right now it's
in the middle and so the resistance from here to here is 50 ohms half of the total resistance
or from here to here and the resistance from here to here is 50 ohms so what I've got is
a voltage divider which if I put a voltage across these two outer terminals I will get
half that voltage at the middle on the other hand if I put say plus 10 volts here and zero
volts here now I'll have five volts in the middle if I crank all the way over to here
so it's connected to the 10 I'll have 10 volts and if I crank all the way down to here I'll
have zero volts and so what this potentiometer allows me to do it's a variable voltage divider
it allows me to divide the voltage as I choose by turning what you would see as the user
this knob which turns that variable piece so it's a little bit more than a variable resistor
a variable resistor would have two terminals and a knob and if you turn the knob you would
change the resistance this does something more than that it taps off a fraction of the
voltage that's applied across the whole thing and by the way if you wanted to have just
a plain variable resistor you could make it by taking the resistance across either pair
of terminals with the middle this pair or this pair and you'd get the resistance between
the first point and the middle point and that would vary as you turn the slider so that's
a potentiometer and one of its many uses is to be a volume control in an audio amplifier
in the old days a big powerful one like this might have been used for something like controlling
the brightness of a light bulb but we know that's a horribly inefficient thing to do
nowadays because most of the power would be dissipated as heat in this resistor and we
have far better electronic ways to handle that problem I mentioned that that's not what
you would find for a volume control in an amplifier well a volume control probably in
an older amplifier or one of those tube radios I showed you might look like this and it's
a similar thing you just can't see it because the variable or the resistance is hidden behind
this metal case but you do see the three terminals the two that mark the end of the resistance
and the one in the middle and so what we have if we want to add a volume control to our
amplifier is a potentiometer and I've placed the potentiometer in this case at the output
of the first amplifier and before the input to the second stage now I've got to be a little
bit careful in doing this I'm introducing a new resistor into the circuit that wasn't
there and that's going to mess up the biasing and the operating point of the stage one amplifier
unless that potentiometer has a much much bigger resistance than that 10 kilo ohm resistor that
I've got as the load resistance in my stage one so I you know I might need 100 kilo ohms 200
kilo ohms that's getting awfully big so if I were redoing this amplifier I might actually put
the volume control at the output of the second stage because then the potentiometer resistance
would only need to be much bigger than the 500 ohm load resistance in that case but it
doesn't really matter the idea is here as I slide that slider up and down and you can see the symbol
for the potentiometer it's a resistor and then it's got this little pointy arrow which represents
the slider that you can imagine moving up and down along that resistance if I move it all the way up
I get the most volume I can have I get the full output of stage one if I move it all the way down
to the ground I get zero and even though stage one is producing an output there's no input to
stage two so that is our volume control now so far we have a nice two-stage common emitter
voltage amplifier we've increased the gain by putting those capacitors across the emitter
resistors we've added a volume control pretty good the problem though with this and many other
amplifiers is in this configuration even if there's no input to these amplifiers there is still
current flowing through their load resistors and through the transistors because we're trying to
hold that operating point about halfway between in this case the 10 volt supply voltage and the
zero volts of ground and that means we're dissipating power in the load resistors and we're
dissipating power in the transistors and we're wasting energy now at the early stages of an
amplifier it's not a problem because it's not a lot of power but when you want to build a 200 watt
audio amplifier you would really like it when the music is quiet for that thing not to be drawing
much power out of the power line and if you simply continued with bigger and bigger power versions
of this common emitter amplifier you would be dissipating hundreds of watts even when the
thing was completely quiet and you don't want that that's a crazy waste of power contributing to
climate change doing all kinds of bad stuff that you don't want to do and wasting your electric
bill and heating up the amplifier and making the components where it's all kinds of bad things so
we need to develop a power amplifier that can handle lots of power and drive a loud speaker for
an audio amplifier but that won't dissipate power when things are quiet and that circuit is called
an emitter follower well not quite the emitter follower is going to be part of that circuit the
emitter follower is a current amplifier it's also called a common collector configuration because
you'll notice that the collector of the transistor is connected directly to the power supply which
along with ground is another common point in the circuit shared by everything and so this is a common
collector not a common emitter but a common collector amplifier also called an emitter
follower why is it called an emitter follower because we take the output at the emitter and the
output basically follows the input so what happens is we have a voltage gain which is basically one
it's actually a little bit less than one if we're dealing with small voltages because of that point
seven volt drop across the base to emitter junction so this amplifier does not have it has no
vote well I don't want to say it has no voltage gain doesn't have zero voltage gain it has a
voltage gain of one it doesn't gain you anything in voltage it passes the input voltage through as an
output voltage but what it does do is amplify current so there comes a small base current in
down comes a much bigger collector current beta times the base current beta being the current
gain of the transistor both of those combine and go through the emitter resistor and the output
voltage is approximately the input voltage minus the point seven volts at that junction but there's
a lot more current so this is a current amplifier and because it's amplified current there's also a
lot more power available to pass through that load resistance then there would have been coming into
the input so it is a power amplifier so where are voltage amplifiers but this one is amplifying
power by amplifying current and you could replace that load resistor by a loud speaker if you wanted
to so there is the emitter follower a current amplifier a power output stage sort of for big
power amplifiers but so far it's still not all that good let's just take a quick look at it the
current gain of this thing is I through the load the load is now in the emitter lead so it's
carrying both the emitter current and the base current so it's beta plus one beta for the current
coming through the collector remember beta is about a hundred or so one for the extra current
coming in through the base beta plus one is close enough to beta because beta is on the order of a
hundred who cares whether it's a hundred or a hundred and one or ninety nine or a hundred and
fifty or a hundred and fifty one doesn't matter so it's essentially approximately beta the problem
with this amplifier is it to when we're in the quiescent state has to be biased or that transistor
will turn off when the input voltage goes negative and we therefore are going to have to bias this
one just like we did the other amplifier in some similar scheme and we're going to be dissipating a
lot of power when things are quiet and that now matters because that resistor if it's a loud speaker
typically has eight ohms of resistance it's very low lots of current is going to flow there's going
to be significant voltage the power supply voltage for a big power amplifier might be 30 or 40 volts
maybe even more a lot of power we don't like that we're wasting energy we're heating up that load
resistor we don't need to so what can we do that would make this better well remember when we talked
about semiconductors I mentioned that we have of course the beauty of semiconductors is we have
these two kinds of semiconductors p-doped and n-doped p-type and n-type they're complementary one
has positive charge carriers holes the other has negative charge carriers electrons and we've
been dealing almost exclusively since then with NPN bipolar junction transistors but I pointed out
when I introduced transistors that we could equally well make a PNP bipolar junction transistor
which is complementary and what we're going to do now is develop a complete output amplifier
stage the final stage it's going to drive the speaker and we're going to make use of that
complementarity of the two transistors we're going to develop a circuit called complementary
symmetry now I'm going to show you the simplest rendition of complementary symmetry I should
point out that if you look at circuits for real amplifiers there are in fact asymmetries between
the workings of PNP and NPN transistors and they have to do with the different ability of holes
and electrons to move and carry current and so sometimes you will see circuits that you'll
scratch your head about looks like they have two NPN transistors but they're actually simulating a
PNP transistor with an NPN circuit I'm going to show you is going to be truly complementary and use
a and one NPN transistor and one PNP transistor so how does this work here is our basic emitter
follower amplifier now I'm first going to take that load resistance and move it so it goes out to
the right it's the same circuit you remember you can draw circuit any way you want as long as you
got the connections right so that is the same circuit I just showed you just got the load
resistor going off to the right and now I'm going to bring in a PNP transistor and I'm going to
connect its collector not to ground but to a negative supply voltage so maybe I've got plus 10
volts at the top of the collector of the collector of the NPN transistor and I've got minus 10 volts
at the collector of the PNP transistor and you'll notice I've connected their two bases together
and just to emphasize that word symmetry I'm going to redraw it with the base the input connection
to the middle so now this thing is completely symmetric draw a horizontal line through it
especially if I'd run that ground connection sideways we'd have perfect symmetry and we do
have perfect symmetry electrically we got an NPN transistor on the top a PNP transistor on the
bottom positive power supply at the top negative power supply again relative to ground so the
collector of the lower transistor is 10 volts say below ground but one of the top is 10 volts
above ground if we're talking 10 volts there's 20 volts between the V plus supply and the minus
supply and now how are we going to get an input into this thing well let's take a look at what
we've got with our load line analysis so there's the load line analysis we did in the previous
lecture for an NPN transistor we have this load voltage we have the load current they have to
lie somewhere along that diagonal line the load line they also have to lie somewhere along those
characteristic curves the transistor curves and I pointed out when I first drew these for a transistor
transistors only work in one direction so we don't draw all four quadrants but now we have two
transistors there's cutoff and saturation for the NPN transistor but we also have the PNP transistor
with its own load line and its own saturation and cutoff and what's the idea behind this
complementary symmetry amplifier here's how it works suppose V in is zero well if V in is zero
then both transistors are at cutoff there's no current flowing anywhere and V out is zero but
what if V in is greater than zero if V in is greater than zero we get some current flowing in
through the input lead through the base emitter junction because that's going to be forward
biased out through the load resistor and to ground if V in is zero and that means the upper
transistor the PNP trans the NPN transistor is conducting it's working it's transesting it's
being a transistor and we get a bigger collector current and the collector current flows through
the load resistance and to ground and we've got amplification but that's only going to work if V is
greater than zero in fact this is what was wrong this looks like the common emitter amplifier I
started with as our first try and I said it doesn't work and it didn't work because if the input
went negative the base emitter diode was shut off and the thing didn't pass any current nothing
happened but now we have that second transistor and so what happens if V in is less than zero well
if V in is less than zero everything goes the opposite way we get a small current flowing in
from ground if you will through the load resistor and in through the base emitter junction which is
forward biased now going to the left in other words if we put a negative V in we draw a little bit
of base current like that and that causes a much bigger collector current and again the collector
current goes the other way because it's a PNP transistor and now we get current flowing from
right to left a big current flowing from right to left in the load resistor so the beauty of this
thing is it will amplify when the input signal goes positive by turning on the NPN transistor and
it will amplify when the input signal goes negative by turning on the PNP transistor that's why it's
complementary we have these two complementary transistors and they complement each other one of
them amplifies the positive going half of the cycle and the other amplifies the negative going
half of the cycle beautiful and what beauty of it is when there is no input when the input is zero
neither transistor is on we're dissipating no power we only draw power when crash the symbols
crash and a lot of current has to flow when the music is quiet no power great it solved their
power problem however it's got another subtle problem and here's the subtle problem I did a
simulation of this circuit in circuit lab to show you it's got an eight ohm load I've got a V out
label they got 10 volts there at the NPN transistor minus 10 at the bottom I've got an input sine wave
coming in and I'm showing you pictures of V in and V out they're not identical for two reasons one
is V out is actually a little bit less than V in there's a number of factors there these transistors
you're using in these simulations are in some sense like real transistors they've got some aspects
that we've been ignoring part of the reason for that the other part of the reason is there's that
seven tenths of a volt drop across the diode and that seven tenths of the volt of a volt drop
across the diode leads to the other problem look at that V out graph the lower graph you see we
get a nice rising sine wave but then we get this little flat part uh-oh and then we go down to the
negative half as the lower transistor the PNP transistor kicks in and starts amplifying but
there's that little short time when it's zero why and why don't we want that well let me tell you
first why we don't want that and that'll tell you why it occurs here's why we don't want that I'm
going to play you a sound that is basically two seconds of what the output of this amplifier
sounds like followed by two seconds of actually it's going to start the other way it's going to be
two seconds of pure 440 Hertz a above middle C tone as it should be as the input would sound for
example in this case and then I'm going to play two seconds of the output and it's going to repeat
that so you will be able to hear the difference between what the input signal sounds like and
what the output signal sounds like so take a listen and I think you'll agree that the distortion is
plainly evident in that case this is not high fidelity high fidelity means faithfully reproduce
fidelity faithfully reproduce the input we are not faithfully reproducing the input and it's
because of that little glitch that occurs now why does that glitch occur it occurs because what does
it take to turn on the NPN transistor it doesn't take a voltage going positive it takes a voltage
going above that point seven volts that it takes to turn on the diode and what does it take to turn
on the PNP transistor it doesn't just take the input going negative it takes the input going
below that point seven volts so when the PNP transistor will turn on and current will flow
from right to left through it problem and so that little glitch is caused by the transistors
turning off during that interval when the input voltage is between plus point seven volts and
minus point seven volts neither transistor conducts and the output therefore is zero that's called
crossover distortion it's occurring when we cross over from the upper transistor conducting to the
lower transistor conducting and by the way you'll notice I've got a 2N3904 that's the designation
of a transistor and a 2N3906 there are transistors that are made to be basically matched complementary
pairs 1NPN 1PNP and the 2N3904 and 3906 are such a pair so what do we do about this crossover
distortion how do we get rid of the crossover distortion well there's an easy trick so our
trick for getting rid of the crossover distortion is to simply put a couple of diodes running in
a string with resistors in series with them nice and symmetrically from the plus 10 volts down to
the minus 10 volts and so there's going to be current coming down through that string of resistor
and diode both diodes are forward biased current is flowing down through that string and both diodes
therefore have point seven volts across them the input is coming to the gap between the two diodes
and what the diodes effectively do is they take the base of the upper transistor the NPN transistor
and they make it point seven volts positive so it's just on the verge of turning on and the
lower diode takes the base of the bottom transistor the PNP one and it makes it point seven volts
below ground and therefore just on the verge of turning on that one and so now is if the input
signal swings even the slightest bit positive bingo the upper transistor is on if the input
swings even the slightest bit negative the in the lower transistor goes on and we have no
crossover distortion and the graphs of the input and output show that these things are identical
what a great and elegant solution to that problem relating to that internal ultimately that internal
electric field of the PN junction okay well I could stop there but I'm not going to I want to
say one other thing I'm going to now give you a mantra which I'm going to be repeating from now
to the end of the course it's a very strange mantra for someone who wants you to learn electronics
and build electronics and the mantra is well let me tell you the mantra it the mantra is don't
build buy or buy don't build because nobody today would go out and build an audio amplifier from
scratch unless you want to do it as kind of a learning process you would go out and buy an
integrated circuit audio amplifier and I'm going to just show you in the last few minutes what one
sounds like so what I have over here let me turn on the oscilloscope on the big screen so you can
see it what I have over here is a so-called LM 386 integrated circuit audio amplifier it's got 10
transistors in it seven resistors and a couple of diodes not surprisingly it has a kind of
complimentary symmetry output although as I mentioned it fakes it with NPN transistors it's all on
that little chip everything I'm coupling it out through up to a loudspeaker that's built into my
little breadboard here and we are going to listen to the output of that loudspeaker once I turn it
on and there's the music and once again it's once again the music is my sister's hammered
dulcimer playing and if you want to know what the music looks like if you've ever wondered what
music looks like there it is on the oscilloscope screen that's the input so when I turn off the
amplifier it doesn't turn off now that's a cute little amplifier costs a few cents maybe a few
tens of cents to buy one of those chips it can produce up to a watt of power not a huge amount
but significant for many applications if that's not beefy enough for you well go to this one don't
build buy it this is an LM 3886 integrated circuit audio amplifier and it can produce 68 watts
continuously 134 watts in peaks and it costs about ten dollars it's used in high-end televisions
stereo systems others and it's basically a complete audio amplifier you hang a few more
components resistors and capacitors on the outside of both of these to give them the gain you want
and some other features but basically they're audio amplifiers all in themselves but they work on
the principles we've just learned here so that's the end of this lecture if you want to do the
project you're going to build your own complete audio amplifier
okay your project here is to simulate the combination of a two-stage common emitter amplifier so if
you did the previous project you already built one stage of that and maybe if you did the lab
part of this lecture during the lecture you've already got part of that done and then
combine it with a diode bias complementary symmetry output stage to make a complete audio
amplifier remember that diode biasing was to take out that crossover distortion so use the two-stage
CE amplifier earlier in this lecture which you may have built use the complementary symmetry
amplifier that i just introduced couple them with mic one micro farad capacitors and for the input
use a 25 millivolt one kilohertz sine wave find the voltage gain and calculate the power delivered
to the load okay well here is what my circuit looks like in circuit lab it's basically the circuit
i showed you in the lecture it's basically the two circuits now they've been coupled with that
coupling capacitor between the CE amplifier which itself has a coupling capacitor between its two
stages and there we are with the diodes that bias to prevent that crossover distortion and so on
and so we're supposed to find the voltage gain and calculate the power delivered to the load
so let's simulate this circuit and we're on a time domain simulation and there we are okay
so we are looking at a voltage swing of something on the order of going from 0 volts up to about
one and a half volts or 1.7 volts maybe and down to about minus 1.7 volts at the output
so a swing of 3.4 volts at the output and the swing at the input is 50 millivolts from plus 25
down to minus 25 so 50 millivolts to 3.4 volts let's try to figure that out if it was 100 millivolts
it would be a gain of 10 to get to 1 volt a gain of 34 to get to 3.4 volts and so it's twice that
because it's only 50 millivolts that's a gain of about 68 so there's the gain and let's go through
that calculation a little more carefully here's the calculation gain is about 1.7 volts over 0.025
volts those are the peak amplitudes and that is the 68 I just calculated in my head and the power
to rl well power is v squared over r for a resistor with a known voltage across it and you work that
out it comes out 360 milliwatts that's doesn't sound like a whole lot you probably have a 200 watt
stereo amplifier or something but it's actually significant audio power for most uses your cell
phone for example probably produces about 30 milliwatts of audio power when it's on speaker phone
so this is 10 times that so it's a reasonably significant power let's take a look at the
same amplifier in two circuits I won't bother to go through the whole thing but there it is
looks the same I've used batteries instead of that has batteries for its DC power sources I've used a
function generator nice function generator that we have available a simulated instrument
in two circuits and if I run it and run the time domain analysis I get results that are similar but
they're not identical and I'm not absolutely sure why they aren't perhaps the transistors have different
specs or other things are wrong but you can see clearly we've got the amplification the input and
output are approximately in phase and we're looking pretty good so there is a complete audio amplifier
and that really is a significant achievement to be able to build that much a two-stage pre-amplifier
a complementary symmetry output stage complete with those diodes for eliminating distortion
good work building that amplifier
