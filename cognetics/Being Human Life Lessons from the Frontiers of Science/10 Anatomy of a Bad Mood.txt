We are back.
I since the last lecture have changed my shirt.
I've been dry cleaned and martinized.
My batteries have been replaced and hopefully the same has occurred for you because we are
ready to push into hopefully uncomfortable and familiar terrain.
Here's the scenario and I'll bet there's a good chance you have experienced this at
some point or other.
You were with a friend, a good friend, your significant other, your beloved, whoever it
is and you've been a jerk.
You've done something really jerky.
I don't mean you had a slightly abrasive tone of voice or you kind of ignored.
I mean you've done something totally jerky and your beloved is pissed off at you.
They express this.
The two of you have a fight and you are totally defensive saying no I didn't do that or if
I did I didn't say that and if I did I didn't mean that or you were misinterpreting all
that.
And at some point you finally stop and you think a little bit about what you've done
and you realize oh upon reflection it is undeniable I've been a jerk that really was
a jerky thing that I did.
And you realize that and you apologize, you do it emphatically.
You try to make it sound sincere.
You actually sincerely mean it and it works.
Your beloved accepts your apology and sort of realizes that not that much harm was done
and does you a don't do that again though and gives you an angry final flare of the nostrils
and you're kind of feeling good by now.
You realize well for that magnitude of a jerkiness I kind of got off easy and that
flare of the nostrils kind of looked good there and your mind is heading and then suddenly
suddenly your beloved just when you thought it was all over with your beloved dredges
up some jerky thing that you did during the first Reagan administration.
Some jerky thing that you can't even remember anymore but they remember every single detail
of it and they just want to go all over it every detail and you thought it was over with
and what are they doing?
Where did this come from?
Are they just trying to tornado this torpedo this whole relationship?
It's just why did they bring this up?
And what we'll be seeing in this lecture is there's a very good explanation for it and
it has to do with the fact that your limbic system and your autonomic nervous system function
at different speeds.
OK, that's going to begin to explain this problem.
Where we start off with is the famed philosopher, psychologist William James around 1900 or
so.
One of the great influential thinkers of the time and you can tell that by the fact that
all the photos of him were in black and white and him looking sideways.
This is your textbook dead white male.
This is the sort of guy that people named buildings after.
And remarkably enough William James, the man not the billion building, William James
is going to give us some insight into why your apology and the recovery from that fight
with your beloved went off the track so dramatically.
Now what we begin to focus on here in this lecture is a very simple question which is
how does your brain figure out what emotions you're supposed to be feeling?
Now we've got a very standard contemporary model for how that works.
Which is, for example, you see something which is a rousing of strong emotions, fear.
For example, you step outside your bathroom and you're about to head down the hall and
unexpectedly there is a large grizzly bear there.
So what happens?
The information is taken in by your eyes which send it up to as we heard earlier, your primary
visual cortex that turns those little pixels of bear into lines and then eventually into
your associational visual cortex which says, oh my, that's actually a grizzly bear and
then wakes up your limbic system, in particular your amygdala, which has an excited realization
that this is not good news and you're already feeling the emotions.
You're already feeling the pants wetting terror at finding a bear just outside your bathroom
and eventually, like a second or two later, your brain via the limbic system gets around
to notifying the rest of your body of this.
How does it do this?
By way of a system, the nervous system, we've already heard referred to the autonomic nervous
system.
Okay, a bit of a review of the autonomic nervous system.
Now most of what you are doing when your brain is commanding your body's muscles to make
some sort of action is voluntary.
You shake somebody's hand, you sign a check, you foxtrot and whatever, but then there's
a whole domain where your brain, your central nervous system is sending commands out to
your body having to do with things you normally don't have much conscious control over.
Things like goose flesh and orgasms and pupillary contractions and blushing and your stuff that
is automatic.
And thus the term for this part of the nervous system is the automatic or the autonomic nervous
system projecting down from your brain and sending all the way down out to your fingertips
to make them feel clammy out to all the hair cells or remnants of hair cells throughout
your body and you get goose flesh down to your heart down to sending out all of these
autonomic signals telling your body what emotional state your brain is in and thus
what bodily state should be happening to match it.
Just to complete the overview the autonomic nervous system comes in two halves.
First half sympathetic nervous system, emergency arousal, all hell breaking, loose heart racing
and contrast the parasympathetic nervous system, calm vegetative function.
Okay so what we have here in our contemporary scenario is you've seen the bear thanks to
your visual cortex processing it and trying to figure out what all those pixels mean and
waking up the amygdala and saying there's a bear and the amygdala being part of your
emotional limbic mediated realization that this is not a good thing and then your amygdala
sends relays down to your hypothalamus and midbrain and brainstem and down your autonomic
nervous system, your sympathetic nervous system and your blood pressure goes up and your heart
is racing and your body has gotten the news from your brain as to what your emotional
state is.
So this is our current model.
Nice elaboration on it came a few years ago actually from a wonderful neuroscientist named
Joseph Liddo at New York University who changed that model a little bit with some really interesting
research he had done.
So our model just now was yes your brain figures out its emotional state and then tells the
rest of your body how to go along with this.
What he showed was a slight modification there.
Our model just now was sensory information comes in and is processed by your cortex and
the first layer to the second and the third and so on and eventually wakes up the amygdala.
With that sort of process the bear would already be eating your liver by the time your amygdala
was sending this message down what Liddo and colleagues found was a shortcut, a pathway
which not only does this visual information come in and start churning its way through
the visual cortex there's this side pathway there that shoots straight to the amygdala.
In other words your amygdala is getting information that there's a bear there before your cortex
is actually consciously processed it.
What's that about?
That's times where reaction times are so fast you were already responding, running, breathing
fast before you were fully processed what's going on there.
This seems to be what's happening instead.
Interesting complication that comes out of this.
This is great in that the shortcut may allow you to have defensive responses really fast
before you're even consciously aware of it but something you have as a price to pay which
is when you get this shortcut you are sending visual information kind of this big bear like
thing coming at you before your cortex has really done the careful analysis on it.
This side path means your amygdala is getting emotionally laden sensory information is getting
real fast but it's not necessarily all that accurate.
Nonetheless, we still have the same general model which is your brain sees something and
figures out what it is, figures out that it's scary as we've just seen in this Liddo model
perhaps the this is scary is coming even before you have the conscious awareness of
what it is but in either case your brain is figured out what's happening emotionally
and has sent the signal down and your sympathetic nervous system kicks into gear and that's
how things work.
This is not how things work according to William James and this was his remarkably counter
intuitive notion that he came up with back when which is the flow of information is exactly
the opposite.
Your brain doesn't figure out its emotional state and tell your body how to respond your
body first has its bodily response and based on that your brain figures out how it feels
about it.
This seems totally bizarre here is a classic Jamesian scenario that he would say where
perhaps not the bear just outside your bathroom but nonetheless you see the bear and unconscious
pre-conscious subconscious not conscious stuff goes on in your brain and is already telling
your body how to respond you don't know yet what you're looking at and this is scary your
body begins to tremble and as a result of trembling your conscious brain in effect sits
there and says oh my I'm trembling why should that be is it because I forgot to flush the
toilet is it because I didn't turn it's because there's a bear here and I feel a sense of
panic totally opposite flow of information.
To James theory of emotion actually he got a sidekick named Lang who nobody ever knows
anything about but the James Lang theory of emotion which is unconscious processing of
sensory stimuli which gets a bodily response and part of how you consciously decide what's
going on out there how you feel about it is your brain your conscious brain is canvassing
what's going on in my body and if I'm trembling let me look around there must be something
which is causing that trembling to occur totally counterintuitive turns out there's a little
bit of support for it and in some interesting domains for example a psychiatric malady
of people who have panic attacks there's some understanding these days panic attacks were
suddenly somebody has a floridly aroused anxious state totally driven by sympathetic nervous
system and for no reason at all and they are flooded with panic flooded with anxiety there's
increasing evidence that there's a chemical which can get into the blood stream under
some circumstances called lactic acid and lactic acid in some individuals could trigger
a panic attack and you can even do with a great deal of careful supervision and human
subjects approval you can even inject people with lactic acid and people who are prone
towards panic attack that will trigger it in there at the time the lactic acid is initially
causing a whole bunch of bodily changes and the brain is sitting there saying my heart
is racing all the it must be because whatever the grounds for panic is in this case it is
very clear a peripheral bodily state changing in this case the stuff that lactic acid is
doing your brain if you were prone towards panic attacks your brain is looking for attribution
and comes up with it here's a reason to be utterly panicked so this is support for it
but for the most part though there's not support for this James and this James line model for
a number of reasons first off the autonomic nervous system the sympathetic response doesn't
kick into gear all that quickly you are responding to whatever that bear is invoking in you you're
having the emotional change when you look closely it's occurring sooner than you're
having the large autonomic changes the other reason that votes against the strict model
your brain figures out what emotions it is feeling based upon what's happening in your
body is how undifferentiated the sympathetic nervous system response can be your heart
your blood pressure they're doing very similar things if you were overcome with joy or overcome
with terror it can't be the strict Jamesian model of your brain says well what do I feel
about this well what's my blood pressure how much am I sweating out of the bottom of my
feet how much oh that's what I'm feeling so the strict Jamesian model goes down the
tube there nonetheless what there's lots of evidence for lots of things to think about
is that your peripheral state your autonomic state signals from the body may not be telling
you exactly what attribution to make but it may be biasing it may be changing the intensity
of the emotions you feel and maybe making you more or less sensitive to certain cues
in your environment that would validate your emotional conclusions more and more evidence
for that there's one domain of research that supports this and this has to do with facial
expressions facial expressions and the fact that often your brain is deciding how it feels
about something by an effect canvassing your face the facial feedback hypothesis trying
to decide how am I feeling based on what my facial muscles are doing this seems totally
backwards in a Jamesian counterintuitive way this can't be nonetheless some really interesting
studies supporting this okay here's the first take home experiment to do with this course
try this unless you're on audio and driving take a pen and put it in your mouth and you
need to hold the pen in a certain way and when this was first tested on people they
were told we're trying to work out some device for the handicapped here you have to hold
a pen in your mouth one of two ways either holding it with your lips or holding it with
your front teeth your scientifically mobilized incisors holding it there and if you do that
what you'll see is when you're holding it with your lips you're clamping down and your
lips a lot and your facial muscles tend to go down and if you're doing this instead with
your front teeth your mouth tends to pull in the remotest crudest sort of way this is
kind of a pen in your lips induced frown and this one is a kind of pen in your teeth smile
and you make people do this a whole bunch of times over and over either the lips version
or the tooth version and they start to have emotions that are consonant with the frown
or the smile shown in these studies you have people who've just spent their five minutes
running around at high speed holding the pen either with their lips or hold them in your
teeth with your mouth going up in some fake pseudo-smileish way and people rate cartoons
as being funnier afterward than if they were holding it with their lips and this sort of
approach has actually been used in a therapeutic setting you take somebody with severe depression
and you force them to go through this completely artificial silly exercise of pretend to smile
again give me a really big smile and you put somebody through that state and someone
with a depression on the average will begin to feel better something about how that person's
brain is working is saying life is awful I am just as despairing but whoa my cheek muscles
keep doing this thing that is associated with smiling maybe things don't feel that bad.
Now more evidence for this kind of modified James Ian view comes from facial expression
stuff as well more of this facial feedback stuff you take one of the most dramatically
life-changing civilization altering medications out there Botox get Botox and if you are of
a certain narcissistic ilk what you do at a certain age is you stuff your face and your
lips and everything else full with Botox and you look nice and smooth and cheroopic and young
but among other things your facial expressions are a whole lot more blunted now than they
would have been without the Botox and what the studies have shown is you get Botox into
people's faces and there's less muscular correlates of emotion people under those circumstances
feel less emotion one remarkable study you take people with or without Botox I assume
they didn't inject people with Botox for this experiment but they recruited volunteers
but in this one study you get people with or without Botox and you ask them to mimic
a certain emotional state a strong one in this case anger and you stick them in a brain
scanner I'll allow some of our earlier lectures and what you see is you look at the amygdala
the part of the brain that as we know is all involved in fear and all of that and you force
somebody to pretend that they are angry and people with Botox not only rate themselves
as feeling less extreme anger they don't feel the emotions intensely but their amygdala
don't get as activated something about their amygdala and brain and limbic system is sitting
there saying well I'm pretending I'm really angry but if my facial muscles aren't doing
a whole lot maybe I'm not so angry after all more evidence for this you look at people
quadriplegics of a type where they're also not getting sensory information coming in
more blunted perception of emotions not getting the bodily signals there's some rare diseases
where the autonomic nervous system is not working quite right and what you see there
is somebody can have the exact same emotional processing in their brains but there's not
as much of a bodily response less emotions are perceived emotions are perceived as blunted
okay so we're seeing evidence here in all sorts of ways that some stuff going on in
your body probably most dramatically sort of your facial muscles can bias you towards
reaching certainly certain emotional conclusions not the classic Jamesian model where it is
inventing the solutions if you happen not to tremble when you see the bear you would
not fear the bear being there whatsoever but nonetheless modulating in that direction not
causing but modulating so more evidence for this and this goes into one of the all-time
classic experiments in psychology famous famous psychologist in the early 60s family shactor
and what he was exploring was the notion that some of the time what your brain is doing is
not so much having an emotion caused by what's going on in your body but what your brain does
is if you were having a strong bodily response of some sort or other your brain sits there
and doesn't say oh I'm going to invent this emotion but what it does is it looks around
in effect in the world around you looking for environmental cues emotionally relevant cues
which it can attribute that bodily state to okay this is nice and abstract here is the classic
famous shactor experiment he got a whole bunch of volunteers and as per classic psychology
studies in a way that can't be done quite that readily anymore he lied to people he told them
they were getting a new type of vitamin he made up a name it was called suproxen which
supposedly helps your eyesight people were not really getting this new imaginary vitamin what
they were getting instead was a slow acting form of adrenaline also known as epinephrine
adrenaline adrenaline which kicks the sympathetic nervous system into action people were getting
adrenaline without knowing that that's what they were getting so we had four different groups one
group got placebo another group got the adrenaline and they were accurately informed what the side
effects were now this suproxen stuff may make your heart raise may make your breathing rate
increase that's part of what it makes the side effects that's what's going on in the third group
they got the adrenaline but they were not informed about any side effects in the fourth group they
got the adrenaline but they were misinformed they said oh you might get an itchiness in between your
third and fourth toes you might get a bit of a headache they were not given a way to attribute
their bodily responses so we've got these groups of the three groups getting the adrenaline one
group knew this stuff suproxen stuff is supposed to make my heart race and the second and third
groups had no idea idea at all now they are released out into the waiting room in this
psychologist's office where presumably they're coming in in a while to have their eyesight tested
with new wonderful suproxen but the actual experiment of course was occurring in the waiting room
confederates of shactor people working with him would be in the office there'd be one of them
they're out in the waiting room and they would have one of two styles either the person would be
a total angry over the top impossible they're looking at their watch saying this is ridiculous
i was supposed to have a one o'clock appointment for this psych test i can't i'm gonna miss my class
my car's gonna get towed they can all or in the other case the person is there highly extroverted
in a positive sort of way saying wow i love these psychology tests don't you i love doing these
are you a psych major what year are you what dorm are you in these were college students of course
totally affable so what happens with the people who have the adrenaline on board their hearts racing
where they know this is due to that suproxen stuff my heart's supposed to be racing
nothing happens to them they just continue going about their business what happened in
the two groups the misinformed and the uninformed those two groups where their heart was racing
but they had no way to attribute it to this ridiculous fake vitamin they attributed it to
the social environment instead and in those two groups when it was the angry confederate in there
prompting them before you knew it they're up yelling at the receptionist and saying i can't
waste my time on this and when they're instead with the highly extroverted affable confederate
within two minutes they're up and singing college songs and inviting the person to dinner and what
do we have in these cases if you know why your heart is racing you're not searching for a
shaktarian attribution in the world around you on the other hand if you're having some really strong
bodily state and you have no idea why that may be going on you search around for explanations
and this is a frequent picture with the effects of other hormones as well
testosterone doesn't cause aggression oxytocin as we've heard about before
doesn't so much cause trust to occur what it does is it lowers the threshold for you
deciding there's cues in the environment to elicit this more evidence for this as well
very interesting class of medications okay suppose you are having terrible problems
with anxiety and you go to the doctor and the physician decides well yes you need an
anti-anxiety drug and gives you some of that drug meanwhile across town there is some competitive
gymnast who has been thanks to an injury getting muscle spasms in their shoulder and they go to
their muscle spasm doc who gives them a muscle relaxant to try to make things better so they
have their medication and the remarkable thing is it's the same medication in both cases
in both cases a class of drugs called benzodiazepines benzodiazepines we all know some of the
common versions of those in valium, libraium, weight in this part of the town they decrease
anxiety but in that part of town they relax your muscles how can that be classic jamesian
scenario of feedback from the body benzodiazepines a lot of what they do is they decrease muscle
tension how does that reduce anxiety you're sitting there in your chair and life is just
as awful as it used to be in as much grounds for panic but you are so relaxed it's like you
were a bowl of jello dribbling over the chair and if your body is feeling that relaxed maybe
i don't need to be quite as worried some feedback at that level the way pain increases the likelihood
of depression all of these wind up being examples where your brain is not deciding what emotion
is going on as a function of what's happening in the peripheral autonomic world but what it's
doing is it biases it towards having a more intense version of what was already going on
it biases it towards looking around in the world around it oh my heart is racing because
i'm angry just like that person is it is massaging all these circumstances so that brings us back to
our original scenario you've been the jerk your beloved is furious you apologize it should be all
over with and just when it's about to be your beloved dredges up something awful you did way
back when you're often running all over again why did they do that why was that brought out when it
seemed to all be over with and the critical thing is that your brain works at a different speed
than your autonomic nervous system does okay look at how fast your brain can work both your cortex
and your limbic system you're out in the crowd and somebody steps on your foot from behind really
hard bashes into your instep you're furious you spin around you're about to yell at this person
in other words your cortex is already in action telling you about this pain your limbic system
is already in action you're you turn around and you see oh the person has a cane and dark oh
they're blind they didn't mean to do that they just and you instantly shift your cortex is already
processed oh the person's blind it is already figured out no this was not some idiot slamming
into you this was somebody that and already your limbic system has changed direction with that
really fast responses you're playing some game a sport or something racquetball and obviously
your cortex and its motor instructions are going incredibly fast your emotions your limbic state
is going incredibly fast also you get a good shot you think you're king of the world is wonderful
you miss one you're hopeless your total loser switching back and forth these on and off states
in the brain both the cortex and the limbic system really really fast and the problem though is
the autonomic nervous system is like a locomotive it can't have caused these emotions as we heard
before because it takes too long for it to get started seconds and seconds but once it's all
over with your autonomic nervous system takes a whole lot longer than the brain to get back to
normal it just keeps chugging along so your cortex might know it's over with and your limbic system
might know it's over with but the rest of your body is still roaring along slowly returning
from this sympathetic nervous system storm slowly return in other words you know this is over with
the person was blind you know this was over with that jerky friend of mine has apologized you know
this is but your body is still roaring and thus your brain searches for attribution oh if we've
just had this fight and the person just apologized and my cortex knows that and my limbic system
but my heart is still racing and I'm still feeling pissed off well it's not because of this because
they just it must be because of the time they did whatever your brain is searching for an attribution
and knowing that this particular offense is now inoffensive and over with searching for and suddenly
you're often running with the thing that was almost filed away and forgotten centuries ago this seems
to be what's happening okay final final disturbing piece about this whole thing one that explains
even more of the real world there appears to be a gender difference in this a gender difference in
that on the average always saying that because there's dramatic exceptions on the average men turn
on the sympathetic nervous system more rapidly than women do and on the average women keep it
turned on for longer than men do it's a longer recovery time and what does this begin to explain
this is your stereotypical picture of men getting sexually aroused more rapidly than women
obvious exceptions and afterward that endlessly stereotypical scenario of afterward she wants
to say all sorts of sentimental whispery things cuddled up for hours afterward and all he's
thinking about is where can you get like you know Chinese noodles with peanut sauce at this time
of night different speeds of recovery this perhaps also explains why on the average there are different
speeds of recovery after the end of the fight okay so what do we have here we have a very unlikely
realm for barreling into a whole new self-help program the William James self-help program for
solving your fights and making life more what do we have here at the end we've got a recognition
our brain is embodied as discussed way beginning early in this course nothing that your brain
is doing is independent of what's going on here so maybe you should remember that the next time
you've had one of those fights and it's over with afterward get everybody to take a deep breath
turning off sympathetic tone have everybody sit down turning off sympathetic tone making it less
likely to have that miserable minute bit of misery from centuries ago dredged up at that point or
maybe the best thing to do is just take the bull by the horns there and say wait a second are we
having a William James moment and on that note I wish you wonderful wonderful relationships from here on out
