Thanks to the gargantuan efforts of just droves of scientists, we finally have a clear
piece of information.
What is a key predictor of good health?
And the answer is, if you want to be healthy, try not to be poor.
Try not to be born poor.
Try not to spend your fetal life inside the womb of someone who's poor.
As we alluded to in an earlier lecture, your socioeconomic status has tons to do with your
health.
And what is seen is now what's called the socioeconomic gradient, the fact that in disease
after disease in westernized countries, the lower you are in the socioeconomic hierarchy,
the higher the incidence of various diseases, the greater mortality rate.
This is seen with cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disorders, rheumatoid arthritis,
gastrointestinal disorder, psychiatric diseases.
The poorer you are, the more likely you are to get these diseases, succumb to it, so extreme
that when you look in the United States, in some areas of high income versus the lower
ends, there's more than a 10-year difference in life expectancy.
So of course the question has always been, why does the socioeconomic gradient exist?
And there's an obvious easy answer right off the bat, which is the reverse causality deal,
which is people who are chronically sick don't become CEOs of companies very often.
Ah, the body's health, the illness predisposes towards socioeconomic status.
But that turns out not to be the case.
And what shows this is all sorts of time course studies where you can show the socioeconomic
status of somebody at some point in life is predictive of their health at a later time.
OK, so it's not this reverse causality deal.
It's not some extreme kind of step function, which is to say everybody has roughly the
same health and life expectancy until you get to the very poor, and they've got the
big drop.
No, heading all the way down, start going from Bill Gates to Warren Buffett, and all
the way down it's a continuum.
Every step down the socioeconomic ladder.
Another obvious explanation, well, in a place like the United States, if you're poor you
don't have access to health care as readily it's an access issue.
But it turns out that doesn't explain anything either, because you look in countries with
universal health care, socialized medicine, and they've got socioeconomic status gradients
of health as well, and you see the same thing for even diseases where it doesn't matter
how often you go to the doctor, that doesn't change its incidence, juvenile diabetes, for
example.
So it's not health care access.
Maybe it's got something to do with lifestyle, with risk factors, with protective factors,
and it's obvious if you are poor you are more likely to be living next door to a toxic dump,
you are more likely to be working a job that is bad for your health, you are more likely
to be in a neighborhood that's unsafe, you are less likely to afford that health club
membership, go down and get nothing but that good old organic produce.
Yes, risk factors, protective factors, but really careful work is shown only about a
third of the relationship is explained by stuff like that.
And what people have come to recognize in this field is stress has a lot to do with it.
The stressfulness of lower socioeconomic status having something to do with health.
Now the evidence for that used to be indirect along the lines of what you just heard, well,
it's not reverse causality, it's not health care access, it's not risk factors, so maybe
it's stress in the last decade or so, the notion that it is due to stress has become
much stronger.
Work by, for example, Nancy Adler showing that yes, yes, your objective socioeconomic
status is a good predictor of health, even more so your subjective socioeconomic status.
In other words, it's not being poor, it's feeling poor.
Work by Richard Wilkinson taking this one step further.
What is it about a community that translates into socioeconomic stress?
What he shows is income inequity.
Live in a community where for the same average income there are greater extremes on the average
health is going to be worse.
What's that telling us?
It's not being poor, it's feeling poor, and the surest way of feeling poor is having your
nose rubbed in it by all the people around you.
Now this relationship, again, is remarkably permeating and hits very early in life and
lasts for a long time afterward, a remarkable study.
Some years ago looking at nuns, looking at aging nuns, all of whom who had joined the
order when they were 18, 19 or so, all of whom constitute the perfect experiment in
that from age 20 or so, they have now spent the rest of their lives perfectly controlled
the same diet, the same medical care, the same living conditions, and what those studies
have shown is your socioeconomic status at the time that you are joining this order is
a predictor of health outcomes 60 years later.
These are very persistent effects and maybe one of the best ways of summarizing how this
works was the observation that one of the best predictors of who survived the Titanic
sinking was what your socioeconomic status was.
The poorer you were, the more likely you were to go down with a ship.
So that's a whole field and lots and lots of realms where this plays out.
Now the purpose of this lecture is to look at the rare cases where instead you get an
inverse socioeconomic status.
Where the wealthier you are, the higher the incidence of the disease.
And what we'll see is this teaches us something about how the body works, the nature of disease.
It teaches us something about the nature of society and an unequal society.
And what we're going to see is the most surprising outcome of this.
It also teaches you sometimes be careful what you wish for.
Now in some cases, these diseases that show an inverse socioeconomic gradient, the wealthier
you are, the higher the incidence, in some cases it's utterly mysterious.
In that, for example, there's a bunch of autoimmune diseases.
Autoimmune diseases.
Normally what your immune system is good at is spotting stuff that's not supposed to
be in your body.
Bacteria, virus, invading pathogens, and what the immune system is brilliant at is constantly
having its cells nosing around all over the body and sampling cells that it encounters.
And it's got a whole list there of what types of cells, with what types of features, what
things are self part of us.
And thus what things are non-self, some invading something or other, and then you activate
an immune response against it and it protects your health.
Every now and then though, the immune system screws up big time and mistakes a part of
your body that really is a part of your body and is supposed to be there and decides instead
it's some invasive pathogen and goes about attacking a part of your body, an autoimmune
disease.
Now what's seen is there's some autoimmune diseases which mysteriously are more common
with higher socioeconomic status.
Rheumatoid arthritis, as I mentioned before, shows the classic relationship, the poorer
you are, the higher the incidence on the average of rheumatoid arthritis.
Meanwhile, another autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, shows the inverse gradient.
The wealthier you are, what's this about?
At this point nobody has a clue.
Now some of the time these inverse SES, socioeconomic status, these SES gradients, reflects something
about society's values and society's notion of beauty.
Amazing economist Torsten Weblen, working in the beginning of the 20th century, came
up with his grand opus, the theory of the leisure class, and one of the things he noted is that
in society after society, the wealthy work very hard to have conspicuous signs of their
wealth.
One of the ways to do that is to give off all the indicators that you don't have to
soil your wealthy status with any sort of work, physical labor.
Traditional China, the binding of the feet of girls among the wealthy in order to atrophy
the feet and the feet that are so atrophied that you couldn't possibly do any physical
labor or even move around much.
Look how wealthy I am, my feet are useless.
You can have another domain of showing off and Weblen was the one who pointed out that
if you were some rancher in the 1880s or so and you wanted to let everyone know how incredibly
wealthy you are, what do you do?
You take a piece of your grazing land and you don't let animals graze on it.
I am so wealthy, I don't even have to have my animals making use of all my land and you
want to make sure your guests see that piece of land, so have it near the house.
What have you just invented?
The lawn.
The lawn, what Weblen didn't live long enough to do though was to sort of incorporate the
notion of little plastic trolls and flamingos on lawns into his thinking about it, but lots
of cases like these where the whole point is to communicate to the world your wealth.
And for centuries one of the ways of doing that was to make sure you were alabaster white,
pale, never do you have to stand out in the sun and be pummeled by the reality of the
world that the Holy Poloid deal with, however things have changed.
And now these days if you are wealthy what you try to do is give everyone the impression
wearing your blue jeans that you're just a good old boy cowboy as soon as there's a
break in your dot com in Silicon Valley you go out to rattle up the horses or whatever
suddenly what prestige is about if you were wealthier in this country is to have this
year round tan because your beach house your ski lessons this whole world of rotisserie
signs of privileges and where do you see the inverse SES relationship here the wealthier
you are in this country the higher the incidence of melanoma the most dangerous form of skin
cancer.
Now people who are actually doing physical labor outside don't get whole body tans they
get red necks or as we know is this often the case in this country they're not getting
a whole lot in the way of a tan because of the amount of melanin they have in their skin.
Now some of the time these inverse socioeconomic gradient relationships what they reflect is
not a higher incidence of the disease but what would be called a detection bias where
depending on your SES status that influences the likelihood of you actually getting diagnosed
with the disease classic case of it a disease that shows the inverse relationship chronic
fatigue syndrome the highly mysterious disease potentially related to a virus potentially
related to God knows what very very mysterious at this stage but one of the things about
chronic fatigue syndrome is it shows the inverse gradient the wealthier you are the more likely
you are to have chronic fatigue syndrome but that's not what's really going on the wealthier
you are the more likely you already get diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in one world
the symptoms get you this fancy diagnosis in another world you just lose your job because
you keep showing up late at work so in that case it's not a real difference it is just
a bias an artifact of diagnosis that occur.
Now sometimes you see this because it's reflecting SES differences in life history trajectory
one of the things you see in westernized societies is on the average the higher the
SES status of a woman the later on the average does she have her first child delayed child
bearing what does that mean you spend more of your life having menstrual cycles you spend
more of your life exposed to the high estrogen levels that are frequently a part of that
and what does that have to do a seeming inverse SES disease the higher the social status the
higher the incidence of estrogen sensitive breast cancer endometriosis again a case where
it reflects something about differences in lifestyle.
Now another case where there is seemingly an inverse SES relationship and it turns out
not actually to be the case at all but again it's got to do with the nature of the disease
and this is that great scourge of our past thankfully in the past now unless you happen
to live in parts of the developing world polio polio what was the standard picture of polio
in the United States back when it is an inverse SES disease it's a disease of the wealthy
it's a disease of Franklin Roosevelt coming down with polio after being out on his yacht
one day it's as always was viewed a disease that shows this pattern and it turns out that's
not actually the case it is not the case that people of lower socioeconomic status kids of
lower SES are less likely to get polio they're less likely to get diagnosed with it and here's
the reason why polio if you get it at age three four whatever reeks havoc produces the
whole array of symptoms that characterizes awful tragic disease if you get polio when
you're approximately under one year of age it's pretty much asymptomatic and what you see is poorer
kids get a lot more polio because they live in much higher density they get a lot more polio but
they get it earlier in life again because of more exposure at a time when it's simply asymptomatic
and it's not appreciated as such and artifactually you have the sense now that this is a disease of
the wealthy now some of the time though what you see is real true cases of this going on and the
story I'll be telling here is one having to do with a disease a true disease of inverse
socioeconomic status one that teaches us a lot about the nature of health and the body and all
of that but also teaches us as promised a ton about the values of society it has to do with
the disease called hospitalism this is this archaic term now but hospitalism was a very
relevant term back earlier in the 20th century what was hospitalism this was a world unrecognizable
in some ways from our own this was a world of orphanages filled with children orphans
abandoned children and this was a world with mind-boggling bad survival rates in orphanages
studies done in the early 20th century one study around 1916 or so examining children in ten
different orphanages and such high mortality rates that in nine out of ten of these orphanages
none of the kids survived to age two this was a world of terrible survival rates for children
particularly in settings like that and you read some of these papers these reports from
back when these stiff mannered reviewing of the statistics on every single child being
dead and it is just heartbreaking to imagine from across these decades now there was a
particular disease related to this that would come up with kids who were in hospitals kids
are in hospitals obviously a kid is in the hospital because they're not well but there was
this additional disease that would come in termed hospitalism and this didn't begin to be
appreciated till the 1920s or so remarkable transition prior to that you did not go to the
hospital to get better you went to the hospital to be separated from everybody else who's wealthy
going to the hospital decreased your life expectancy was until the 20s that finally this
was a place to go to to actually become healthier so you've got kids in hospitals and on the average
if kids were in hospitals for more than two weeks at a time they would begin to show this
disease of hospitalism they would become archaic termed morantic after two weeks on the average
again this child would begin to become listless low energy they would develop a technical term
kekexia which is losing body weight faster than can be explained by food intake they would get
nonspecific gastrointestinal tract infections nonspecific pulmonary problems once you had
kids passing that two week mark and you began to see this hospitalism tenfold increase in the
mortality rate now what was most striking was from the very start it was recognized this was
an inverse SCS disease when a child would go to a hospital the higher the socioeconomic background
to the child the higher the likelihood of coming down with hospitalism and dying from it so what
is this about people didn't have a clue then but it is now understood and it represents the
intersection of two critical things around that period the first one in medicine was an
obsession with hygiene hygiene above everything else what medical care is most fundamentally
about is making sure people are not exposed to pathogens so this obsession with hygiene and
the other piece of explaining this is the view at the time that kids don't really need a whole
lot of tender loving care that that notion is just a bit of sentimental maternal foolishness this
was a very different time for thinking about how development worked and how parental behavior this
was long before dr. Spock influenced all of our parents and how we were raised this was a very
different time there was a dr. Spock of that period named Luther Holt and this man was exactly the
opposite of dr. Spock this man wrote the definitive textbook at the time for child rearing it around
the year 1900 decade before and after went through 15 different editions the care and feeding of
children just the title tells you something the care and feeding of plants the care and feeding of
guppies the care and feeding of children this tells you a whole lot which was what parenting should
be about is making sure kids are adequately fed kept warm enough in the book he refers to the
vicious practice of holding kids for too long advising mothers not to do that because kids are
meant to be not pampered in that way kids should be seen but not heard a completely different view
as to what constituted optimal parenting and if that's what these experts were advising everybody
out there had to go about optimal parenting you can imagine how that took hold in hospitals the
view there was a kid in a hospital should be kept warm should be fed should be all those things but
the last thing it needs is parental care pseudo parental care social contact physical touching
this was a completely different world a world in which parents were not welcome in pediatric
words if they were allowed in it was one hour a week to come and see their child and now leave
us alone to do our medical care and all of this social connection and care and affiliation
it's got nothing to do with any of this health business now we know far better and the shift
began in the 1940s a physician at New York University named Harry back when and he was the
first person to note that children in long-term hospital wards children who begin to succumb
to hospitalism they are suffering from social deprivation emotional deprivation loneliness
loneliness this is the hard-ass scientist who introduced the word lonely loneliness into the
medical literature by the 50s a scientist a pioneering one named Harry Harlow had introduced
another technical term into the medical literature love that normal development requires all sorts
of things like the avoidance of loneliness social connectedness love the evidence began to emerge
at that time evidence which anyone who was attuned to parenting or how children develop already knew
but the scientists finally got on board classic work by Harlow showing that young monkeys developing
monkeys if they had a choice of being attached to a surrogate artificial mother of forming a bond
between one that gave it food and one that gave it comfort a surrogate mother covered with nice
warm terry cloth they defied everything that Luther Holton would have told you in his pediatric
advice book in terms of what kids need is adequate calories forget the food they would become attached
to the surrogate mother that gave warmth that gave contact normal development and bonding isn't just
about getting adequate calories it's about all sorts of things in addition now in the aftermath
of this people began to do studies showing things like when baby rats are groomed by their mothers
licked and groomed which is how moms go about being good rat moms when that happens the levels
of growth hormone would rise in these baby rats it would enhance growth it would enhance health in
the 70s wonderful research done by a psychologist named Tiffany Field focusing on a population of
human infants who are incredibly isolated from normal socialization normal contact and these
were kids extreme premature kids growing up or starting their life in NICUs neonatal intensive
care units and those are just you know salutes to hygienic isolation and what she noted was these
kids who never touched they're never handled and what she did was go in and studies and increase
the amount of physical contact rubbing the backs of preemies and the backs of that side is basically
your fingers there and showing these kids grew faster they had fewer health complications what
we're seeing is all sorts of lessons about adequate calories and the right blanket every now and then
is not enough for normal development these kids would come home from the hospital earlier these
differences would persist for months afterward and it turns out this is going to tell us a lot
about hospitalism okay so we take those pieces we take that obsession with hygiene and we take
that notion that mothers maternalism let alone paternalism socialization contact love the avoidance
loneliness has nothing to do with normal development and what you would get is this vicious
cycle which is a kid would be in the hospital for some kind of surgery or who knows what and they
would begin to show signs of hospitalism with their gut infection with their pulmonary infection and
what would be the logical response ah this child has been done in by some pathogens the environment
is not hygienic enough make an even more hygienic one more isolation more being cut off from everything
that makes for normal mammalian development fewer moments where the parents were allowed in more
of this which would worsen the hospitalism which would cause even more hygienic hysteria and this
was the cycle with which it went this was where hospitalism was coming from this obscure disease
that was pandemic at that time in kids in hospitals it was because nobody recognized that all of that
social emotional development stuff was critical for normal good health just if they're beginning to
show the health consequences of loneliness and deprivation isolate them more isolate them more
so that does a lot to explain this hospitalism but what it doesn't explain is why did it show this
inverse SES relationship this business of the higher the socioeconomic status of a child the more
likely they were to begin to show the signs of hospitalism when they were prolongingly in the
hospital more likely to succumb to it what is this about this is extremely confusing and you go back
and it's the fascinating thing to do you read the medical literature from that time the pediatric
journals that would sometimes have proceedings of some conference and it would have a record
afterward of the discussion between the person presenting the people in the audience and discuss
and you would read this and there was just this palpable confusion people noting there wait a
second the mortality rate for hospitalism was higher in these wealthy hospitals you could
smell the confusion going on there nobody understood it but we understand it now all these
years later and it has a lot to do with that notion of telling you something about society what
was going on at that time there was a wonderful revolution in medicine that owed its existence
to poultry science around 1900 what scientists in the poultry business were figuring out was
how to build incubators egg incubators and this apparently transformed chicken science and incubators
and it wasn't long before it occurred to somebody to have infants who were sick premature babies
whatever in incubators as well and that was wonderful there was actually a period where
state fairs that during the summer would go cruising around the Midwest and show off the prize
calves and that sort of thing would have a display a baby in an incubator that would be donated by
poor parents and the deal was at the end of the season the child would go into a good orphanage
bizarre piece of history suddenly this notion of incubators as being good for developing
children who were sick what was going on was not all hospitals could afford these new fangled
incubators it was the wealthier hospitals and as a result it was the children winding up in
there who were put in the apogee of isolation from all the things a developing child needs a
brand new spanking incubator and that's why the rates of hospitalism were higher in the wealthier
hospitals so what's the moral that comes out of this well actually there's a bunch of them the
first is an obvious one and I noted something along this line in the earlier lecture an obvious one
that hasn't a chance of possibly going anywhere which is if you get a choice in the matter don't
be poor okay maybe there's also the moral that you know you should do something to help out those
who are poor more strikingly what this teaches you is good health is not just about germs it also
teaches you that normal child development is not just about adequate food and adequate warmth and
temperature regulation and all you have to do is look in the kids growing up in the nightmare
Romanian orphanages a decade ago or so and you see that with a vengeance what's another moral here
which is even if you're Bill Gates you need to use sunscreen but finally there's a moral that I
think is the most subtle most interesting one which is be careful what you wish for because we all
know a lot of what happens with medicine if you are a concerned individual and a loved one is sick
if you yourself is sick what you want to do is get the newest the best access the connections
somebody's cousin knows somebody who's this fancy doctor who's willing to give you consultation the
whole world of what do you want to do is get access to the bestest medicine out there and what we
see in this case is that's not always a good idea because somewhere back when there were the high
priced doctors who had their wealthiest patients and were willing to let them in on the best new
stuff out there this new science of using leeches to cure you of whatever of bleeding people to
get out the vile humors here I've got a free sample of this new drug called thalidomide what we
see in these cases is be careful what you ask for because we know somewhere back when early in the
last century anxious parents who happen to be wealthy with their child going into a hospital had
their beloved pediatrician telling them you're in good luck this hospital has the best the newest
equipment
