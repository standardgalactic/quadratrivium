So a few years ago, I found myself having a problem at work, which is I had this administrative
assistant who helped out in my lab, and I found I was just irritated as hell with this
person.
Okay, this was a guy named Paul, and it had nothing to do with the job he was doing.
He was superb at doing this, but it was in fact the music he was listening to.
Okay, I know you exactly where you think this is going to be going, which is complaining
about his generation's music, which is scientifically provably inferior to what I listened to.
That wasn't the problem.
Problem was this.
Okay, he'd be in there in the office one day listening to whatever contemporary, horrible
music he was listening to, but then the next day he comes in and he's listening to Beethoven
all day, and the day after that he's listening to Grand Old Opry and then Gregorian Chance
and Shostakovich and jazz and big band and klezmer music and Ima Sumak and pygmy, pygmy
wedding love songs, and it was unbelievable what he was doing with this.
He was a couple years out of college and was doing this for a few years before grad school.
He was getting his first paychecks and he was just going out and systematically exploring
music and trying out all sorts of new stuff.
Same thing with his appearance.
He had long hair and a beard, and one Monday morning he comes in and he has shaved it all
off.
What's up with that?
He thought it would be interesting to see if people interacted with him differently now
that he had like no hair on his head.
Comes in and what has he done over the weekend?
He's never seen an Indian musical movie before, so we went to a festival and watched like
17 of them in a row.
One day he's reading Chaucer, the next day he's reading Melville, the next day he's
reading some experimental Hungarian realist.
This kid was like pathologically open to new experience.
And thus, he was just irritating the hell out of me because what this did was force
a little bit of like self-reflection there.
I love music, I love classical music and I realized I can't remember the last time I
listened to a new composer or I love Mahler and I realized 90% of the time when I'm listening
to Mahler it's the same exact symphony, in fact the same movement and then suddenly realizing
how did this happen?
How did I become one of those people where late night television they sell anthologies
of like Bob Marley's greatest hits and people like me fall for it?
What happened?
How did I lose this capacity to be open to novelty?
Now if you're a regular person this is a crossroads, a point where you may have some painful self-reflection,
some difficult introspective moments of having to face sort of the reality.
If you're a scientist though what you do is you sublimate all of this into a scientific
experiment.
So I decided I was going to do a scientific study here derived from this painful insight.
What's up with this business about as closing to novelty as we get older?
Okay, so I got out my lab coat and I positioned my microscope and I started making some phone
calls.
So the first phone calls I made had been prompted by Paul's music taste so I'm sitting there
and he's listening to like a tape of Wagner played on ukuleles out there so I'm thinking
about music.
What is it that goes into openness to certain novel types of music?
What is it that goes into losing that novelty with age?
So here's what I did.
I called up 50 radio stations across the country all of which played period music, contemporary
rock, classic rock, big band, doo-wop, 50's whatever and in all cases I managed to get
the station manager on the phone and I asked the same two questions.
First one, what's the age of the music that you play?
Second, what's the average age of your listeners?
And you put all of that together and you do a whole bunch of fancy statistics and outcomes
the not very surprising finding that there's not a lot of teenagers listening to the Andrew
sisters and not a lot of people in nursing homes listening to Marilyn Manson and James
Taylor fans are beginning to wear relaxed jeans.
You can actually do real science on this and generate real data.
When you play around with the numbers out comes the finding that on the average people
were under 20 years of age when they get their musical tastes that they hold on forever
after and if by age 35 you haven't listened to a particular type of music and liked it
and chose to listen to it again, 95% chance you never will.
That window of music novelty has closed by that age.
Okay, so emboldened by that I decided to look at the same issue in a second realm.
What about food?
What about food novelty?
What happens with our openness to trying new foods as we get older?
So of course the immediate challenge is what counts as novel foods, foods that really quite
new pizza, yeah, right, that's as American as apple pie, bagels, that doesn't really
do it.
Chocolate covered ants, it's hard to choose what it was finally.
I hit on it which was sushi.
Sushi not just anywhere but sushi in the American heartlands in the Midwest with this assumption
that this sort of amber waves of grain, meat and potato crowds might not find the most
natural match with them with little like raw fish and vegetables carved to look like
lotuses and so I went about trying to study this then.
Same exact strategy.
Get on the phone and track down the phone numbers of 50 different sushi restaurants scattered
throughout the Midwest ranging from in places like Indianapolis or Omaha down to I believe
the smallest place was Eden Prairie, Minnesota and in each case get the proprietor on the
line and there was like this palpable air of anxiety in some of these people that like
some Stanford biology professor wanted to talk to them about their sushi and the great
anxiety you could hear rippling there but would get these people on the line, the owners
of these restaurants and again ask two questions.
Number one, when did sushi first come riding into your Midwestern town?
When did the first sushi restaurant first open?
One question, what's the average age of your non-Asian clientele?
So all ready to like deal with the data there.
One thing I noted though that where's this bizarre, weird fight going on between the
two sushi restaurants in Bloomington, Indiana over which one of them opened first?
I really didn't understand this.
You would think they could have figured it out unless one of them had been a bowling alley
and they started serving raw fish and it's unclear when they made the transition but
with those two data points sort of sorted out, eventually you could do the same calculations
and you come up with a very simple finding there as well which is people on the average
are under their about age 23 or so when they first try sushi and decide they like it and
if by age 39 you have not voluntarily tried sushi and decided you liked the food, 95 percent
chance you never would.
Okay, so I was at some momentum at this point and I decided I needed one final domain of
research and looking at the issue of openness to novelty in the realm of fashion.
Fashion and what should be obvious by looking at me is I don't know a whole lot about this.
I happen to live in the Haight district in San Francisco which is a very good place to
be reminded endlessly about the extent to which you are not where fashion is at.
The notion of like back when wearing blue jeans in high school was a sign of outrage
and fighting against the machine, seeing fashion has changed dramatically since then.
So trying to figure out okay what's going to count as a novel form of fashion where
you can ask at what age do people welcome that sort of novelty, at what age are they
getting close to it.
So trying to figure that one out, let's see how about tattoos.
Tattoos are not going to work as follows.
Tattoos have always been around, their connotations have changed and it's gone from like brawling
merchant mariners to like star yogis or who knows what, it's always been around just the
connotations have changed, that's going to be hard to study.
How about pierced ears on men?
That used to be an outrageous fashion statement.
That's become so normal now that like Rick Perry can have a pierced ear and he wouldn't
sort of alienate his constituency, that wasn't going to do it.
And with a little bit more sleuthing and educating myself, I realized I had entered
the world of body piercing and tongue studs and navel rings and genital rings and all
sorts of stuff.
So at this point I decided to let my assistant make the phone calls because I was not quite
up to this.
So Paul proceeds to call up 50 body piercing parlors in either San Francisco or New York
City and get the proprietor on the line and those same two questions, when did you first
offer the service of tongue studs and what's the average age of your clientele getting
their tongues studded?
And one thing that was interesting after the sushi restaurants, none of these body piercing
parlors seemed to find it remotely interesting that some Stanford biologist wanted to know
about their like tongue piercing practices and do the same sort of calculations and back
comes the finding that the average person getting their tongue studded in this realm
is 18 years old and by age 23 or so, if you have not voluntarily decided to get a tongue
stud, 95% chance that instead of doing that you're just going to go get a new hairdo,
the window of novelty there has been closed as well.
So we see one thing in common throughout all of these, which is early in life you are open
to tremendous novelty about new music, new food, new fashions, but we see this big difference
which is the time course.
Age 23, you're mostly past your tongue stud window, age 35, that for music age 39 for
food and all of this brings up the question of number one, why do our brains close to
novelty as we get older and obviously number two, why the different rates?
So how to make sense of this?
So as I poked into this a bit more what I discovered was naturally was I had very clumsily
reinvented the wheel, all sorts of people had been studying this, thinking about this
for years and documenting absolutely clearly a pattern that in general for example the
most creative of our people over the years, over the centuries, their creative output
decreases over time and this is not just the world of like these Wunderkin mathematicians
and physicists who are washed up by the time they're 20 or so, look at composers, look
at poets and on the average the number of measures of music composed, the numbers of
lines of poems decreasing as they age and this is a pattern.
Mind you very importantly in that all the things being covered here, this is not universal,
there's dramatic exceptions to this, Matisse was inventing new art styles in his 80s, things
of that sort but on the average our most creative generative minds have less output
of creativity as they age.
Even more important in terms of making sense of all of this is the evidence that a lot
of those gigantically creative generative minds as they get older are less open to somebody
else's novelty and this is the realm of Einstein spending the latter half of his life leading
a rear guard attack on quantum mechanics, there can't be that indeterminacy, God does
not play with dice, that whole thing is fighting against what in some ways was the logical
extension of the revolution he had started, Martin Luther the same thing, he spent his
latter decades helping the powers that be crushed, the peasant uprisings that were the
perfectly logical outcome of his own revolution.
Here is a guy when I was in grad school, this guy, I won't mention his name but he
was a very August cell biologist, one of the finest of the last century, amazing guy also
it's a great research, here's what this guy is destined to be remembered for, he was the
last cell biologist of any credibility whatsoever to go to his grave insisting that DNA was
not really interesting, DNA was not the material of heredity, this guy is going to be remembered
for the piece of novelty that he fought tooth and nail to his grave, another great creative
mind closing to somebody else's novelty in this regard, this pattern seen over and over,
so what is this about, okay I'm a neuro biologist and obviously what immediately comes to mind
is well what's going on in the brain as we age, so when you, oh I just realized 12 lectures
into this I finally have remembered to make use of these wonderful cryptic pieces of artwork
here, note the brain, the brain, the brain we now ask is closing to novelties, we get
older what's going on in the brain, okay I've just done my thing for the great courses
of appreciating their artwork which I will obviously be appreciating less 30 years from
now, okay so what's going on in the brain as you get older, why do we lose openness to
novelty, what's the neurobiology of that, and the answer is absolutely obvious which
is as we get older our brains rot on us, or at least that's what people used to think,
okay here is the dogma in the field, everyone used to understand brain aging, it was very
straightforward and clear cut and it went as follows, you're like 18 years old and
you're cruising along and your brain is great and your synapses, the connections between
different neurons are all excitable, everything's terrific, you're learning new things and
magically, amazingly on the very morning of your 21st birthday something happens and
you start losing brain cells, you start losing neurons, everybody knows this well enough
that there was even a magic number that came out of it which is you're losing 10,000 neurons
per day every day for the rest of your life unless you've had a drink in which case you
lose another 10,000 except that part's probably true, you lose 10,000 neurons per day, this
is normal brain aging, this is inevitable, by the time you're 40 you're like neck and
neck with a brine shrimp in terms of neural complexity, this is what normal brain aging
is about and in retrospect we now understand why this was totally erroneous and why this
got inadvertently accepted as dogma, this was due to a very influential and very wrong
study that was done in the 50s, some neurobiologists, neuroanatomists who were trying to understand
what happens to the number of brain cells in the human brain as we age and if you don't
do this sort of work this is one of the most obsessive crazy questions you can ask because
these guys set out to try to count the number of neurons and knowing full well nobody in
their right mind was ever going to try to do this experiment again, they said okay we
need some brains, we need some really aged brains for this study because we don't want
to mess up on this, let's get brains from some of those folks who are so aged they can't
even remember their name, who they are, where they are, some of those really aged, oh in
retrospect we know the mistake they just made, they were not getting the brains of normally
aged individuals, they were getting the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, other
types of senol dementia, do the counts and you see this catastrophic decrease in neuron
number and suddenly out of it comes this magical number of you're losing 10,000 neurons
per day every day for the rest of your life and no wonder be close to novelty. And what
we've learned in the years since is that's not remotely what the aging brain is about.
Yeah, you do lose some neurons in some interesting parts of the brain, part of the brain many
lectures ago we heard about Parkinson's disease, you lose some neurons in a brain region that's
responsible for smooth movement and you get a Parkinson's tremor, your hippocampus as
we've learned, the region of the brain associated with memory, you lose neurons there very interestingly,
you lose neurons in your frontal cortex and some aspects of emotional regulations. Okay
so you lose some neurons for the most part though, you're not losing massive amounts
of neurons, not only that but your brain can get better over time, those synapses, those
connections between neurons, the connections become more powerful, they can become more
excitable, neurons can grow new connections, new synapses, new processes, major revolution
in neurobiology is the fact that the adult brain, even the aged brain can generate brand
new neurons, neurons can be born in the adult brain in response to all sorts of stimulating
environments, suddenly neurobiology isn't going to explain this closing to novelty business,
not only is it not the case that your brain is falling apart with time and as it turns
out it's not the case that there's a novelty center in your brain that particularly rots
out and most certainly then there's not a subsection of the novelty center that's the
tungsten novelty center or the raw fish center, neurobiology is not going to tell us much.
So with that I shifted over to psychology, seeing what psychologists had to say about
this and some really interesting work by a psychologist named Dean Simonton and what
he first documented was in highly creative individuals, the decline with generativity
with age, the decline in openness to novelty, what we heard about already, okay we're looking
at what seems to be distressingly another age related phenomenon but he made a really
interesting observation which is this is not actually a function of chronological age,
it's a function of disciplinary age, not how old somebody was but how long they had
been in the same discipline or stated a different way, people who changed the disciplines, changed
jobs, changed foci, basically reset the clock on openness to novelty.
This is rife with all sorts of confusing features, how much of this is self-selection, that's
part of the complication, there's also the issue as to whether people truly now are doing
different behaviors or they're doing the same old behaviors in a different context,
what was getting really stale when you were a particle physicist is totally cool now that
you're doing modern dance, that kind of thing but nonetheless it is clear that the process
of making a major change has some very beneficial effects on the nervous system.
This goes back to wonderful work by a neurobiologist at Berkeley named Marion Diamond and she
did a study some years ago that people have thought of doing decades before but nobody
bothered because they knew exactly what the answer was going to be.
Back to the early 60s some Berkeley scientists in particular a man named Mark Rosenzweig
did these landmark studies taking baby rats, young rodents and showing if you raise them
in a normal rat environment in a lab which is in sort of a bear cage or if you raise
them in an enriched environment, this rat nursery with other baby rats and running wheels
and beeping lights and smells and stuff, you get a very different outcome.
Enriched environment, you get a brain that matures faster, the cortex winds up being
thicker, better learning abilities, all sorts and this has produced just a cottage industry
of research since then, how does environmental enrichment produce all these beneficial effects
in the developing brain, wonderful science.
Diamond was a young scientist in their orbit at the time and it occurred to her to finally
do a study that seemed kind of irresistible until you thought about it because why bother
because it's obvious what the answer was going to be, hey does environmental enrichment
have some of these good effects on the adult brain and everyone knew the answer that couldn't
possibly be because remember the brain is losing 10,000 neurons per day and just falling
apart but she went and did it and what do you know, environmental enrichment makes for
a more complex adult brain, more synapses, stronger synaptic connections, even more neurons
showing it then in aged individuals, take a 90 year old in a more enriched environment
and on postmortem, that individual will show all the science of neurons growing new processes,
brain maturation is a lifelong process, what we see there is this is a neurobiological
explanation for why switching disciplines, jump starting the whole system can have some
very rejuvenating effects on the brain.
Now at this point, Simon's made an even more interesting observation because remember he's
looking at this issue of highly creative accomplished people and they're closing to novelty over
time and have something to do with disciplinary age rather than chronological age, he noted
something important in there, something that was a predictor like you can't believe for
this closing of the mind to novelty which is if you want to be entrenched in your field
and you want to be open to new ideas, here's the thing that is the kiss of death that makes
it so unlikely for you to be open minded if you suffer from the dread state of being
eminent in your field, because all it means if you are eminent in your field and you've
been in that field for decades, all it means is anything new that comes down the pike means
nothing other than that you and your buddies are going to get tossed out of the textbooks
and there's been fascinating research done showing the more eminent and aged the zoologist
was at the time that Darwin and his revolution swept in the less likely they were to embrace
this new revolution. Okay, so this is very meaningful but this danger of being too eminent
in your same discipline and fearing novelty, that's not going to explain why you're twiddling
with the dial there trying to get the music you were listening to when you were a teenager.
There's no reason to believe that listening to new music is going to increase the odds
that the BGs are going to be tossed out of the music textbooks that has limited explanatory
power. So then I began researching the work of another psychologist Judith Rich Harris
and what she has emphasized is the extraordinary power of peer influences especially during
development her work is often misinterpreted as being an argument for how unimportant
parents are instead it's a strong argument for peer influences, peer socialization.
And what she basically has shown is something that makes sense to anyone who has a teenager
who was a teenager which is at age 15 or so what is the thing you want to communicate
to the world more than anything that you have nothing in common whatsoever with those stagnant
crystallized calcified people that came before you like your parents you want some markers
that you and your generation have done something individuating and what happens is your generation
comes up with whatever it's version is of a cultural outrage of Elvis or the Beatles
or who knows what and that defines your generation and your peer identification and what's going
on 25 years later you're sitting there saying well if this music was good enough when we
were defeating Hitler or Liking Ike or sleeping with each other at Woodstock it sure is plenty
good to keep me going here 25 years later if people are willing to like die because
of group distinctions they sure should be willing to listen to lousy music so age group
identification so this tells us a lot but as a scientist is a biologist this wound
of being insufficient for me for a very simple reason take a laboratory rat and look at
at what points in life is it willing to try new food baby rats extremely phobic about
new food then suddenly in rat adolescence into early adulthood they're willing to try
new stuff get further into adulthood and their window of novelty closes their rats
show the same pattern over time they show the same features when you look at non-human
primates who occasionally move into new territories with new food types who are the ones who try
the new foods adolescents juveniles and it's their peers who take up the new discovery
and nobody older ever does it what you see in here is there's a piece of zoology a piece
of hardwired biology what Simon's work shows is this may help understand this sort of age
group stuff may tell you something about why Johann Strauss didn't like waltzing to the
music of Arnold Schoenberg and peer identification may tell you something about why all the people
who came of age listening to Strauss never much like Schoenberg but that's never going
to tell you why a rat decides that new foods are not that appealing no rat is going out
of its way to outrage its parents so looking at all of this it eventually struck me that
maybe what I've been doing all along is asking the wrong question instead of asking why is
it when we get older we close the novelty maybe the question should be asked as why
is it as we get older we like repetition more and more and there's some interesting insights
into that one comes from the work of the author Tracy Kitter the author of a number of wonderful
books one of them including the book old friends a study of people in a nursing home in Massachusetts
and one of the people he interviews at length is this man who has a roommate and the roommate's
memory is not the greatest then he's gotten a bit repetitive and this man discussing his
roommate's tendency to repeat himself has this wonderful statement to the effect of you know
to hear one of Joe's stories a couple of times is great to hear it like 20 times is really
annoying and irritating to hear it every day for the last three years is one of the most
comforting things I can imagine when the fat one of the sand underneath your feet is getting
turned into quick sand and less and less certainty something familiar and repetitive can wind up
taking on an enormously reassuring power similar story Igor Stravinsky when he was on
his death bed there was apparently this vigil around him because he was clearly dying his wife
was there around the clock there her beloved losing him and he apparently had a very large ring
on one of his fingers and he kept pounding sort of the railing of his hospital bed with it and
finally his wife there at his death that just totally irritated with him and said will you
stop doing that why are you hitting your ring against the railing stop doing that you know I'm
still here and Stravinsky's response was I want to make sure that I'm still here and maybe what
some of this increased sort of appeal of repetition does as we get older it's us pounding on the
railing there with our rings and hearing the same sound over and over again and it's a good way of
reassuring ourselves that will we are still there and there's something that can be predictably
relied upon okay so any good scientist at this point is supposed to say the same exact thing
which is obviously more research is needed on the subject maybe more research isn't needed on the
subject is this such a big deal is a pressing societal problem that we don't have enough 80
year olds eating raw eel with tongue studs is it really such a crime if I listen to the same exact
tape of Bob Marley's greatest hits over and over and over again is this really something that we
need to worry about this closing to novelty and at the end it strikes me that there are some reasons
why you may want to fight that one is on the very obvious level that it should not just be the purview
of the young to be on fire with new thoughts with new feelings with the world and its vibrancy and
all the new things it comes up with that should be something that all of us at all ages can get the
benefits of but ultimately there's even a more fundamental reason where it strikes me that this
closing to novelty is something to resist and this is something I'm constantly struck by given how
I spend most of my time around 20 year old college students and it's a pattern that I see in the best
of my students not best of with the GPAs that are straight eight pluses but the best of the students
the ones who are in a frenzy upset about the unfair treatment of some group the ones who are using
their free time teaching kids to read who are living on the wrong side of the track the ones who
after graduation are going to try to go cure the world and cure the lepers of God knows what the
ones who are just open to the most important type of novelty they see somebody in need somebody
where on first pass that person is way different from them a different appearance different beliefs
different language and at that juncture where they could see the differences or the similarities
they're open enough to see the similarities and see the need for help and mobilize to do that and
at the end of the day that's the single best reason I think for fighting this closing to novelty
because ultimately an open mind is a prerequisite to an open heart
