Lecture 17 Symbolic Anthropology, Claude Levy-Strauss
As I indicated at the end of the last lecture, the two representatives of the movement called
Symbolic Anthropology that we'll be looking at, Claude Levy-Strauss and Clifford Geertz,
each took one end of Sousour's model of language, the long and the parole, language as such
and concrete acts of speaking. Claude Levy-Strauss emphasized the long aspect
of culture. He looked for the deep structures out of which any culture could be generated
and which then gave rise to the actual actions and speeches that people made. And so his
movement came to be known as structuralism. Clifford Geertz emphasized the actual actions
that people undertake. He wanted to look at what people did and how they were motivated
by culture. And while his style of analysis never received a formal name among academics,
we can refer to it as a more pragmatic approach to Symbolic Anthropology. But both thinkers
have in common the fact that they each took signification as the key to understanding
a culture, that the job of the anthropologists was to decide what natives meant by the things
that they said and did.
We begin with Claude Levy-Strauss. Levy-Strauss's system of analysis is a big, rambling, multi-volume
work that even working scholars today often have a hard time making much sense of. And
once they do, they have a lot of doubt that it is a very useful way to approach things.
It's going to be a challenge to try to boil it down into a brief discussion. But one way
that we can approach Levy-Strauss's style of analysis is to look at some events in his
own early life that set the puzzle for him that he spent the rest of his career trying
to solve.
Claude Levy-Strauss was born in Belgium in 1908. He grew up in France. His father was
an artist. He went to college and majored in law, but he took a secondary area of concentration
in sociology, and he read the works of Comte and Durkheim. Upon his graduation, he accepted
a position not in France, but in Brazil, going to work for the University of Sao Paulo as
a lecturer in sociology.
He decided to take advantage of the fact that much of Brazil at that time was still considered
very wild and unexplored. He had been inspired by Durkheim's way of determining cultural
forms by looking for them in their most elementary, simplest manifestations, thinking that by
finding that, you might be able to find the origin of religion and other cultural systems.
Levy-Strauss felt he was in the perfect place to replicate that experiment, and maybe even
to do it better. Durkheim had had to rely on other ethnographic reports of Australian
Aboriginal life. But Levy-Strauss was now in a position where he could get on a boat,
go up the Amazon River, and try to find for himself the most primitive tribes around and
do his own ethnography, and perhaps even go Durkheim one better.
So between 1934 and 1937, he made a series of expeditions up the Amazon, but because
of his academic position, he was never able to do the kind of extended period of fieldwork
that the functionalists recommended. He could only go for a few months at a time.
What he was looking for was the anthropologist's dream, the completely undiscovered tribe,
the tribe that no one from the West had contacted before. Such a tribe would be totally uncontaminated,
by what Levy-Strauss liked to refer to as Western filth. They would be pristine. They
would display their own cultural forms in the most pure manner imaginable.
The problem was that such a tribe was very hard to find. The mere fact that Levy-Strauss
could get on a boat and access these places generally meant that Westerners had already
been there, and that the tribes he discovered had already been contacted. So as he went
up the river, he found that the tribes closest to Western settlements tended to be the most
contaminated. While they still maintained their own languages, many of them spoke Portuguese
or other European languages very well. Their social structures had fallen away. Many of
them were decimated by disease, alcoholism, and exploitation. And he didn't feel that
these were appropriate places to try to find native culture in its pure form. So he kept
traveling up the river. And the farther up he got, the more he found tribes in a more
or less pristine state, but still, always with that element of Western contamination
that led him to wonder if he had actually found something he could work with.
Finally, way up at the headwaters of the Amazon, near the border of Paraguay and Bolivia,
he came upon the tribe called the Tupi-Kawahib. And this was where he found his dream. This
tribe had never seen a Westerner. He was the first white man who had ever set foot in their
settlements. They were undiscovered, pristine, pure, and most important, extremely primitive.
Having found his dream, though, he discovered a problem. Let's listen to his own account.
I had wanted to pursue the primitive to its furthest point. Surely my wish has been gratified
by these delightful people, whom no white man had seen before me and none would ever
see again. I had come upon my savages. But alas, they were all too savage. There they
were, all ready to teach me their customs and beliefs, and I knew nothing of their language.
Having found the Tupi-Kawahib, Levystros had no way of communicating with them. Having
been uncontacted by any previous European settler, they didn't know his language. Nobody
knew theirs. All he could do was stand and stare.
Now, at this point, a functionalist anthropologist would say, well, the answer to this problem
is quite obvious. All you need to do is arrange to have a time for some extended fieldwork,
go back there, and stay for a while. Stay there for a year, or two, or three. Learn
their language. Observe their customs and practices very closely, and come up with a
good ethnographic description that describes how it all works. But Levystros decided that
was not the way to proceed. The puzzle that this presented him was one that had never
bothered any of the functionalists, and that was the fact that the mere presence of the
Western anthropologist in and of itself would necessarily have an effect on these people.
At the very time that Levystros was studying them, he would also be contaminating them.
This is a problem, as you recall, that Malinovsky and Radcliffe Brown had never lost a moment's
sleepover. Malinovsky was perfectly happy to live among his Trobri and Islanders for
years on end, to be present among them, to take copious notes, and to have a colonial
garrison just over the hill to where he could go to buy his cigarettes and chocolate, and
never once stopped to wonder if the mere fact that he and all these soldiers were on the
scene might be changing the native culture that they were trying to study. So the problem
that Malinovsky and the functionalists ignored became the starting point, the puzzle, for
all of what Claude Levystros did during the rest of his career. How do you get at the
pristine core of a culture's being without contaminating it by your presence?
And the solution that Claude Levystros came up with, and one that makes his mode of procedure
extremely controversial, was don't be there. Don't be there to contaminate it. Don't
learn the language. Don't make close-up observations, but study things from a distance. Now that's
very interesting. How do you study a culture? If you don't learn a people's language and
you can't talk to them, all you can do is watch them from a safe distance so that you
can be sure that your presence is not affecting them. This is where Sousurian linguistics
comes into Levystros' life, and we know that he was directly influenced by Sousur's linguistics
because he learned about them from his colleague at the university, the linguist Roman Jakobson,
who had studied with Sousur. Levystros decided that perhaps the function
lists had been a little too quick to dismiss the project of the Victorian anthropologist
Frazier and Tyler of collecting folklore and tales and descriptions of rituals from
all over the world in an effort to synthesize a grand picture of human nature as such. Maybe
it was time to reclaim that project and use the comparative method to get some kind of
picture of culture in and of itself rather than to follow the functionalist approach
of intensive fieldwork doing purely local studies simply to understand one culture.
This approach was very much like studying language as far as Levystros was concerned.
If you study another language, you will certainly develop a skill you will be able to communicate
with other people. But that's very different from studying linguistics, which is to look
at the way language itself works. That kind of task, as any linguist knows, can only be
done comparatively. Certainly one does have to learn a lot of different languages, but
not simply for the sake of conversing with the people who speak those languages, but
to put them all together, compare them, and through the comparison try to distill out
what is common to all of them as a way of gaining insight into language as such.
So he thought the Victorians had maybe been on the right track in doing this grand comparative
work, but the problem was they had not gone deep enough. They had pulled together a lot
of customs and rights and mythologies, and they had certainly done some level of comparison,
but the end result had been mere cataloging. They had lists of things that seemed to be
similar, but they had not gone more deeply into the structures that determined how these
myths and rituals were put together in the first place.
So in order to do something analogous to a linguist who is trying to understand language
as such, Levy-Strauss decided that you needed a method of comparison that was more rigorous
than simply juxtaposing similar things side by side and saying, isn't that interesting?
New cultures have fire rituals, and to go deeper and say, what is it about the human
mind itself and the way it's structured that makes these rituals emerge?
So in this he was following the Kantian tradition as refracted through Sousur that saw the human
mind as itself having deep structures that take reality and put it together in webs of
signification. But here Levy-Strauss went one step further.
You remember that Sousur had asserted the arbitrariness of the sign, and by correlation
the arbitrariness of the way things are related. Now on the surface this seems plausible, we
certainly can see that there's no necessary reason why a tree should be called a tree
as opposed to anything else, and as the example of the Chinese word for watermelons and sweet
potatoes and papayas shows us there's even no particular reason why things should be
grouped together in a certain way. So it does appear that perhaps the way signs are formulated
and related to each other might be purely arbitrary. But since the days of Sousur a
new theory in linguistics had come into being, transformational grammar. And what transformational
grammar had added to the mix of Sousurian linguistics was the idea that there may be
some level at which the manipulation of signs and words is not arbitrary, and we can prove
this by looking at the mere fact that our mind is situated in a physical brain. This
means that it is a mechanism that has to work in certain ways. You can't simply put
things together in any manner that you choose because you are always going to be limited
by the physical structure of the brain out of which the mind arises. Now this is crucial
for Levi-Strauss' thought because he saw in this connection of mind and brain a way
in which he could perhaps connect culture to nature itself, that there may be something
about our own physical bodies that are situated in a physical world which in fact constrains
the way in which we deploy symbols. And it may be that physical structure which gives rise to
the structuring of symbols. Now this is all very abstract, so let's take a concrete example to
see how this might work. Let's take one of the most common cultural signals that we have
in the West, a traffic light. When you come up to the intersection, there is a box with
a series of three lights, one red, one yellow, one green. These are part of our western industrial
technological web of significations. That set of lights means something. The red means stop,
the yellow means caution, it's about to change to red, and the green means go. Now if you analyzed
this in a purely Salsurian way, you would think that the association of the color with the message
is purely arbitrary. There is no reason we can think of perhaps why green doesn't mean stop
and red doesn't mean go. But Levy Stross pointed to the natural makeup of our eye and our brain in
order to show that there was in fact some constraint on how this signal communicates its message to us
and why it actually makes sense for the colors to be assigned the meanings that they have. The human
eye is structured in such a way that it only perceives a certain band of visible light in the
electromagnetic spectrum. Beyond the ultraviolet and the infrared, we can no longer even see the
light. Now it turns out that yellow sits right in the middle of that band of visible light. Because
it's the frequency that is the easiest for the eye to see, we tend to perceive it with the greatest
intensity. Graphic designers will tell you that if you want high contrast, you don't put black on
white, you put black on yellow, and that gives you the most visible thing because yellow is so intense.
This actually makes it sensible to assign yellow as the color to signal the message that it is most
crucial for us to receive. Now if you were to map this all out, what you would be looking at is a kind
of triangle that sits alongside a vertical line next to it and a horizontal line under it. Let's
picture this triangle as containing the three colors of the traffic light. On one bottom corner, we
will have red. On the other bottom corner, we will have green. And at the apex of the triangle, we'll
place the yellow. Now that means that these signals stop, go, and caution occupy the three corners of
this triangle. The horizontal line under the triangle can map the colors for us, therefore, because as
we scan the triangle from left to right, we will encounter the three colors, red, yellow, green. So,
they occupy the three places on the horizontal line under the triangle. On the vertical axis
next to the triangle, you can picture only two terms, static and transitional. In other words,
a state that is not changing and a state that is changing. The red and the green, since they are
both at the bottom corners of the triangle, are both on the same place on this vertical axis. They
both indicate a non-changing state. You are now permitted to stop. You are now permitted to go.
Whereas the yellow, which occupies its place at the apex of the triangle, represents change,
transition. And so, it occupies the other end, the top of that vertical axis, change.
Now, this is a graphic picture of a structure. The structure of a set of culturally determined
symbols that Levy-Strauss believes he can now show is actually based in nature. The vertical axis,
which indicates stable and transitional states, the horizontal axis along the bottom, which gives
the three colors red, yellow, green, yield the triangle. With the stable states on the bottom,
go stop, red, green, and the transitional state yellow up at the apex. This shows that there is
a system of cultural symbols at work there that, because they are rooted in the very natural
structures of our eyes and our brain that respond to natural light, is in a way non-arbitrary and
thus connects nature to culture. And by this kind of exercise of taking symbols, not just from
traffic lights, but from all kinds of cultural settings and seeing how they are arranged with
relation to each other, Levy-Strauss believes he can actually find the basis of culture in nature.
Humans have to base their culture in nature for one very specific reason. If we compare human
beings to animals, a great difference seems to emerge, at least Levy-Strauss and many other
thinkers believe this to be true. Animals don't appear to symbolize things. Being driven by
instincts, they appear to the outside observer to simply deal with the world as it is. They don't
create webs of signification, they simply react based purely on their nature.
But the nature of human beings is to be remarkably free of instincts. Whereas a snake popping out
of its shell with no parent present can go right out into the world and find food, human beings
have to go through a long period of education just to acquire the skills that they will need
in order to survive. They need to be educated and they need to be inculturated. The fact that we
are so free of instincts is a basic part of our nature, our natural makeup, which absolutely
requires that we form cultures. So Levy-Strauss has shown we must have these webs of signification,
otherwise we are simply lost. We're helpless babies unable to do anything to care for ourselves.
Now, Levy-Strauss applies this connection between nature and culture and the creation of symbol
systems to all kinds of cultural settings. For example, let's take the simple act of eating,
which Levy-Strauss describes in a book with the title The Raw and the Cooked.
What is food in nature? Food is simply organic material that is capable of providing nutrition
for our bodies. Food does transform as it sits out in nature. It just rots. A piece of meat lying
on the ground or fruit lying on a bowl on your kitchen counter will simply transform in a natural
way by rotting if you let it go. Animals having instincts that simply lead them to things that
are edible, which they then eat, do not need to symbolize food in any way. They simply discover
something that is edible, they eat it, they digest it, and you have another natural instance
of the transformation of food. But human beings have culture because their nature requires it,
and the difference that this makes is whereas animals merely eat, humans dine. Now, what's
the difference between eating and dining? Dining transforms the purely natural act of eating by
turning it into a cultural occasion that can provide signals that fan out in many directions to
help establish relationships between people. Now, we can start by simply looking at the artificial
or the cultural transformations of food, which differ from the natural process of either rotting
or just being eaten and digested. We cook food. We can do it in several ways that are more or
less artificial. The act of roasting is something that generally doesn't happen in nature, and so
is the most artificial. We roast meats. We can also boil or steam things, which transforms them in a
way that looks a bit like simple rotting. We can also actually make use of the natural processes
of rotting, but in a controlled way to produce things like cheeses and yogurts and things that
ferment. Now, if you take those things that are analogous either to cooking like in roasting meat
or rotting, fermented drinks, steamed vegetables and such, you then find that when people get
together to dine, they will set the table. And to set a table is to create a tableau in which
things are arranged in a culturally meaningful pattern that we can decode. The food that is most
artificially, most culturally transformed, the roasted meat takes center place, but a little off
to one side, closest to where the head of the family sits. Think of the Thanksgiving dinners that
you might have had with the large extended family. The head of the household, probably the father,
sat with the roast turkey closest to him. Ranged around the periphery are the raw foods like salads,
the fermented foods like perhaps the blue cheese dressing, and the vegetables, which have been
either boiled or steamed. And the people who sit closest to those places where those foods are set
are the lesser members of the family. So dining is a way of taking what is originally simply a
process of nature, the transformation of food, and turning it into a tableau that communicates
all kinds of cultural information about people's place in the family. That is a system of symbols
that interlocks together to tell people all kinds of things about what is edible and who gets to do
what and who sits where and what relationships obtain among the people. And so starting with
nature and the natural makeup of the human body and brain, we build then to a grand cultural system
that we can decode by simply looking at the way the table is set. And these can be arranged in
tabular form just as we made our triangle with the red, green, and yellow lights.
Now it is when Levi-Strauss applies this method of analysis to mythology that most scholars come
to have a great deal of difficulty with his procedure. Levi-Strauss, having utterly failed
to communicate with the Tupi Kawahib, decided that it was legitimate to study mythology without
even learning the local language. In other words, to study myths in translation. Now remember, this
is what drove Malinowski into apoplexy. He ranted about people who rip myths out of their living
context, set them out as mere story, and play with them in trying to analyze their symbols.
He insisted you had to learn the language, you had to do the fieldwork, you had to be there.
But Levi-Strauss is saying, no you don't. And so he was perfectly happy, for example, to take
ancient Greek and Roman myths, such as the myth of Oedipus, in English translation, without paying a
lick of attention to the people who might have once told the story, what occasions they would
have told the story, the kind of people who were allowed to tell the story, and questions such as
those. How is this even possible as a legitimate mode of procedure? Well think of it this way.
If you want to study construction as such, then you don't have to live in a person's house,
see how they decorate it, see how they live in it, see what street it sits on. You can take almost
any house, anywhere at all, take the people completely out of it, take it apart, and you
can still learn something about the structure of houses. And if you do that with a number of houses,
all equally taken out of context, you will still come away with some kind of useful information
about how you put a foundation down, how you build floor joists, how you put diagonal braces
between the floor joists, build the wall studs, put across the ceiling joists, put it all together,
and you will in the end know something about the engineering and construction of houses as such
without knowing anything about the actual lives of the people who built those houses or lived in
them. With his structuralism, that is exactly what Lovie Stross was trying to do. And he claimed
that even in translation, even ripped out of their cultural contexts, the myths of the ancient
Greeks and Romans and of the Norse and of modern primitive tribes could still be examined that
the translation did not affect the basic structure that held these things together.
Now, just as when you're cataloging the parts of a house, and you can arrange them into floor
joists, band joists, wall studs, ceiling joists, etc., Lovie Stross noted that in doing the comparison
of mythologies, you could see recurring themes and elements within them. You might have, as in the
Oedipus complex, the story of the boy who kills his father and marries his mother. You might have
the theme of the youngest son who would normally be the most disadvantaged in the family structure,
who goes out and makes his fortune, as in Jack and the Beanstalk, or the faithful wife unjustly
accused of adultery, like the character Sita in the Indian epic Ramayana. Lovie Stross believed
that these were the fundamental elements. They were, in a sense, the words out of which the
structures of myth were built. By looking at their arrangement, you could then come to see
something about how people structure the elements of myth in order to make complete stories. And in
fact, unlike other people who had analyzed myths who might say, take the story of Oedipus as Freud
did as a self-contained unit and analyze it in order to make one particular point, Lovie Stross
pointed out that even the Oedipus myth is not an isolated story, but is part of the larger
mythical history of a whole people. It is part of a cycle of myths, and when you look at that whole
cycle of myths, you begin to find that there are elements that recur that, when they're all put
together, seem to communicate a kind of coherent message. Now, as Edmund Leitch pointed out, if
you're going to talk about a message being sent, you have to wonder who is the sender and why are
they doing it in this particular way. Well, the sender could be the ancestors, and the ancestors
are telling you something through these myths. But as anybody who's ever tried to shout a message
across a large distance through a windstorm to another person knows, a lot can be lost in the
transmission. So what Lovie Stross thought was going on was that the ancestors had put together
their cycles of myths in such a way that they reinforced the message and provided ways of supplying
parts that might have gotten lost or garbled in one story by repeating them in others.
And so in analyzing myths, Lovie Stross would recommend tabulation, simply taking a piece of
paper, marking a grid on it, and filling in the different elements within the cycles of stories
and the stories within stories, and then comparing all of them to see what recurs the most, what might
fill in the gap in another place, and how things were put together. Now, does this mean that there's
a system to myths? Well, in a sense, yes, but only insofar as there is a system to language.
But as when we're speaking, we take the resources of our language and string them together as best
we can in order to try to communicate. Lovie Stross said, this is the way cultures communicate.
We have a basic culture. We have myths and symbols that are cultural performances.
But in the end, we string them together as best we can in order to put forward some kind of message
that we can communicate. He called this process bricolage, a French word that can be translated
roughly as gerry-rigging or makeshifting. That's the best I can do to try to tell you what Claude
Lovie Stross was doing in his analysis of culture. He said, our physical structure constrains us in
putting together webs of meaning in certain ways, and we use those webs of meaning to makeshift
communications that help us to establish ourselves in the world and our relationships within society.
Clifford Geertz took another approach as we'll see next time.
