And now we begin Elemental Matters, an Introduction to Chemistry Lecture 1, Water, A Natural Wonder.
Welcome to Elemental Matters. We will begin our discussion of chemistry with water,
H2O. All living systems are composed primarily of water and 70% of the earth's surface is covered
by water and aqueous solutions. You already know a lot about water. You are familiar with it as a solid,
a liquid, and as a gas. Chemists call these the phases of matter. You probably also know that
water transitions from one phase to another at specific temperatures. 32 degrees Fahrenheit or
0 degrees centigrade is the melting or freezing point of water depending on whether you start with
the solid or the liquid. The boiling or condensation point of water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit or
100 degrees centigrade. You are familiar with the macroscopic or visible differences between
solid, liquid, and gas phase water. Solid water, ice, snow, hail, has a definite volume and a shape
unrelated to that of its container. Liquid water forms drops when present independently in small
amounts. Although its volume is independent of its container, its shape conforms to that of any
container you put it in. Gas phase water is invisible. Most of the gas phase water we encounter
is distributed in air. Although most water vapor is invisible, we're sensitive to high humidity,
we feel it. When chemists discuss the properties of water, they are considering pure water.
Outside of the lab, however, we rarely encounter chemically pure water.
Rainwater contains dissolved gases and dust from our atmosphere. Pure spring water contains
dissolved salts from geological formations. Here the word salt is used in the chemical sense
to describe a wide variety of inorganic compounds that dissolve in water. The water from your tap
contains trace amounts of fluoride salts, other salts, and other chemicals. The closest you can
come to pure water is water purified by reverse osmosis or distillation. You can buy this water
by the gallon at most grocery stores. Both distillation and reverse osmosis are techniques
which allow the chemical components naturally present in water to be separated from the water
itself. If you've ever had distilled water to drink, you've probably discovered that it
doesn't taste very good. The distillation process removes the salts and dissolved gases from water.
The lack of dissolved gas makes the water taste flat, like a soda that lost its fizz.
The salts flavor natural waters. Although pure water might sound better than water with
additives, it usually doesn't taste better. The difference between natural and contaminated
as descriptions of drinking water is a fine line, and one we will consider in some detail later in
this course. But for now let's take a chemist's perspective and consider the behavior of pure
water. Water is a molecular compound H2O. H2O means two hydrogen atoms are connected to one
oxygen atom to make each molecule of water. The connections are called chemical bonds.
The mass of a water molecule is equal to the mass of two hydrogen atoms plus one oxygen atom.
The phase transition we have already mentioned are associated only with changes in the three
dimensional arrangements of lots of water molecules relative to each other. Chemical bonds
are not affected by phase transitions, so the characteristics that describe the different
phases of water are called physical properties. One physical property that can describe any phase
of water is the density. Density is the ratio of the mass of a sample divided by its volume.
What do you know about ice as compared to water? That's right, ice floats. Ice has a lower density
than water. The density of pure solid water at zero degrees centigrade is 0.92 grams per milliliter.
If you start at room temperature, 25 degrees centigrade, with one liter or a thousand milliliters
of liquid water, and you cool it off to zero degrees centigrade, what happens to the volume
of the sample as it freezes? You may be able to answer this question intuitively,
but to answer it formally, you need to remember one thing. All the water molecules you started
with are still in the sample, whether they are present as a solid or a liquid. The mass of the
sample does not change when the phase transition occurs. If the mass stays the same, but the density
goes down when the solid freezes. The volume of the liquid water when it freezes to ice must change.
In fact, the volume must increase. The expansion of water when it freezes is responsible for the
erosion of mountains on geological timescales, for the formation of potholes in our highways over
the course of a year, and the splitting of water pipes in our walls on a particularly cold evening.
This expansion demonstrates the spectacular strength of chemical bonds and the forces that
control their three-dimensional arrangement in space. The expansion of water upon freezing is
so familiar to us that we might consider it to be a common chemical behavior. So think for a moment
about another pure chemical that you can heat so it changes from solid to liquid, or cool so it changes
from a liquid to a solid. I guess we need some chemistry theme music here for a minute.
What did you come up with? There are a few things that might come to mind. If you heat white sugar,
you can convert it to a liquid. If you heat a rock, a lot, like in a volcano, you can turn it
into magma. You may have already heard about plans to liquefy coal to produce automobile fuel.
However, if you think more carefully about these processes, they are different than the
melting of water. How? Well, the melting of water is reversible. You can take some ice cubes out of
your freezer, put them in a glass, and wait for them to melt. If they melt, you can pour the water
back into the ice cube tray and re-freeze it. You'll get back ice cubes that look exactly like the
ones you started with. However, if you heat sugar and melt it and cool it, you do not get white sugar
back. And if you heat rocks and then cool the magma, you do not get the same rocks back. The
heating of these compounds produces chemical changes, not just physical changes. And liquefied
coal is a bit of a misnomer. You need to mix other chemicals with coal to make it a liquid.
In fact, you can think for a long time, but you will not come up with very many compounds that
you've encountered in your everyday life that undergo reversible phase transitions.
Paraffin, candle wax, is one of the few aside from water. If you've ever melted paraffin,
you note one difference between it and water. Solid paraffin has a higher density than its
liquid. When you melt paraffin, the solid stays on the bottom of the container.
Water may be the most familiar chemical we deal with on a daily basis, but when it comes to
melting or freezing, it is far from the most typical. In fact, water is unique among the
known chemical compounds, and that its solid is less dense than its liquid. If you use water as
a basis for predicting typical chemical behavior, you will be mistaken. Water is common, but it is
far from typical in the chemical universe. What about converting our liquid water to a gas?
Most of us have never encountered pure gas phase water. When we heat a pot of water on the stove,
the gas phase water we produce is mixed with the air. Let's note a few things. First, the water in
our pot converts slowly to a gas, even if we don't turn the heat on. You can observe this phenomena
by placing some water in a container, marking the level and leaving it undisturbed for a few days.
Unless you are in an un-air-conditioned house in the summer, the water level will decline
noticeably over time. As long as the relative humidity of the atmosphere near the water is
less than 100%, water evaporates continuously from the pot, converting liquid water into gas-phase
water. If we put a lid on the pot, the relative humidity of the air inside the pot rapidly becomes
100%. Under these conditions, we can stop the apparent evaporation of the water.
What behavior distinguishes the boiling point of water? Not the evaporation of water from
liquid to gas, we know that happens most of the time. We identify the boiling point when we see
bubbles forming. What are bubbles? Bubbles are droplets of gas-phase water inside the liquid.
What does the behavior of bubbles tell you about their density? Since the bubbles rise to the surface
of the liquid, it seems safe to conclude that the density of the gas is less than that of the liquid.
But unlike solid and liquid water, which have specific densities at specific temperatures,
gases take the volume and shape of their container, and gases are compressible. You can change the
volume of a fixed sample of gas molecules and let them occupy more space or pack them into a smaller
space by pushing on them. Because the density of gases can vary, chemists specify standard condition
called standard temperature and pressure, STP, to a lazy chemist, so they have a basis on which to
compare different gas samples. The density of pure water at STP is 8.0 times 10 to the minus
fourth grams per milliliter. Because gases expand as they get hot, the density of gas-phase water
at 100 degrees centigrade in one atmosphere is less than this, 6.0 times 10 to the minus fourth
grams per milliliter. The properties of steam are critical in modern industry. They are so important
that they are extensively tabulated in tables called steam tables, which are available from a
variety of sources. What other common liquids evaporate into gases? We probably need a little
more chemistry music to let you think about that. Okay, what did you come up with? The first things
that come to my mind are gasoline and alcohols. These chemical compounds, gasoline is actually
a mixture of a number of different chemical compounds, evaporate from open containers.
Interestingly, motor oil and cooking oil are much less likely to evaporate. However,
have you ever boiled gasoline or alcohol? Probably not. Why not? Because heating chemical
compounds can do more than cause a phase transition. It can facilitate chemical reactions,
especially the chemical reaction we call combustion.
Hot gasoline, like hot alcohol, can burn or explode in the presence of air.
Don't try to measure the normal boiling points of gasoline or alcohol at home.
Thus far, we have considered the observable macroscopic behavior of water and some other
chemical compounds. But the point of science is not simply to collect observations, but to
build models that allow us to explain the behavior we have observed and to predict behavior we have
not. The systematic application of the scientific method has resulted in an enormous improvement
in our understanding of chemical behavior over the past 200 years or so. In this course,
we will use modern chemical methods to explain the unique behavior of water and expand our study
from this most familiar of chemicals to those chemicals that exhibit more typical but more
exotic properties. We will highlight a variety of the advances from the past 200 years. We'll
consider both conceptual and mathematical aspects of our models, and we'll review the current
understanding of chemistry both within the framework of a typical college or university
introductory course, and we'll discuss some 21st century applications that are pushing
modern chemistry almost to the realm of magic, abandoned in the 17th century with the fall of
alchemists. Let's start with some fundamentals. As we've said, water contains two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom chemically bonded together. Atoms are the smallest pieces of the chemical
elements. Everything you can see, touch, taste, or smell is made of some combination
of the atoms of the 114 we just added to new in June 2011, known elements.
Until Dalton proposed his atomic theory in the early 1800s, the prevailing model of chemicals
consistent with most observations was that matter was continuous. The water on your stove is noticeable
because of the space that it fills. The pot that contains it absolutely appears solid. However,
modern chemistry views matter as composed of discrete atoms, and modern physics tells us
that atoms are mostly empty space. If atoms are mostly empty space, how do they manage to assemble
into things that appear to be solid? Science tells us that atoms and molecules are fundamentally
electrical in nature. You can demonstrate the electrical nature of a large collection of atoms
to yourself in a number of ways. Brush your hair enthusiastically on a dry day, and it may stand
off from your head. Or rub a balloon on your sleeve and hold it over some bits of paper on a table
or place it against the wall. All of these physical activities produce charge separations
in the molecules that make up the materials. Like charges repel each other, and opposite
charges attract each other. When you brush your hair, the hairbrush acquires one charge,
and your hair another. When many hairs have the same charge, they repel each other,
and they stand up off your head. The balloon gains a negative charge from the cloth that is
rubbed on. The negative charges induce a charge separation on the bits of paper or on the surface
of the wall, and the attraction between the opposite charges is sufficient to attract the
paper to the balloon or the balloon to the wall. Today, the atomic theory is accepted
as a correct picture of the chemical elements. The atomic theory says that atoms are composed
of subatomic particles, which were first isolated between 1897 and 1932. The negatively charged
electron, the positively charged proton, and the electrically neutral neutron are the three components
of atoms. The charge on the electron and proton are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.
We call the magnitude a unit charge. The electron is negatively charged, and the proton is positively
charged. The mass of the proton and neutron are almost identical, but the electron is the lightweight
member of the group, weighing about 1,800th as much as the neutron and proton. The structure
of the atom was not determined until the quantum revolution, which began at the end of the 19th
century, but it made the first half of the 20th century the age of the nucleus. Today we know
that all atoms have a central nucleus, which contains all its positive charge and the vast
majority of its mass. The nucleus is surrounded by electrons, which occupy a space which is huge
compared to the size of the nucleus. All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons
in their nuclei. The number of protons is called the atomic number, and on a periodic table it's
the integer in the top of each block. Hydrogen is atomic number one because each hydrogen atom
contains one proton in its nucleus. Gold, Au, is atomic number 79 because each gold nucleus contains
79 protons. To be electrically neutral, an atom must have exactly the same number of electrons
as protons. However, two atoms of the same element can have different masses if they have
different number of neutrons in their nuclei. Hydrogen is the lightest of the elements. It
contains one proton and one electron when it is electrically neutral. Oxygen atoms contain
eight protons and eight electrons when they are electrically neutral. If you took a chemistry
class in school, you will remember the periodic table. The periodic table organizes all of chemistry.
It puts all of the known elements in order according to the number of protons in their
nuclei. We call the rows of the periodic table periods, and the columns are called groups.
A periodic table is a rich source of information about atoms, their physical properties,
and their ability to form chemical compounds. We will consult it frequently during the course
of these lectures. The electron shell model describes how electrons are organized around
their nuclei. The greatest part of the atom, as we said, is occupied by the electrons.
If you consider the nucleus to be the size of a P, a typical atom would be about the size of
a Major League Baseball Stadium. Because the electrons occupy the outside of the atom,
they are responsible for most of chemistry, and the electrons around an atom can be divided
into two categories. The two categories are based on their location relative to the nucleus.
The electrons close to the nucleus are so strongly attracted to it that they essentially
never participate in any chemical processes. The outer or valence electrons are on average
farther from the nucleus and shielded from its positive charge by the electrons in its core.
It is these outer or valence electrons that are rearranged in chemical processes.
So, the periodic table reflects the valence electron structure of atoms. As you move from
left to right across a period, the number of valence electrons goes up. The elements in the
left hand column, called the alkali metals, each have one valence electron. All the elements in
the same group on the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons, except for Helium,
element number two, which has only two valence electrons, while all the other noble gases have
eight. Chemists think of atoms as small squishy spheres with their size given by an average radius.
As you go down a group on the periodic table, the radius of the atoms increases as you would
expect since the number of electrons increases. But as you move horizontally across a period,
the radius of the atoms varies with increasing atomic number in a more complicated way,
and in general decreases. We'll consider the factors which affect the size of the atoms
in more detail in Lesson 5. In 1916, Gianluis proposed an electron dot model for showing
the distribution of the valence electrons in molecules. Today, the electron dot model is
ubiquitous in chemistry. It allows us to both explain and predict the structure of covalent
chemical compounds. In addition, it provides the underlying motivation for the structure function
hypothesis that continues to revolutionize modern molecular biology. To use Lewis's model,
you need to know the chemical symbols for the elements and the number of valence electrons
each one has. The majority of molecules we'll discuss in this series of lessons
will be composed of the elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, phosphorus,
sulfur, and chlorine. These atoms form molecules when their valence electron shells physically
overlap in space. The overlap allows atoms to share a pair of electrons, bonding electrons,
between their nuclei. At its most simplistic, the negative electrons provide the glue to hold
positively i together. Lewis's dot diagrams show that the atoms in molecules prefer to have
eight electrons and octet of electrons in their outermost shells. Lewis's diagrams
arrange these eight electrons in four pairs, except hydrogen, which only tracks one pair of electrons.
In water, the central oxygen contributes six valence electrons, and each hydrogen
contributes one valence electron for a total of eight electrons in each molecule. The Lewis's
dot diagram for water shows the oxygen in the middle, and on each of four sides of an imaginary
square drawn around the oxygen, a pair of electrons is shown as two dots. Two of the
electron pairs have hydrogens drawn next to them, showing the positions of the hydrogen atom.
The electrons shared between the oxygen and a hydrogen are called bonding electron pairs.
The electron pairs that are not shared are called non-bonding or lone pairs.
The Lewis's diagram is a very convenient two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional
thing, a chemical molecule. The electron pairs determine the geometry of a molecule. Electrons,
remember, repel each other, so electron pairs would like to stay as far apart in space as possible.
You might remember from high school geometry that four things can stay as far apart in space as
possible by pointing towards the corners of a tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is the simplest
of the platonic solids that you study in solid geometry. Its surface is composed of four identical
equilateral triangles, which are joined at the edges to form a solid with four triangular faces
and four vertices. The oxygen in water sits in the center of this tetrahedron, while the electron
pairs, both bonding and non-bonding, point towards the four corners. Two of the corners are occupied
by hydrogen atoms. In water, the distance between the center of the oxygen atom and the center of
the hydrogen atom is 94 picometers, 94 times 10 to the minus 12th of a meter. We say the bond
length is 94 picometers. The bond angle is defined by the lines which connect the oxygen
to the two hydrogens, and the bond angle in water is 104.5 degrees, as determined by experimental
measurement. That's not far from the perfect geometrical tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees
centigrade. We consider the water molecule to have a bent or V-shaped geometry because the
molecular geometry is determined by the relative positions of the nuclei in the molecule. Essentially
water looks like a fat boomerang. Remember that electrons are so small that essentially we can't
see them even in their molecular structure, but nuclei weigh a lot, and it's the nuclei
whose positions we can identify through experimental observation. The tetrahedral distribution of the
four electron pairs around the oxygen and water is the dominant reason, however, that water exhibits
its unique properties. Similar simple models illustrate the structure of other covalent molecules,
including methane, CH4, ammonia, NH3, hydrogen fluoride, HF, and hydrogen chloride, HCl. In
methane, the carbon has four valence electrons, and the four hydrogens provide the other four electrons
to complete the octet of electrons around the central carbon atom. The molecule again has a
tetrahedral structure with carbon in the center and hydrogen on each corner of the tetrahedron.
In ammonia, the central nitrogen atom provides five valence electrons,
therefore only three more are needed to give the nitrogen an octet. To draw the Lewis diagram of
ammonia, draw five electron dots around the nitrogen, and you can complete the octet by drawing
three hydrogen atoms with their valence electron dots. The four electron pairs around the nitrogen
again point to the corners of a tetrahedron, but the ammonia molecule geometry is called a
triangular pyramid. Since we can't see the lone pair of electrons, we have to think of the ammonia
molecule as being turned so its three hydrogens are sitting on a tabletop. The three hydrogens form
an equilateral triangle. The nitrogen in the center of the tetrahedron is above the plane defined by
the three hydrogens, so the molecule has a pyramidal structure. The lone pair of electrons on the
nitrogen points vertically upward in this configuration, but remember we can't see them,
so we say the structure of an ammonia molecule is a triangular pyramid.
Fluorine is a member of the halogen family. It's in column seven on the periodic table.
It has seven valence electrons and needs to combine with only one hydrogen atom to get an octet.
The HF molecule is considered to have a linear geometry. The four electron pairs around the
fluorine still point towards the corners of the tetrahedron, but we only see the hydrogen nucleus
and the fluorine nucleus when we look at the molecule. Sometimes Lewis diagrams are simplified
and shown as ball and stick pictures. In a ball and stick picture, the balls represent the nuclei
and the sticks represent the electron pairs they share. If you want to build a model of a molecule
and you don't have a fancy molecular model kit, you could use marshmallows or gumdrops or styrofoam
balls to represent the atoms and toothpicks to represent electron pairs and build yourself
some molecular models. Ball and stick models are convenient for illustrating geometric features
of molecules, but atoms really occupy space, so the bonding of atoms and molecules is more
accurately represented by space-filling models where the atoms appear smushed together like
compressible balls. In using either of these model techniques, the relative position of the
nuclei of the atoms defines some molecular geometry. More sophisticated computer-generated
models of molecules are available to chemists, symbiologists, and physicists today. The computer
model can replicate the Lewis dot pictures, the ball and stick pictures, or the squished ball
pictures, but they can also provide tremendously more information. For instance, showing how the
electron distribution varies in the space around the atomic nuclei or how an imaginary positive
test charge approaching the molecule responds to its electrical environment. A popular molecular
illustration uses a rainbow of colors from red, orange, yellow, green, blue to violet to illustrate
the force experienced by this positive test charge as it moves around in space near a molecule.
The picture of the water molecule in this model shows a variation in its electrical
environment. The test charge is more strongly attracted to the side of the molecule occupied
by the lone pairs of electrons because opposites attract, but it is much less attracted or even
repelled by the side of the water molecule where the hydrogens are located. The picture of a single
water molecule therefore would range in color from red at the side where the electron pairs are
to violet-blue at the tip of the region occupied by the hydrogen atoms. This space-filling model
gives us some more information about how molecules interact with each other. Model of the ammonia
molecule is similar to the water molecule, but the violet-blue region is larger corresponding to the
larger number of hydrogens hooked up to the nitrogen. In contrast, the methane molecule
is pretty uniformly blue all around with some green regions between the pairs of hydrogen atoms.
Molecules whose pictures show a systematic variation in color across the rainbow are said to be
polar molecules. Water and ammonia are both considered to be polar molecules. One side
of the molecule looks mostly negative and the other side mostly positive. Methane however
is considered to be non-polar and all hydrocarbons, compounds made of only carbon and hydrogen,
are considered to be non-polar too. Chemists generally describe the polarity of molecules
as arising from the polarity of individual chemical bonds. Two atoms do not necessarily share the
valence electron pair that forms the bond between them equally. Some atoms want their partner's
electrons. Some atoms are very willing to give their electrons away. The extent to which atoms
attract shared electron pairs was first discussed quantitatively by Linus Pauling. Some of you
may be using copies of Pauling's book, General Chemistry, as a companion to this series of
audio lessons. Pauling defined the electronegativity of an atom as the measure of its tendency to
attract electrons to itself. Pauling assigned the highest electronegativity, 4.0, to the electron
pig of the periodic table, fluorine. Fluorine wants electrons more than any other element
on the periodic table. Because fluorine occupies the top right-hand corner of the periodic table,
we can predict that electronegativity decreases as you go down the group of a periodic table
or as you move from right to left across a period. You can think of a covalent bond as a tug of
war between the two nuclei for the attention of an electron pair that makes their bond.
In water, hydrogen has a medium electronegativity of 2.2. But oxygen, which is right next to fluorine
on the periodic table, has a relatively high electronegativity, 3.4. Therefore, when hydrogen
and oxygen try to share an electron pair, the electrons spend more of their time near oxygen,
and we say that the OH bond is a polar bond. Interestingly, although oxygen is quite electronegative,
when two oxygens bond together, they share their electrons equally. The oxygen-oxygen bond
and the oxygen molecule are both nonpolar. But continuing our quest to be quantitative in this
discussion, we can assign what's called a dipole moment to a polar bond. The dipole moment is a
measure of the magnitude of the charge separation in a bond multiplied by the distance separating
the positive and negative centers. Dipole moments are usually represented on molecular diagrams by
an arrow superimposed over the molecular model. The arrow points in the direction from the less
electronegative atom to the more electronegative atom. Dipole moments have both a magnitude
and a direction, and therefore a physicist would call it a vector quantity. In contrast,
mass and volume and density are called scalar quantities. They're described by numbers and
units, but they don't have a direction associated with them. In order to have a polar molecule,
you must have some polar bonds. But the converse is not true. If we replace the hydrogens in our
methane with four fluorine atoms, we can make the molecule CF4, tetrafluoromethane. Tetrafluoromethane
has four polar bonds, with the bond moments pointing from the carbon towards each of the
fluorine atoms. But because the fluorines are located at the corners of a tetrahedron, the four
vectors exactly cancel each other out, and tetrafluoromethane is a nonpolar molecule.
If you have trouble imagining this in three dimensions, consider a two-dimensional version.
If we have four exactly equivalent teams pulling to the north, south, east, and west of a single tug
of war rope with four handles, the center of the rope would not move. A balance in the poles
is an exact analogy for the balance of the forces the electrons in tetrafluoromethane experience,
and they mean that the molecule is nonpolar. Before we turn our attention to a chemical
consideration of the scale of water molecules and their energetics, let's look at some fun facts.
You've probably heard that all snowflakes are six-sided, and that no two snowflakes are exactly
alike. This turns out to be pretty much true. Kenneth Libric, a physicist at Caltech, has used
a specially designed photo microscope to take thousands of pictures of naturally falling
and laboratory-made snowflakes. He's published a beautiful book full of pictures demonstrating
that no two snowflakes are alike. Given that all water molecules are exactly identically the same
in shape and size, this may give you some indication of how many water molecules make up a single
snowflake. And those of you who are science fiction fans are probably wondering how Kurt
Vonnegut's creation of Ice-9 in his novel Cat's Cradle compares with reality. Chemists actually have
identified an Ice-9, however thankfully it lacks the stability that Vonnegut ascribes to it in Cat's Cradle.
There are actually 17 known forms of solid ice. They differ slightly in how the water molecules
are arranged relative to one another. The fact that we only encounter one of them with any
regularity illustrates clearly how little of the physical universe we experience directly.
The known forms of ice exist over temperature and pressure ranges which span from near absolute
zero on the temperature scale to more than 400 degrees centigrade and from pressures of zero
to almost 10 megabars, 10 million times atmospheric pressure. These conditions include those which
we expect to find at the bottom of glaciers and in the vastness of outer space.
Liquids exist because forces hold the molecules together. The kinetic molecular theory tells us
that all molecules are in constant random motion and that means it's possible for them to fly apart
from each other unless they're attracted to each other in some specific way. If we look at a series
of liquids we see that the boiling point of liquids of the same type seem to go up as the number
of electrons goes up. For instance, we could compare four compounds, methane CH4, SiH4,
GEH4, and SNH4. That walks right down the column with carbon in the periodic table.
All of these molecules are nonpolar. They all have a tetrahedral structure. But the attraction
between the molecules increases as the number of electrons in the molecule goes up.
It's hard to see in an electrostatic world how nonpolar molecules would attract each other,
but they clearly do. The forces that hold nonpolar molecules together are called London dispersion
forces. They're named for physicist Fritz London, not the city of London. Fritz London realized
that the electrons being in constant random motion in a molecule might occasionally end up
a little bit more on one side than the other side before they could correct and get away
from each other again. This temporary charge separation between the positive and negative
centers in a molecule gives rise to London dispersion forces. London dispersion forces
can induce dipoles in neighboring molecules, so a small separation in charge in one methane
can cause or induce an opposite charge distribution in an adjacent methane. These
temporary induced dipoles are sufficient to cause the boiling point of SNH4 to be substantially
higher than the boiling point of CH4 because as more electrons are available in a molecule,
the size of the dispersion force can become larger. On the other hand, polar molecules
have permanent dipoles, and the dipoles allow two molecules of the same type to be attracted to
each other. Since opposites attract, the positive end on one molecule is attracted to the negative
end of another. If we look at the series of molecules starting with silicon hydride SiH4
and moving to HI, SbH3, and TeH2, we see that they all have the same number of electrons,
but their structures are different. SiH4 is tetrahedral like CH4.
Hi is linear like HCl. SbH3 is a pyramid, a triangular pyramid, like ammonia,
and H2Te is bent like water. So even though all four of these molecules have the same total
number of electrons, we see that the boiling points are dominated by their dipoles. The boiling point
of H2Te bent like water is larger than the boiling point of SbH3, is larger than the boiling point
of HI, which is larger than the boiling point of the nonpolar SiH4. From these observations,
we can conclude that dipole-dipole attractions provide a stronger attractive force than London
dispersion forces do. There are three compounds that have particularly high boiling points,
compared to other molecules with the same number of electrons and the same general geometry.
The three molecules with the very high boiling points are NH3, HF, and water. And water has a
boiling point which is much higher than any other molecule on the periodic table would lead you to
predict. The observation that these three compounds have unusually high boiling points means that
they have unusually strong forces acting between them. That unusually strong force is called a
hydrogen bond. And long before we were able to model or see hydrogen bonds spectroscopically,
there was a hypothesis that the hydrogen in a water molecule could be attracted to the
non-bonding electron pair on an adjacent water molecule. And that this attraction was a strong
enough intermolecular force to cause the boiling point of water to be much higher than we would
have predicted. Today's experiments indicate that on average, water molecules participate in three
hydrogen bonds at any second. And that hydrogen bonds are very labile. They form and reform
millions of times a second. But these very dynamic hydrogen bonds are the dominant force in determining
the structure of water, in determining the interactions between water and other molecules
it encounters. Hydrogen bonds turn out to be essential to life as we know it. The proteins
that make up most living things are amino acids, amino, like ammonia, and acid, a modification
of a carbon compound with oxygens and hydrogens attached. The amino and acid groups in proteins
interact with water in specific ways that cause the structure of the protein to be determined.
Hydrogen bonds between proteins and water are the most important factor in determining the
three-dimensional structure of proteins that underlies the structure function protocols that
are important in today's understanding of molecular biology. In the next lesson, we'll talk about
the formation of solutions, mixtures which contain mostly water, but some other things too. And we'll
see how the structure of molecules determines the forces with which they interact with water
and the energetics of that situation.
