your lecture is dr. Scott P. Stevens dr. Stevens is a professor of computer
information systems and business analytics at James Madison University he received bs degrees in
both mathematics and physics and a phd in mathematics from the pennsylvania state university
dr. Stevens research interests include analytics combinatorics graph theory game theory and
statistics his work has appeared in numerous conference proceedings and professional journals
and he has acted as a consultant for several companies dr. Stevens was the recipient of the
carl harder distinguished teaching award james madison university's highest teaching award
he also has been recognized as an outstanding teacher five times in the university's undergraduate
business program and once in its MBA program we live on a planet of seven billion people
organized into communities and companies and nations and every day all of those people
and the communities and companies and nations that they make up have to make decisions
decisions that affect themselves usually the lives of others as well this isn't a new state of
affairs and as long as the situation remains this affiliate familiar one or if it's new but not too
complicated then it's relatively easy for them to find a good course of action experience informs
intuition maybe the personal experience of the individual maybe the experience of the community
codified in its traditions and rules all in all it's a pretty good system and we've been using
it to figure out how to hunt or how to build a fire or when to plant and harvest crops for a long
time preserving and passing on this kind of knowledge is the foundation of any society but
cultures and traditions develop over a long period of time and those eventual good answers
have usually been found after a long period of trial and error but many of the problems
faced today are anything but traditional they're new they're complicated and some of them come
with huge even global consequences for bad decisions but the brave new world of these
complicated problems also contains new possibilities for finding answers including two that will be
especially important to us in this course the development of mathematical tools and techniques
to access and the access to extensive and affordable computer power the confluence of
mathematical tools and computational power has led us to where we are now and to what this course
is all about taken as a whole the discipline has a variety of names occupational research
operations research management science quantitative management analytics but its purpose is single
minded to apply quantitative methods to help people businesses governments public services
military organizations event organizers financial investors to find ways to do what they do better
let me give you some examples medicine university of pitsburg researchers looked at how liver
transplants are assigned and livers delivered in the us it turns out that there are 11
distributional zones that evolved over time in a way that had more to do with history than
getting livers in time to people who need them so researchers revisited the problem
they looked at factors such as geography and population density and they anticipated supply
and demand of future liver transplants using an optimization technique called integer programming
they analyzed more than a trillion alternatives and came up with a new map consisting of six
rather than 11 distribution zones they estimated that implementing this new system could mean that
14 percent more people got liver transplants that's over 800 people each year getting an organ that
they can't live without transportation the netherlands is a small country but one that relies heavily
on its railway system on average a dutch citizen travels about a thousand miles per year by rail
about 1.1 million people use the system on an average work day that kind of load often leads
to substantial training delays the dutch could build more track but that's expensive and frankly
land in the country is at a premium so in 2006 netherlands railway threw out their old passenger
time table and created a completely new one no new track just a new timetable
the new scheduling was done using operations research techniques including a network flow model
the result a new system with fewer delays more trains in operation and a happier public
netherlands railway saw a 60 million dollar increase in its annual profit a quarter of
which came from increased passenger usage a win for the company a win for the public
and a win for the rest of us with the reduction in greenhouse gases that accompany the shift
from private vehicles to rail transport let's go global after the cold war both the soviet
union and the united states had huge stockpiles of plutonium but they had to have decommissioned
from the warheads about 34 tons of it in fact so what to do with it plutonium is highly toxic
even in minute quantities and the fact that it could be stolen by terrorists presented a clear
and present danger to both national and global security further the terms of the treaty between
the two superpowers required that their stockpiles be depleted in tandem both countries applied
operations research to the problem in the form of a multi-attribute utility model they created a
hierarchy of objectives non-proliferation of nuclear weapons operational effectiveness
attention to the environment health and safety issues and so on the ordering of the goals differed
between the two countries but in the us 37 criteria emerged for assessing the relative
desirability of 13 different disposal alternatives the one that was selected interestingly enough
was the same one that was adopted by the soviets to mix the plutonium with an into an oxide fuel
for radiation and commercial nuclear reactors well these examples are all very large scale
liver transplant networks national rail systems nuclear build-down you might be getting the
impression that quantitative analytics is only useful and only used on problems of that magnitude
not so the tools are increasingly applied in small and mid-sized companies as well
let me give you two examples from the aviation industry let's start with the small one
bombardier flex jet they had a fleet of 25 aircraft and operated essentially an airline
without a flight schedule flex jet offered planes with 24 hour a day availability flying to a
destination of your choice you could literally fly almost anywhere in the world with 48 hours
notice or less think of the logistics of this things are expensive and letting them sit on the
ground or flying from place to place with no customer quickly eats up the profits likewise
crew need to rest and federal regulations are quite strict on how long a crew can be active
before getting time off a crew that's not where it's needed has to be deadheaded traveling as
passengers to their next point of departure and flex jet didn't even know what its schedule was
going to be they did quite well for themselves in spite of this and within a four-year period
flex jet grew from a company with 25 aircraft to manage 12 with 80 and the logistical headaches
became much much worse so they turned to analytics including non-linear programming the final result
was a decision support system consisting of three pieces each handling a different aspect of flex
jet scheduling needs the first determined the annual leaves for the crews the second worked out
the basic basic monthly schedules the third had the huge job of working out the daily and
weekly scheduling the support system took three years to implement but the results were worth it
a 20 decrease in the flight crew size per flight a 10 increase in flight hours available per craft
and no reduction in the fraction of flights that went off perfectly a great solution for a small
company on the other end of the scale we have continental airlines long ago continental decided
where it would fly what its flight schedules would be where its transportation hubs would be
located and so on but every airline faces unexpected disruptions in its schedule from weather to
mechanical problems to crew availability like flex jet continental turn to operations research
or for a way to prepare for what they couldn't predict the result was crew solver a decision
support system that quickly determined the best or nearly the best way to reassign crews to craft
in event of a disruption it takes into account not only the flights that needed to be covered
and the regulations that must be obeyed but also factors in quality of life issues for the crews
being scheduled the system was in place before the 9 11 terrorist attacks and continental led the
industry and the rapidity of its recovery from the disruptions of that day continental estimates
that crew solver saved the company 40 million dollars in major disruptions in 2001 alone
since then many other airlines have followed continental's lead and the list of applications
goes on and on and on kimberley clark uses or to schedule its factory floors in latin america
letting it manufacture its dozens of products quickly and inexpensively on the same few machines
electric companies use or to determine the schedules for buying selling and generating
electricity and then delivering it cheaply and reliably to wherever it's needed hospital emergency
rooms use or to reduce waiting times cut costs improve the quality of service or has helped
travel velocity to regain its market share and double its revenue over a three-year period
it's been used to develop an expert system to assist patients suffering from prostate cancer
to make intelligent informed decisions based on their personal situations and preferences
in short or is everywhere but what is it what are we doing when we're applying or to a problem
because to some extent the success stories i've told you about so far there's been black boxes
the only thing that they seem to have in common was that there was a problem
along comes operations research wamo things got better well operations research is an umbrella
term and a lot of powerful techniques fit under that umbrella to characterize what or is the
institute for operations research and management science has coined the phrase the science of better
and that's an excellent way to put it or applies a variety of mathematical techniques to real world
problems it leverages those techniques by taking advantage of today's computational power and if
successful it comes up with an implementation strategy to make the situation better this course
is about some of the most important and most widely applicable ways that that gets done through
predictive models and optimization speaking broadly predictive models let us take what we
already know about the behavior of a system and use it to predict how that system will behave
in new circumstances often what we know about a system comes from its historical behavior
and we want to extrapolate from that what's going to happen in the use of solar power in the speed
and power of computer chips can we look at the emails that you've received in the past
and build a better spam filter how does amazon make good guesses about the other products that
you might be interested in how does pandora pick the next song to play on your personal radio
station we'll look at all of these questions and techniques that can address them sometimes it's
not history that lets us make predictions but we already know about how the pieces in the system
fit together complex behavior can emerge from the interaction of even simple parts from there
we can investigate the possibilities and probabilities how can search parties that have
failed to find a down plane turn that negative information into guidance on how to carry on
what can a direct marketing firm expect to happen if changes if it changes its catalog
shipping practices what's going to happen to the waiting times of customers if the service
facility's capacity is cut by 10 percent how much of a safety margin is needed in bidding a job in
the face of uncertainty if you don't want to lose your shirt we'll explore all of these questions too
and the tools needed to address them but making informed predictions is only half of what we'll
be talking about we'll also be looking closely at optimization and the tools to accomplish it
optimization means finding the best answer to a problem how should an airline schedule its crews
its flights select its hub cities how should a railroad get its empty freight cars from where
they are now to where they're needed cheaply and quickly how should hospitals schedule their
staff while keeping costs down how should you divide your hard-earned money among various
investments in light of some expenses that you know you have coming up and how much can the
situation change in any of these matters before the best answer that you just found has to be scrapped
looking at these examples will lead us to a variety of optimization techniques
and give us the insights into why some optimization questions are so much harder to answer and solve
in creating this course i've aimed for a middle ground in terms of rigor my guiding principle
has been to cover the material that has proven useful and to do so in the context of interesting
cases because of that you'll see neither mathematical proofs nor drill work what you will see are lots
and lots of real-world examples along with the development of the or tools necessary to address
them and the actual solution process applied to a simplified version of the situation
in some cases where a computer is capable of or even essential for conducting the needed
grunt work i'll show you how to use a simple spreadsheet program to get that part of the
job done but in every case i've tried to combine the actual solution process with a useful intuition
about what's really going on so if you're looking for a roll up your sleeves course
there'll be plenty to do by the time you finish it you'll have a basic competence in operations
research and a solid foundation if you want to go further but just getting a sense of what it's
all about can also be very empowering and you can come back later and improve specific skills if
your intellectual curiosity or professional interests take you in that direction you don't
need technical fluency in order to see how mathematical decision-making can apply to a problem
that you may face maybe you call them the experts or maybe that becomes your own cue to engage with
this material more fully regardless mathematical decision-making offers a different way of thinking
about problems a perspective that i believe can inspire anyone to seek and find new solutions
all sorts of problems it may be helpful to say something about how all this got started
this way of looking at problems goes all the way back to the rise of the scientific approach
in particular investigating the world not only qualitatively but quantitatively that change
turned alchemy into chemistry natural philosophy into physics and biology astrology into astronomy
folk remedies into medicine it took a lot longer for this mindset to make its way into science and
engineering from there to other fields such as business and public policy least squares regression
for example was pioneered in astronomy in the early 19th century but it didn't get the name
regression until the late 19th century and it didn't get applied to business and economic
problems until the 20th century in the 1830s charles babbage pioneered early computing machines
he expounded what's today called the babbage principle namely the idea that highly skilled
high-cost labor should not be wasting their time working on things that lower skilled lower cost
laborers could be doing in the 1880s this idea became part of frederick taylor's scientific
management which attempted to apply the principles of science to the manufacturing workflow his
approach approach focused on such matters as efficiency knowledge transfer analysis and mass
production tools of statistical analysis began to be applied to business then henry ford took
the idea of mass production coupled it with interchangeable parts and developed the assembly
line system at his ford motor company the result was a company that in the early 20th century paid
high wages to its workers and still sold an affordable automobile but most historians set the
real start of operations research in britain in 1937 during the perilous days leading up to world
war two specifically at the bogsy research station near suffolk it was the center of research radar
research and development in britain at the time it was also the location of the first radar tower
in what became britain's essential early warning system against the german lyftwaffe
ap roe was the station superintendent in 1937 and he wanted to investigate how the system might
be improved roe not only assessed the equipment he also studied the behavior of the operators of
the equipment who were after all soldiers acting as technicians the results allowed britain to
improve the performance of both men and machines roe's work also identified some previously
unnoticed weaknesses in the system this analytical approach was dubbed operational research by the
british at the time it quickly spread to other branches of their military and the armed forces
of other allied countries let me give you an idea of what i mean by focusing on one man
pms blackett blackett was a physicist and a veteran of world war one in the 1940s he became
the scientific advisor to the commander-in-chief of the british anti-aircraft command many years
later blackett would go on to win the nobel prize for his work with cosmic rays but in the early 1940s
he and his team were looking at the problem of how to more effectively shoot down german planes
attacking britain early on during the battle of britain in the summer and fall of 1940 it took an
average of 20 000 rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition to bring down just one plane
a year later with blackett's team on the job that dropped from 20 000 rounds
to only 4 000 from there blackett went to work for the royal navy commercial ships were being
targeted and sunk by german viewboats with frightening frequency they needed to travel
in convoys escorted by military vessels the convoy can travel no faster than its slowest
ship so some military leaders wanted lots and lots of small convoys others favored fewer large
convoys the idea here was that a large convoy can have more escort warships assigned to it
better protection blackett reviewed the data and found that the losses that a convoy suffers are
for the most part dependent on the density of escorts on the convoy's perimeter and it follows
from this that the larger convoys were the way to go let's see why imagine for a moment that the
convoy's geometry is a square the same analysis applies to any other shape the area of a square
determines how many ships the convoy can contain the perimeter is the border that the escorting
warships have to secure in the schematic picture that i'm using we have four escorts for one cargo
ship icon you can see that doubling each side of the square gives you an area that can hold four
times as many ships but the perimeter is only increased by a factor of two that means that
combining four smaller convoys into one larger one would enable the british to double the density
of escorts on the perimeter once an analytic approach starts to take hold you sometimes see
things that you really should have seen earlier during the war the bottoms of the bomber aircraft
were painted black since they were often on night missions but was this the best choice when bombers
were being used to hunt subs during the daytime experiment showed that painting the belly of
the plane white made it blend in better with the gray skies of the north atlantic the white
belly bomber could get 20 closer to the target before being sighted on average and that meant
it projected 30 increasing kill rate a no-brainer on the other hand what sometimes seemed like a
no-brainer really wasn't for example if our planes have enough engine power to carry more armor
where should we put it to answer that question people looked at planes that limped home after
suffering german anti aircraft fire operational research is data driven the damage intended to
fall in certain areas of the plane so naturally they suggested that those areas receive extra armor
except except black its team came to exactly the opposite conclusion the planes that were
being seen were the ones that made it back which meant the areas where they took damage
were not vital to be able to be able to return from a mission his team recommended reinforcing
those parts of a plane that were conspicuously not damaged on the returning aircraft
operational research or as it came to be known in the u.s. operations research was useful throughout
the war it doubled the on target bomb rate for beef 29s in fact attacking japan it increased
you boat hunting kills by a factor of about 10 most of this and other work was classified during
the war years so it wasn't until after the war that people started turning a serious eye toward
what operational research could do in other areas and the real move in that direction started in
the 1950s with the introduction of the electronic computer until the advent of the modern computer
even if we knew how to solve a problem from a practical standpoint it was often just too much
darned work weather forecasting for example had some mathematical techniques available from the
1920s but it was impossible to reasonably compute the predictions of the model before the actual
weather occurred computers changed that in a big way and opportunities have only accelerated
more in recent decades gordon e more co-founder of intel first suggested in 1965 what's since
come to be known as more's law that transistor chip count on an integrated circuit doubles
about every two years a lot of things that we care about like processor speed and memory
capacity grow along with it over more than 50 years the laws continue to remain remarkably
accurate it's hard to get a grip on how much growth that kind of doubling implies more's law
predicted accurately that the number of chips on an integrated circuit in 2011 was about 88 million
times as high as it was in 1965 still hard to grasp that's the difference between taking a
single step and walking from august to main to seattle washington by way of houston and la
and all that power now available to individuals and companies at an affordable price so
we've got complicated and important problems like it or not we've got computing power the
last piece of the puzzle is the mathematical decision-making techniques that allow us to
better understand the problem and put all that computational power to work how does that work
well let me answer that first very broadly and then sharpen the picture first you've got to
decide what you're trying to accomplish then you have to get the data that's relevant to the
problem at hand did a collection in cleansing can always be a challenge but our computer age
makes that easier than ever before so much information is automatically collected and
much of it can be repeat retrieved with a few keystrokes but then comes perhaps the key step
the problem lives in the real world but in order to use the powerful synergy of mathematics and
computers it has to be transported into a new more abstract world the way that it always feels to me
is not so much the problems transported as translated from the english that we use to
describe it to one another into mathematics if you like the language of math isn't suited to
describe everything the beauty of a sunset is and i suspect always will be beyond mathematics
but what it can capture it does with unparalleled precision and stunning economy
i'll come back to this step in a few minutes but for now let's imagine that you've succeeded in
you're creating your translation you've modeled the problem what do you do with this shiny new
formulation you do what humans always do you look for patterns you try to see how this new
problem is like the ones that you've seen before and then apply experience with them with do it
just like the ancient wisdom that we discussed at the beginning of this lecture that experience
may be personal or it may be hard won by others and passed on to you but when an operations
researcher thinks about what other problems are similar to the current one he or she's thinking
about most of all the mathematical formulation not the real world context in daily life you might
have useful categories like business or medicine or engineering but relying on these categories
and operations research is as sensible as thinking that if you know how to buy a car then you know
how to make one since both tasks deal with cars in or the categorization of the problem depends on
the mathematical character of the problem the industry in which it comes from is it matters
only in helping to specify the mathematical character of that problem correctly so we'll
be introducing a wide variety of useful mathematical categories in this course each one is a category
because some collection of very bright people figured out an approach that works for everything
in that category that's lovely the approach is like a super highway to your answer very fast
very smooth and once you're on the right road quite easy to follow but almost every trip is going
to have an initial segment taking you from home to the highway by secondary roads without that part
the super highway isn't going to do you much good that initial part of the journey is the
translation of the problem from English to math that we discussed earlier modeling formulation
so we're also going to spend quite a bit of time making sure that you have the expertise
that will let you reach the highway for a lot of problem types and will give you a feel an
intuition for each problem type or technique to help you find your way one important way that we
can classify problems is either stochastic or deterministic stochastic problems involve random
elements deterministic problems don't kimberley clark knew what their machines could make what
quantities of each product they needed how long it would take to reconfigure a machine between
one product and the next don't don't don't a deterministic problem determining a corporate
response to a potential public relations nightmare that's stochastic many problems ultimately have
both deterministic and stochastic elements so it's helpful to begin our course with some statistics
and data mining to get a sense of what that combination looks like right up front both topics
are fields in their own right that often play important roles in operations research a lot
of the deterministic problems in or focus on optimization for problems that are simple or on
a small scale the optimal solution may be obvious but it's the scale or complexity of the problem
increases the number of possible courses of action tends to explode think of guessing someone's
one character password as opposed to guessing their 16 character one an experience shows that
seed of the pants decision-making can often result in terrible strategies but once the problems
translated into mathematics we can apply the full power of that discipline to finding its best answer
we're going to see that in a real sense these problems can often be thought of as finding the
highest or lowest point in some mathematical landscape how we do this is going to depend on
the topography of that landscape it's easier to navigate a pasture than a glacial moraine
it's also easier to find your way through open countryside than through a landscape criss-crossed
with fences if you're taking calculus you know that it's great at finding highest and lowest
points at least when the landscape is rolling hills and the fences are well behaved or non-existent
but in calculus we tend to have complicated functions and simple boundary conditions
for many of the practical problems we'll explore in this course through linear programming
we have exactly the opposite simple functions but complicated boundary conditions in fact calculus
tends to be useless and irrelevant for linear functions both because the derivatives involved
are all constants and because the optimum of a linear function is always on the boundary of its
domain never where the derivative is zero so i'm going to focus on other ways of approaching
optimization problems ways that don't require a considerable background in calculus and are
better at handling problems with cliffs and fences these deterministic techniques often
allow companies like flex jet and continental to use computer power to solve in minutes problems
that would take hours or days to sort out on our own when flex jet finally knows what its
routing requirements are or when continental becomes aware of the disruptions to its normal
operations their models can compute solutions almost instantaneously not only prescriptions
of what should be done but reports on how sensitive the solutions are to the minor errors in the data
that were used to create the model in the first place how about more sizable uncertainty as soon
as the situation that you're facing involves a random process you're probably not going to be
able to guarantee that you'll find the best answer to the situation at least not a best answer in
the sense that we meant it for deterministic problems for example given the opportunity to buy
a lottery ticket the best strategy is buy it if it's a winning ticket and don't buy it if it's not
lovely strategy but of course we don't know whether it's a winner or a loser at the time that
you're deciding to make the purchase so we have to come up with a different way to measure the
quality of our decisions when we're dealing with random processes and we'll need different
techniques which will develop in the last section of the course probability Bayesian statistics
markoff analysis simulation one thing's for sure in a stuff happens kind of situation we're going
to want to be able to get a handle on the range of possible results of a strategy how good can
things end up how bad and how likely is how bad so there's a lot to talk about predictive models
optimization stochastic models a lot of powerful tools a lot of practical applications
and some surprises along the way
