Let's talk about nanotechnology through the lens of the electronics revolution, of the
computer revolution.
Why does that sensible thing to do?
Why does that make sense?
Well we've talked from a really basic point of view about electrons flowing and controlling
one another.
I'll make the case that electronics and computers are really about electrons controlling other
electrons and of course our capacity to design integrated circuits, chips that control, program
and take advantage of that.
I'll also show in this first of two lectures on electronics and computers that the march
forward for electronics since its advent in the 1950s and 60s has been taking us from
kind of the macroscopic to the micrometer to the millionth of the meter and then in
the second lecture I'll show that the march that electronics is marching along is now
well into the nanometer.
And so when you talk about electronics today you're talking about nanotechnology.
There's nanotechnology inside your computer and in your cell phone and in your digital
camera.
And then the final point is that the technologies that have enabled us to get down to this nanoscale,
they were the ones that took us first to the microscale.
They were the basis for carving matter on the scale first of the micrometer and then
the nanometer.
So these are platform technologies for what we call top down nanotechnology.
They are the basis for our ability to manipulate matter the way we need to for nanotechnology.
So first in this lecture we'll speak about going from the macro world around us to the
scale of the micrometer and how that relates to building computers.
First though let's just look back at some old pictures that I think many of us have
seen about computers like the ENIAC which did for the electronic numerical integrator
and computer.
ENIAC was the first general purpose electronic computer.
What does that mean general purpose?
Well it meant that it could be reprogrammed.
So it wasn't something that was only a calculator, only did a specific set of arithmetic operations.
You could use it to solve a whole bunch of different problems.
Now it was actually designed for a fairly specific purpose.
It was in World War II and the United States Army needed to be able to rapidly calculate
how to launch artillery.
This was for its Ballistics Research Laboratory.
And so in 1943 in a secret agreement it started off with University of Pennsylvania's Electrical
Engineering School on building this general purpose computer.
Building this ENIAC if you adjust the dollar figures to today's values cost about six million
dollars.
And I think impressively it kept going in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955.
So getting on for ten years how many computers do you have that you've continuously used
for eight or ten years without them going obsolete and you upgrading to another one.
So I think that's impressive that the ENIAC had such a long useful life.
Now I mentioned this idea of general purpose computer but the way the ENIAC was programmed
wasn't the way we think of programming today, it wasn't with software, it was actually with
specific plugs and electrical connections and wires connecting with each other.
And that idea of a reprogrammable via a stored program which is software idea actually was
exploited a little bit after ENIAC and I think that's kind of interesting to think back to
there was a day, there was a time when we didn't think of kind of the world of computing
is having hardware on top of which software ran but that itself was a new idea.
So how do computers like ENIAC work?
How did the original ones work?
Well the founding feature that's common to ENIAC and is common to what's in your computer
and your cell phone today is as I was saying what we call electronics which really is electrons
controlling other electrons.
Why is that a basis for computation or analysis or computing or arithmetic?
Well if you think of one simple component and I'll start with a vacuum tube but we'll
move on to transistors, start with a vacuum tube if you have a current that can flow between
two points between two electrodes and if you can use a third either a current or a voltage
with some kind of other electrode to steer that current around to turn it on and off
well then you have the basis for digital computing where the world is filled with ones and zeros
and with ones and zeros we can accurately represent information over huge swaths of dynamic range
and if you can control that current flow not just with zeros and ones not just to complete
on and off but if you can control it to intermediate phases then you have the basis for what we
call analog or kind of continuous electronics where you can vary these different levels.
Well that second phenomenon the analog electronics if you can if I can change the control signal
just a bit and I can get a large change in the current well then I have amplification
and so the history of computing is really intimately tied to the original discoveries
like lead to forest work which allowed electronic amplification because then you can take a
radio signal as was done then and you can amplify it so you can pick weak signals just
out of the air and then turn them into an audio signal in this case that you can listen
to and so this field of the analog the field of the digital these are the two primordial
bases of electronics but in a way they're sort of using the same building blocks these
vacuum tubes initially which then evolved into the transistors which we'll talk about
in a sec they one of them uses them in this sort of continuously varying mode and the
other is the on and the off.
Okay so let's go to the vacuum tubes I think these pictures of vacuum tubes are familiar
when we were looking at ENIAC we saw all of these sort of panels with periodic arrangements
of things and those were the vacuum tubes kind of looks a bit like a light bulb and
it has something in common with the light bulb which is that it inside it is a vacuum.
Now for this controlling of the flow of electrons why do we need a vacuum well the answer is
that if we didn't have a vacuum if we had air then electrons trying to flow in the form
of a current would basically run into the molecules that make up the air they'd collide
and so we'd lose our current we'd need to apply vastly more voltage than otherwise in
order to get our sufficient current to flow and so inside the vacuum tube we have the
perfect environment for the free flow of electrons and so we just heat up in a vacuum
tube one of the electrodes and enough energy is now available from thermal energy to result
in the emission of an electron the phenomenon is called thermionic emission the therm being
the temperature of the thermal and then with the aid of an electrical field these electrons
can then really scream through this vacuum without any impediment because of the lack
of anything else present now that's that's just a start that's not something that has
electrons controlling electrons yet that's just establishing the current where the control
comes in is with this third electrode which can control independently whether that current
flows think of it as being kind of in the perpendicular direction I will turn on or
off the flow of that current using a third electrode conceivably without having to really
invest much electrical current or very much electrical power at all that's the key to
amplification is to have just a touch of a modulation on the control side have a big
impact on the flow of current so we talked about how the vacuum was necessary it led
to the free flow of electrons but you can easily picture and you already know the problems
with a computer based on kind of a bunch of light bulbs I mean they're all going to be
burning out and if there's thousands of light bulbs or thousands of vacuum tubes making
up the computer at any given time the things can be down as a result of one of the vacuum
tubes that's gone off and that's exactly what happened and that was that was exactly one
of the problems so really the field of transistor electronics of semiconductor electronics was
born of the desire to take advantage of the best properties of the vacuum tube which is
its free flow of electrons and its enablement of control over that flow but get beyond this
reliability issue get beyond the size issue scale things down so this picture is showing
one of the very first transistors and here the electronic current didn't flow through
vacuum it flowed within the semiconductor and that's the first function of the semiconductor
let's let's think about a crystal of silicon it's this perfect array a perfect pure array
of atoms they're completely ordered they're completely periodic and now think of the electron
we spoke about how it's actually a wave we don't usually think of it that way we picture
it sometimes as a pointer as a particle but it's actually a wave and so within a semiconductor
we can have an idea of what's called commensurability and this means that the wave of the electron
can follow perfectly the wave of silicon atoms you can have a silicon atom a silicon atom
and another silicon atom and you can have commensurable flow of this electron wave it
can be delocalized as we were speaking about with ways it can be ubiquitous it can be everywhere
and so now without having to establish this perfect vacuum and make this large tube that
has these reliability issues we're able through the perfection through the order through the
structure of semiconductors through their purity through their crystallinity we're able
to achieve the same everywhere nests in the electrons so that's this key element that
we took the learning from the vacuum tube field and that we managed to translate into
the solid state so when we talk about solid state electronics we're talking about going
from this evacuated phase the vacuum and we're talking about translating the good stuff from
that into a solid state device that we can then also start to make many of and we can
make them a lot smaller now before we talk about making them a lot smaller there's something
crucial and it was a crucial discovery in the field of electronics and it was it was
only when we figured out how to manage the interfaces of these materials so the connection
between say a piece of silicon or a piece of germanium as a lot of the early work was done
in the connection between that in the outside world which of course we refer to as the surface
of the interface here and not all the silicon atoms are happy right we talked about how
in diamond or in silicon the carbon or the silicon atoms respectively see four nearest
neighbors well that's perfectly true right inside the bulk of the semiconductor but
at the interface one of these silicon atoms could see nothingness above it and so from
a chemical standpoint unless we take special steps to manage the interface silicon is not
perfect right at its interface nor is any semiconductor now silicon it turns out has
this very special property which is that when you take a interface of silicon with the rest
of the world and you just let it oxidize you let it form SiO2 which is glass and you do
to the right temperatures and you do it in the right humidity you can form this oxide
we call it the native oxide because it's exactly what silicon forms when you introduce oxygen
or water on top of it you can form this oxide that forms a very clean interface and so now
these silicon atoms that are mostly satisfied in the bonds but they have this one bond hanging
up that bond can be satisfied through the presence through the formation of this native
oxide that's also really easy to make that's very convenient because oxidation we just need
to cook things you know in the right environment and we grow this native oxide on the surface
of the silicon so what we've talked about here and what's in this picture is a single transistor
of course that's not a basis for computing this discrete transistor we need to connect it together
at least with some other transistors there's going to be wiring involved right there's going to be
points of connection involved well okay let's connect together a couple of transistors here's
what an undergrad electrical engineer still builds today it's called a breadboard and it's got a bunch
of these individual transistors each one of these blue things and black things is a transistors
typically with three terminals and this breadboard allows for a relatively convenient connection you
can put resistors in as well so you know every electrical engineer and I'm an undergraduate
electrical engineer I remember suffering through this in third year in our electronics course we
build these circuits by actually jabbing these little discrete transistor elements into this
board and then putting wires and resistors and connecting them all together how many of these
can you put together until you go crazy 10 20 30 maybe 40 if you're lucky and most of the time
you've got a wire in the wrong place and it doesn't work you've got to debug your circuit and so
it's what we now would say with the insights of the integrated circuit revolution it's what we
now call not a scalable solution it's not something where if you come up with a good idea to make a
circuit based on the manageable 30 transistors and then the next day you say wow if I could take
two of those circuits and combine them or four or 16 of them combine them I could make a parallel
computer that could do 16 times more computations well it's 16 times more work and so it's not
conveniently or in a cost-effective way scalable technology and so that's where the integrated
circuit comes in we use the word monolithic integration and the monolithic you know it makes
sense it's one rock we're we're making one piece of semiconductor now and people found out in the
50s in the 60s how they could carve many transistors into the same rock and the rock is a crystalline
piece of silicon it's a large piece of silicon it's a large substrate and what we needed was as well
as the ability to make many of these transistors typically they're actually essentially all the
same as each other we're just making many copies many repeats of the same thing it's like you're
taking a potato carving and image out of it and then just repeating it many times we then also
have to connect them and so what we needed was a path to build many transistors and then
systematically connect them and of course reliably connect them with each other and that wiring on
a two-dimensional substrate that's fairly readily done once we first define how we put these
transistors down where we locate them relative to each other then we'll connect them with a bunch
of wires so for example and this and we do this all the time you can imagine having a mask that
we call a shadow mask where you cut holes in it and you allow a metal you heat a metal up and you
allow it to evaporate and it only penetrates through the holes and it doesn't penetrate where
it's obscured and so you can form interconnect you can form layers of connectivity you can make
wires on your two-dimensional chip and your wires can now connect together all of your
transistors let's take a little bit take a little bit of a look here at how we do this I mean that
shadow mask technology it's a start and actually we do it you know in my own lab University when
we're trying to do course connections and many of them it's a great way to do things and you can go
and carve out that mask yourself but it's not going to get you down even to the micrometer length
scale so the technology that we use to get down to the micrometer and and somewhat beyond is called
photolithography and in photolithography instead of just taking that mask and sticking right up
against your wafer you have an a mask whose purpose is to be optically transparent in certain
regions and to be opaque in the other regions and then you project light through a lens and you
project it down onto the wafer onto the substrate the silicon that you're going to go build your
transistors on and you essentially just put an image of your mask onto that that wafer now what
does that light have to do with anything well on that wafer at every stage is something we call
the photo resist and it's really just like photographic film it's something where you expose
this material and if it sees light then when you put it later in a developer solution like old
fashioned pre-digital photography it washes away but if it wasn't exposed to light it goes in the
same developer but it doesn't develop it hasn't had this photo catalytic reaction occur it will
stay intact and so now what you've done is you formed a template on your silicon wafer that allows
you to do quite a number of different possible things so one of the things you can do if you
want to make wires is you evaporate that metal on here and then you subsequently wash away the
remaining photo resist and where the metal may direct contact with semiconductor it sticks and
where it was just sitting on this soluble a removable photo resist you lift it off what if
you want to build a transistor well the building blocks of transistor construction involve taking
these silicon crystals and putting controlled levels of impurity very low concentrations of
impurities in there so you can use this mask that you've made and you can introduce impurities onto
the surface of your silicon and if they're in direct contact with the silicon surface they'll
diffuse in through that surface into the silicon and where you have a mask that blocks their contact
their interaction with the interface they don't and so you can selectively alter the properties
of your silicon from on top so this lithography process that is done using photons today using
light is the basis for being able to make incredibly scalable integrated circuits and one of the
inevitable needs of the electronic sector is you know we're we're hungry as consumers we're as soon
as we get something we want something even better and so there's this desire to scale to make things
more integrated to make integrated circuits that are faster that use less power that are more
sophisticated more complex that can process a huge image a huge and complex image and can process
it so fast that you can't even tell when you're interacting with your computer that billions
of operations had to happen well how do we do that and and keep things keep size under control
it involves making the transistor smaller and smaller with every generation and to make them
smaller and smaller you can you can see where this is going if we're using photons which
are waves which have extent then eventually we're going to sort of run out of steam there because
as we said before we're not going to be able to confine that focal point of light onto something
smaller than about the wavelength of the light that we're working with and so the march forward
of lithography is also the march to shorter and shorter wavelengths it's gone from being in the
visible to in the ultraviolet to deeper into the ultraviolet and there's even work on x-ray
lithography today and so here our understanding of waves and wavelengths and the ability to focus
them is key to understanding the technological march of photolithography as we move to
shorter and shorter wavelengths to more and more energetic particles as we do so
so how do we build these circuits in a way that's reliable i mean let's let's think about the
number of transistors that we have to put down today it's in the billions in one of these
integrated circuits well perhaps you've seen a picture of somebody working in a clean room
as they're called obviously the purpose here is to minimize dust and particles because a little
piece of dust that lands on one of our transistors in one region of this big wafer containing many
integrated circuits and all of a sudden that integrated circuit is a chance of not working
so in clean rooms the pictures you will have seen have people wearing what we call bunny suits
technical term and they're they're covered head to toe you can't see who it is or if it's man or
woman they have little slippers on that are disposable slippers and and these allow you
know all the little bits of dust little bacterial little viral particles people are very dirty they
allow us to minimize the extent to which these particles get released into the room and potentially
onto your wafer in fact the latest generations of clean room technologies tried to just minimize
the extent to which there's people in there at all tried to do everything as much by a robotic
operation of moving these wafers around where everything can be just kept in this completely
pure and clean environment you know and I for my own phd I used to go into a clean room at
Cornell it was called Cornell Nanofabrication Facility and and and there and and at every
clean room you know if you wanted to write your notes or write in a lab book you'd have a special
lab book or special notebook a kind of paper that doesn't slough off little bits of dust
but that's allowed for use in a clean room because it's essentially dust free paper that's how
sensitive we are to these kinds of issues now given this complexity given that we're talking
about these rooms with incredible environmental control with control over temperatures with control
over humidity these are very costly things to build in fact today to build a clean room in
which we can build the latest generations of integrated circuits costs three to four billion
dollars so the number of these places where we build integrated circuits is actually very small
now and what has emerged in the last couple of decades is what people call the foundry model
so there are companies that make all their own branded integrated circuits but there are also
places where anybody can come in and you know for a price typically charged per wafer you
can build using an established set of technologies using these kinds of photolithography you can
choose your metal layers you can choose how you diffuse dopants into a semiconductor you can
build using these available recipes and you can send them your circuit designs and they can
actually build your circuits for you so you don't end up spending the three or four billion
dollars as a company or as a startup company in order to build your circuits but instead you
just pay for the use of that facility people call this model the fabless model and by that they
don't mean that it's not fabulous they mean that you don't have to have your own fab your own
fabrication facility but instead you can leverage existing infrastructure so where are these
integrated circuits I mean we know we know that they're inside our computers that's kind of the
canonical example but these integrated circuits are in all sorts of places they're so for example
the digital camera that you use it has an integrated circuit where the silicon is being
used to absorb the light there are processors these days that are devoted entirely to the
processing of graphics in fact the processors these days have become so complex and so sophisticated
that the amount of heat being generated energy being generated on them is so large that they're
now starting to become segmented where instead of having a single processor there are what are
called multiple cores where there are different regions of processors that talk to one another
to some degree but most of their time they're off in parallel working on different computational
problems and then kind of sharing the information you know there's other sort of more surprising
or more unusual things that you do with integrated circuits so your cell phone transmitter is now
made with an integrated circuit that's more on the analog side of the world where just like in
the first radios you're trying to transmit electromagnetic waves or receive and then
amplify very sensitively electromagnetic waves this whole trend this whole
incredible race to the bottom is as Richard Feynman called it this race towards the smaller and
smaller it was described in what has become known as Moore's law and some people object to the use
of the word law to describe Moore's law the the the law here is that it's an empirical law it's an
observation it's a description that Gordon Moore made Gordon one of the founders of Intel made
in about 1965 and he described that from 1958 to 1965 that about every two years there had been a
doubling of what you could put onto an integrated circuit of a given size so you could put twice as
many transistors you could make a circuit a computer that was twice as sophisticated twice as complex
every two years and typically you could do it for about the same price and this is a great this is a
great recipe and this this is the it's that doubling every two years an exponential growth law
that can be used to describe how the integrated circuit revolution has happened
and we've gone from those discrete elements where thinking about putting tens of transistors onto
a breadboard is already difficult to being able to put billions of transistors onto a chip becomes
possible and it's possible to do it for costs that are either measured in the few dollars or measured
in the tens of dollars per chip it all is directly traceable to this scalability of integrated circuit
technologies so to summarize really what we've discussed in today's lecture it's kind of the
precursor to the nano revolution but in fact we really through Moore's law we we face right up
against the nanometer now because we do have the capacity to use shorter and shorter wavelengths
of light through photolithography to make our transistors smaller and smaller to pack so many
of them on that we are invariably and inevitably at the cusp of the nanoscale in fact the integrated
circuit you have in your computer today consists of transistors that are made using technologies
that can access below 100 nanometers so they're well into the nanometer length scale and so the
big question for the remaining half of this discussion of electronics in next lectures will
be the following what happens when we start to build our transistors on the scale of a nanometer
I argued in the discussion of the physics of the nanoscale that exciting things happened that this
was an opportunity to engineer phenomena like quantum mechanic phenomena on the other hand
when you think about Gordon Moore's observation even if it's just an empirical law there is an
impression of continuity there right there's the sense that we will be able to scale we'll be able
to gradually transition to smaller and smaller geometries build greater and greater complexity
and there's no brick wall there there isn't a change in the rules but they were just extrapolating
on the existing rules and so in the next lecture what we'll talk about is this tension on the one
hand the fact that to extrapolate to smaller and smaller geometries to continue this tremendous
legacy of Moore's law that we're going to be doing so within a new physical regime the regime where
we hit up against quantum effects but at the same time there will be opportunity there will be
these new physical effects things like electron tunneling things like really seeing the size of
electronic waves not being able to ignore their waves anymore and there are people who are working
at the nanometer scale in nano electronics to try to leverage those phenomena for new paradigms in
computing
