Checking Conflict Management/01. Why Conflict Management Matters.txt
1. **Conflict Definition**: Conflict is defined as a discomforting difference that bothers at least one of the parties involved and involves interdependence, opposition, expression, and negative emotions.

2. **Early Lessons on Conflict**: We often learn how to deal with conflict from our earliest experiences in life, which can shape our approach to conflict throughout adulthood. These lessons are frequently reinforced through our interactions within organizations and society at large.

3. **Wrong Ideas and Metaphors**: Common metaphors like "battle" or "clash" can perpetuate unhelpful attitudes towards conflict, such as viewing it as something to be won rather than resolved. This can make it harder to address conflicts effectively.

4. **Assignment for Lecture 1**: Reflect on the most compelling lesson about conflict you learned early in life and describe how this lesson influences your typical behavior when handling conflict. Additionally, come up with two or three examples of conflict from your own experience that you can use to test insights from the course.

5. **Next Steps in the Course**: The course will explore the nature of conflict, the roles we play within it, and the emotions involved (Lectures 3-14). It will then delve into specific relational contexts such as personal relationships and organizational settings (Lectures 15-18), before concluding with discussions on seeking help, managing aftermath, teaching conflict management to children, and future directions.

6. **Historical Context**: Before modern research, the ancient Greeks developed the adversary system, which is arguably the most important discovery in conflict management. This system will be discussed in detail in Lecture 2.

Checking Conflict Management/02. The Adversary System.txt
1. The adversary system has been a significant improvement in conflict management, substituting verbal combat for physical combat and preventing violence. It is essential for conflict resolution in modern society.
2. However, the adversary system has downsides: it can be expensive, time-consuming, and emotionally damaging to individuals and relationships involved. It also tends to perpetuate a competitive rather than cooperative mindset.
3. The adversary system is still relevant today and understanding it is crucial for effective participation in legal and societal debates.
4. To navigate the adversary system effectively, one should:
   - Understand forensic reasoning.
   - Recognize the issue at hand.
   - Consider the credibility of the evidence presented.
   - Check one's own logic and assumptions.
   - Anticipate and respond to the opponent's arguments.
   - Seek good professional help when necessary.
5. The downsides of the adversary system include it sometimes prioritizing winning over being right, leading to unnecessary expense and emotional harm. It also keeps individuals in a competitive mindset, which may not be conducive to resolution or collaboration.
6. As an assignment for further development, those interested in improving their argumentation skills within the adversary system are encouraged to take a course, read relevant literature, or engage in other educational activities to enhance their logical reasoning and debating abilities.
7. In the next lecture, we will explore how Morten Deutsch challenged the assumption of competitiveness in conflict resolution in the mid-20th century, leading to the concept of win-win solutions.

Checking Conflict Management/03. Morton Deutsch and the Concept of Win-Win.txt
1. **Key Figure**: Morten Deutsch is a pioneering figure in the field of conflict resolution and management. He challenged the prevailing belief that conflict is inherently competitive, introducing the concept that conflict can have a win-win outcome where both parties involved can benefit.

2. **Breakthrough Discovery**: Deutsch's research showed that conflict isn't a zero-sum game, which was a fundamental shift in understanding how conflicts can be resolved. This discovery opened up new possibilities for resolving conflicts more effectively.

3. **Utility of the Discovery**: While Deutsch's insight is valuable, it only provides a starting point. To truly improve our conflict resolution skills, we must delve deeper into subsequent research that builds upon his findings.

4. **Ongoing Work**: Individuals must actively work to replace outdated beliefs about conflict with new understandings. This process involves continuous effort and is not easily achieved.

5. **Assignment**: Reflect on recent instances where the term "win-win" was used, considering whether it was employed accurately or glibly. Contemplate how a full understanding and application of win-win could have led to better outcomes in those situations.

6. **Next Steps**: In the next lecture (Lecture Four), we will explore the insights that follow from Deutsch's discovery, focusing on the role of perceptions in conflict. Understanding how different perspectives can shape one's view of a conflict is crucial for effective conflict management.

In essence, this lecture highlighted the importance of Morten Deutsch's contribution to the field of conflict resolution and set the stage for understanding the nuances of conflict perception, which will be covered in greater detail in the following lecture. The overarching goal is to equip individuals with the knowledge and tools to resolve conflicts in a manner that benefits all parties involved.

Checking Conflict Management/04. Perception, Perspective, and Punctuation.txt
1. **Conflict Origins from Perception**: Conflicts often arise not from the actual differences between individuals but from our perceptions of those differences. It's crucial to understand this because it affects how we interact and resolve issues.

2. **Person-Centered Interaction**: We must engage with others on a personal, psychological, and full human level without losing sight of the objective realities present in any given situation.

3. **Avoiding Correctness and Rightness**: To achieve win-win resolutions, we should focus less on who is correct or right and more on understanding both perspectives and finding a solution that integrates both points of view.

4. **Understanding Perceptions**: It's essential to understand our own perceptions as well as those of the other party involved in a conflict. This involves recognizing how each person's perspective shapes their perception of the situation.

5. **Influence of Punctuation**: The timing at which an individual notices a situation can significantly influence their perception of what is happening. This concept of punctuation is a key factor in how we perceive events differently.

6. **Avoiding the Fundamental Attribution Error**: We tend to blame others for conflicts and excuse ourselves, which often leads to misunderstandings and escalates conflicts unnecessarily.

7. **Homework Assignment**: Reflect on a past conflict by using the lens model provided by Howard and Willmont to understand your perspective versus that of the other party, considering how differences in punctuation might have affected each of your perceptions.

8. **Next Steps**: In the following lecture, we will explore emotions in conflicts, their impact, and strategies for managing them effectively to de-escalate tension and work towards resolution.

Checking Conflict Management/05. Managing Multiple and Conflicting Emotions.txt
1. Emotions are internal facts that are present in every conflict, influencing our reasoning and behavior. They cannot be simply wished away or ignored but must be acknowledged and managed.

2. Reporting emotions involves using "I" statements to communicate what you're feeling without blaming the other person. It requires a safe environment, adequate communication skills, self-esteem, and a willing and able partner to listen.

3. Taking time away to calm down, if necessary, can prevent emotional responses from escalating out of control when the arousal level is too high.

4. In any conflict, it's essential to recognize and respect the other party's emotions as privileged communication, treating them with trustworthiness and not using them against the person.

5. As an assignment, try expressing your emotions during the next conflict you encounter by using "I" statements and observe the outcomes. This can lead to more effective and constructive communication.

6. In our next lecture, we will explore the topic of goals in conflicts, understanding that they are complex, multiple, and often conflicting, and require careful handling to navigate through a conflict successfully.

Checking Conflict Management/06. Practicing Egyptian Religion.txt
1. **Akenartan's Monotheistic Experiment**: Pharaoh Amenhotep IV (later known as Akhenaten) attempted a radical shift from polytheism to monotheism around 1350 BC, promoting the worship of the sun-disk, the Aten, and changing his name to Akhenaten, which means "beneficial to the Aten." This move was met with significant resistance and was deeply unsettling for the Egyptian people who had followed traditional polytheistic beliefs for over 1500 years.

2. **Challenges in Transition**: The transition from polytheism to monotheism, as exemplified by Akhenaten's experiment, presents significant challenges. It requires a fundamental change in worldview and the abandonment of long-held beliefs. There is also the fear that such a change could upset the balance of the world or offend the gods.

3. **Egyptian Religion**: Egyptian religion was relatively non-demanding on the common people, who did not need to be experts in religious matters. The priesthood and the pharaoh managed the worship of the gods, and if things went wrong, they were often blamed. The average person only needed to participate in festivals and ensure their daily lives were in order.

4. **Hebrew Monotheism**: A comparison can be drawn with the Hebrews' transition to monotheism as described in the book of Exodus, which also presents challenges such as overcoming old habits and resisting the temptation to revert to polytheism.

5. **Death and the Afterlife**: In the next lecture, we will explore the other significant aspect of Egyptian religion, which involved the elaborate preparations for death and the afterlife. Egyptians believed in continuing life after death, and this belief influenced many aspects of their culture and daily practices.

In summary, while Egyptian society was largely tolerant of different religious beliefs, Akhenaten's attempt to introduce monotheism was a significant but ultimately unsuccessful departure from tradition. The common people's engagement with religion was minimal, leaving the management of divine worship to priests and pharaohs. The focus on death and the afterlife played a crucial role in Egyptian culture, which is evident even today in the artifacts and practices that have been preserved through history.

Checking Conflict Management/07. Power—How Much We Need and How to Use It.txt
1. **Definition of Power**: Power is the ability to influence outcomes. Influence is crucial because it determines how much impact we have on a situation or relationship.

2. **Sources of Power**: Power comes from various sources, including personal characteristics, relationships, and the context or situation at hand. It's multifaceted and can change over time.

3. **Assessing Power**: It's important to recognize that everyone has some power in every conflict, and it's essential to understand both our own power and the power of the other party.

4. **Sufficiency of Power**: We don't need more power than the other person; we just need enough to make collaboration worthwhile for them.

5. **Power Dynamics**: The more equal the power distribution, the more likely a satisfactory and lasting resolution will be reached.

6. **Exercise of Power**: Those with less power should remain engaged, seek allies, enhance their skills, and avoid escalating the conflict into a spiral. Those with more power should exercise restraint and recognize interdependence.

7. **Assignment**: Reflect on a recent conflict by considering the other party's stake in your satisfaction, identifying choices or consequences you could have used as leverage, and assessing how you might have increased your leverage if it was not already maximized.

8. **Next Steps**: In upcoming lectures, we will explore strategies for managing conflict based on our default conflict styles, which are shaped by our early experiences with conflict. These styles will be the focus of lecture eight.

Checking Conflict Management/08. Conflict Styles.txt
1. **Conflict Styles**: We've learned that individuals have default styles for handling conflict, which were established early in life and are automatic responses. These styles include avoidance, competition, compromise, accommodation, and collaboration. Each has its place, but collaboration is generally the most constructive approach.

2. **Response Options**: When encountering conflict, we have three main options: turning toward (collaboration), turning away (avoidance), or turning against (competition or hostility). The quality of relationships often improves when both parties predominantly use turning toward behavior.

3. **Assignment**: The lecturer asks the audience to assess their own conflict styles by reflecting on past conflicts and identifying their automatic responses. Additionally, they suggest discussing with a close personal relationship partner how each responds to conflict (turning toward, turning away, or turning against) and working together to improve the relationship by aiming for more frequent turning toward behavior.

4. **Looking Ahead**: In the next lectures, we will explore specific strategies to handle conflict effectively, including identifying dysfunctional strategies to avoid and employing constructive processes and principles to achieve win-win outcomes in conflicts.

5. **Key Insight**: The overarching principle is that successful conflict resolution generally requires a collaborative approach, where both parties work together to understand each other's perspectives and find solutions that address the needs of all parties involved.

Checking Conflict Management/09. Dysfunctional Conflict Strategies.txt
1. **Avoidance**: Use only when the risk of harm from confronting the conflict is too great. Otherwise, try to engage in the conflict.

2. **Withdrawal**: Utilize this approach if you need to avoid dealing with the conflict and withdrawal is the only way to do so without damaging the relationship.

3. **Imposition**: Employ imposition only when you absolutely must achieve your outcome and there's no opportunity for consultation or agreement with the other party.

4. **Manipulation**: Avoid manipulation entirely, as it is dishonest and can harm relationships that should be built on trust and honesty.

5. **Absolute Framing**: Use this strategy when you are dealing with matters of absolute principle where compromise would be a violation of your core values or beliefs. Otherwise, strive for flexibility.

6. **Triangulation**: Minimize the use of triangulation unless it's absolutely necessary and can serve as an outlying solution in the long run. It's generally harmful to relationships.

7. **Payback (Revenge)**: Do not use revenge or payback, as it typically escalates conflict and causes more harm than good, especially to the relationship.

8. **Compromise**: Engage in compromise only after you have genuinely attempted to reach a win-win solution and determined that a win-win is not attainable. Compromise should be a last resort when the outcomes are less critical.

In summary, these dysfunctional strategies should be used sparingly and only under specific conditions where they are absolutely necessary. They can have harmful effects on both the conflict at hand and the relationship between the parties involved. The goal is to aim for constructive conflict resolution that benefits all parties and maintains healthy relationships. In the next lecture, we will explore principles and processes for effective negotiation based on the work of Roger Fisher and William Urie. As an assignment, reflect on a recent conflict and analyze the strategies used, their effectiveness, and any unintended negative consequences they may have had.

Checking Conflict Management/10. Principled Negotiation.txt
1. **Separate People from the Problem**: It's crucial to differentiate between the individuals involved in a conflict and the issue at hand. Personal attacks or attributions can hinder progress and should be avoided. Instead, focus on the problem itself, not the people.

2. **Focus on Interests, Not Positions**: Understand that positions are the parties' initial statements of their wants and needs, which often lead to conflict. Interests, however, are the underlying reasons why individuals hold those positions. By identifying and understanding each party's interests, you can find common ground and work towards a solution that satisfies both sides.

3. **Generate Options for Mutual Gain**: Once you have a clear understanding of everyone's interests, brainstorm a wide range of alternatives to resolve the conflict. The more creative and varied the options, the more likely you are to find one that provides mutual benefits, making it easier for both parties to accept the solution.

4. **Use Objective Criteria**: Establishing objective standards or criteria can help evaluate the different options generated in the previous step. These criteria should be agreed upon by all parties involved and provide a fair basis for decision-making, ensuring that the chosen option is the best one for everyone.

5. **Batna (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)**: Know your alternatives to the current deal. If you don't have a good alternative, you'll be more likely to accept a poor agreement. But if you do have a strong Batna, it gives you leverage and improves your position in negotiations.

6. **Negotiation Jiu-Jitsu**: Use the other party's pushes and demands to your advantage. Instead of resisting or meeting force with force, draw them in and find ways to satisfy their interests while also advancing your own. This approach can turn potential conflict into mutual gain.

7. **Assignment for Practice**: Engage in a conflict situation by first identifying what you want (your goal). Then, determine what position you would take to achieve that goal and explore the underlying interest behind that position. Similarly, identify the other party's interests. Use this information to work towards a resolution that addresses both parties' interests.

In the next lecture, we will delve into a more structured step-by-step process for conflict resolution, which will further enhance your negotiation skills and help you navigate conflicts more effectively.

Checking Conflict Management/11. Preparing and Arranging to Negotiate.txt
1. **Calm Down**: Before addressing the conflict, ensure you are calm and thinking clearly. If emotions are running high, take time to cool off and approach the situation with a clear mind.

2. **Define the Issue**: Once composed, define the issue in terms of voluntary behavior rather than attacking emotions or character. This helps keep the conversation constructive.

3. **Clarify Your Goals**: Identify what you want to achieve from this negotiation. Be clear about your objectives and what a successful resolution would look like for you.

4. **Make the Decision**: Commit to engaging in a negotiation process with the aim of reaching a mutually beneficial outcome, or decide that it's not worth pursuing if the benefits do not outweigh the potential costs.

5. **Approach the Other Party**: Initiate contact with the other party and set up a meeting to discuss the issue. This should be done respectfully and with the intent to find a solution that works for both parties involved.

Assignment: Reflect on three conflicts you've experienced in the past year, and consider how they were framed. Think about whether defining each conflict in terms of voluntary behavior could have led to different outcomes or more constructive resolutions. This exercise will help you understand the importance of defining issues clearly and constructively when entering into conflict resolution discussions.

In the next lecture, we will explore how to conduct the meeting effectively, with the goal of achieving a win-win resolution for all parties involved.

Checking Conflict Management/12. Negotiating Conflict Resolutions.txt
1. **Identify the Issue**: The first step is to clearly identify the issue at hand, ensuring it is framed as a problem of voluntary behavior that can be negotiated.

2. **Clarify Your Goals**: Determine what you want out of the negotiation. Understand your own interests and goals behind the positions you take.

3. **Decide to Negotiate**: Evaluate whether negotiating is the best course of action, considering the relationship with the other party and the nature of the issue.

4. **Approach the Other Party**: Initiate contact, arrange a meeting, and set a clear agenda focused on resolving the issue in a mutually beneficial way.

5. **Conduct the Meeting**: Take charge of the discussion, steering it towards understanding both parties' goals and interests, and strive for a win-win resolution.

6. **Achieve an Agreement**: Once a potential solution is found, draft a clear, unequivocal agreement that both parties can adhere to.

7. **Follow Through**: Implement the terms of the agreement, provide positive feedback when the other party does their part, and renegotiate if circumstances change or if the initial resolution isn't working out as expected.

**Assignment**: Practice these steps in a low-stakes conflict to build your negotiation skills. Begin with a minor issue where the outcome is not critical, and apply the seven-step process from start to finish.

In the next lecture, we will delve into the art of listening during conflicts, as it is essential for effective negotiation and understanding the other party's perspective.

Checking Conflict Management/13. Listening in Conflict.txt
1. **Challenges of Communication in Conflict**: We discussed how communication during conflict is one of the most challenging tasks for humans, and both speaker and listener face significant risks and efforts. It's crucial to approach this with respect and understanding for each other's roles and difficulties.

2. **Listener Responsibilities**: Listeners should assume equal responsibility with the speaker, check perceptions of meaning, attend to both verbal and nonverbal cues, and take into account Richard's four messages (Sense, Feeling, Tone, and Intention). They should respond and reciprocate to ensure mutual understanding.

3. **Speaker Responsibilities**: Speakers should express themselves using "I" statements to take ownership of their feelings or perceptions. They should aim to minimize potential pain or threat to the listener when delivering their message. This approach helps facilitate better listening on the part of the listener.

4. **Conflict Strategies**: We highlighted three fundamental strategies for dealing with conflict—fight, flight, and communicate. The last strategy, communication, is unique to humans and requires a conscious effort, time, attention, and resilience to navigate through conflict effectively.

5. **Learning to Listen**: Listening is a skill that can be learned and improved upon. By applying the suggestions from this lecture, individuals can experience immediate benefits in their communication during conflicts.

6. **Assignment**: Reflect on a recent argument and consider how the strategies discussed in this lecture could have been applied to improve understanding and resolution of the conflict.

7. **Next Steps**: The upcoming lectures (14 and 15) will explore conflict management within close relationships, followed by an examination of conflict in work relationships. Understanding the context and dynamics of these relationships is key to effectively managing conflicts in these settings.

Checking Conflict Management/14. Dynamic Patterns in Close Relationships.txt
1. **Conflict Management Strategies**: Apply all the conflict management strategies learned earlier to handle conflicts in close relationships.

2. **High Stakes**: The stakes are higher in close personal relationships due to the emotional intensity and interdependence of the parties involved.

3. **Unique Challenges**: Close relationships present specific challenges, such as dealing with patterns like the predictable stages of conflict or managing the impact of past interactions.

4. **Understanding Dynamics**: A better understanding of the dynamics within close relationships can help reduce threat levels and make it easier to navigate conflicts.

5. **Recognition of Patterns**: Recognizing destructive patterns (the four horsemen: complaining, criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stone-walling) is crucial, as they indicate a relationship in distress.

6. **Importance of Conflict Handling**: Effectively managing conflicts in close relationships is not only important for psychological well-being but also for physical health.

7. **Assignment**: Engage in a conversation with a partner about how conflicts are currently handled and discuss how they could be improved, focusing on making the relationship safer and more inviting for discussing conflicts constructively.

8. **Next Steps**: In the upcoming lecture (Lecture 15), we will explore specific recommendations for handling conflict better in close relationships and discuss critical communication contexts that can disrupt the nature of a relationship.

Checking Conflict Management/15. Disruptions in Close Relationships.txt
1. **Constructive Conflict Management**: Emphasize the importance of using constructive conflict management to maintain strong personal relationships, and vice versa.
   
2. **Collaborative Negotiation**: Highlight the need for collaborative negotiation when a conflict arises, aiming for win-win solutions through creative problem-solving and being willing to compromise or take turns balancing each other's needs.

3. **Regular Discussion Opportunities**: Encourage creating dependable opportunities to discuss conflicts, ensuring that both parties can rely on each other to be present during their busy lives.

4. **Addressing Critical Communication Contexts**: Suggest the importance of talking more, being honest but considerate, and potentially seeking professional help if needed. Emphasize celebrating the struggle of surviving issues together as a couple or family.

5. **Family/Couple Meetings**: Recommend setting up regular family or couple meetings (weekly for four weeks) to address concerns, listen without arguing, and work towards resolving conflicts as they arise. This structured approach can help in establishing a new normal and improving the relationship over time.

6. **Next Steps**: The assignment is to commit to holding a weekly family or couple meeting for four weeks, following the guidelines provided, and then assess whether it has been beneficial and decide if it should continue beyond the initial period.

7. **Transition to Work Relationships**: The focus will shift to addressing conflicts in work relationships and organizational settings in the upcoming lectures. This is where conflicts are most likely to occur and can have significant impacts on personal well-being and professional environments.

Checking Conflict Management/16. How Management Theories Affect Conflict.txt
1. **Costs of Organizational Conflict**: Unaddressed or poorly managed conflict within an organization can be very costly, both financially and in terms of employee well-being and productivity.

2. **Importance of Effective Conflict Management**: Reducing unnecessary conflict and improving the way employees handle it is a critical goal for managers and supervisors at all levels.

3. **Organizational Structure and Conflict**: The structure, policies, and management theories that govern an organization play a significant role in how conflicts are managed within it. Understanding these theoretical underpinnings is essential for managing conflict effectively.

4. **Limitations of Classical Management Theories**: While classical management theories still form the backbone of most organizational structures, they can sometimes inhibit effective conflict resolution by promoting rigid and hierarchical systems.

5. **Contributions of Human Relations and Systems Management Theories**: These theories offer strategies to mitigate the negative effects of a purely classical management approach. They emphasize the importance of communication and interpersonal dynamics in managing conflict across different levels within an organization.

6. **Role of Managers and Supervisors**: Competent managers and supervisors must understand and apply insights from these theories to manage conflicts optimally, which is part of their job responsibility.

7. **Assignment for Reflection**: Consider the management theories your organization or work unit relies on and reflect on how they shape organizational structure and conflict management practices. Recognize that these theories are not immutable and can be influenced by individual actions and decisions.

8. **Next Steps**: In the following lecture, we will explore concrete strategies and actions that managers and supervisors can take to improve conflict management within their organizations, thereby reducing its costs and enhancing its benefits.

Checking Conflict Management/17. The Manager's Role in Dealing with Conflict.txt
1. **Avoid Classical Management Inhibitors**: Managers should avoid outdated management practices that can stifle constructive conflict resolution.

2. **Managers' Role in Conflict Resolution**: It is crucial for managers to ensure that everyday conflicts are handled well by all employees, guiding and supporting them through the process.

3. **Clear Policies and Training**: Organizations should have clear policies concerning conflict management and provide necessary training to both managers and employees.

4. **Formal Procedures for Conflict**: There should be established formal procedures for handling disciplinary actions and addressing grievances within the organization.

5. **Prevent Unnecessary Conflict**: Managers should clarify roles and responsibilities to prevent conflicts from arising, and address those that do promptly.

6. **Model Conflict Behavior**: Supervisors must demonstrate the conflict behavior they expect from their employees.

7. **Supervisors' Pivotal Role**: Supervisors play a key role in guiding, teaching, helping, and arbitrating conflicts when necessary.

8. **Importance of Conflict Management**: Effective conflict management can lead to better morale, less absenteeism and turnover, increased employee motivation, improved productivity, and ultimately, a positive impact on the organization's bottom line.

9. **Human Environment**: Organizations are more than just places for work; they are human environments where people spend significant amounts of time. Therefore, managing conflicts well is essential for a better quality of life for everyone involved.

10. **Personal Reflection and Action**: Employees should reflect on how conflicts are handled within their organization, assess their own role, and consider what actions they can take to improve conflict management.

11. **Looking Ahead (Lecture 18 Preview)**: In the next lecture, we will explore where to seek professional help for managing conflicts in various relationships, including couples, families, organizations, and communities.

In essence, the key takeaway is that conflict management is a critical aspect of organizational health and personal well-being. It requires proactive measures from both managers and employees to ensure that conflicts are handled effectively and constructively.

Checking Conflict Management/18. Getting Professional Help with Conflict.txt
1. **Conflict Resolution Professionals**: There are four main types of professionals who help resolve conflicts:
   - **Arbitrators** are best when you need a binding decision made outside of court, often to resolve disputes.
   - **Mediators** are helpful when emotions are high and there's a risk of damaging relationships. They guide parties through a conversation to find their own resolution without a binding outcome.
   - **Ombudsmen** work within organizations to address concerns and complaints, often focusing on systemic issues rather than individual cases.
   - **Counselors** provide support for personal or relationship issues, helping individuals understand and manage emotions and communication patterns.

2. **Seeking Help**: It's important to seek the least formal help first, as it's generally less stressful and more accessible. The choice of professional should be made by both parties in a conflict, with agreement on who to work with.

3. **Knowing Resources Ahead of Time**: Before you find yourself in need of conflict resolution services, research what options are available in your community or organization. This can include counselors, mediators, arbitrators, and ombudsmen.

4. **Assignment**: Investigate the conflict resolution resources in your personal and professional circles. Have a list of go-to professionals for different types of conflicts, so you're prepared when needed.

5. **Next Steps**: In our next lecture, we will discuss how to effectively assist others in resolving their conflicts, understanding the potential risks such as triangulation, and ways to navigate these situations constructively.

In summary, conflict resolution professionals are valuable resources that can help address disputes and personal issues in a variety of settings. It's wise to know who to turn to for help before you find yourself in need of their expertise.

Checking Conflict Management/19. Helping Others Manage Conflict.txt
1. **Avoid Triangulation**: When helping resolve conflicts, avoid taking sides or triangulating, which can escalate the conflict and damage relationships.
   
2. **Clarify Your Role**: Be clear about your role—whether as a coach, mediator, or facilitator—and maintain that role throughout the process.

3. **Honor Trust**: Honor the trust placed in you by all parties involved when you intervene in a conflict.

4. **Avoid Pitfalls**: Watch out for common pitfalls such as aligning with one party, overestimating your skills, or losing focus on the process of resolution.

5. **Know Your Limits**: Don't take on tasks that are beyond your expertise, as this can do more harm than good.

6. **Reflect on Past Efforts**: After attempting to resolve a conflict, reflect on the outcome, assess whether it was a case of triangulation, and consider what you might do differently next time based on insights from this lecture.

7. **Next Steps**: The topic of intractable moral conflicts will be addressed in more depth in the upcoming lecture (Lecture 20), particularly those that cross cultural divides and center on issues of morality.

**Assignment**: Reflect on a recent attempt to help resolve a conflict, evaluate how well it worked, identify any instances of triangulation, and consider what you might do differently in the future. This reflection will provide valuable insights and prepare you for dealing with more complex conflicts, including moral conflicts, in the next lecture.

Checking Conflict Management/20. Moral and Cultural Conflicts.txt
1. **Complexity and Intractability**: Moral conflicts are inherently complex due to their perceived importance, deep-seated beliefs, and emotional stakes involved. They often evolve over time and can seem intractable.

2. **Challenges and Emotions**: These conflicts trigger strong emotions and moral outrage, which can lead to polarization and a hardening of positions, making resolution more difficult.

3. **Strategies for Resolution**: Despite the challenges, there are strategies that can help in resolving or at least mitigating moral conflicts. These include reframing issues using "I" statements rather than moral judgments, fractionation to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and empathy development to understand the perspectives of others involved.

4. **Building Trust and Patience**: Combining these strategies with patience and a focus on building trust can create an environment conducive to finding solutions or at least progress in dealing with moral conflicts.

5. **Personal Application**: These conflict resolution techniques are not only applicable to large-scale international conflicts but also to personal disputes where moral judgments might unnecessarily complicate the situation.

6. **Reflective Questions**: Three reflective questions are suggested for individuals to consider: When, if ever, is violence justified in addressing a moral conflict? When is it morally right or wrong to show tolerance for another's view on a serious moral issue? And could discussing moral issues more frequently with friends and colleagues improve our ability to handle these conflicts?

7. **Hopeful Outlook**: The lecture concludes with an assurance that, despite the difficulties, there are examples of successful resolution of moral conflicts, which will be explored in the next lecture.

In summary, while moral conflicts are among the most challenging types of disputes to resolve due to their deeply held values and emotional intensities, there are constructive methods and approaches that can lead to progress or at least more productive discussions. The upcoming lecture will provide real-world examples where these methods have been successfully applied, offering hope for constructive engagement with moral conflicts.

Checking Conflict Management/21. Managing Moral Conflicts—Success Stories.txt
1. **Principles of Effective Conflict Resolution:** The examples of Begin, Sadat, and Reagan demonstrate the power of strong convictions and principles in resolving complex moral conflicts. These leaders stood firmly on their beliefs yet were open to understanding and empathizing with others, leading to groundbreaking agreements.

2. **Empathy and Trust Building:** Empathy and trust are crucial in conflict resolution. The willingness to see things from the other's perspective and build a relationship based on mutual respect can pave the way for successful outcomes.
