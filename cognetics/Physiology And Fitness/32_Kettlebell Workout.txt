Welcome to your kettlebell workout. Now kettlebells are not a new innovation, in fact their origins
date back to military training in Russia in the early 18th century. The unique design with the
inverted U shaped handle allows for swinging movements and working with momentum which stimulates
a completely different neuromuscular response than your body experiences with other resistance
tools. Training with a kettlebell is founded on multi-joint movements through different planes so
this creates a truly functional routine. This workout is also a time efficient way to improve
your cardio respiratory fitness, your strength and your endurance and in addition you can expect
to improve your core strength, balance, posture and coordination. Now that's what I call value
added training. Now since kettlebells come in many different weights and there's such a wide
spectrum of exercises you can perform with them, a kettlebell is the perfect addition to anyone's
purpose arm weight as it can be used to increase your functional strength and so make it easier
to perform daily tasks such as getting up off the sofa and putting your shopping in the boot
of the car. Clearly just about everyone can benefit from adding some form of kettlebell exercise to
their routine. Now technique is vitally important here even more so than with other resistance
tools as you have to work hard to control the momentum. Now it's strongly recommended that you
start with a really lightweight and only a small range of movement and then you can increase both
as you become comfortable with such and remember it's important you remember from our lecture on
muscles it is vital to observe that progressive overload maximum if you want to avoid hitting
a plateau you do need to keep increasing the weight as you get a little stronger. Now as with
any workout you need to ensure you have a good warm-up first make sure you're thoroughly warmed
up before you begin as you can see the guys are doing now some shoulder rolls, some knee lifts but
particularly be aware of exercises that mobilise the lower spine because that's where we're going to
be focusing doing a lot of our work and because of that it's worth a mention that if you're carrying
a lower back injury this probably isn't the ideal workout for you. Now our target for all of the
exercises is 12 repetitions and obviously on each side where necessary so assuming you've had
your five-minute warm-up and if you've not press pause and do so now then we can begin. Let's take
our weights guys and remember that we're going to start with an exercise that uses your whole body
and the guys are going to start with a slightly heavy weight but they're maybe on some of the
trickier exercises or point where they'll need to change and so you might need to have a little
selection so you can choose the appropriate weight for each exercise. Now our first exercise the
alternate swing we're going to start nice and easy and by dropping the weight down the knees are
slightly bent the abdominals are in really tight. Now just let it take a little swing for a second
to get that feeling it's an odd movement you might want the other hand out for balance. Now what
we're doing here is pressing through the heels there's work through the hamstrings at the back
there's work through the glutes work through the thighs giving the abdominals in tight we're going
to let the weight swing up let it swing up to about shoulder level face level and then grab a hold
of it with the other hand it's not as tricky as it sounds so let's drop it down take a swing up
we'll swap it over to the other side and up it goes now let it swing naturally okay and away
we go now we're looking for we said 12 reps but obviously you're swapping sides here so I'm looking
for 24 reps and I'm going to trust you to count those 24 reps. Now the work here is keep going for me
whole body this is the great thing about it why it's such a time efficient workout
you can see that we're working through this bend in the knee is bringing about some contraction
in the thighs here front and back quadriceps and hamstrings we're working through the glutes
we work the whole of what's called the posterior chain to control that momentum as we said we
don't get that with other resistance tools we've really got to work through the muscles in the glutes
in the lower back we're also working into the rotator cuff to stop it pulling us forwards
and those rotator cuff muscles are around the shoulder blades yeah controlling that momentum
we're also working into the shoulder on the lift so really getting total body we keep the
abdominals in tight and trying at all times to keep just a little gentle curve in the lower spine
how we doing is that 24 yet you must be getting close
I would love to do them with you obviously I'll join you for the last couple
fabulous and you may start to feel as you're doing this your heart rate increasing a little bit
is that I'm really not counting please tell me we've got to 12 on each side by now
and gently take a rest and I advise you to put them down in between sets give yourself a little
rotation through the spine or a little side to side a few shoulder circles give yourself
that little posture break in between exercises we're going to move on now for the single leg
deadlift and this is great for really getting into the glutes hamstrings um on this exercise so
this is what we're going to do and be careful how you pick up your weights make sure you bend your
knees first pick it up we're taking it in both hands you're going to take your feet together
the important thing on this exercise keep your hips chest shoulders square to the front facing me
because what we're going to do is hinge from the hip so stay long in that position you're in
now your shoulders back and down you're going to let the leg lift behind let's take your left leg
first behind and let yourself drop the weight down but don't let it pull your shoulders down
just until we feel as far as it's comfortable getting that little stretch um through the hamstring
and then start to contract and pull that back up we'll stay on the same leg for 12 repetitions
before we change to the other leg so let's go nice and slowly abdominals are in tight
shoulders are back away you go guys i want 12 repetitions please nice and smooth good now make
sure you're keeping your hips chest shoulders square to the ground don't be letting that hip
rotate up let's go keep it going at your own pace nice and comfortable if you lose your balance
you can always reset yourself now we're looking for that front leg to be straight
yeah your right leg is straight but not locked out at the knee yeah but it's straight what we're
doing here is working through your dynamic range of motion through those hamstrings as well fabulous
keep it going abdominals are tight there's a nice long line through your spine from the top of the
head to your tailbone down to your heel there's that nice long line through the body maybe a slight
bend but only a very slight bend on that knee if you need to for balance yeah working to your full
comfortable range of motion and clearly you can see how this is a functional exercise picking stuff
up off the floor every day something that we do excellent and this is really challenging you to
keep your abdominals pulled in tight otherwise what happens as you start to hinge down the belly
pulls yeah so you've got a really pulling tight through your tummy button in tight make sure
you're still breathing is that 12 repetitions at night if it is we'll swap over to the other leg
okay so 12 on each side it needs to be balanced now be aware you may feel slightly different
from one side to the other if you've had any history of injury or if you particularly did one sport that
was one side dominant you might find that one side the balance isn't as good the strength isn't as good
the flexibility isn't as good so that's important when you're doing your workout as we swap from
side to side to make sure that we balance those things out so concentrate on what you're doing
slow is better yeah there may be a slight bend on that front knee just for your balance but ideally
we keep it almost straight we're making sure that this hip stays twisted down towards the ground
abdominals are in tight and you're hinging from the hip you're not rounding the spine so make sure
we know that difference between this and this yeah make sure we're hinging from the hip yeah it's
all about there that's what the guys are doing so you let your top of your head drop towards
the screen while you're doing this exercise fabulous you should be really feeling this
in that standing leg particularly in the hamstring in the back of the thigh
then also into the glutes at the back okay fabulous exercise okay we're going to change
things around slightly now so I'm going to ask you now to pick up the kettlebell took the thumbs
through the holes so you've got a hold of it now slightly different exercise okay take the feet
about hip width apart now they're going to stay hip width apart when you take one leg back really
going to get into the legs and into the waist here what I'm going to ask you through is step your
left leg back put it on the ball of the foot drop the knee down to the ground and at the same time
rotate the kettlebell to that side we're going to stay on the same leg for your 12 repetitions before
we swap over okay are we set step your left leg back drop rotate and up down twist beautiful
it's all one movement let's go abdominals in tight head lifted all the time fabulous down
and twist beautiful so you see how we're really getting some work now into the legs working into
the quadriceps at the front of the thigh hamstrings at the back into the glutes working those big
muscle groups and the great thing about that the more muscle groups you include the greater the
calorie burn will be at the same time you can see there's some work going on here in Frank's arms
and shoulders holding that kettlebell in position but also look at that rotation and that's being
brought about by those oblique muscles working through the waist also what we need to be aware
of is keeping good posture so the abdominals are pulled in all the time so we're really working
through those deeper core muscles which again can only help to protect the lower back
if they're a little bit stronger we're looking for 12 repetitions before we change legs
looks like we're done other leg let's go looking good guys remember I might not be doing it but
I feel your pain looking good step back and twist good now be careful of balance on this we need
to make sure that when you step back you're keeping your feet about that hip width apart beautiful
see how we're getting some work into the waist there fabulous with that twist on the kettlebell
fabulous nice and low into that lunge low is better get your money's worth I feel guilty I really
should join you for a couple of repetitions and again because we're working such large muscle
groups what you'll find is your heart rate may start to go up because what you've got to do is
make sure the heart's pumping enough blood around to get to all those muscles yeah so you may feel
that you're getting a cardio effect from this even though we might be going quite slowly yeah
done we'll take a quick rest in between each give your shoulders a little rest don't forget to have
that little rotation through the spine you're doing a lot of work through those core muscles
muscles in the lower back particularly so let's make sure you get that little posture break in
between each one okay we're moving on now to a one-handed plie lift now we start to drift into
we've talked about before plyometric exercises we're going to drift into plyometric slightly here
so for the plie we're going to take the feet nice and wide the knees and the toes are pointing out
yeah that kind of position one hand out let's take a hold of it left hand to start with abdominals
are in tight and again be careful to make sure you're hinging from the hip not bending from the back
yeah nice long spine okay now there's a little bit of a trick on this one because what we're
going to do here is as we lift it up yeah we're going to turn onto the back like so okay so there's
a little rotation now it'll work a lot easier than that looks so it rests on the back of the wrist
that's the movement we're looking for okay what we're also going to do from there is then press
up to the top without locking out the arm but can we do all of that in one movement and add a jump
he says so just to show you what it looked like we'll pick it up
and press then just open the legs back out nice and wide and away we go again up and press
good now this one he's going to put a lot of stress through the core muscles they've really
got to work so this is where you might want to drop down to a slightly lower weight or at least
start and then you might need to switch press keep it going keep it going 12 repetitions please
beautiful and away we go so now hopefully as i'm panting already you'll start to notice you get
a bit of a cardio effect now because we're working big muscle groups and this is something we talked
about at the top we're working your whole body that's the great thing about this why it's so
time efficient you're working so many muscles in one go but what you're also doing then is creating
a much greater calorie burn at the same time so just half an hour this is all you need now we
done is that 12 repetitions i hope you count take a quick rest and then swap it over to the other side
nice and wide with the plie feet wide knees and toes pointing out let's go drop it down
pick it up and it's all one movement a plyometric uh is an explosive exercise yeah so make sure we
get a little bit of a jump here and push yeah so you've got to work quite nisterly on that hand
to make sure you roll it around and then press it up beautiful and as you can see we're going into
here a little bit of work for the shoulder on that shoulder press beautiful some real work on the
abdominals pulling in tight at all times we've got to protect the lower spine what we're doing here
is basically challenging this movement you wouldn't get this kind of stress in your normal day to
day activities but that's the point if we can train our bodies particularly the muscles in the core
to protect the lower back in a movement like this then when it comes to your day to day activities
put them down have a quick rest guys well done then you'll find that it's a little bit easier to
do those exercises okay so we're going to head for the floor now and a little prone row exercise
again the challenge here is your core strength protecting your lower back you'll remember that
from the earlier lecture in this series what we need to do is get ourselves in a position
where we've got neutral spine and neutral spine talked about before it's a little phrase that is a
comfortable spine your natural alignment so i'm going to show you what i mean by that so we're
going to go down guys for the prone row so you're going to be essentially in a press up position
yeah it's where you're going to be and let's put the kettlebell under your left hand so to make things
slightly easier you can have the feet hip width apart yeah if you're feeling strong you can have
them together if not slightly apart and if you're new to this exercise i'd have your knees down on
the floor but if you are going to do that i want them slightly further back so you're not in an
all fours position but the feet are further back there so you can still rest on the knees now the
important point about this is your abdominals are in tight and you've got to find your neutral spine
position so we don't want to be too drop down we don't want the backside in the air so if you just
have a little move around there you'll find the position that's about right and that works if
you're on your knees as well you've got to find that position that feels about right for your lower
spine where's comfortable and then lock it on by keeping your abdominals in tight okay so the
challenge of this exercise can we keep everything else still and then just lift it up to the shoulder
and back down don't twist stay locked in the center lift it up back down can we get 12 of those please
let's go fabulous so see how the challenge here is what's trying to happen is gravity is trying
to pull your hips down yeah so this is not just a case of the row although the row is clearly working
into the biceps working into the rear shoulder working into the upper back actually that's only
half the challenge it's really what's going on in the middle the glutes are working the hamstrings
are working pulling in the abdominals this transversus muscle that runs across the center there
the obliques are pulling in everything's pulling in to try and keep the center locked still yeah
now if you do start to lose that position I'd advise you to put your knees down take a quick
rest if you've done one set you're making this look way too easy and onto the other side
into the full breast up position or on the knees whichever find your neutral spine first find your
comfortable spine position and away we go lift up fabulous excellent so we're keeping that natural
little curve in the lower spine the lumbar curve there yeah making sure the back side's not sticking
up in the air make sure you keep your breathing constant keep your chest hips shoulders square
to the floor abdominals are in tight and again you should be able to feel this all over the body
yeah real value added training you should feel the whole body working on each of these exercises
yeah don't let the body twist how we doing is that's well done three and take a quick rest there
okay give yourself a little stretch little mobilization we can have a little lift of the arms
whatever you feel comfortable with just have that little posture break and particularly do something
through the lower spine okay we've only got two exercises to go but i've got to say this next one
is fairly tough yeah a fairly tough exercise so the turkey stand up you might already go for the
lighter weight on this one so the turkey stand up is just that all you're going to do is stand up
and then get back down now because this is a tough exercise i said 12 of everything actually this is
just 12 total i just want you to do six on either side so the challenge is don't do anything yet
just get guys just take a quick rest you've earned your rest what i'm going to ask you to do is lie
down and hold the dumbbell uh kettlebell directly above the center of your chest the challenge is
can i keep it up up there while i stand up without using the other hand it says and then can i get
back down again again ideally without using this hand but don't let it go anywhere other than there
now if you get to this point and get stuck then use that free hand to help you up now to make this
work your whole body is working but particularly this is where you really need to work hard for
your core muscles when you remember when we talked in the lecture about the lower spine and we looked
at the core muscles one thing we said was that's this is absolutely vital to transfer strength from
the lower to the upper body to integrate your strength you've got to be strong in the center
and this really puts that to the test okay so we're going to do six on the left hand and then six on
the right hand so down we go
fabulous and yeah legs are straight whenever you're ready pull one leg back and up we go
up up up if you need to use the hand that's good and then back down again beautiful if you need to
use the hand that's okay you don't need to do that and up abdominals are in tight
and trust me this is one if you're doing this with us at home which you should be
you won't need me to tell you this is working your whole body up you get
good fabulous great work fabulous exercise and again because we're using lots of muscles
you'll start to get a bit more of a cardio effect because the heart's got to work a little harder
to get the blood around but again also we're starting to use more calories
so don't be falling to thinking that the only way to burn calories is to do cardio
so this kind of resistance work will really work if you're are we done six take a quick
rest and then swap over to the other hand
fabulous and be aware like we said earlier that you might have differences from one side to the
other this time make sure you swap to the other leg so you should be pulling the other leg back
first this time let's go use the hand if you need to of course you don't need to and down we go
great work abdominals in tight making sure we're keeping that dumbbell lifted lifted lifted all the
time good abs in tight under control don't let gravity throw you back down to the floor that's
what we're working against up up up keep it up slowly on the way down be under control
fabulous how you doing at home I hope you're still with us
I mean it's not that tough all you've got to do is stand up surely and back down
how many more we've got is there two more and up good lifted up lifted up lifted up lifted up
fabulous just one more abdominals in tight you might need that other hand out for balance
is this it last one up up up okay so that's a pretty tough exercise to have you stand up
so just take a couple of moments here maybe a little longer than the other breaks you've had
to have that little posture break to work through your lower spine a good little exercise you can
do there is to rest on hands on the the knees and to pull the lower back up to the ceiling and down
just hunch up and then let it release down don't press down too low but it's just a great exercise
to release through the lower back it's important to have those little stretches in between each exercise
particularly something as tough as that to stand up so we've got one more exercise before we get
down so this exercise is the single shoulder press but slightly different than you might have
done a shoulder press normally um because what we're going to do here is actually we'll sort of
cheat a little bit but what that will do is allow us to lift a little bit more weight into use the
whole body so careful how you pick up your kettlebell bend the knees please and we're going to turn
this around now remember resting it on the back of the wrist yeah okay so the beauty of this exercise
you might need the other hand out for balance is we're going to use the legs with a slight squat
and then press now we're making sure that the elbow is slightly bent we don't lock out and the
abdominals are in tight back down it comes end up we go I'm after 12 repetitions please
so this hand you can have on the hip or out for balance and we're looking for those 12 repetitions
really working into the shoulder keep going please keep counting abdominals are in tight now as you
take that very small it's only a small squat there yeah and we're really getting into the shoulders
so just keeping the head tall chin in abdominals tight beautiful and again working through your
whole body see how we're linking and remember we talked about your core strength helps you to
transfer that weight and look at it here we're working through the legs through that core and
then through the upper body as well really working into that shoulder but also what's great swapping
it over fabulous have you ready you weren't taking a rest but then also what you'll find is because
of this elbow extension we're really working into the triceps as well often a problem area so that's
great to get into the triceps as well as the shoulder but don't be fooled it looks like the
work's going on here in the shoulder or maybe you can see a little bit of work going on here
but as with all of these exercises kettlebell exercises you're really working in the middle
in the core and remember our definition of core strength is having the strength here
to be able to maximize the strength out here yeah that's what it's about having a strong core
will enable you to perform better through your legs and through your arms fabulous
and we'll lose that one so we're going to move on now down to the floor to really get into our
very last exercise getting into the abdominals particularly into the waist let's work on the
hourglass figure so you need to get yourself sitting down really getting into the abs now
particularly into the waist Russian twist really going to work on those core muscles again
which can only help to strengthen the lower back so you're going to take your feet about hip width
apart nice and easy pick it up it's just in front of the chest all i'm going to ask you to do on
this one is to rotate side to side drop it down and across to the other side so if we're looking
for 12 it'll be 12 each side so that's 24 all together please or whatever 12 each side just make
sure we get those repetitions and keep going please make sure your abdominals are in tight make sure
you've got a nice long line from the top of your head down to your tailbone you're sitting tall
and then hinging backwards but not rounding remember that difference this hip hinge there
so that we keep the abdominals in tight and keep the natural curve in the lower spine
and what's bringing this about is that work through the obliques the muscles at the waist
that are really beginning to twist you from side to side yeah fabulous try not to hold your breath
but again there's a real challenge here on keeping the transversus across the middle
pulled in really tight abdominals are pulled in really tight well done well done if you want to
lose that kettlebell to the side and what we're going to do now is slip into a little bit of a
cool down so I would advise you to particularly look at the lower back so some simple exercises
so should we just drop ourselves down onto the back and pull your knees into your chest for me
so a great exercise is just to pull the knees into the chest to start with
and you can maybe rock forwards and backwards slightly on the mat get a little massage for
the lower spine and then also what I do from there is then take the legs down to one side
and take your arms across to the other beautiful and hold that position so your stretches you're
going to hold there um for about 30 seconds 15 to 30 seconds and then we'll swap it over to the
other side also a little child's pose that you'll know from yoga so a few little stretches for
your lower back then also don't forget the stretches you've done a lot of work for your quads
for your hamstrings for your glutes so those lower body stretches remember they're all on the
flexibility dvd as well so there's your kettlebell workout well done
