Hi, and welcome to your Dumbbell workout. Now another home workout, the Dumbbell workout
is great because you don't have to have dumbbells. You may have some sitting around in your garage
gathering dust or they're relatively cheap to get a hold of anyway, but if you don't
have them, this workout you can improvise with, a couple of tins of beans, a couple of bags of
sugar, something like that. Now as we've already seen in other lectures in this series, weight
training brings a number of health benefits including reduced risk of osteoporosis, lower blood
pressure and shorter gastrointestinal transit time. But when it comes to changing your shape,
it really is the number one choice due to its effect on raising your metabolic rate,
so helping you to burn more energy quickly and also it can seriously re-sculpt your silhouette.
Now you wouldn't want to drop some fat from here and maybe firm up a little more there.
Now it's important at this juncture to remember that muscle training comes with a few common myths,
probably the most important one being that women will bulk up, become big and bulky if they do
weight training. Now we've looked at this before, the key to muscle growth is to test
osteoen hormone and women simply don't naturally possess this in their bodies in high enough
concentration to produce on his arms or sliced shoulders. However to ensure you get the best
from this workout, we're going to work on a principle called time under tension theory,
the tut theory. Now this states the longer a muscle is forced to work against resistance,
the more damage will be caused to the muscle fibers and therefore the greater will be the
adaptations in their structure, so to put it plainly the harder you work the better the results
you'll achieve, but if you followed the other lectures in this series you'll already know that.
Now what we're going to use here is a continuous rhythm pattern, so this following
pattern of counts has been devised to enable that we exhaust all the muscle fibers and so it's
important to follow this count. Now I'm going to explain this to you very briefly but you'll get
the hang of it as we go along. We're going to do eight singles, we're going to do four twos,
we're going to do four threes and then two sevens, if you kind of remember that you'll get the hang
of it as we go along. Now to help you with the rhythm you'll need your mp3 player or some tracks
playing some music playing that's ideally in the mid-range of beats per minute. If the music's too
fast and the singles, the eight singles we do will be impossible to complete ending up with short
movements and if the music's too slow when you come to the sevens they'll take an eternity probably
leaving you in tears. Now beginners should be aiming for maybe one to two sets, advance people to
progress this, you can do these exercises three sets of each exercise. Now what we're going to do
are just three sets for you today that are going to cover your whole body and the beauty of this
is we're going to work upper and lower body alternating. The beauty of that is that we start
to shift the blood from one part of the body to the other that will lead to a greater calorie
burn but also while one part of the body is resting we can work another part of the body and in that
case we won't need the rest in between so we can get more work done in a shorter time. So
sounds good the high-speed train so let's get some music and get started. Remember you need about a
five-minute warm-up like the guys have hopefully done behind me right now and we're going to start
with a set of legs and back so the music starts now. Be careful how you pick up your weights,

of extra work for the hips and thighs, why not, okay so let's grab those dumbbells please guys,

and we're also going to tilt the little finger slightly higher, get ready, in four and three,
abs are tight, let's lift, up and two, how we do it, working into those shoulders, the legs are

rest the dumbbells on top of your thighs, make sure the knees and toes are pointing out, your
shoulders can have a little bit of a rest while we work back into the legs, now remember when we

anyone there when I just yelled, and up, down, two, down for one, up for seven, let's go,
down, slowly, one, don't get up there too soon, up, no prizes to come in first,
one more time, down we go, down, up one, two, three, four, five, how you doing at home, beautiful,
walk them in, slightly bent knees, and the reason we bend the knees slightly is what that does is
protects us from swaying backwards and forwards, which puts a lot of strain on the lower back, so
the knees are always slightly bent, bring the dumbbells up, palms facing you, knuckles facing me,
now all we're going to do on this press is to get a little twist, as we press up, we twist the palms
to the front, get ready, four, three, two, shoulder press, up, two, how we doing, three, don't lock
the arms out at the top, keep going, four more, four, three, good, looking to not quite lock the
elbows at the top, two counts please, up, two, and down, beautiful, control momentum, up, two,
see how the elbows stay slightly soft at the end, up, and two, and down, and again, up, two, down,
up for three, one, two, three, and down, up, two, three, come on we can do this, up, two, three,
one more of those, up, you know what comes next, seven, seven, seven, up, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, one more, one more go, up, two, three, come on, four, five, six, seven, and take it down,
put the dumbbells down, care for how you do it, use the knees, get yourself a sip of water,
towel yourself down, get ready for your last set, so that was your shoulders and legs,
we've done back and legs, what should we work on next, what about chest and abdominals,
problem region for a lot of us, so we're going to get down onto the mat, onto an all fours position
please, so what we're going to do here is use the dumbbells as a rest for our press-up position,
so the hands are going to be on the dumbbells, yeah okay, so we're going to be on the knees
or in the full press-up position, whichever you feel confident with, I would warn you full
press-up position this does get tough, either way whether you're in the full position or on the knees,
abdominals are in tight, the elbows are going out to the side,
press and don't lock the arms when we get to the top, are we ready, set up your position,
maybe a full position, don't know why I'm looking at you, or maybe on the knees,
definitely looking at you, in five, six, seven, go down and press, two and three, how we doing,

three, four, five, how we doing at home, seven, beautiful, you can take a little rest there,
you're going to flip yourself over, feet this end, head there, so we're going to work into the
abdominals now, a little bit of work, simple crunch, all we're going to do is a simple crunch,
but we're still going to use that timing, that count, so for this exercise I want to make sure
you've got your hands back, elbows back, the hands are there to support the weight of the head,
to take the stress off the neck, so lay yourselves back down please,
fabulous, hands behind your head, feet are about hit width apart, now all we're looking for is
a squeeze in the abdominals to lift the shoulders off the mat, that's all we're going to do, get
ready, using the same count we've been using, focus on your muscles in the tummy, in five, six,
seven, sit, up, and down, two, and down, up we go, up, and down, up, four more, four, concentrate
on squeezing the ribs closer to the hips, up, two counts now please, up, up, and down, down, come on,
up, up, and down, looking good, let's go, up, up, and down, keep your elbows back, up, up, and down,
two more, up, up, and down, one more, up, okay, three counts, three counts up, we go, up, two,
three, and down, up, two, three, and down, up, two, three, and down, last one, up, two, now you

up, two, keep those elbows back, four, five, six, seven, and down, beautiful, turn yourselves over,
we've only got two more things to do, that's one more set of the press-ups, we're going to do the
slow count in the other direction, one more set of sit-ups and we're done, looking good guys,
looking good, this is not fake sweat, you know that, set yourself up for the press-up position,
remember the tips, abdominals are in tight, nice little comfortable curve in the lower spine,
remember not to lock the arms out at the top, are we ready, in four and three and two press-ups,
let's go, down, and press, and two, good, good form, down, keep your abdominals in tight,
one more, two counts please, down, down, up, and up, down, down, up, and again we go, down, down,
and up, up, down, down, down for one, up for three, down, up one, two, I saw that, down, up one, two,
two, three, down, up one, two, three, down, up one, two, now it gets tough, down, up one,
two, three, four, five, six, come on one more of those, down, up one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, beautiful, turn yourselves over, it's time for your sit-ups, last set, this is the last exercise
you're going to do, we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time your slow counts will be
on the way down rather than on the way up, just like we did with the press-ups, hands behind the head,
beautiful, feet are about hit with the parts, make sure you've got that comfortable position,
neutral spine, that comfortable lower spine position for four, for three, for two, let's go, we sit
up and down, two and down, beautiful, focus on pulling the ribs to the hips, really focus on a
spring in the abdominals, squeeze it together and down, two counts slowly, up, up, down, down,
up, up and down and down, up and up and down and down, last time, up and up and down, now hold
it there, we're going up for one and down for three, okay, get ready, get right up, up, down one, two,
three, up, good, one, two, three, sit up, down one, down two, down three, sit up, one, two, up for
one down for seven, up, down one, two, three, four, five, six, one more, you can do it, up, down one,
two, don't die me yet, four, five, six, beautiful, hold it there, pull your knees into your chest
and have a little rest, you'll be pleased to know you're done, chest and abs, chest and abs, chest
and abs, great little exercise there, they're pressed up, not just the chest, you're also
getting into those trouble areas into the triceps, so you've got a total body work out there, what
we're going to do now is possibly fall asleep, we're going to have a little stretch and remember
it's a good idea, if you can't remember any stretches to look at that flexibility dvd,
you've got the whole work out there with a range of stretches, you need to be holding your stretches
at this point when you're nice and warm for about 15 to 30 seconds, that'd be ideal and that'll help
you gradually cool down, I hope you enjoyed the workout, well done.
