Hi, and today, next in your homework series, the workout is going to be with a training
bar.
Now, this is a great tool.
It comes in different weights.
It's easy to get a hold of from different sports retailers.
We're using 12s.
We've also got an 8.
It's not easy to improvise with this because you do need a little bit of weight on the
bar.
Ideally, begin as you're working around three to six pounds, intermediate, somewhere
in nine to 18.
In advance, you'll be working 24, even up to 36.
Got to remember before this workout, as with any workout, you need to get a good warm-up
like the guys are doing now, a little bit of mobilizing, and maybe even practicing some
of the moves you're going to go through, the little squats, the bicep curls, those sort
of moves.
For the targets for this workout, we're looking at one set of 15 repetitions of each exercise.
If you're already a little fitter doing exercise already, possibly two sets, and those of you
are more advanced, you want to be looking at three sets of each exercise.
So a little tip here.
What we're going to be doing, and this kind of flips back to our lecture on the spine
when we talked about core strength, and we've touched on this a few times.
The idea of our core strength is it helps us to integrate the strength in the upper
and lower body.
So what we're doing here is we're going to set ourselves up with an upper body exercise,
a lower body exercise, and then we're going to combine the two together, and we're going
to repeat that on several sets.
So hopefully you've got your bar and you're ready to go.
Take a hold, and we're going to start, careful how you pick it up, well done guys.
We're going to start with a simple squat.
Now you could hold it in front if you wish, or you might want to take it over the top,
careful how you do it, rest it across the top of the back, and hands lightly, never
squeeze on it.
Feet are about to hit with the part for the squat, and all I'm going to ask you to do
is press down into the heels, keep the tummy in tight, and then straighten back up.
So shall we go?
Down we go, and press, away you go please.
I'm looking for 15 repetitions, and I'm going to trust you to count them.
So keep going please, but keep your eyes on me while you're doing that.
What I want you to do is sit down, press the heels back, keep the abdominals in tight.
Resist the temptation to let your belly drop forwards, don't let the shoulders drop forwards.
Fabulous, 15 repetitions please.
Now what we're doing here is really getting into the quadriceps, the front of the thighs.
We're getting into the hamstrings at the back of the thighs, and we're getting into the glutes.
Absolutely fantastic exercise for the whole of the lower body.
15 repetitions please, well done guys.
We're going to change that slightly now, bring the bar over to the front, keeping the abs
in tight, keeping the knees slightly bent for your balance, take the strain off the
lower back, I'm looking for a shoulder press.
We're going straight up, but slightly forwards.
The reason for that is if you push directly upwards, that's a really uncomfortable position
through the shoulder complex.
So actually the ideal position will be to use your peripheral vision.
You'll push upwards, keep looking forwards at me, but you should still be able to see
the bar slightly.
Let's go for our 15 repetitions please.
Press up and back down.
Now ideally, I don't want you to be holding your breath, the tip is to exhale on the exertion.
So breathe out as you press, beautiful.
Away we go.
15 repetitions, no cheating.
And the thing to look out for here, abs are in tight to protect your lower back.
The knees are slightly bent, there's a little bit of tension through the legs and what that
will do is stop you swaying backwards and forwards, again which stresses the back.
And also worth looking out for, we're not locking out the elbow.
Yes, we're going straight, but don't lock it out, control that momentum.
Yeah, 15 repetitions.
There's 15, not 150, fabulous, well done.
What we're going to do now is put those two together.
Now this is harder than it looks because what we really need to do now is lock on in the
middle, pulling through the tummy, pull in through the waist.
Let's get set to go, we're starting at chest level.
So you're going to squat down and press up at the same time, let's go.
Squat and press and down.
Squat and press and now you should begin to feel, keep going, you should begin to feel
a lot more work is required here in pulling the abdominals in when you go down, there'll
be a tendency for your belly to want to drop forwards, that's not going to happen.
Keep it in tight so that we maintain neutral spine.
Talked about that before, that's a comfortable curve in your lower spine.
How we doing?
Fabulous.
15 reps, making sure we're breathing, good, fucking deadly serious, fabulous.
Working through the legs, working through the shoulders, so we're working upper and lower
body and the great thing about combining our exercises is that we're using more muscle
groups, more muscle groups we're using, it's more demanding in terms of energy.
So what that means is we're burning more calories.
Okay, we're going to skip on to our next exercise.
Again, we're going to take the bar over the top, rest it on the top, there you go and
we're going for a rear lunge.
Now careful with this, your feet are hip width apart, when you step back with your right
foot, remember I'm mirroring you, when you step back with your right foot, place it on
the ball of the foot, drop the knee straight down to the floor and then we come back up,
make sure there's no twisting of that rear knee.
Also, don't let your body drop forwards, keep your abs in tight as you step back.
Okay, are we ready?
I'll take 15 repetitions on your right leg, let's go, drop it back, knee down to the
floor and up, down, beautiful, how you doing?
Hope you're still with me, good, keep going, remember if you haven't got your training
bar yet, you could be using just a broom handle to get used to the exercises until you've
got one, excellent stuff.
And the best bit about this is working through a greater range of motion actually requires
more muscular effort, so stepping a long way back like we're doing here, a fabulous example,
long step back, great range of movement, little bit more demanding through the legs, that's
what we're after, great stuff, abs are in tight all the time, 15 reps, perfect and guess
what?
Let's swap over to the other leg.
Now be aware if there's any difference from one side to the other, if one side's a little
weaker it maybe needs a bit of extra work, start with your feet hip width, abs are in
tight, you're nice and tall, chest lifted and away we go, drop down the left leg, your
left leg, knee down to the floor, good, down you go, excellent work, keep it going, make
sure you're stepping onto the ball of the foot and that knee drops straight down at
the back, yeah?
Now what you're also doing here is getting some work, front of the thigh, back of the
thigh, gluteals, yeah, great exercise, but because of that we're using lots of what
are called large muscle groups, yeah?
Compare those to the muscles in your wrists, yeah, they're large muscle groups so they
take a lot of energy, that's what we're after, we want that calorie burn so we're getting
some toning and we're burning up some calories at the same time, fabulous stuff.
Well done guys, how you doing at home?
So we're going to get a little bit innovative with this now and we're going to do a little
rowing exercise, so I really want you to be stable on this so I want your feet hip width
apart and your knees slightly bent, now if you find that you still start to rock about
through the lower spine, what I'm going to ask you to do is a split lunge, one foot in
front of the other because that's even more stable, so all we're doing here, anyone who
can remember Hawaii Five-O, I've just shown my age there haven't I, we're going to do
a little bit of rowing, so a little bit wider than chest width, all we're going to do is
take it down to this side and then take it down to that side, good.
Now if we go there and there, that's one, there and there is two, keep it going please.
So what we're doing here is you're challenging your core strength, because of this rotation
it's actually trying to throw your lower spine all over the place, so what we've got to do
is pulling tight through that transversus abdominis across the middle, pulling tight
through those internal obliques, the smaller oblique muscle and what that will do is then
pull this thoracolumbar fascia at the back that then splints the lower spine and keeps
you stable, remember we talked about what core strength means to us, it's having strength
in the middle that allows us to generate that strength and power through the limbs.
So what we're doing, I've completely lost count, I'm trusting you all to do 15, beautiful.
Okay so let's put those two together now then, what we're going to do is our rear lunge
and our row at the same time, now the row is going to go in opposition so that you get
some rotation which again works those core muscles a little bit harder, so what we're
going to do as you take your right leg back, you're going to row down to the left, down,
up, down, beautiful, row down, get a little rotation through the body now, fabulous, you
should really start to feel, keep it going, a little bit of work here on the hip flexors
on your right side as you're getting that rotation there, yeah, don't sacrifice the
technique on the lunge, keep that good technique on the lunge, nice and deep, make those legs
do some work, fabulous stuff and getting that body rotating, so we're working through clearly
your arms and shoulders are doing some work moving the bar here, but really what's going
on is that rotation in the middle is coming from your core strength, we're using those
obliques to get that little turn and to maintain that position you're keeping your abdominals
pulled in really tight, good work guys, should we swap to the other side, so you're lunging
back with your left leg and rowing down to the right side, so as the leg goes back we
row down and row and row, beautiful, keep your head up, keep your chest lifted, keep
breathing, sorry they told me not to yell, I shouldn't have done that, and down, good,
how we doing, keep it going, fabulous, great example, keeping your head up, yeah, remember
we're talking about our core strength, we're talking about keeping that spine fixed, yeah,
so we've got a nice central column and all the work, the arms and legs, all that movement
is going on around the outside, yeah, we've got this constant dance between mobility,
the arms and legs and stability in the center, yeah, keeping it strong, that's really what
we mean by core strength, you look like you thought I might do another one then but I
won't bother, that's okay, okay what we're going to do now is move on, next exercise,
now if at any time between the exercises you want to stop and get yourself a quick sip
of water, that's okay but get back to me very quickly, okay let's move on to the plie, now
just a tip, if you find this position uncomfortable behind, yeah, for these leg exercises you
can keep it down here as well, but it's just sometimes a little easier to get it out of
the way there, but the plie I want the feet wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, however wide
you just put them go a little bit wider, point the knees and toes out slightly, yeah, pointing
out at this angle because when you plie the knees follow the line of the toes, what that
will do is as well as working into the front and the back of the thigh we now start getting
into the add up to muscles in the inner thigh, okay so plie we're looking for 15 repetitions,
be careful abdominals are in tight as we go down and down, beautiful, knees following
the line of the toes and be careful not to stick your backside out, that's not what we're
doing, you're staying a little more upright than the normal squat here and let the legs
do the work and again that range of motion, the wider we go, more muscular energy being
involved, greater the toning effect, so look out for these knees, slow as better on these
exercises to make sure that they follow the line of the toes and resist that temptation
for your knees to drop in towards the center, yeah, okay bring the feet back in slightly
and we're moving on to the bicep curl, fix your elbows by your side, make sure they're
fixed in, we lift up and then slowly down, nothing else moves, yeah, really getting
into just that bicep, into the bicep, okay, so feel about hip width apart and again we
want to avoid that swinging movement so keep the knees just slightly bent, just bending
the knees slightly we'll start to engage these muscles which will lock on your lower body
and keep you fixed, okay are we ready, 15 repetitions, up we go and back down, remember
our tip on the breathing, exhale on the way up, inhale on the way down, failing that just
keep inhaling and exhaling, whatever you do don't hold your breath, good, now a little
tip here while we're doing this is to put your mind in muscle, yeah, focus on the feeling
of the muscle that's doing the work, really think about your bicep and think back to our
lecture on muscles, how they work, try to imagine that bicep muscle just shortening
and lengthening and shortening and lengthening, remember we said a concentric contraction
and an eccentric contraction, yeah, the muscle at work, how we doing guys, look at those
arms, fabulous, oh I've got there just in time, so just in case you haven't picked up
the swing of what we're doing here we're going to put those two exercises together, nice
and wide with the legs and again because we're combining upper and lower body together here
that integration relies upon your core strength, so abdominals in tight, okay are we set as
you squat down, it comes up, let's go, keep the elbows fixed to your side, keep your chest
lifted, head up and keep smiling, just think what this is doing for you, knees out, make
sure the knees don't collapse into the center, yeah, beautiful work, control the momentum
on the bar, yeah, when you're lowering this down this goes for any weight training exercise,
you must control the momentum on the way down, the exercise is not simply lifting the bar
up, it's lifting it up and slowly lowering it down, fabulous, nice deep plies, should
really begin to feel that getting into the inner thigh as well, well done guys, well
done at home, so let's move on, front lunge now, now the front lunge is a little more
tricky than the rear lunge, reason being the stability issues now, so this is great work,
if anyone's had trouble knee injuries this is a great exercise to do but take your time
with it because it really builds up the muscles around the knee that help control your motion,
so what we're going to do again, you can rest it here or get it out of the way, rest it
on the back there, so feet are about to hit with the part, for the front lunge right leg
you're stepping forwards, dropping the knee down and then in one movement coming back
to where you started on that right leg again, but be careful here because two things can
happen, one if you're not careful we've got a stability issue here, but two what might
also happen is your knee shoots forwards and the problem with that is if the knee shoots
forwards too far here that puts a real strain under the patella tendon there which is not
a good idea, so what we're looking for is only going as far as there so that it goes
straight down, really you don't want your knee to go further than the line of your
toe while you're moving, so just look out for that, okay always set, start hip width,
make sure you step hip width, don't step onto a tight rope, yeah okay, away we go, right
leg, step, lunge down and back, abs in tight, shoulders back, chest lifted, work at your
own pace, you don't have to work in time with us, it's down to you, good, remember what
we said, longer lunge and these are great lunges, the more muscular energy we're using,
yeah, the more of the muscle fibres, the better the toning effect, fabulous, nice and
long, down onto the knee, good and remember we've got to control that motion, don't let
it wobble side to side, don't let the knee overshoot the toe, so you've got to take
a nice long stride, should really feel some work in the front and back of the thigh as
you lower down but then as you kick back you should really start to feel that in the glutes
and to really exaggerate that, let's try this on the other side now, think about pushing
off with your heel from that front foot, so let's swap over sides, set yourself up,
make sure you're hip width apart again, as you step out this time what I'm going to
ask you to do when you lunge, really press off that front heel, really get that feeling
that you're pressing back off the front heel to get you back to where we start, okay are
we ready, your right leg, your left leg, come on then keep up, here we go, lunge in down
and push and down and push from that front lunge, let's go, excellent, so really getting
into the glutes by working on that push off the floor there, so what we're doing there
is working into, if you remember when we talked about the joints and we talked about the hip
joint, the movements about the hip joint and we talked about hip extension and that's
what this is, returning from that forward position from flex back to that hip extension
and that's brought about by the gluteal muscles, so we get a really good push off the floor
to get us back, really toning into the buttocks, excellent work, how are you doing at home,
I hope you're still with us, remember all of these exercises you can try just with a broom
handle at first before you get your training bar, okay so we're going to add to that now,
let's move on to the upper body, shall we go with some work for your shoulders, so let's
try our lateral raises, a little bit of a balance issue here, make sure you get the
bar in the middle, it doesn't matter if it wobbles too much, again in terms of stability
we'll challenge the core strength, so let's try and keep the feet hip width apart, knees
slightly bent, if you find that you're starting to sway a little bit remember we can split
the feet and that goes for any exercise you're doing where you're lifting weights up a body,
if you start to find that it's difficult to maintain that strong center then if you split
your feet into what we call a split lunge, a tiny distance there, that'll help you with
the stability issues, okay so here we go, knees are slightly bent, we're going to lift
to the side but keep the elbows slightly bent as well and we're just lifting to about head
height so the bar's up to shoulder level, if your hand's up to head height there we go,
okay are we set, we're looking for 15 repetitions, now this is an isolation, nothing else moves,
we're just getting into the deltoids, up and down, abs are in tight, you should really
feel now because we've got a balance issue, if you're not locking on in the center clearly
you're going to fall over, so you've got to lock on in the center there as you slowly lift,
how are you doing, really focus, mind and muscle, just concentrate on that shoulder,
if you focus on the muscle that's doing the work you're more likely to get the technique right,
how are we doing, a little couple more, doesn't matter if the bar wobbles a little bit, try
and reset it, abs are in tight and if we're done, should we swap over to the other side,
again be aware that you might have imbalances from one side to the other, how many of you
carry your baggy on one hand all the time, the same arm on the same shoulder, okay so we're
lifting up and back down, think about the technique, abs in tight, knees slightly bent so we're in
that braced position, all the work's coming from the shoulder here, yeah, we're working particularly
there's a little bit of work from the front and from the back of the shoulder, the anterior and
the posterior deltoid, but most of the work is coming through there the medial deltoid,
the middle part of the shoulder, abs in tight and don't swing, remember what we said we're
working eccentrically against gravity, we're slowly lowering it down, don't let it just fall,
get your money's worth, get the whole exercise, yeah, okay so it starts to get tricky now because
we're going to combine these two, so you've got those stability issues when we step forwards making
sure the knee doesn't wobble in or out and making sure it doesn't go too far forwards at the same
time as lifting the bar, now we're going to go in opposition here, so what's going to happen is
you're going to lunge forwards with your right leg but you're going to lift the lateral raise on
the left side so that it keeps you balanced, okay so set yourself up, be to hip width apart, we're
going to step forwards there with that leg and lift up at the same time and back down, yeah,
not an easy exercise, hop and down, you can see I've put this other arm out for balance and
down, beautiful, get a good deep lunge, 15 reps please how we doing, excellent, nice deep lunge,
lifting up to shoulder level, excellent, good work, these guys are super fit, they're only sweating
because of the lights, trust me, good work, keep going, abs are in tight, beautiful, nice deep
lunges, so don't sacrifice it, yeah, you've got a lot to think about here and this is taxing because
it's a whole body exercise, trust me, we've got some calves, we've got some hamstrings, we've got
some quads, glutes, abdominals, obliques, the shoulder, there's a lot of work going on here,
it's fabulous, swap it over to the other side, fabulous me because I'm not doing it, I'm just
watching them doing, take the feet out wide again, we're on to the other side now, so you're
going to lunge forwards and control this lunge, we're lunging forwards with your left leg and we're
lifting the bar on the right side, get a couple of breaths and away we go, nice deep lunge and lift,
fabulous, boom, if you need the other hand out for balance, if you want it on the hip that's fine,
make sure your body's staying upright in the centre, excellent, the head's lifted, the chest
lifted, fabulous, don't sacrifice those lunges, good, always don't rush, don't rush, yeah,
always about getting good quality, super, tricky exercise really relies on the core strength,
what we call the inner unit, the diaphragm that pushes down, transversus pulling in, the internal
obliques at the side and that multifidus muscle at the back gives us that inner unit which gives us
what we call the abdominal balloon that pulls in, helps us stabilise the spine, great work, great
exercise, so you'll be pleased to know that we're going to make it a little bit easier, should we
get down on the mat, take a little rest guys, you deserve it, we're going to get down for some, no
workout's going to be complete without some abdominal work is it, so let's work into our
rectus abdominis, the six pack now, now remember the key with this exercise is you're trying to draw
your ribs close to your hips, that is all the six pack muscle does, really you only use it
a couple of times a day getting up in bed in the morning and going back again at night,
so for this exercise what we're going to do is take the bar across the chest when you lie yourself
down, the feet are about hip width apart, as you sit up you're going to press the bar up, yeah,
so make sure that the movement is initiated by the abdominals and the way to do that getting back
to our mind and muscle is to think about your abdominals as a spring and squeeze it together,
yeah, that's what you're going to do, think about the spring, squeeze together and then lift the bar,
yeah, okay, sitting up nice and tall, are we ready, I'm going to take 15 repetitions guys, let's go,
remember your breathing, breathe out on the way up and in on the way down, yeah, try and keep your
heels down, if you can you might find your feet wobble a little bit but that doesn't matter as
long as you're getting that work from the abdominals, yeah, so think about initiating the movement
by squeezing the ribs down towards the hips, yeah, and reaching the bar, that extra resistance we're
working against, fabulous, can we feel something going on in the center, now this is slightly
different because what we're working on in terms of abdominals here and not the abdominals I was
talking about earlier when we were standing, they're with the deeper postural muscles that just pull
in and fix us, we're now talking about the rectus which is a mobilizer, it's responsible for moving
you, yeah, different abdominal muscle group, excellent, 15, super and a quick rest there,
going to vary things slightly because what we're going to do is still use the rectus,
but what I'm going to do now is then change it slightly and add some more oblique work
and again remember the obliques, we have two different muscles here, the external obliques
that if you just were to put your hand on your waist the direction of your fingers really that's
the sort of angle that the obliques run at, yeah, whereas your internal obliques if you turn your
hand over they're running that direction, so the internal obliques are deeper and they're the ones
that work on your core strength, the external obliques just here are what help us with rotation,
but interestingly and if you think about this if you've got external obliques running this way
and internal obliques this way can you see how they work on opposite sides, so if I want to go
that way it's this action, internal here and external there, if I want to go that way it's
actually going to be internal here and external there, yeah, so they work together but sort of
in opposition if you see what I mean, so it's internal and external that way, internal and
external that way and that's because of the angle the muscle fibers run at, so we're going to add
them together and get that twist, but also we're getting a little sit-up so we're getting some
rectus work as well, so let me just show you first of all for this one you can continue to rest guys
for a second, a well-hand rest, you're going to sit up so this is where your rectus comes in
and then use the obliques as you reach the bar up and over to that side, yeah, we're just going to
go to that one side first of all sit up and reach it across, yeah, so a little bit of coordination
movement here as well, so I'm after 15 repetitions please, are you set, go, up and twist, beautiful,
up and twist, so reach that bar up nice and high, a little bit higher up there, fabulous, good and
reach, excellent, so getting into that rectus abdominis, getting into the obliques with that
twist, keep it nice and smooth and don't let yourself fall back down, remember to slowly
lower yourself down, get the full value for each exercise, up and reach, beautiful, excellent work
just 15 and then you can have a quick rest, good work, really working into those abdominals, problem
area for a lot of us, we all want to work on this and this is a great exercise you can do, well done
when you've done your 15 you can have a quick rest, yeah, excellent, good work, well done, so all we've
got to do you'll be pleased to know you've only got one more exercise to do and that is the same
thing that sit up and twist but we're doing it on the other side now, now you might be getting a
little bit tired but don't sacrifice your form, yeah, we're nearly there, this is your last exercise,
so are we set, let's go with it, sit up and twist, beautiful, twist and reach upwards,
just a little bit higher with that bar, jump to the corner, fabulous and up and twist, beautiful,
up and twist, good, a little bit more rotation if you can, twist the body, good, really get
into those obliques, get a little bit more rotation if you can, yeah, really make them do some work,
excellent stuff, sit up and twist, good, I do feel guilty watching you guys do all the work but
you're doing such a great job, I don't look half as good as them doing this, hopefully you're looking
good at home, yeah, we're done, you can have a quick rest, in fact why don't you just lay the bar
down and pull your knees into your chest and have a rest there, so what we're going to do now is
go into a little cool down, importantly because we've done a lot of work through the core strength
there, we need to do some stretches for the lower back so what the guys are doing here is that little
pulling your knees into the chest and you can rock forwards and backwards and side to side,
that'll really get into there because you've really worked around the centre there on a lot of
these exercises, although we were isolating like the bicep curl, when we combined upper and lower
body, as I said to get that integration you've really got to work your core strength, what I'm
going to ask you to do now is to drop both knees down to our side over here and then take your arms
across to the other side, so that little stretch there again, great stretch for getting through
your lower back into the obliques, the muscles that have just done some work, try and just relax
yourself down into that position and you know the usual rule for our stretching exercises at the end
there, we're looking for about 30 seconds because you're nice and warm now, so this is a good time
to get that stretching, if you're short of any ideas, don't forget you've got your little flexibility
workout DVD in this series that gives you lots of different stretching exercises you can use,
should we flip over to the other side, but particularly for this one and any exercises
that are really using your core strength, so on our medicine ball, on our kettle bells, those kind
of exercises, this training bar as well, what I want you to do is get a good little stretch, a mobility
work through your lower spine at the end there, so that is your training bar workout, great tool,
so many exercises you can do with it, so many different things you can do with it, like I say
if you haven't got one to start with, you can still do that workout with us with a broom handle,
remember the guidelines, we're looking at a one set of 15 if you're just setting out,
two sets of 15 if you're already exercising, more advanced, three sets and then also remember
you've got the opportunity to go slightly heavier with these training bars, it's a great workout,
have fun with it.
