In this presentation we'll take a look at what yoga is and its benefits trying to demystify
a little bit and we'll move on to a practical session where I'm going to teach you just
three poses and challenge you to link them as a routine.
So with no special clothing or equipment in the comforts of your own home I hope you'll
join me in a short while and experience the body toning tension releasing opportunity
that could well open the door for a whole new way of exercise for you.
You've really got nothing to lose so why not give it a go.
In fact to borrow a quote from one of Hollywood's less timid personalities, Mae West, try everything
once and twice if you like it.
Now the word yoga literally means union or yoga and it can be described as a unique system
of physical, mental and it could even be spiritual development developed around 3,000 years ago
in its largest context.
It can be interpreted to mean the union of the individual soul with the collective soul
but contrary to some beliefs it's not a religion but rather an ancient form of conscious living.
Unfortunately it's this potential for yoga to reach into our lives that often repels
many people from investigating the practice and its value perhaps suspecting it to be some
form of cult or associated with a hippie like existence or link to some unusual dietary
regimes.
In truth yoga can truly be all things to all people it just takes a little forethought
to establish what you want to take from it and then figure out how to derive that.
Now if you consider that a 2005 study proved that yoga can improve biochemical indicators
associated with heart disease, stroke and diabetes or that it's also been shown to
reduce symptoms associated with back pain, osteoarthritis, couple tunnel syndrome or
that Seattle research found it helps to control weight gain in middle age then you can't
help but draw the conclusion there must be something in this.
Now if I tell you that soldiers with the 320th engineer company serving in Iraq are practicing
yoga to help with fatigue levels and to keep them battle ready I think you'd find it pretty
tough to mount an argument against giving it a go.
Now research suggests that yoga can improve mood, counteract stress, reduce heart rate
and blood pressure, increase lung capacity, improve strength and flexibility and ameliorate
conditions like anxiety, depression and insomnia.
So I asked Professor Satterfield to tell us a little bit more about the clinical research
behind the relationship between yoga and health.
So there's a number of different complementary and alternative therapies that are currently
being studied many of them supported by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine at the National Institutes for Health.
There is a growing body of literature that supports therapies such as yoga and hatha
yoga is usually the most commonly studied also tai chi and it seems that for most of
these therapies they found positive results for depression, stress and quality of life,
all important things that we need to pay attention to.
But particularly for tai chi there's been a number of studies looking at the use of
tai chi in patients who've survived cancer, they have had surgery, chemotherapy and or
radiation therapy, they're trying to cope with those side effects, get their quality
of life back and tai chi seems to be an important treatment that does that for them.
Some years ago I made that first step into the world of yoga myself even though I'd
always promised myself that along with golf it was something I would only indulge in well
into my retirement years.
During my first yoga camp joining several sessions every day and sleeping for around
12 hours each night my body just felt different like driving a new car and I experienced a
sort of epiphany and so my fuse had been lit but for me as a fitness expert the journey
has been about exploring my body and taking things from the practice that I can apply
to my daily life to improve my performances at work, perhaps my sporting prowess and more
importantly my health.
I call my approach fitness yoga as it's clearly about fitness first but using hatha poses
as a means to an end but it's most certainly not a traditional yoga program.
However fitness yoga does marry centuries old yoga poses together with a modern approach
to improving well being primarily through enhancing both postural awareness and core
strength capabilities.
Going beyond the realms of traditional body conditioning programs fitness yoga is a systematic
sensory approach to integrating both mental and physical functions thus rendering it as
true mind body experience but what exactly is mind body exercise you may ask?
The key component is awareness as mind body exercise initiates and actually requires
a profound inwardly directed focus.
It differs from traditional exercise in that it's both non-judgmental and non-competitive
so there's no emphasis on how much you can do, how much you can lift, how many repetitions
can you do, how fast can you go, there's none of that.
There exists this greater degree of freedom to explore and to express yourself without
the pressure to fit into a particular norm.
You're not expected to look, move or feel the same as anybody else when you're doing
this but rather just to enjoy the individual exercise experience.
The benefits of this approach are many-fold predominantly because western exercise often
concentrates on dividing the body into target areas for attention whereas eastern based
philosophies treat the body as a whole unit which has greater application to real life
situations.
In addition western exercises come to view flexibility as really the sort of poor second
cousin to strength training a phenomenon well supported by the lack of time spent stretching
after most gym programs or studio classes in many health clubs.
Mind-body exercise promises to enhance balance by seeking to improve flexibility helping
to move freely but also seeking the strength to control the stability of movement.
Beyond purely the physical benefits it's widely recognized that once the body is in
tune and it's balanced the mind can then become free to both relax and to grow.
And what are the essential aims of this fitness yoga well firstly to enhance muscular balance
and strength which in turn increases the ability to stabilize the joints.
We want to develop flexibility to predispose a greater range of motion around the joints
and also to improve skeletal posture so reducing the risk of spine related ailments.
We can also facilitate the ability to optimally function at work at play and also to establish
a constant dialogue between the mind and body.
Now Indian Vedic texts going back a long while state that yoga integrates the mind with the
body reduces stress and tension awakens the body and it inspires the mind.
From its ancient roots up to the present yoga has provided a demanding fitness program
that stretches and tones the body with emphasis on the spine and the core muscles.
It includes breathing techniques that improve lung capacity as well as concentration.
For some it may simply be a way to have fun to look better and feel more relaxed but for
others it's a way of connecting to perhaps a higher state of consciousness.
Now it can be that any or all of these things are what we take from yoga.
The decision is up to you as to which you choose.
Now with ha meaning sun relating to passion energy positivity and that meaning moon suggesting
cool reflective negativities easy to understand why half the yoga being the most popular form
is described as this union of opposites.
So the goal then is to achieve balance to position oneself in the center and there's
now a whole plethora of yoga flavors out there available for anyone to try and most
of them have their root in half the basically the theory is that if you're moving then
it's half the base although the styles will differentiate themselves via differences
in intensity sequence whether it changes or it's a set sequence and intention is it
for purification is it for body conditioning is it about meditation.
All of these will dictate how the practice changes.
Now the Indian sage Patanjali systemized the various aspects of yoga into a little book
called the Yoga Sutras.
This is around some 2000 years ago now according to Patanjali there exist eight limbs in a
yogic lifestyle all equally important and interconnected and these are designed as a
blueprint for this yogic lifestyle it's easy to see how applying them to today's world
would make for a happier life for us all.
So the first of these is yamas which refers to the individual practices that basically
make us better human beings and make for a better world so these will include things
like truthfulness non-stealing non-harming generally leading a good life and not always
being on the take.
Niyamas refers to personal disciplines things like cleanliness contentedness self-discipline
and self-study and then pranayama breathing exercises very important for many yoga practices
absolutely vital Pratyahara is the detachment from worldly activities or withdrawal of
the senses Dhyurana is mental concentration and then there's Dhyana meditation Samadhi
refers to for some people absorption with the divine some connection with God for some
people it's just bliss and then finally most important for me asana which is the practice
of physical poses the poses that we assume during yoga practice what I've done is to
try to find a way to bring these to life when I practice my poses so that although I'm
a fitness expert I'm mostly concerned with the body I can try to get a little value
added training by using these principles so when we have our little practice which you're
going to join me for listen out for me filtering those eight limbs into the poses we practice
together now a fitness yoga workout follows a rigid blueprint you'll see how we do this
and this is something you can easily replicate yourselves and this has come through years
and years of being tried and tested to be sure that it's safe and effective we'll always
start with some breathing exercises and this basically forms the warm up but warming up
in a slightly different way now we're going to allow a little longer for this and we're
going to be warming up from the inside out we're going to learn individual poses we're
only going to do three poses today we're going to learn each one we're going to work off
both sides and explore our movement within them we're going to link them together as
a routine slowly piecing the sequence together gives us a little challenge in terms of continuity
and controlling our core strength on the move we'll then take it up to doing it dynamically
now the purpose to perform dynamically is because in everyday life we move dynamically
so we need to be able to control our core strength as we're moving and generating a
little bit of power finally we'll do the routine with flow and we'll look at how we can mimic
harmonious continuous movement so there you have it this is how fitness yoga works so
why don't we put it into practice and have a taste of a practical session so I'd like
you to join me you need to move the furniture out of the way make sure you've got a little
bit of space if necessary and we're going to begin by just standing with your feet together
and your hands by your side so if you're ready we'll have a little practice of fitness yoga
so here we go with your fitness yoga work out now remember we're doing fitness first
this is not traditional yoga we're not working through pose and counter pose there's not
so much emphasis on the breathing those of you who've done a little bit of fitness will
be aware that as soon as you start to exercise your breathing rate will increase accordingly
so we're going to look at three particular areas muscular strength you'll remember from
our lecture on muscles we talked about isometric muscular contractions where the length doesn't
change we're going to look at flexibility and also we'll look at balance now you may
remember from that balance lecture about the importance of core strength so we're going
to start first of all by putting your feet together in our mountain pose so be aware
of being balanced first of all now I'm going to work through a couple of breathing exercises
just to get you warmed up first of all breathing in and out through the nose that's all I'm
going to ask you to do take some deep breaths in and out through your nose now you'll notice
that you can begin to slow your breathing rate down which is good because what I want
you to do is try to get in a little more oxygen and get out a little bit more carbon dioxide
now we're about to do some exercise oxygen is the fuel the muscles run on so it makes
sense for us to fuel up so let's get some deep breaths in now I know your tidal volume
your normal in-out breath is only about a third of your lung capacity so we're going
to go a little bit deeper now and the beauty of that is as we go into the lower lobes of
the lungs we get a better exchange of gases so what that means is that we start to get
rid of a little bit more carbon dioxide so we're starting our detox process also breathing
through your nose begins to warm the air so try for a second you might want to close your
eyes just for a second to focus on that warmth and taking it deep down into your center also
breathing through your nose begins to fill to the air so again we're beginning to take
in pure air we're beginning that purification process now most importantly breathing is
linked to the flow of energy around your body the Prana this is why breathing exercise in
yoga are called Pranayama so this is what I'm going to ask you to do when you take those
deep breaths try to feel as though you're beginning to wake up the tissues all around
the body I'm going to change that slightly I'm going to ask you now to take both hands
and rest them on your tummy just put both hands there now take a few deep breaths and
you'll begin to notice that the hands move forwards when you breathe in and they come
back slightly when you breathe out and this is due to the diaphragm moving down and up so
what I'm going to ask you to do now is to exaggerate that movement so when you take
a deep breath in I want you to actually consciously push the hands forwards and when you exhale
let them relax back so let me show you that from the side we're keeping the spine in a
neutral comfortable position but when you breathe in I want you to actually push forwards
here really push the diaphragm down and then when you exhale let it come back so just breathing
at a nice comfortable relaxed pace for you but we're actually pushing the hands forwards
and then when we exhale they're coming back a couple more of those and all the time we're
doing this should be beginning to feel like we're getting the energy flowing around your
body we're beginning to liven up we're also beginning to warm up from the inside out now
I'm going to change that and this may feel strange at first because I'm going to ask
you to do completely opposite of that move and completely the opposite of your normal
breathing pattern this time when you breathe in I want you to pull the hands in and when
you exhale I want you to let them relax forwards so deep breath in and pull the hands in you'll
feel the chest expand try to keep the shoulders away from the ears and then exhale we'll have
a couple more of those please again try to feel that energy flowing all around the body
am I going to do one more little exercise we're going to take the hands wrap them around the
ribs you know not the waist make sure you've got a hold of the ribs take a couple of deep
breaths and just feel how the rib cage expands and then contracts and you'll remember from
our lecture on respiration we talked about that thoracic cavity expanding the pressure
drop and the air coming in remember it's the pec minor intercostal muscles the diaphragm
that are responsible for this fabulous what I'm going to ask you to do now is actually
press with the hands so now you've got to work that much harder through those respiratory
muscles to be able to expand the rib cage so what we're doing here is a little resistance
training for your respiratory muscles yeah and again you should now be beginning to feel
like you're getting a little bit warmer that core body temperature should be beginning
to rise press with the hands and work against that resistance and we'll relax the arms
down there back into our mounting pose be aware first of all of your balance finding
your center point so what I'm going to ask you to do is take a slight sway forwards and
backwards and side to side what I'm looking for is focusing on the soles of the feet
I want you to try and find the point where you feel lightest on your feet where there's
the least amount of stress on the soles of the feet so have that little sway around and
try and find that point we're going to call that your center point and we'll keep coming
back to that I'm going to work through a list of teaching points that we're going to use
for everything we do we'll start at the bottom with our foundation first of all be aware of
having the same amount of pressure on the right and left foot I'm going to ask you to
press your feet down into the ground the feeling is you're rooting yourself now and if you've
done traditional yoga will be familiar with the idea now of initiating that first energy
loop coming into the lower leg press down should start to feel something going on in
the lower leg I'm going to move up and work on your alignment now so first of all I'm
going to ask you for an inner spiral of your thighs I want you to rotate your thighs towards
the center not squeeze them in turn them in rotate them towards the center now that may
feel a little uncomfortable at first because what might happen as you do that is your back
side sticks out you'll exaggerate that curve but that's okay because the next move is to
draw the tailbone down now then what hopefully has happened there is we've begun to kick
in these core muscles around the center and just to check have a little prod just below
the tummy button and what I'm going to ask you to do is pull in here pull in here and
lift up here that starts to give us this energy in the middle gives us that abdominal balloon
we now outer spiral the arms simply rotate don't lift them just rotate it takes the shoulder
blades back and down releases the tension through the neck keep the arms exactly where they
are just in a spiral your hands only your hands come back keep your fingers together
and thumbs in I want you to be focused on your whole body reach your fingertips down
to the ground when we do that you'll start to feel some energy coming through here but
I'm going to add to that so I want muscular energy now all around your body and that feeling
is that you're drawing the muscles onto the bone all the way around the body now this
is not tension but intention a little bit of drawing everything in and in the not so obvious
places like your calves forearms everywhere now the opposite of that is our final or our
organic energy the feeling now is if you imagine the way the sun works it draws all the gases
into the center burns them and then throws out all the light and heat so imagine drawing
everything in but now when you take a deep breath let all that energy come back out let
it shine out of every cell in the body and then you can just relax and give your shoulders
a roll and give your legs a shake so those seven teaching points we're going to apply
to everything we do so now it's time to do some work let's put our feet together find
your center point make sure you're balanced I'm going to ask you to put your hands on
your thighs and take a little sit down into our awkward pose press the hands onto the
thighs ok so things to look out for here first of all make sure that we're keeping the abdominals
pulled in tight what I don't want is this dropping forwards but we're going to work
through those teaching points so first of all pressing the feet into the ground the
way to do this let's press the right foot down first ease that off press the left foot
down ease that off and now press both down really pressing to the ground now it's a little
awkward in this position but still we can in a spiral the thighs rotate your thighs
to the center and now draw your tailbone down ok so the feeling is you're taking your tailbone
down to the floor so we've still got that natural curve in the lower spine
beautiful the arms are resting at the moment be aware of pulling your tummy in tight
be aware of letting the top of your head lift up and forwards gravity pulls us down what we're
trying to do is lengthen through the spine so sit your chin back slightly let the top of your head
lift forwards now trick here can we keep going go an inch lower it would appear so
now remember I know it looks like I'm doing nothing but I'm with you the abdominals are
pulled in tight focus on that balance between the right and left foot now we talked earlier about
muscular energy I'm going to take it that we've already got some muscular energy in the thighs
you can nod if you like but just to be sure could we sit an inch lower fabulous now that puts more
of a challenge on keeping the abdominals pulled in tight pull in through the waist lift up through
the pelvic floor are we beginning to feel anything in the legs yet no oh oh oh oh keeping the abdominals
tight we're going to press through the thighs through the heels up we come and give your legs
a shake well done well done so far we've done one squat that's not bad going okay so let's work a
little further into that if you have any concerns with your lower back I want you to keep one hand
down to support your weight so give the legs a shake we've got an idea where we're going now so
starting from that mounting pose I'm going to ask you to sit down again this time keeping one hand
let's keep our right hand on the thigh please sit down into your awkward pose and lift the left
arm as we go down beautiful okay making sure you've got one hand down on the thigh so I'm
going to change things slightly we start at the bottom again on your foundation press your feet
into the ground yeah now if you're getting nice and deep you might be beginning to feel a little
bit of a stretch coming into the lower leg there press down in a spiral your thighs rotate to the
center that'll make this curve deepen but then we use the glutes to draw the tailbone down
and now we're going to add on to that keep your abdominals pulled in tight we're going to do that
outer spiral on the arm by rotating your arm out it'll take your shoulder away from your ear
now this is hatha yoga base so we're doing the union of opposites we're reaching with the arm but
drawing the shoulder blade back those two have to work together
okay hold it there muscular energy now as well as in the legs and just make sure we've got some
can we go an inch lower please it's not really a question brilliant can we make sure we've got
some muscular energy in our arms that feeling of drawing the muscles onto the bone stretch those
fingers out but draw the shoulder back and down and you'll feel that work in the upper back fabulous
doing that work around the rotator cuff muscles beautiful the abs are pulled in tight and can
we press through the feet and come back up to the top and give those legs a little shake well done
well done hopefully beginning to feel some work in the legs remember we're talking about muscular
strength okay let's move it on slightly what i'm going to ask you to do now is to sit down and lift
both hands if you have any concerns about your lower back keep one hand down if not this is what
we're going to do sit down and lift both hands up please beautiful foundation press into the ground
make sure you're balanced on right and left in a spiral your thighs draw your tailbone down and
now feel the energy in the center here just that natural little curve in your lower spine out to
spiral your arms so your shoulders are not near your ears reach the fingertips draw the shoulders
back and down the chin is slightly back so the top of the head is lifting up through the gap in the
arms there's muscular energy in your arms drawing the muscles onto the bone feel as though you're
pulling all that energy into the center let's get our money's worth can we go one inch lower please
fabulous just a little higher with those arms really reaching them up to the sun beautiful abdominals
are in tight press through the heels take the arms out and give your legs a little shake well done
well done good work we're moving on put that to the back don't forget it we're going to turn
your right foot out we're going to take your left foot into this t-shape it's not heel to heel
i want the heel in the cup of the instep we're going to open them out and we're going to sink
down onto the front leg just easy to begin with now first of all our foundation particularly the
back foot i don't want this one drifting out so on the outside edge really press it down into the
ground as you press down we start to feel the energy coming into that lower part of the leg
for this one we're going to sink out beautiful i want to keep your hips chest shoulders square
to the front now your union of opposites here your challenge is can i keep this hip back but this knee
out yeah we're going to sit down we're going to pull in here we're going to pull in here
and we're going to lift up here be aware of top of the head up tailbone down now what happens as
we begin to sink onto this side what we'll find is a little bit more muscular energy here
a little bit more of a stretch here don't go too far just yet can we press out of that
can we flip the heels over make sure we've got that line from the heel to the cup of the instep
and let's have a look see if it's any different on the other side remember we talked in our
flexibility lecture about maybe having difference from one side to the other so let's analyze that
now press into that foot hip back but knee out really open out through your hips feel that
release through the hips pulling tight through the abdominals lift up through the pelvic floor
pull in through the waist top of the head up by sitting your chin back tailbone down
fabulous we get more muscular energy on this leg just by sinking a little bit further this way
and bring it back and turn it over to the other side okay there's only one way to find out how
far you can go and that's by challenging yourself let's open those feet out a little bit further
now i know you're getting warmer so pressing down into the ground with the feet sinking down onto
this leg to generate this muscular energy can we go a little bit further this time hips back
knees out we're taking the arms up to shoulder level make sure they're balanced make sure the
back hand doesn't drop down it's the same height as the front hand out to spiral your arms rotate
them backwards that generates this distance from the shoulder to the ear which releases
attention through the neck but now keep your arms exactly where they are just turn your palms over
we're going to go for a bow and arrow you're going to reach this way and this way at the same time
abdominals are in tight top of the head's lifted can we sink a little bit lower please
maybe a little lower still let's start to get a little bit of flexibility work into this inner thigh
and as we sink lower you'll feel the backside might want to stick out so keep it pulled down
fingers together thumbs in and press yourself out of that and relax over to the other side
constantly swapping from side to side so that we can make that comparison okay we're sitting down
pressing the foot down pressing into the ground
pulling in pulling in arms to shoulder level fingers together thumbs in make sure this back
hand's not dropping down out to spiral your arms in a spiral your palms make sure there's some
muscular energy in your arms so make sure we've got this feeling of drawing the muscles onto the
bone all the way through the body you know particularly in these strong arms well done guys
can we go a little bit lower compare it how does it feel compared to the other side
have we got one side that's maybe more flexible than the other if so we know which one we need to
work on and let's press ourselves back out of that beautiful bring the feet in let's turn the right
foot in this direction put the left foot behind and rest it on the ball all I'm going to ask you
to do is move on to a little bit of balance the focus here is on our core strength so firstly
I'm going to bend this knee and I'm going to put my right hand on the thigh to support my weight
the challenge here is can we pull in pull in lift up and keep this fixed keep pressing into
your right foot until you're just able to pull the toes up on your left foot so you've got a
slight lean in this direction keeping your hips square and we'll change that back over to the
other side once again keep comparing side to side see if we have a weaker side that needs extra work
so left foot's pointing this way challenges can we move into the balance but keep locked in the
center pull in lift up push into this foot keep this fixed can we lift that right foot off the
floor and pull the toes up now if you lose your balance it doesn't matter just reset yourself join
back in when you're ready let's take it over to the other side and take it one step further let's
take the left arm out this time reach it away let's get that release through the neck so we're
going to press into this foot we're going to lift the left toes we're going to now begin to straighten
through this leg now look at the long line from the top of your head through your tailbone through
your heel and let's ease it over to the other side what I'm looking for on the supporting leg
is that extra muscular energy by drawing the kneecap up so let's go over to the other side
hand on the thigh for support first of all if you have any concerns with your lower back
you must support your weight when we're flexing so abdominals tight pull in through the waist to
pull up through the pelvic floor press into the foot and lift and then we begin to extend
through the leg now just as far as is comfortable yeah just as far as is comfortable keeping your
hips square to the front chest to the front and we're now locking on this leg remember how important
our foundation is the key to any balance is really pressing that foot into the ground
yeah really press it into the ground and then draw up that energy from there
fabulous and release it down we'll change over to the other side well done so same thing again
find your level we're going a little bit further each time find your level so the right foot's this
way this time we're going to open out the arms reach fingertips are facing me excellent press it
into the foot lift up keep the abdominals in tight and let's begin to hinge just as far as
is comfortable for you but you know what you'll only find out how far you can go by experimenting
with it i'm going to give you the choice you can look down to the floor you can look up to the front
up to the top hand whichever works best for you you lose your balance that's okay just reset yourself
press that foot into the ground it's important to get that foundation lock on that leg pull those
toes back brilliant and ease it down let's go across to the other side well done point in the toe
rest on the ball of the foot let's open out fingertips together thumbs in
out to spiral those arms get the shoulders away release through the neck we need to stay
locked here this is our challenge we're working on our core strength pull the abdominals in tight
press into your left foot lift the right toes begin to hinge nice and slowly find how far you can go
keeping that strong foundation does it go a little bit further remember you have the choice
to look down to the ground look to the screen or look up to the top whichever works for you
let your head drop as well so you've got a nice long line through the body don't forget that muscular
energy in your arms as well brilliant and back up to the top and take a quick rest there roll your
shoulders give your legs a shake you now have three poses working on strength flexibility balance but
our challenge now can we control our key strength while we're on the move so we're going to link
them together take your mountain pose please take a couple of deep breaths first we're going to sit
down into our awkward pose the first position so sit yourself down lift your hands up
just check yourself press the feet into the ground as in tight shoulders back and down can we now step
out with your right leg straight into your warrior two position straight over check yourself make sure
that we've got that foot pressed into the ground make sure the hips chest shoulders are square is
there any chance we can now lift straight into our half moon this is all about pre-engaging the
core muscles as we lean into this leg and lift lock on that right leg now that was the easy bit
slowly bend that right knee lower yourself back down into that warrior two position look where
the ponds are now step back into your awkward pose sit down straight into the position and up to the
top so the challenge is as awkward as it feels can we move straight from one position to the next
it should feel a little bit awkward but that's the challenge if we can accommodate this movement
then our everyday movements will feel that much more easy to do and uh iyenga who originated
iyenga yoga used to refer to yoga as an obstacle race and iyenga yoga is the most popular yoga
used to refer to yoga as an obstacle race the idea being that we just keep putting things
in the way and making a little bit more of a challenge so let's work to that challenge
awkward pose sit yourself down we're going the other way this time step out with your left leg
into warrior two directly into it now have confidence be strong in the center lift straight
up into your half moon lift lift lift straight up fabulous fabulous lock on that leg well done guys
brilliant take that right foot back down into your warrior two position straight into it
moving directly straight down into your awkward pose
and up to the top mountain pose give your shoulders a little roll we've only got one more thing to
do the problem is in everyday life we sometimes need to move dynamically particularly if you're
doing any kind of sport so the challenge is can we now move quickly but control that movement
this is all about core strength it's all about your muscular energy we've been talking about
this muscular energy you need lots of it now so feet together take a deep breath you're going to
move as quickly as you can into each pose and then stop still so for the first one awkward pose
sit yourself down quickly let's go you're going to step out into into your warrior two with your
right leg go now have confidence lock on in your core muscles lift
straight down quick back to your awkward pose quick
and lift up we move dynamically in everyday activity if you're shoveling snow raking the
garden whatever it is you're doing you need to move quickly if you can't lock on these muscles
your back's going to be at risk so one more time going this way please set yourself find your
balance awkward pose let's go step out into your warrior two with the left leg quick go
lifting yourself up into that half moon quick go brilliant lock it on lock it on that's the
challenge back down into warrior two quick awkward pose hop and up we go and well done well done
take a few deep breaths in and out through your nose just to bring yourself back down so that's
our challenge there we're working purely from a fitness angle we're looking at our strength in
that first pose flexibility and our balance using our core strength we're linking them together
because that's how we move functionally but then we're doing it dynamically because that's how we
need to work in day-to-day life so why not have another little practice try it slow a couple of
times try it fast challenge yourself see how you get on
