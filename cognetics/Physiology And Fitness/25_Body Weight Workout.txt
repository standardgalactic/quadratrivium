Welcome to your body weight workout and the great thing about this is all we're going
to do is use the weight of your body against gravity, the clue is in the title.
So we really don't need any expensive equipment, we can do this anywhere, hopefully you're
doing it with us now at home, but you can do this indoor or out, you can take it on
holiday with you, you can do this if you're working away from home.
Now you might question whether this actually works, well you can join me with this simple
exercise if we do a little squat down, hopefully you can feel a little bit of work into the
front of the thighs, back of the thighs.
If I ask you now to do that on a single leg, it starts to get a little tougher, if I now
ask you to do it on a single leg but do it really slowly and you'll begin to see that
this can really have some effect in terms of building up our strength.
Also working with your whole body, we're starting to do functional fitness, yeah, we're working
on balance and you'll remember this from our balance lecture, we're working on our core
strength, you'll remember from our lecture on the spine.
Now before we start it's important to have a warm up like the guys are doing now, some
gentle mobilizing movements from head to toe that start to work through the dynamic range
of movement through your joints, start to get the synovial fluid working, start to get
your body temperature up, that's important.
Start gently, maybe you start with a walk, maybe you begin to build up into a jog like
the guys are doing, now there you go, fabulous.
So you'll start to get your core temperature up a little bit.
Now we're aiming for one set of 15 repetitions in this workout, those of you who are already
doing some exercise might want to go for two sets of each exercise and those of you who
are exercising really regularly, maybe even three sets you have the choice with a brief
rest in between.
Now be aware I'm deliberately alternating here between floor and standing, we'll constantly
be changing, getting up, getting down, getting up, maybe a little bit annoying but the great
thing is it's going to increase the energy burn through this, we're going to burn a few
more calories and also it's practicing an essential functional movement that we need
every day.
So should we get started?
Starting with your feet about hip width apart, are we ready guys?
What we're going to do here is take a lunge out to the right with your right leg, take
a look at it first, we're stepping out, we're lunging down, there's a slight point outwards
on this leg, we're hinging at the hip, reaching the hands down, this leg staying straight
and back to the side, we're looking to 15 repetitions, you can begin nice and easy,
all we set, let's go guys, 15 repetitions, reach out to the right leg and back, right
leg out and down we go, you're pointing the knee and the toes slightly outwards as we
go down and you're hinging from the hip, not rounding your spine, keep going for me.
So you're keeping your abdominals pulled in really tight, working that core strength,
really getting down onto that leg, okay, really getting nice and deep, get a good range of
motion, we should be a little bit warmer now, look how this knee and toe on John's pointing
out slightly to the side, so that we follow the natural hinge through the knee, bending
down, pressing the weight through the heel, abdominals are in tight, hopefully we'll begin
to feel a little bit of work getting into that right leg into the thigh, we're looking
for 15 repetitions, keep your breathing nice and relaxed, excellent, I'm going to trust
you guys to count to 15, no cheating, it's only yourself you're cheating, beautiful,
excellent work, are we nearly there yet?
Just joining for the last couple, that's me, fabulous, good work, good work, we're moving
on, we're moving on to our Hindu press up, so I'm going to show you this from the sideways
on so you can see what we're doing, we're going to start in a downward dog position,
so the feet are up, the back side's up, we take the chin down to the floor, we go through
the hands up to the cobra, back up to that position, the chin's down, along the floor,
up we go, and back to that position, beautiful work, through the mobility of the shoulders
in the lower back, down we go guys, are you ready at home, I'm looking for 15 repetitions
and away we go, chin down to the floor, up we go into that upward dog and then back up
to the downward dog, down we go, beautiful, fabulous work, keep it moving, continuous
all the way through them after 15 reps, please, good, pushing it up, so the great thing about
this is it becomes a dynamic flexibility exercise as well as a little bit of strength, we're
working through the range of motion in the shoulders, into the lower back, also into
the hamstrings as we come back up, from that upward dog into the downward dog, little bit
of a stretch maybe through the calf and Achilles at the back as we push back into that downward
dog, little bit of stretch through the chest and shoulders at the front, how we doing,
hang in there, 15 repetitions at home please, beautiful, get into a nice rhythm and go with
that pace, remember to keep breathing, don't hold your breath on these strength exercises,
excellent work, keep it going, keep it going, beautiful, be careful not to lock out your
arms, make sure the whole movement is under control, good, how many is that, about three
is it, four, I'm losing, I'll take that, go on, one more will do me, fabulous and we're
back up, quick up we get up we get up we get and we straight over to our side lunge but
on the other side now, so we're working your left leg, remember when you step out to point
the knee and toe slightly out so that we can follow that natural hinge movement, are we
ready, stepping out with the side lunge and down we go and back, can I get 15 of those,
please it's not really a question, let's go, now remember when you're bending don't
let the shoulders round, don't round through the lower back, but hinge from the hip, yeah
away we go, 15 reps, make sure you're hinging from the hip, keeping the abdominals in
tight, we're not rounding through the spine, okay, fabulous work and again it says quickly
getting out of the way, look how this point, we point out slightly on this toe which allows
the knee to point out slightly and follow a natural hinge, what we don't want is too
much lateral motion through here, the abdominals are staying in tight, we're working through
your core muscles as well as hopefully you can feel some work getting into this, left
thigh, into the front of the thigh, into the back of the thigh and hopefully as well a
little bit of work into the glutes, beautiful bonus here is we're also working dynamic flexibility
through that other leg, okay we're going to move on to a gecko row, this is about challenging
the position of our posterior muscles, we're going to try and keep our body in a fixed position,
so take a look at it first, we're down in a press up position but the feet are wide for
stability, the aim of the exercise is to bring the knee up to the elbow at the same time
I'm going to lift the opposite hand, what I'm trying to do is fix myself here, so this
is really challenging the muscles around the lumbar pelvic region, abs are pulling tight,
obliques are pulling, pelvic floor is lifted, we're trying not to twist and we're certainly
trying not to stick your backside up in the air, the aim is to just lift one hand up to
the shoulder, the opposite knee up to the elbow, okay take your time on this one, we're looking
for 15 repetitions, so pick your good leg first, down we go, excellent, get yourself
fixed first of all, backside down, no backside sticking up in the air and away we go, slow
as better on this one, good lifting the hand up to the shoulder and the knee up to the
elbow, beautiful, so the challenge here is can we stay locked on in the center to keep
your natural alignment in your lower spine, see how Jen's got this little curve in the
lower spine there, that's what we're looking for, beautiful, don't be round in the shoulders,
we're really pulling in through the tummy, keeping your abdominals pulled in tight, pulling
in through your waist, good, let the top of your head drop forwards, you don't want any
nasty creases in the back of the neck there, good, abdominals are in tight, good, challenging
those core muscles, remember those postural muscles that work isometrically, which means
they're not changing their length, they're just trying to fix you in the center, so don't
worry if you lose your balance a couple of times, that's going to happen, just reset
yourself if you do, yeah, and when we're done we're done, beautiful, you get a few
X ones in there Jon, excellent, okay I'm moving on now to the single leg squat, so the single
leg squat again I'm using a functional movement, I want you to imagine you're picking something
up from the floor, so you'll get a little bit of a hinge through the hip as well, so
let's pick our right leg first, all I'm going to ask you to do is bend, reach the hand down
to the floor, now what we're going to do here is this hand you can use for balance, put
it on your hip if you're feeling okay, but what I'm asking you to do is hinge at your
hip, keep your abdominals in tight, as you go down you're hinging, that's not bending
or rounding, but hinging from the hip as we reach the fingers down to the ground, okay,
set yourself up onto the right, but left leg lifted, and we're going to go down please,
when I get 15 of those let's go, now remember you might get a slight wobble, you might need
to reset yourself, that's okay, challenge yourself, can we get that left hand down to
the floor, beautiful, see how that knee's bending, now remember we've mentioned this
in a couple of the other workouts, the single leg squat is the most effective exercise you
can do to tone the glute muscles, your buttocks in other words, fabulous, down we go, excellent,
see how we're hinging from the hip, but that's challenging you to keep the abdominals in
tight, don't let the tummy drop down, what we're trying to find here is any rotation
through the knee, any rotation through the hips, to really work in those stabilizer muscles,
remember we talked about mobilizers and stabilizers in one of the earlier lectures, fabulous, good,
well done, well done, well done, and remember we're going up and down, up and down, so I'm
going to show you this one sideways on, going to do a little bit of work for the triceps,
so we're both going to be facing that way, so this is what we're going to do for your
right arm first of all, you're going to be lying sideways down, a little bend in the
knees to make them comfortable, you're actually going to put your right hand over the front
and take the left hand down, see how this elbow is high, all I'm going to ask you to do is
to press up straight through here and work into that tricep, yeah, that's all we're doing,
working into that right tricep, okay, let's go, down we go, heads that way, that's it,
beautiful, so bring that arm across, okay, so we're pressing up from there, press up
and back down, beautiful, so try and keep your body in a nice comfortable position,
bend through the knees and make sure that we're not lifting through the waist but it's
all coming from that press, isolating onto the outside head of the tricep, super, make
sure you stay sideways on through this exercise, excellent, try to relax your head and neck,
try not to feel too much stress through the neck as we do this, now you can't help but
cheat slightly, trust me, naturally you'll feel a little bit going on in the waist but
try to focus your mind in muscle, try to concentrate on the muscles that should be
doing the work, the triceps at the back of the arm, excellent, you're just looking for
15 of those, it's looking really good, excellent, I do feel guilty not doing anything, you're
doing really well guys, how are we doing at home, I hope you're still with us, once you've
done your 15 repetitions, annoyingly we're back up again, well done, well done, we're
moving on to the other leg, you're on your left leg now for your single leg squats, remember
this arms out for balance, this leg's out of the way, when we bend we're hinging at
the hip, reaching towards the floor and then back up but don't let the shoulder drop forward,
set yourself up, left foot down, right foot lifted, are we ready, let's drop that right
hand down to the floor, can I get those 15 single leg squats, please, yeah, beautiful,
let's reach this hand down to the floor, good, reset your balance if you need to, excellent,
excellent, there we go, keep the abdominals in tight, okay so remember in our balance
lecture we talked about how important the core muscles are in maintaining that balance,
so what we're doing here is challenging those core muscles, we're also challenging those
stabilizers around the hip, around the knee to help keep your balance on this exercise
but also it's a great toning exercise for the thigh, for the buttocks, super exercise
and probably one of the most functional movements we can do, how often each day do we bend down
to pick something up, but you know what, you don't want to be bending down to pick something
up and injuring your back, so that's why it's good to practice this movement, excellent,
excellent, excellent, have I got time to do a couple with you, or have you done yet, oh
is that it, okay we're going to move on, we're on our lying tricep but this time we're
on to your left hand, so let's turn and face that way, laying yourself sideways on, down
we go, bring that hand across, fabulous stuff and away we go pressing, so remember keep
this hand out of the way so that you can press up and all the way back down, working into
that tricep at the back of the arm, yeah and press, good, how are we doing, keep your breathing
relaxed, super, press in, excellent, you're making that look really easy, good, we're
looking for 15 at home remember, 15 is our magic figure, good, really important air in,
this is an isolation exercise, remember we talked about compound exercises and isolation
exercises, this is really targeting those triceps alone, fabulous, look at this we don't need
to use anything more than our body weight, beautiful, well done, well done, well done,
excellent, we're moving on to some plank work and again the challenge here is can you keep
your hips fixed, you're lower back in your neutral or comfortable spine while we're actually
changing our position, so that's the challenge, I'm going to show you it front on and then
side on, from the plank position all I'm going to ask you to do is lock on in the middle,
try to avoid too much rotation as you go down onto the elbow, onto the elbow, back up and
back up, so what we're trying to avoid here is either this happening or this happening,
the abdominals in tight, lock on in the middle as we go down, keep it locked on as we go
up, yeah are we set, are you ready at home and away we go, so onto the elbow and then
up to the hands, keep the backside down a little bit so you've just got that natural
little bend in the lower back, that natural lordotic lumbar curve, down we go, so sometimes
change which hand you lead with, now when you start to get a little fatigued don't stick
your backside up in the air, remember the challenge here is to work particularly on
this transversus muscle across the middle, so you're pulling your tummy button in tight
all the time, you're also getting some work for the inner obliques here, you're also getting
a little bit of work for the pelvic floor pulling up, everything's fixing the lower
spine in place on these exercises, good how are we doing, looking good guys, excellent,
onto the elbows and back up, try to avoid too much rotation if you can, you're doing
really well, how are you doing at home, I hope you're still with us, it says good, looking
good looking good, well done well done well done, we're back up, we're taking a little
variation now on that single leg squat and turning this into a diagonal lift, so now
we're adding a little bit of rotation, a little bit of extra plane of movement, so
we're starting on our right leg again, this time the leg's behind, but as we go down I
want you to reach over to there, when you come up I want the foot forwards and reach
over to there, so we're going down from the low diagonal to the upper diagonal, but look
now how we're getting much more movement through here, so this is more of a challenge, because
now I'm reaching down, but then as we come up, look how I'm extending through this position,
down and now instead of straight up we're extending, so a little bit of balance work
as well, so let's get onto our right foot guys, lift the left, this arms out for balance,
let's reach down to there and bring it up to the opposite diagonal, we're off to our
15 repetitions, nice and slowly, remember if you lose your balance that's okay, just
reset yourself, that's one of those things we talked about, as with flexibility and strength
of your cardio, it will get better with practice, yeah, beautiful, how are we doing, reach it
down, excellent and back up, really good stuff, well done, and really extend through that
position, beautiful, remember we said that the spine flexes extend, but it also hyperextends,
so we're getting that little bit of hyperextension, yeah, remember that it's important to work
through your full range of motion, if we're only working through a restricted range, we'll
only develop the strength through that restricted range, so what we're trying to do here is
work through our full range of motion, excellent stuff, and go get a couple shots, beautiful,
down we go, shoot up, good balance everybody, how are you doing at home, oh, see I said
that and then completely lost it, that was bound to happen, okay we're shifting on now,
we're going to go on to a single leg bridge exercise, and I'll show you this sideways on,
you'll have your head at this end when you do this guys, so what I'm going to do is go into the
right leg first, I'm going to put the left leg straight out, comfortable position, I'm pressing
into the heel, lifting your whole body as one, keeping the abs in tight, and then lowering
back down, try not to put too much stress on the neck, make sure the shoulders stay on the floor,
okay let's try it, so this is a really good exercise again for the glutes, but also getting
into the hamstrings, so let's get that leg up, there you go, perfect, okay are we set,
are you ready at home, and away we go, now just a little tip, if you're doing this at home make
sure that leg comes up as well at the same time, up you go, beautiful, you're not cheating
on your nose, and up we go, and up we go, beautiful, I'm looking for 15 repetitions,
keep it under control, don't swing the leg, yeah the lift is coming from pressing the heel down
on your right foot, you'll feel the work into the hamstring at the back of the thigh, into the glutes,
but again we've got that challenge for your core strength, in stabilizing you in the middle,
great exercise, getting three benefits from this single exercise, beautiful stuff,
and again we don't need any equipment, just working with your own body weight, slow is better,
keep it under control, now make sure you're in a comfortable position when you're doing this,
you want to ideally be sideways onto it, so you can just tilt your head and see what we're doing,
that's of course assuming you're not sitting on the sofa eating cookies, you should be doing this
with us, excellent, when I say earth obviously I'm in you because I'm not doing anything,
but it's time to get back up and we're on to the other leg, so we're onto our diagonal lift,
but we're on the left foot now, okay, so set yourself up on the left, be aware if you've
got any difference from one side to the other, just one side need a little bit of extra work,
so we're onto our left foot, the right foot's lifted, we're going to reach down to the low,
up to the high diagonal with that slight lean backwards remember, down and then really working
through that hyper extension, yeah, okay let's go 15 repetitions, does it feel any different to
the other leg, maybe better maybe not, who knows, beautiful, so what we're looking for here is to
be locking on in the middle, pulling your tummy in tight, if you start to lose your balance that's
okay, you can reset yourself, we're getting some really good work on this supporting leg, working
through the front of the thigh, the quadriceps, working through the hamstrings at the back,
remember we said we're working the glutes here, so this is what we're talking about in terms of
total body exercises, great thing about that is it burns lots of calories, we're doing really well,
good, good, good, excellent, oh was there a wobble there, actually it's really windy here,
that's it, if it looks like we're wobbling it is the wind, excellent, well done guys, locking on
in the middle, make sure you can feel this energy by pulling in here, pulling in here and lifting
up through the pelvic floor, you'll feel that abdominal balloon we talked about when we talked
about our spine and our core strength, brilliant stuff, we're straight back down onto the single
leg bridge on the other leg, so down we go, beautiful, that's it, that's it, straight out,
are you with us, you should be ready now for your left foot to press down for your single leg
bridge and away we go, excellent, so remember we're looking to lift here the whole body up,
that nice long line, yeah keep going for me, that nice long line that goes from your heel
all the way down, so when I'm pressing here into the heel, look at that line that goes from there,
all the way down here, yeah that's what we're looking for, great work for the glutes and the
hamstrings, slow is better, good, excellent, just the job, keeping the abdominals pulled in tight,
super, hopefully we can feel something going on there at the back of the thigh, maybe into the glutes,
excellent, keep your breathing nice and relaxed, particularly try and keep your neck relaxed
in this position, good, hope you're still with us at home, good work, well done, well done, well done,
we're there, excellent, we're moving straight on, you know we've got to do some abdominals,
I'm sorry it's only fair, you can stay down for this one, only because I'm going to really make
you get up on the last one, so for this one we're going to do a little bit of a B sit-up, so the great
thing about this exercise, normally your sit-ups will work just the upper part of the abdominals,
the reverse curl will work the lower part, so we're going to do the two together, so let me show
you sideways on what this looks like, I'm going to start with the feet in this position, I'm going
to start with the hands out like so, all I'm looking to do here is sit up there, both together, okay,
both together, yeah, if you're feeling particularly flashed don't put them on the floor when you go
back down, yeah, so we're bringing the knees to the chest and sitting up at the same time, so for
the rectus abdominis down the middle here, we're getting to the top and the bottom at the same time,
okay are we set, hands out, beautiful, I'll take 15 of those please, away we go, beautiful,
knees to the chest at the same time and you'll see there's a little bit of balance influence
here as well, superb, so remember we talked about when we're doing our abdominals, so this kind of
exercise, picture the abdominal muscles, the rectus like a spring, yeah, as you're sitting up try to
squeeze that spring together, get your mind into the muscle, yeah, and that'll help you with this
exercise, come on, don't worry I can give you a pull if you need, how are we doing at home,
if things are target, if you're finding that too easy remember what we said, you can always take a
quick rest, do another set, if you're feeling particularly strong you could always do three
sets but that gives us something to aim for, brilliant, make sure you're breathing, excellent,
be pleased to know there's only one exercise after this, you're doing really well,
yeah, fabulous, well done, good little work for the abs hopefully you've felt that, okay so our
last exercise, just take a rest for a second guys, is the turkey stand up, so and the aim here is
simply to stand up, that's it, so what I want you to do is take one hand, doesn't matter which hand
because you're going to swap over after seven repetitions and point to the ceiling, the aim is
to stand up ideally without using the other hand, so what I'm going to do is lay myself down,
point one hand straight to the ceiling, this hand stays pointing to the ceiling all the way through,
yeah, so I come up, stand up, keep it pointing to the ceiling and then guess what, do exactly the
same thing, keep it pointing to the ceiling on the way down, now if you find that a little bit
difficult you can use the other hand when you get to here to push yourself up but ideally what we're
aiming for is not using that other hand, let the abs do the sit-up, let the legs do the work, down
we go, you can pick whichever hand you like, your head at that end and your feet at this end,
point whichever hand you like to the ceiling because you're going to change after seven reps,
legs straight out to start with, okay are we set, let's go, legs in, keep the finger pointing to the
ceiling, both of you are cheating, I hope you're doing better than this at home, have we got the
receipt for these two, I might need to take them back, point to the ceiling, keep it pointing to
the ceiling and up we go and down, you see you're lucky you can't see their faces, they're pulling
faces at me here, come on up we go, up we go, excellent and down, how are we doing at home,
good up we go, up, up, up, good and back down, you can see why I only demonstrate the first two
and then don't do any more afterwards, come on up we go, how many is this, I should have brought a
book with me or something, up we go point to the ceiling, good, you're doing really well, that's
six already, crikey and only an hour or so gone, good, are you changing arms now, good well done,
well done, are we changing arms yet, I'd change the legs, use somebody else's if I were you,
you're doing really well, how are we doing at home, remember 15 is our target, it shouldn't feel
easy, if it feels easy there's no point in doing it, you're doing really well guys, it's easy for
me, I'm not actually doing anything, as you've probably noticed, good, you're doing well, I think
we've only got a few more to do, so the great thing about this is it's a whole body exercise,
you're using your arms on the first part of that movement, you've really got to use the legs and
remember when we talked about our core strength, about this thoracolumbar fascia, the sheath at the
back and the whole point of that is that's what helps transfer the strength from your upper to
your lower body, that's the link that gets your whole body working together and you're really
having to use that here, really having to brace yourself in that movement that gets you up and
down, are we done, fabulous work, how did you do at home, hopefully you did really well, what we're
going to do now is a little bit of a cool down with some gentle movements that get the joints
moving, just similar to how we did in the warm up, let your pulse rate come down a little bit,
let your temperature come down a little bit and then we're going to go into a few stretches,
so let's just get ourselves moving guys, just a few gentle mobilizing moves, you know the kind
of thing that we do for the warm up, remember if you're not sure on the stretches to use, we've
got that flexibility workout for you where you can go straight into that now and use those stretches,
don't forget how important progression is, so maybe we're looking at one set of 15 for each
exercise to start with, we could build that up to two sets and then three sets, now you can either
do that by doing three sets of each exercise then on to the next one, then on to the next one or
what you could do is the whole routine and then do the whole routine again, it's your choice,
but certainly to start with it's about quality not quantity, get the technique right, that's the most
important thing because these whole body movements are working really, really focusing on those poor
muscles and their vital, beauty of what we've just done, all of those movements are functional,
we use those movements every day, so this workout with no equipment is something that you can take
into your everyday activities, the benefit of that is it's going to really help to protect your lower
back from injury.
