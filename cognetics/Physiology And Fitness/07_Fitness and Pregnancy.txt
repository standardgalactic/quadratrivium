There's now a wealth of research around to support the theory that exercises of great
value both before and after giving birth, helping mums to be to reduce pregnancy symptoms,
control weight gain and to ease labour.
In addition to assisting the new parent in toning the stretched pelvic floor and abdominal
muscles, exercise can also help to realign her posture.
Now while some maintain that pregnancy is a good time to put your feet up, or at least
to significantly reduce the amount of exercise you do, others would point to marathon runner
Paula Radcliffe running 14 miles a day when she was expecting her second child.
As for postnatal exercise again, somewhat advised taking it really easy, yet Paula
won the New York marathon only 10 months after her first child was born.
So what's myth and what's old wives tell when it comes to exercise at this critical
time of life?
The truth is that it's very much down to the individual and even to the specific pregnancy
as symptoms can vary from a woman from one pregnancy to the next.
Overall however, a review of pregnancy studies in clinical obstetrics and gynecology in 2008
show that the evidence suggests a benefit of exercising pregnancy.
Exercise in pregnancy could prevent and limit adverse maternal and fetal morbidities and
provide a long term benefit to a reduction of maternal weight gain during pregnancy and
an improvement in cardiovascular fitness.
The aim of this presentation then is to help you to sort the wheat from the chaff and to
enable you to make the right decisions as to whether exercise will be of benefit and
if so, what type and how much.
In order to draw the right conclusions, we'll take a look at the changes a woman's body
goes through together with how exercise affects such.
You'll probably be quite surprised at some of the facts we'll uncover along the way.
So let's begin by understanding how pregnancy might affect the body during exercise, starting
with the key area, the pelvis made up of the two hip bones and the sacrum between conveniently
forming a basin for the growing baby to sit in.
The female pelvis differs from the male in that the symphysis pubis, the point where
it meets at the bottom is wider to allow for passage of the baby during childbirth and interestingly
this is a factor in how forensic scientists are able to ascertain whether a skeleton
belonged to a male or a female.
Such a marvellous design is the female pelvis that the sacrum and coccyx are curved to direct
the baby towards the exit.
Next the abdominal muscles that in order to accommodate the growing baby are forced to
stretch which leads to the linear elbow, the tenderness line in the middle separating.
So care needs to be taken not to put undue stress on this area particularly as the muscles
will be weakened.
So exercises that require strong contractions for example sit-ups are not advised at this
time as this could exacerbate the separation and also lead to doming.
Now static abdominal contractions however are favoured as maintaining some tone in the
abdominal muscles will help the healing process after birth, reducing the risk of separation
and this is known as diastasis and also giving the appearance of a bigger tummy.
Now the spine is affected by the posture change due simply to the weight of the baby at the
front causing the backward lean, so exaggerating that lumbar curve and causing the pelvis
to tilt.
The pelvic floor muscles are in layers and like other muscles have an elastic property
so during pregnancy these become stretched due to supporting the weight of the baby and
can cause a partial reduction in their functional ability sometimes resulting in stress incontinence
whereby you're in leaks when running or even just coughing.
Now to allow the pelvis to expand during pregnancy the body produces the relaxing hormone that
has the effect of loosening the ligaments particularly in the sacroiliac joints where
the three pelvis bones meet at the rear.
In addition the ligaments around the symphysis pubis at the front also relax and these two
combined actions leading to a degree of instability in the pelvis can be a concern.
Relaxing levels peak in the third trimester and gradually diminish after the birth.
The changes that occur to the cardiovascular system include an increase of around 30% in
blood volume but this is mostly plasma and so the concentration of red blood cells is
actually reduced sometimes leading to feelings of fatigue.
As a response the heart increases its workload to ensure enough oxygen is transported around
the body so although blood pressure doesn't normally increase due to the progesterone
hormone the walls of the blood vessels stretch to accommodate.
Now surprisingly the respiratory system is also affected due to the size of the baby
in the third trimester pushing up on the diaphragm so reducing chest volume although this is
subconsciously compensated for as the tidal volume the amount we breathe in and out regularly
increases by around 40%.
Now since breathing changes are automatic in the mother-to-be specific breathing exercises
at this time are actually of little benefit.
A key consideration for exercise is the risk of supine hypertensive syndrome now that's
when lying on the back can result in the weight of the baby resting on the main blood vessels
causing them to pinch and that could temporarily restrict the blood supply flowing back up
to the heart and so in turn the supply to the mother and baby as a whole.
So the arguments for specific exercise during pregnancy are as follows.
Firstly to gain relief from the typical pregnancy symptoms we can reduce the risk of varicose
veins controlling excess weight gain as we spoke about earlier helping to ease the actual
birth and ensuring a speedier postnatal recovery.
However exercise during pregnancy needs to be modified in light of the body changes we
just mentioned so here are some basic recommendations.
Our target will be two to three times per week and if you're not already a regular
exerciser then you should stick to low intensity.
Drink plenty of water that's vital movements should always be smooth and never ballistic
never jerky avoid lying down exercises as we just said after 20 weeks and focus on constant
relaxed breathing it's important also because of that effect of relaxing to limit the range
of motion.
As you'll most certainly be aware pregnancy is recognised as comprising three periods
each of three months characterised by the changes that occur to the body at these times.
Since specific exercise advice will vary for these three periods let's take a moment to
consider what the mother to be is likely to be experiencing.
Fatigue and nausea are common symptoms in the first trimester and emotions may swing
from joy to excitement to even apprehension.
It's likely the mother will be comfortable and able to continue at her current level
of exercise but it's important to listen to the body and rest if necessary particularly
as miscarriage is most common towards the end of this first trimester this first period.
However exercise is not thought to be the cause of miscarriage unless it's extreme in
fact the American pregnancy association suggests that maintaining a healthy lifestyle will
reduce the risk and specifically recommends including exercise.
So let's move on to the second trimester during the second trimester the blood volume
weight and relaxing levels begin to increase and the first signs of the tummy expanding
can be seen often the sick feeling subsides to be replaced by renewed energy although
not for everyone as occasionally sickness can continue through the full term.
As we move to the third trimester symptoms are perhaps breathlessness, posture and balance
issues can arise plus possible joint instability again caused by this higher level of relaxing.
Individual variations are manifested by weight gain being anywhere from one to two stones
or roughly between 15 to 30 pounds and also whether the baby is carried high or low in
the abdomen.
Now whereas the primary aims of antinatal exercise are to prepare for birth the postpartum period
focuses on a return to functional and psychological health as follows we'll look to realign the
posture to strengthen the abdominal muscles to tone the pelvic floor and to improve body
confidence but let's now break down the components of an exercise session and investigate the
implications of pregnancy as they relate to the warm-up cardio muscle toning and flexibility
sessions first let's think about the warm-up the heart rate is elevated due to the extra
load on the cardiovascular system caused by the increased blood volume so exercise should
begin very gently and remain at a low intensity which will also help to reduce risks associated
with the joint stability issues the center of gravity change makes speed of movement
and direction changes more difficult so again a gradual build-up is required generally body
temperature will already be raised so this part of the class the warm-up can usually
be a little shorter than you would normally allow the cardio section needs to be simple
as proprioception ability which is the body's ability to know where it is in space can be
reduced and so agility challenges should be avoided particularly later in the pregnancy
since the heart rate is already higher than usual the workload here will need to be lower
than a normal workout to achieve a training effect also the workout needs to remain below
the anaerobic threshold whether lactic acid builds up when we start to fatigue as this
can be an issue for the growing baby at this point in the workout the mother to be will
be grateful for a supportive bra in light of the obvious breast growth energy levels can
be a problem so regular small portions of complex carbohydrates are recommended now
although cardio exercise can remain as is for the first trimester restricting to low
impact from the second trimester onwards will reduce the stress on the pelvic floor and
those unstable joints particularly in the pelvis we talked about exercise impulse really
shouldn't exceed 70% of your maximum working heart rate which we calculate by subtracting
your age from the number 220 with a maximum of 20 minutes being the recommended limit
in the early postnatal period certainly now cardio is valuable to help reduce weight but
it should be very gentle and again low impact muscle toning exercises need to incorporate
a focus on correct posture due to the potential instability and isometric options where there's
no movement like for instance a ski sit where we're holding the position should really be
avoided as this can lead to blood pressure increases now due to supine hypertensive syndrome
we mentioned earlier exercises that require the mother to lie flat on her back is certainly
not recommended from around 20 weeks onwards once the baby starts to show in the tummy
usual abdominal exercises are not ideal as they put stress on the muscles that are already
being stretched and weakened plus they may exacerbate the diastasis we talked about earlier
or separation of the fibrous tissue that runs down the middle clearly the presence of high
relaxing levels implies extra care will need to be taken on the flexibility part of the
workout if you push the stretches too far during pregnancy or early in the postpartum
period the ligaments may be caused to slacken and this could remain after birth lean to
unstable joints it's worth mentioning that this is more of an issue during additional
second third pregnancies some stretches can be hindered by developing babies and the increased
body fat so experimenting with different positions to find comfortable options is required so when
we're planning exercise during pregnancy it's worth being aware of extrinsic factors that
can influence the mothers to these efforts and the likelihood of adhering to a routine and to
recognize that benefits can be derived in more than purely physical dimension some women greatly
enjoy being pregnant and outwardly a periodient whilst others struggle with the responsibility
and even feel the baby could have a negative impact on their lifestyle for this latter group
it's important to realize that the endorphin release from exercise will help to lift moods so
it should be encouraged the tight-bitting workout gear normally worn for exercise is really not
going to look too favorable once weight begins to increase so investing in loose attire is is a
wise choice for the mother to be something that feels comfortable when we're exercising now some
people wrongly believe that exercise should be avoided during pregnancy so it's important to
hook on to family and friends who offer encouragement when when we're going through this this period
morning sickness other children and work can all present barriers to exercise so it's important to
plan some me time to ensure it doesn't regularly get squeezed out of your daily routine as to be a
benefit it needs to be frequent and it needs to be often now psychological aspects commonly
affected by pregnancy can include anxiety even forgetfulness even feelings of isolation so
things like crosswords Sudoku adult learning are all great ways to occupy the mind and also create
a positive distraction and help to improve that mental fitness now we've already established
that correct exercise technique is vitally important due to the many changes that take
place within the body so let's now consider a few specific issues squats may need to be restricted
so the heels always remain in contact with the floor stability is important so you should
evenly spread the weight rather than favor one leg as this can cause stress to the sacroiliac joint
to protect the lower back side bends should be supported so put the hand on top of the thigh
lift the other hand up and we bend sideways so the hand on the thigh supports the weight
lifting the leg should be done with a focus on keeping the pelvis centered try to avoid side
shift this can cause problems for the synthesis pubis
standing and sitting exercises should be done with the knees bent a straight
legs can cause the hamstrings to pull the pelvis into a tilt that stresses the lumbar spine
abdominal exercises should include just pelvic tilt lying on your back
tilting the pelvis upwards and back down and also rolling on to the side supporting your
weight with your elbows and knees and what we call a hip hitch simply lifting the hip away
from the floor and back down try not to twist make sure you're just lifting up and back down
your abdominals now for any exercise program to be effective it has to adhere to well proven
principles so to design a plan we need to know how these apply during pregnancy and immediately
postpartum the platform of all exercise is the concept of overload defined as stressing the body
systems more than they are used to dealing with and repeatedly doing this leads to the
body adapting and improving its ability to accommodate the extra intensity now clearly
this principle needs to be applied very carefully to the mother to be to avoid excessive fatigue
so rather than seeking to greatly improve fitness levels we should be looking to apply gentle overload
here in general then it should feel as though you've done some work after an exercise session
rather than feeling that it's so easy it doesn't elicit a training effect
frequency can be a tricky one because some others to be will feel they can manage exercise every day
whilst others may not feel so chipper and so struggle to meet the minimum requirements of
two times each week so a sensible target is to aim to get sweaty every alternate day
now intensity is usually measured by your heart rate but as we mentioned earlier this can be
already elevated to begin with so it's best to listen to the body particularly as exercise will
feel easier on Sundays than on others and perhaps with no logical reason why so a rough guide to
the level is where your breathing rate increases but it's still possible to talk something we call
the talk test so you'll be aiming for around sort of six or seven out of ten on this and the duration
of exercise is really very much down to the individual and the energy levels on the day because
although anti-natal group exercise class is usually around 45 minutes long comprising the warm-up
cardio strength flexibility the elements we talked about earlier you will feel different on different
days and a good class will also see the instructor giving participants opportunities to rest
when required now the actual mode of exercise is very much down to personal preference but
as the weight of the baby increases aqua becomes more appealing as the water's buoyancy takes
stress from the pelvic floor and joints including the lower back and makes reduced impact jogging
possible whilst the resistance from the water provides a toning effect on the muscles
on terra firma brisk walking and yoga are great options the latter helping to increase stability
in the joints and to teach breathing techniques that might prove to be useful during labor
however a number of yoga poses need to be avoided or adapted so we need to avoid deep
back bending such as the the full wheel pose avoid any breath exercises or pranayama that require
rapid inhalation and exhalation and we need to be aware of twisting gently
from the shoulders rather than doing deep twists and these deep twists can compress the internal
organs and that includes the uterus abdominal and back strengtheners such as the boat pose and
cobra should also be avoided since obviously they will rely on a little press on the abdomen
so likewise we should avoid inverted postures as they can restrict blood flow to the uterus due
to gravity and place excessive pressure on the the placenta and increase the risk that the umbilical
cord could wrap around the baby's neck so make sure you stay away also from heated yoga bicarbon
yoga is not a good exercise at this time your body temperature is already up so stick to the format
and poses that are gentle and don't require any pressure or or any exertion now the final
the final fitness principle to consider is reversibility in other words the the fact that
fitness levels decline muscles weaken and join stiffen if we uh if we don't do regular exercise
something we've come across before in other lectures in this series
now this is a strong reason for continuing to exercise throughout the full term otherwise you
know as as much as nine months could go by without any exercise you know imagine what's
going to happen there now in our final section I want to take a look at following the natural
chronology here let's take a look at postnatal exercise in just a little bit more detail um
and our starting point the general rule of thumb that exercise shouldn't begin until after the
customary six-week examination where many of the changes that occurred have already begun to revert
back towards the pre-pregnant status and those kind of changes I'm talking about the levels of
relaxing will have now reduced by the six-week point and so we can begin work on stability
exercises and maybe using free weight exercises rather than machines as an example
and some caution should be kept in mind here though as it will take months for the relaxing to
completely leave the system and so as in the pre-birth period it's important to concentrate
really on your technique now following the baby's departure the mother's center of gravity will
begin to shift back towards the normal it'll take time to relearn where is the neutral spine
as this should be held static when exercising and picking things up like carrying the baby
so by that neutral spine what we're referring to there is the comfortable position with the natural
little curve in your lumbar spine and that'll differ from one person to another but that'll
gradually come back we can re-educate ourselves now often weight loss will occur naturally taking
anywhere between three and twelve months but not always and so cardio is vital to encourage this
process at this stage again we're talking low impact exercise that's the order of the day low
impact aerobics or brisk walking are really possibly the best options there and since the
abdominal wall can be stretched as much as a staggering eight inches in length and even
more incredibly 20 inches in width it's important to begin toning them as soon as possible so
isometric or static contractions are the starting point i.e. there's no movement so
supine lying position on all fours perhaps provide opportunities to do this
now only after some kind of mild tone as return should we begin to get on to isotonic
exercises or movement in other words on to sit-ups crunches that kind of exercise
this should be introduced once we've got that little bit of muscle tone back so this will also
allow time for the diastasis to repair which could take place within days but you know usually
will take weeks so hence this six-week threshold that we've mentioned a couple of times now
now in the special case of a caesarean section all exercise should be avoided until after the 12-week
checkup now provided there are no remaining issues gradual toning for the abdominal muscles can be
introduced and also the idea of working with a flattened stomach the idea of always pulling in
before we do anything now the pelvic floor muscles clearly they've been stretched they're
going to need some time to heal and so with the abdominals static toning exercises should be
gradually introduced after the six-week period so these allow us to establish some fairly solid
guidelines for postnatal exercise as follows we should always begin gently increasing the
intensity and frequency only gradually and take time to listen to your body too much exercise too
soon can cause fatigue can risk injury and even inhibit lactation now don't push stretch positions
too far just a mild tension and hold for only 15 seconds try to schedule exercise for times
after feeding rather than before it'll actually feel a little bit more comfortable if you do it
that way now we're going to aim for a slightly higher target here we're looking for three to four
sessions per week building incrementally up to 20 minutes duration if we can but don't be disheartened
by stories of elite sports women returning to training after just two weeks in some cases remember
they would have probably been in peak condition at the start of the pregnancy so we'll retain
much of this through the term and then into their postnatal period also their biomechanics will
have been finely honed so the daily tasks during pregnancy will probably have caused less stress
on the joints than compared to the average woman so to conclude however most of us are not elite
athletes but now you have the guidelines and some examples of exercises that can help to make pregnancy
a little more comfortable and also ensure a speedier return to fitness after birth
with the advent of mother and baby walking and swimming sessions it shouldn't be long before
the baby's active lifestyle also begins
