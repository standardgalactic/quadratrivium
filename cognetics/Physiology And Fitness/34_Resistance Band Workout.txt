Now you may have heard of pumping iron but today we're going to be pumping rubber.
We're doing resistance band workout which is absolutely perfect for the home environment.
Now I've got two tools here you can have a look at.
You may have seen resistance bands you may even have one already without handles which
are great although sometimes wrapping them around the hand for some of the exercises
can get a little bit uncomfortable so I prefer and we're going to use today the ones with
handles so nothing wrong with it but no thanks not today.
So first of all important to think about the tool we're using the great thing about resistance
bands they're variable in terms of you can get different thicknesses so you'll get a
different resistance when you're doing the exercises they're so portable you can take
them anywhere.
I actually take one whenever I go on holiday just in case there's not a gym and look how
much space they take up hardly anything you can keep them in a drawer somewhere and like
I say they'll fit easily into your suitcase.
Now what I'm going to show you today a whole range of exercises so versatile always as you
know by now with any of our warm ups it's important to warm up aerobic type movements
that involve large muscle groups like the guys are doing now a little bit of rotation
through your lower spine some wrist arm shoulder circles all those kind of things.
Our actual workout we're going to do today you're going to do with me one set of 15 repetitions.
Now if you're already exercising a little bit you might want to take that to two sets
of each exercise those of you more advanced might want to take that to three sets of each
exercise.
So what I'm going to do here is take a journey around the body I'm starting with the legs
and show you how many different exercises we can do so one set of 15 repetitions on
every exercise are you ready to go.
So let's first of all take the band and be careful how you do this step on to the band
with your feet about hip width apart okay first exercise we're going to do is a squat
so you're going to bend the knees just a little bit take the lock off the knees we're going
to take the band up hold it by the side they're ready to go okay abdominals are in tight we're
going to sit down for our squat press into the heels and then press up that's all I'm
going to ask you to do let's go guys 15 repetitions in your own time keep going the important thing
is here make sure we're keeping your abdominals in tight so that we're not sticking the backside
out too far so that we're not getting too much of an arch in the lower spine keep the
abdominals in tight as we come up keep your chest lifted and keep your head up now how
far do we go down we're looking for as far as is comfortable yeah some of us will have
different range of motion through the knees but importantly we need to keep those heels
down look how Frank's pressing into the heels there keeping the chest lifted and we're working
against that resistance in the band as we press up a little bit of work here for the
front of the thighs for the back of the thighs also getting into the glutes as well okay so
we're moving on now let's again stick with the legs but let's change this to the lunge so if
we can get your right leg forwards for this one the left leg back but make sure it's slightly out
to the side to help you with your balance the feet are on tram lines rather than on a tight
rope and the same feeling lift the band up okay so get a good distance back on that leg for our
lunge keeping your hips chest shoulders square to the screen I'm going to ask you to take your
knee down to the floor and then press back up again away we go we're after our 15 repetitions please
slow as better with these exercises I want to make sure that it's under control okay beautiful now
look here I am as keeping her abdominals pulled in tight nice long spine nice and slowly dropping
the knee down and be careful not to twist the rear foot see how it stays facing the front
on the ball of the foot if we get that twist that's really not good for the knee how are you doing
make sure you're doing 15 repetitions I'm going to trust you to count 15 repetitions slower is
better it's all about technique hopefully you're beginning to feel this now in the front of the
thigh in the back of the thigh maybe also getting into the glutes if you're breathing nice and
relax when you've done your 15 repetitions you're going to swap over legs so put one foot on and
be careful how you do that transition we don't want the band suddenly springing up and pinging you
set yourself up the hands come up to shoulder level remember you've got the other foot behind
this time abs in tight let's go for our 15 repetitions on those lunges please beautiful now
let's use our mind in muscle here try to focus on the muscles that are doing the work so try to
think about the front of the thigh the quadriceps think about the hamstrings at the back think about
the glutes at all times we're working off core strength keeping the abdominals pulled in tight
you're working against that resistance on the band as you lift up on that lunge how you're
doing keep going keep your breathing relaxed and constant 15 repetitions please really getting
into toning those legs head up sure you've got it under control all the time and when you're done
we're going to take the feet again about hip width resting the hands down by the side so we're
going to move on now let's really get into a target area into the hips and really get into
working the side of the buttocks here so what we're going to do is sink the knees down slightly
we're going to work on to your left leg first of all all I'm going to ask you to do is keep your
abs in tight you might get a slight lean but try not to lean too much I'm lifting out to the side
working against the resistance so let's go with your left leg first of all lift out to this side
working against that resistance keeping the hands there beautiful how are you doing I'm looking
for 15 repetitions on that left leg okay this is our hip abduction lifting it out to the side
beautiful try not to lean too much if you can make sure the work is coming from working through
we're actually working through the gluteus medius here really getting into the smaller buttock
muscle but you'll also be feeling this a little bit down the outside of the leg but also the
great thing about this doing these kind of exercises standing rather than lying down is you're
really getting into the supporting leg as well because on the other side of the hip you've got
to work to support this this whole structure to keep this balance so actually getting twice as much
work once you've done one leg set yourself and we go over to the other side now again this is only
going to be possible if you're keeping your abdominals in tight staying up tall so you might get a
slight lean like Frank's doing there but try not to lean too much make sure most of that work is
coming from lifting that leg out to the side and this is what I talked about right at the top
when we talked about variable resistance because now the further you lift the leg the more the
band is stretching the more resistance it will give you so the harder it will be but that's for
you to work with and again as I said if you find that particularly if you start to progress and
get a little stronger as you find that it becomes a little easy you'll need to get a thicker band
then to work with fabulous just 15 repetitions guys and then we're going to change on to a plie so
this time we're going to step out much wider we're also going to point the toes out slightly and
the knees out yeah beautiful we're taking the band up get a hold of it okay so for our plies
when we sit down the knees follow the line of the toes now at this time we're putting a little bit
more work into the glutes but also now you just worked the hip abductors that lift the leg out
to the side we're now working into the hip adductors into the inner thigh okay I'm looking for 15
repetitions working into the inner thigh now okay important things here keep the abdominals in tight
keep going for me guys what I don't want is the backside sticking out when you go down so keep
the abs in tight see how the knees are going out to follow the line of the toes yeah toes are
pointing slightly out knees out and that'll put that work into the inner thighs yeah how we do
looking good looking good we're going to move on there your leg exercises we're moving on to the
back now for this one what we need to do is have a little bit of slack in the middle so we're
stepping down nearer to the handles on this one yeah the abs are in really tight the knees are bent
you're going to lean forward so for this I really need you to get a nice long position but your abs
are in tight your hips are fixed because we're going to row backwards lifting those elbows up to the
ceiling let's go team elbows to the ceiling look how your position doesn't change don't raise up
with it stay bent over it's a bent over row so those elbows have to go up to the ceiling up they
go 15 repetitions please now we're really working into the lats here getting into the upper back
we're also getting a little bit of work for the biceps so think about those muscles doing the work
you're squeezing your shoulder blades together on this exercise as well also working those core
muscles you'll feel a little bit of strength because isometrically we've got to work the
legs to hold your position yeah how we doing excellent stuff now just changing that slightly
we can make that a little bit more difficult and rather than working through the lats at the back
of the armpit we can shift into the rhomboids in between the shoulder blades and these are great
for helping to improve your posture so this time what we're going to do is just put one foot on you
can pick a foot whichever foot on the band again both knees are bent the other foot behind for a
little bit of balance again we need to be in this bent over position so that we can work against
gravity so leaning forwards but keeping the abdominals in tight this time we're lifting
with the arms now you've got a choice we can do it slightly easier and keep the elbows bent as Emma's
doing or taking the arms further out like Frank's doing is a little tougher so let's go for those
15 repetitions you could go with elbows bent or you could go with the arms nearly straight
but your focus here is on squeezing your shoulder blades together yeah you're really trying to get
that feeling of squeezing the shoulder blades together as we row backwards yeah that's your
focus make sure you're bent over but the abdominals are in tight to hold that position and protect
your lower back so a good bit of core training there but really focusing on seeing those shoulder
blades squeezed together feeling that in the upper back great exercise for your posture
lifting the arms up for the elbows up to the ceiling whichever 15 repetitions is all I'm
asking you to do you can do this brilliant well done well done okay so shall we move on we're
moving on to a pull down now feet about hip width apart and you'll have seen this the lap pull down
machine at the gym I'm going to ask you to fold it in half take a hold of the ends like so yeah
the knees are slightly bent the abdominals are in tight you're going to lift it up just
above your head now the aim here is you're going to draw it down just behind the neck but at the
same time you're going to pull it out to the side yeah so we're dropping it down and pulling
it out at the same time and again that's going to get into the lats at the back here 15 repetitions
please guys let's go down we go abdominals in tight don't let it pull you into that arched
position and again you'll find that knees slightly bent at least taking the lock off will help you
with this keep your breathing nice and relaxed don't let it ping back yeah work against the
resistance on the way back up you're in control in every sense beautiful and there's a little bit
of work there into the lower part of the trapezius at the back as well take a little look at it so
you can see what we're doing down it goes and back up working into the upper back and back up
just our 15 repetitions how are we doing excellent oh you can see that one working
and that will cover you for the back we're going to move on now to chest
so for the chest press we're going to take it around we're going to do a little a little
chest fly actually now the problem here for this movement is it's a little bit slack yeah
so what we're going to do is have a little wrap around the hands
yeah let's shorten the band slightly for this one okay so we're out to the side the arms are almost
straight not quite at chest level we're squeezing in and back out yeah if the band's still feeling
too light we could always wrap it around again and away you go we're looking for our 15 repetitions
really working into the pexy the feeling here is squeezing the chest together yeah the chest
muscle attaches from here into that bicipital groove it's called here so it's drawing the arm in
keeping the arms slightly bent let's not work the arms when we're doing this let's really focus
remember our mind and muscle concentrate on the chest that's what's doing the work abdominals are
tight your knees are slightly bent to give you a good balance the position fabulous how you're
doing at home i hope you're still with me oh i can feel that good work good work good work
we're going to move on to your shoulders going to move on to uh first of all electoral raise
i'm just going to put one foot on it again you can pick which foot i don't mind
but make sure always that when you're putting one foot on it you've got it stable we don't
want it pinging out so the other foot behind make sure the knees are slightly bent for your balance
we're really going to target the uh middle part of the deltoid the shoulder muscle here
we're lifting up to the side but this time be careful to keep your elbows slightly bent
locking out the elbows is not good okay so we're lifting up to just above shoulder level
and then back down 15 of those please keep your abs in tight and be careful again not to arch your
back as we get up there make sure all the work is coming into the middle part of your deltoid
slow is better particularly on the way down let's work against the naturally elasticity of the band
15 repetitions please fabulous see how the body position stays fixed on Emma here it's just the
arms doing the work and you've got that choice if you start to fatigue you can bend your arms a little
more you're feeling strong like frank is today we're keeping the arms almost straight as we lift up
need a little bit of tension in the wrist as well really working into those deltoids keeping your
head up keeping your abs in tight nothing else moves brilliant exercise well done well done
keeping one foot on we're going to change that into the shoulder press now it's time we're bringing
it up this is a little bit tougher so you might want to just bend the knees slightly get yourself
down a little okay again abdominals are in tight when you press up make sure the hands are slightly
in front not behind because that's really uncomfortable on the shoulders so when we press up
they go slightly forwards we don't lock out the elbows because that can put a lot of strain on the
tendons around the elbows some of you may already be familiar with tennis elbow so keeping the elbows
slightly bent we're pressing up again really getting into the shoulders you're getting into the
middle and also into the front part of the shoulder on this one as well excellent beautiful keeping
those abdominals in tight and you see with that knee bent position that helps you maintain your
stability it helps you to keep your hips fixed and your lower spine in the position it needs to be
so you can really focus on just the shoulders doing the work can we feel that in the shoulders guy
excellent was there a bit of shaking going on there got to say been a bit cruel we've given
frank the the thick band to work with today okay well done well done hope you did 15 repetitions
we're moving on to the front raise really going to get into the anterior part of the deltoid now
the shoulder muscle splits into three parts um and so this enables us to really get to all of them
so one foot on please one foot behind doesn't matter which foot it is as long as your balance
off front raise abdominals in tight lifting up to face level and back down now if you've got any
concerns about your lower back you might find it easier to do alternating sides here yeah if not
if we can really pull the tummy in tight pulling through the waist i'll have those 15 repetitions
like so please remember the arms again are slightly bent we don't want them straight but
lifting out to the front in that nice big semicircle movement up they go and again really work against
the resistance on the way back down yeah fabulous see how we fix in this position and that's because
we've got a nice bend on the knee here we're nice and stable feet are a little bit apart abdominals
are pulled in tight so we can really focus this is about isolating it to the target muscle we're
trying to get to yeah excellent stuff beautiful beautiful really working into those shoulders
keeping your head up that looks great gonna change it slightly we're moving on now to the
upright row so for this one i want both feet on we want to take a little bit more slack from the
band turn the palms to face you okay the knees are slightly bent as always abdominals in tight
the aim on this exercise is to lift your elbows up high yeah so can i get 15 of those please elbows
up and out try to keep your shoulders down so that we're not pinching into the neck yeah but the
work's coming from lifting the elbows up and out really getting into the deltoid and also the upper
part of the traps great exercise hopefully you can feel that abs are in tight whatever you do
don't hold your breath remember when we talked about in our muscle lecture we talked about
exhale on the exertion the idea of breathing out on the toughest part of the exercise so you'll
breathe out as you lift and in as you go back down good 15 of those will do me nicely we're
gonna move on we're moving on to the biceps we'll start with a bicep curl so fortunately we're in
the same position now this is what i'm gonna do the biceps and you may remember we looked at this
when we looked at the muscle movement the biceps as well as flexing at the elbow there
are also responsible for twisting this way and twisting this way so we need to add a bit of
a twist to get the best for the bicep so we'll start with the palms facing into your side
and then as you lift up you're going to turn the palms this way in towards you yeah so let's go
a half 15 of those get that little twist on the biceps when they come down they turn in when
they come up turn that little pinky towards you yeah 15 of those please absolutely vital not to lean
back we're not cheating we don't want to put any strain on the lower back keep the abs in tight the
only thing that's moving the arms where we go beautiful check out those biceps did you bring
those with you or you just got those now doing this excellent stuff keeping your elbows fixed to
your side what we don't want is any swinging of the arm so keep that elbow fixed to the side
as we lift up brilliant biceps to go needs a slightly bent to give you that stability
abdominals are in tight you'll notice how important the core muscles are working them
all the time there fabulous fabulous now we're going to move on slightly to a concentration
kill so for this one we're going to put the band down and step really close to one handle there
now for this i'm going to take one foot back i'm going to keep my abs in tight and i'm going to
lean down onto this leg support your weight because what we're doing here is lifting across to the
opposite shoulder yeah across to your opposite shoulder can we see how that's getting into the
bicep 15 of those please give your abs in tight lean the hand onto the knee to support your weight
squeeze it across that's our concentration curl beautiful see how we're not swinging here
yeah this is staying fixed remember when we talked about how the muscles work we talk about
fixator muscles this is fixed in place so that the bicep can do its work yeah now even though
we're bent over and supporting ourselves here we still need to keep the abdominals in tight
and you'll see how the body's fixed there's no twisting going on here yeah really good isolation
movement see how this elbow is not moving it stays where it is and we can see the work into
the biceps 15 off this arm and we'll swap over to your right arm as well i mean just in your
biceps i think i better do something to be honest i'm going to join in on this one okay set your
position and let's go squeeze it up fabulous giving your breathing relaxed making sure there's
no twisting through the spine supporting your weight with the other hand your head will drop
forward so that you've got a nice relaxed neck try not to be in this position if you can beautiful
the elbows not moving the shoulders working to fix that position that's the fixator
how you're doing i'm after 15 reps i've done about 35 now already i'm sure
and when you're done we'll take a quick rest there now remember we talked about the muscles
working in in opposing groups so we've worked our biceps there so what we're going to do now
is work into the triceps so with the tricep extension you're just going to take one hand
let's take it in the left hand you're going to take it round behind you what's going to happen
then is you're going to use the other hand to grab the band and then pull it down so that you've
got some really good tension on the band already knees are slightly bent abs are pulled in tight
because the exercise now is can we press up to the ceiling and back down yeah so you need a really
good pull down with your right hand so that you've got some tension in the band as we work into the
triceps so we're working into the back of the arms here but see how i've pulled down on the band
to give me that tension to work against yeah don't be kind be tough on yourself the more you pull
down the tougher it is the better it will be remember what we're looking for is to achieve
that muscular fatigue by the 15th repetition if it feels too easy you won't get that overload
and it won't be doing you any good yeah 15 reps then let's swap over to the other arm please again
look how important the fixator muscles are abs pulled in tight so nothing else is moving the
the knees are slightly soft to give you that better stability yeah try not to push your head
forwards see how the guys are keeping the head in a relaxed position the neck in a comfortable
position pressing up on that tricep when you've done one side we'll swap over to the other side
remember take the hand behind the head get a hold of the band pull the band down first of all
and then away we go pressing up and that little extension try not to lock out your arm at the top
just press it up give it a little bit softer at the top working into the triceps into the back
of the arm fabulous pressing up just the job excellent try not to rush it slow as better
muscular development relies on something called the time under tension the tut
principle so the slower it is the better it is for you because the more muscular fibers you'll
engage in the exercise and therefore you're more likely to get to that point at the end
where we get that momentary muscular fatigue the overload that then stimulates all those responses
we talked about in our muscle lecture that lead to the improvement in muscle tone fabulous exercise
well done well done we'll do another one for the tricep triceps a fairly important muscle group
so for this one really this is about working against your own resistance so we're going to
turn sideways on here so if we all turn our feet this way what's going to happen here is you're
hold it there by your hip and really let's drop one end so that you can see we're going to hold it
here quite tight and we're going to keep that position fixed so you're going to really sort of
put this arm against yourself there to splint it and then what we're going to do here is lift the
elbow the left elbow and point it behind because all you're going to do is press out and bring it
back so extend the arm behind so lift it up a little bit higher as it comes up beautiful
so again we're working those fixators fixing ourselves in position here but now this isolation
exercise remember we talked about isolation and compound exercises so those compound exercises
use a combination of muscle groups so like the squats remember I said we were using here and here
whereas this is an isolation exercise because we're really getting down to just this muscle here
there's not much else going on here yeah looking for those 15 repetitions great exercise yeah really
working into the back of the arm here and we'll swap it over to the other side so again remember
if you're in any bent over positions that puts a focus on the core muscles so keep the abs in
really tight take a hold of it there take a hold of it there the palms facing backwards
let your arm rest against your tummy there and all we're going to do is press back the elbow stays
high don't let the elbow drop down otherwise it becomes a rowing exercise and that's into your
back we want to isolate this to just the triceps at the back of the arm excellent stuff yeah see
how it's just that small move really targeting into here and you're keeping that elbow up high
all the time brilliant stuff that's it pressing back into the triceps abs are tight fix that position
try not to let yourself rotate through your lower spine make sure it's just the arm that's doing the
work it's a great exercise for the triceps real isolation one so even though we're only working
one muscle group here still a fairly taxing exercise I think you'll agree brilliant now
we're going to have to get a little bit creative here because the next couple of exercises to show
you how we can use the bands to work your abdominals so the best way to do this would be to take a
hold like so and to loop this around a door handle or around the bannister or something like that
now we just don't happen to have I'm going to take that from you a door handle or a bannister
and but we've got Frank who's looking very strong and fit and able today so Frank is going to be
our sorry door handle bannister that's the deal today so if I can take that and you're
going to take a hold of the handles for me okay you're going to take a hold of that end
both hands hold it strong so you're going to do this for me please
yeah okay so a little bit of work into the waist so you want to be there nice plie position get
yourself stable yeah abs are in tight knees are bent toes pointing slightly out the arms are almost
straight but not quite and then we're moving in that rotation around beautiful now I don't
know if you remember but in the muscle lecture we talked about the abdominals working
contralaterally so what's actually happening here is you're working the external obliques
on one side and the internal obliques on the other yeah away we go beautiful you're the perfect
door handle bannisterade whatever it is on this one excellent can we feel that working into your
abs beautiful a little bit of rotation really getting into really targeting those um oblique
muscles at the sides excellent
is that the thing yet you're doing really well slow is better brilliant so you just need to make
sure that this end is fixed that's all we need to do now don't move so on the same side what we're
going to do here is to just make that a little bit more of a challenge by including rotation but
also remember the abdominals at the front bring in this flexion so what I'm going to do now is
actually to lift it up a little bit so what you're going to do is the same position facing the front
but this time when you bring it across you're looking to chop down so we're still rotating
but now we're adding a little bit of flexion into it as well fabulous so you see how we're going from
a high down to a low so still the rotation but now what's happening is as well as turning here
we're now pulling down adding that little bit of flexion as well so making it just a little bit
tougher on this side brilliant exercise the knees are staying bent now you will get a little bit of
movement through the legs on this one but that's okay I'm after 15 repetitions again slower is better
and again think about that mind and muscle really focus on what's going on here yeah let's not think
about the arms this is not an arm exercise they're just there for show this is really coming from here
abdominals here through the obliques at the waist drawing down excellent stuff
looking good looking good looking good beautiful should we swap sides so if you can go that side
you can go that side and I'll go back here and away we go again so exactly the same thing on the
other side you know what you're doing now fix that one end get ready to go knees bent and away we go
beautiful keeping your breathing relaxed keeping your head up fabulous make sure this end is fixed
make sure you stabilize yourself with a wide base
looking at getting that little bit of rotation through the lower spine beautiful
keep the tension on the band make sure you stand far enough away so that you've got a
little bit of tension on the band all the time beautiful I should feel a little bit tougher
remember the arms are only slightly bent all the way through don't be pushing with the arms this is
not an exercise for the arms this is all about rotating through the middle yeah I'm going to
take it that we've done 15 there and we're going to lift it a little bit higher and this time you're
doing the same thing but taking it down slightly so remember this time there might be a little bit
of movement through the legs that's okay as long as we're focusing on the rotation and that little
bit of flexion as we take it down to the side there let the waist do the work not the arms
keep your breathing nice and relaxed fabulous make sure that it's fixed and it's stable at that end
and this is called the chop for obvious reasons feel as though we're going from high to low
in that chopping motion 15 repetitions slow as better brilliant star
are we there yet I wish I could count brilliant star excellent super take a little rest there
we can drop that back so what we're going to do now is going to our cool down which we'll do similar
to our warm-up a few mobilizing exercises guys just as we did for the warm-up moving through
those large muscle groups and some rotations some knee lifts heels to the backside a few of
those mobilizing movements and then we're going to stretch for the major muscle groups if you know
how to do that from the other workouts then away you go if not remember we've got that flexibility
workout for you so perhaps you can pop that on and do it now instead
