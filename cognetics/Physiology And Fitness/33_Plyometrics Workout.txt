Welcome to our plyometric workout.
Now also known as jump training, plyometrics involve stretching the muscles prior to contracting
them.
This type of training when used safely and effectively strengthens muscles and decreases
impact forces on the joints.
Plyometrics mimic the motions used in sports such as skiing, tennis and also volleyball.
If you enjoy dodging moguls or chasing down ground strokes or charging the net, plyometrics
might be an appropriate training option as these exercises are designed to increase muscular
power and also your explosiveness.
However, because this type of training is so intensive, it results in a considerable
calorie expenditure so it's really valuable in weight management and not purely for the
elite sports person.
Now the Eastern Europeans first used plyometrics in the early 70s to develop greater strength
than power in their Olympic athletes and based their programs on scientific evidence that
stretching a muscle prior to contracting it recruits the stretch reflex of the muscle
to enhance the power of the second jump and you may remember us talking about the stretch
reflex in our flexibility lecture.
This pre-stretching of the muscles occurs when you perform jumps one after the other.
For example, when you land from a jump, what will happen is the quadricep muscle at the
front of the thigh will begin to stretch as the knee bends and then it will quickly contract
into the next leap and it's this pre-stretch that enhances the power of that second jump.
Now plyometrics is a very beneficial training practice for those trying to increase their
explosiveness but it isn't something you really want to do every work at, it's quite
intense so your body is going to need some time to recover but having said that if you
incorporate this perhaps one day a week into your training regime it will add variety and
also give an intensity boost that will improve the effects of your routine.
Now a safe and effective plyometric program stresses quality not quantity of jump so safe
landing and I'll keep reminding you of this safe landing techniques such as landing from
your toe down to your heel from a vertical jump and using the entire foot as a rocker
to dissipate the landing force over a greater surface area is a really important technique
because we want to reduce those impact forces so I'll remind you of that as we go along
but also using visualization techniques try to imagine yourself landing as light as a
feather and then think of recoiling like a spring after the impact to promote a low
impact landing in that next jump.
Also when you're landing try to avoid excessive side to side movement even when we're actually
performing lateral movements.
Landing forces can be absorbed through the knee musculature which is the prodiceps at
the front, the hamstrings at the back, the gastronemius just below.
Now these work more effectively when the knees bending primarily in the one plane of motion
that's designed to bend being a hinge joint.
In addition to jumping base drills used to develop power in the legs we can also use
these explosive exercises to target the upper body so we'll have a look at that as well
in this routine you're about to do with me.
Now since correct execution of these exercises requires and therefore promotes good core
strength our plyometric workout gives you a good two for the price of one deal.
So what I'm offering you here is a modified version it's a rather advanced sports training
techniques so it's vital to understand what, when, where and why associated with it.
So for that reason here are a few important guidelines.
Unlike traditional toning exercises, body sculpting exercises the focus there will be
on slow controlled isolated movements not so in plyometrics really we focus on being
explosive full body movements that are great for burning huge amounts of calories as well
as toning the major muscle groups in the body and also helping to improve that core strength.
You have a choice today what I'm going to ask you to do is 30 seconds on 30 seconds off
if you're beginning you might want to do 12 repetitions and then your 30 seconds rest
see how we go we're going to do two sets of every exercise but I'll tell you a little
more about that when we get started.
Now remember their explosive movements but they end in cushioned landings so therefore
you've got to concentrate on the whole exercise not just the pushing off phase but also particularly
the recoil.
Always like the guys are doing now you need to warm up first some gentle movements to
mobilize the joints to get your body temperature up a little bit that's what we're doing here
and marching on the spot building up to a jog knee lifting toe pointing all these kind
of rotational movements arm circles will all begin to work and think about your footwear
on this one suitable footwear with good cushioning and a little bit of lateral support would be
ideal and remember the focus is on quality not quantity so stop if you feel your form
beginning to falter yeah and again once more to remind concentrate on soft landings by flexing
your joints as a rule of thumb here the quieter you land the better your technique and the
better your results will be so ensure you're well hydrated before and during the workout
and we're going to get started so I'm going to show you the first exercise you ready guys
we're going to take the dumbbell so be careful how you pick it up we're using a dumbbell here
for our power squat press you could be using a dumbbell or any kind of resistance tool anything
a medicine ball or if you have a couple of tins of being something that we can use to do this
the aim of this exercise is the squat so we're squatting first pressing into the heels keep the
abdominals pulled in tight we're holding this at chest level we're coming up we're going to
continue into a leap and lift up to the top as well okay so this is how we're going to do this
we're going to take 30 seconds on 30 seconds off you know the sad thing is you're going to have to
do all the work because I'm going to have to keep the time I'm really sorry about that so this is
what we're going to do I'm going to ask you to do 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off he says
reset its crawl so the first set you can take it nice and easy and just get used to the technique
so are we ready 30 seconds and away we go down and press down and press down and press get into
a nice easy rhythm to start with keep going for me please so remember the important points
we're trying to land softly we're doing well guys keep going halfway through beautiful we're
reaching up keeping your abdominals in tight heels are down we're rolling from toe to heel on
that landing we've only got five more seconds brilliant work and we're going to take a very
quick rest there well done well done how did you do now hopefully you've perfected the technique
so what we're going to do for our second set is to turn up the pace so get yourselves ready get a
few deep breaths hopefully you can begin to feel we're working lots of muscle groups in this exercise
and that's great because that's where the calorie burn comes from okay so get yourselves ready the
feet are about hit with the pot 10 more seconds take some deep breaths hold your resistance tool
whatever you've got there at chest level i'm going to challenge you this time to squat a bit deeper
jump a bit higher and go a lot faster are we ready let's go guys up push up push come on let's get
into a little bit of a quicker rhythm now get a nice deep squat and push it up let's go let's go
keep going keep going landing quietly deep squat reach come on let's go let's go work at your pace
but keep it going remember never sacrifice technique we've got 10 seconds left we're doing well we're
doing well keep it going keep it going quiet landings see how we're bending through the knees
hips ankles to soften those landings and take a quick rest we can put that dumbbell on the outside
get some deep breaths have a little walk around keep your feet moving i'll show you our next exercise
we've got another 20 seconds rest you're doing really well so our next exercise this is what
we're doing one foot away from the step so you've got a little bit of distance we're doing a little
depth jump here so we're going to squat jump on to the board and off now be careful maybe in the
first set we jump on and just get used to stepping back down yeah just get used to stepping back down
the second set i want you jumping on and off and the secret here is quiet landings going up
and quiet landings going down so let's get ready reset the clock are we ready 30 seconds let's go
guys hop and you can walk down if you want on the first set just get used to jumping up onto the
step now the feeling is landing up and on don't jump forwards we're after some height some height
let's go hand up good beautiful hand up squat first squat first and up beautiful you've got 10
seconds squat and up get some deep breaths make sure you land with the whole of the foot on the
board remember we're landing toe down to heel bending straight into the squat to keep it soft
and a quick rest there well done well done get a deep breath so for our second set this is what
we're going to do take a quick rest we're going on and jump off on be careful on the jump off we've
really got to make sure you land straight into your squat so ideally no noise at all okay
are we set come on guys get ready take a deep breath we can do this think of all the calories
we're burning let's go just 30 seconds jump up jump down squat squat squat it's all about
height this is jump training jump good get up there get up there let's make those landings
quiet see how we're bending straight into the knees into the ankle into the hip and at all times
working through the core muscles keeping the abs tight we've only got five more seconds team let's
go you can do it you can do it and take a little rest there well done well done great work get a
deep breath keep yourself moving if you need a sip of water now's a good time we're going to change
we're moving on to a power lunge a power lunge i'm going to put one foot on the board one foot off
the foot that's off i want really on the ball of the foot now i'm not shuffling we're not shuffling
side to side remember what we're doing is jump training so we talked about the muscle shortening
first that will only happen if we lunge down first of all so we go down and then change down and then
change it's about height use your arms yeah again quiet landings but let's get on the ball of the
foot at the back let's get a little down first then up straight back down swapping over the legs in
between you can use your first set just to get comfortable with the technique okay pick a foot
any foot you like just put one on the board one behind on the ball of your foot
squat down and get ready for your 30 seconds here we go hand up good make sure you're getting
some good height and landing quietly up good up we're looking for height down into that lunge
look how we go straight back down into the lunge work at your own pace work at your own pace get to
a good rhythm we've got 10 seconds come on team and up and up get the whole of your foot on the
board landing quietly try not to look down too much and take a little rest there you've got 30
seconds get a deep breath get ready to do some work how are we doing give me a thumbs up are we
okay brilliant doing well guys doing well okay 10 more seconds get a deep breath and get ready
for your second set this is when we do some work okay five seconds let's get a foot on the board
get yourself ready how high can we jump challenge yourself we're going to do the whole 30 seconds
now here we go team up come on let's go jump jump good can we get some height please height
up come on can we jump a little bit higher can we go a little bit faster come on come on good
use the arms throw yourself up in the air you've only got oh 10 seconds to go come on
can we feel those muscles in the legs doing some work come on come on five we can do this come on
and take a little rest there whoa take a walk around get a deep breath can i just say we're not
faking this this is not meant to be easy the next exercise you stay where you are i'm just going to
show you how this exercise works keep yourselves moving on the spot we're going to move laterally
now so i'm going to turn this around for you just so that you can see what exercise i'm doing so
a lateral jump trying to catch his breath he's simply going over the step now i'm going to give
you options in the first set you could just step over the board to begin with maybe we can progress
that a little bit take a step but hold it for a second maybe a bounce before you come back
yeah but what we're going to try to build that up to is a full over over over without a rest in
between each okay so maybe just hop first of all get used to that lateral technique getting up and
over the board okay always set 30 seconds team let's go so you've got the option to start easy
going over just a little hop or maybe we can take it a little bit further jump with both feet
we'll take a little hop before you come back yeah a little hop before you come back beautiful that's
15 halfway there make sure you're clearing that step lifting up and we're trying to control that
lateral movement yeah and that comes by sinking down setting yourself a little bit of skill related
fitness here and take a little rest there deep breath get some air in keep your feet moving if
you need a sip of water now's a good time get ready for your second set and remember for this
second set we're going to do some work can we feel anything in the legs yes i'm going to take
that as a yes i'm sure you can feel something in the legs okay are we ready so this time if we can
we're going to try and jump straight over and straight back if you need to have a hop before
you come back that's okay are we ready let's go team if you can come straight back if not take a
little hop first but if you can let's go straight over straight back come on let's go team good
both feet feet together both feet good there you go there you go come on we're halfway through team
yes come on come on if you need to take a breather that's okay technique remember it's quality not
quantity beautiful excellent oh i saw that one lovely see how we've lowered the level there
sara took it down a little bit to get the rest because it's about good quality last few seconds
nice one pumping it up and take a little rest there well done well done well done get a walk
keep your feet moving don't stop still remember in our cardiovascular lecture we talked about
blood pooling so keep yourself on the move get some deep breaths and get ready to go
we're on our lateral power lunge now the difference here we're still going side to side on the step
but what i want to do this time is to keep one foot on the step yeah so we're essentially going
side to side but again like the power lunge it's not a shuffle we're not shuffling side to side
that's not the aim of this exercise the aim of the exercise remember we talked about muscle
shortening so we stretch the muscles first and then they contract so it's about height and it's
about landing straight into and this time even though it's a lunge you're landing flat foot yeah
so you're landing down toe to heel so the foot's flat toe to heel so the foot's flat get a really
good squat down keep the abs in tight so first set get the feel of the exercise let's get one
foot on the board get ready to go over and back but even though you're traveling laterally think
about some height 30 seconds let's go you know the secrets now we're bending the knee to preload
the muscles and we're also landing quietly use the arms to take you up beautiful look at that
lovely squat there at each side beautiful loading up the muscles using that elasticity in them to
give you the power we've got five seconds guys for that second jump fabulous last couple and you
can take a rest there get a deep breath keep your feet moving are we ready for that second set because
now we're going to do some work keep your feet moving hopefully you can feel this is doing some
work particularly hips and thighs please know this is the last one you're doing for your legs
how we set okay let's get ourselves loaded so remember the tips here land quietly by bending
straight into your hips knees and ankles as soon as you land you want a nice cushioned
quiet landing that's what we're after nice cushioned quiet landing going straight back down into your
lunge remember the quieter it is the safer it is because that's the less amount of impact you're
taking through the hips knees and ankles okay so while we set 30 seconds team let's go come on
give me some height give me some height up up up come on up the pace let's go come on let's go
let's go we're halfway through good good up give me some height give me some height up we go
up we go you're on your last 10 come on team we can do this up we go looking good are we feeling
this in the heart we're feeling this in the lungs are we feeling this in the legs i'll take that one
as a yes and take a rest there you can have a walk round did you feel that at home remember when we
talked about our cardiovascular system how the heart has to work when we talked about our energy
systems talks about the lactate system you might be feeling that a little bit in the legs now i'm
going to show you the next exercise we're moving on to as i said right at the top but we can also
use this technique for upper body work so let's have a little look at a power push-up so what we're
going to do here i'm going to set it up first of all hands on the board for my push-up normal push-up
give the abdominals in tight down to the board but on the push on the hands to come away if you
start to get tired the knees can go down yeah but the secret is to get your hands off the board
on that push-up yeah so first set nice easy pace let's go team nice and easy pace to begin with
okay so are we set and away we go down and press we just need that little bit of distance just as
the hands leave the step just for a second same rules apply though as soon as we land we bend into
the elbow we bend through the shoulder go straight back down into the next repetition that's halfway
keep it going i will warn you this is a little bit tougher than the legs if you thought that was hard
let's go five seconds guys come on we can do this you can do this
and take a rest there well done well earned rest you've got 30 seconds before your second set take
a deep breath if you need some water now's a good time hopefully you're feeling this a little bit
if you're pleased to know this is your last exercise in your routine although we've not
quite finished the work yet so don't panic okay always set let's get ourselves in position
get ready for that press up you've got 30 more seconds and here we go and press up beautiful
come on just 30 seconds you can do this working through the chest working through the front of
the shoulders working into those triceps at the back of the arm come on let's go hopefully also
work in your heart and lungs let's go we need 15 more come on we can do this we can do this if you
need a quick breather take a quick breather and then get started work to your own level come on
although in time you'll be doing more than 30 seconds trust me come on last couple of repetitions
and take a rest there just get yourselves up keep yourselves walking about please come on up we
get up we get up we get have a little walk around keep your feet moving fabulous yeah there is a
possibility that this being the first time that you've tried this kind of workout that maybe
you needed to work on the technique a little bit and so perhaps you weren't working as hard as you
could so I just want to be sure that we've driven home the technique for each exercise so what about
we do one more set of everything I hope I'm not pushing our relationship too far but I'm only
going to ask you for 15 seconds what's 15 what can you do in 15 seconds not an awful lot 15
seconds on each exercise but here's the deal 15 seconds full out yeah put your hand on your
heart and tell me you're going to do 15 seconds full out that's all I'm asking you and then we'll
have a stretch and cool down we can do this so our first exercise remember was the squad and press
let's grab those dumbbells please the squad and press remember was squat and press squat and press
15 seconds is all I'm going to ask you for so get your tins of beans medicine ball dumbbell
whatever it is if you've got a small dog no don't do that oh we set 15 seconds let's go come on
come on now let's get some work it's only 15 seconds that's no time at all come on come on give me
a good squat and leap quiet landings particularly when you're getting tired come on we only need
a four more seconds three two one take a quick rest well done well done let's lose that dumbbell
on the outside squat jumps were next remember the secret here is to squat land on the step land
off the step but straight into cushioning the landing 15 seconds are we ready go come on hop
hand down hand up hand down come on come on 15 seconds jump onto the step jump off the step
jump onto the step and off the step come on let's go a few more seconds come on
and take a little rest there well done well done how are you doing take a deep breath
take a sip of water the next exercise just to remind you was the power lunge yeah hop
hand up hop hand up that's all we're doing on the power lunge get yourself ready one foot on the
board take a deep breath remember we're looking for height we're looking for soft landings we're
looking to get started let's go hop good hop hop come on we only need 15 seconds you can do this
this is our power lunge you're halfway there already come on beautiful good work team yes
yes and take a rest there well done well done see how easily this is 15 seconds
was by no time lateral jump remember that's either hop or take a little bounce before you come back
or since we're only doing 15 seconds perhaps we can go straight from one side to the other get
yourself ready to go side to side over your board and let's go 15 seconds come on come on this is
no time to drop out on me now you can do this but remember quality not quantity if you're beginning
to lose your technique take a rest come on come on we're nearly there guys last couple of seconds
and rest beautiful one foot is on the board one foot's off this is our lateral power lunge there's
only two more to go hang in we can do this so one foot on one foot off it's about height it's about
cushioned landings are we ready let's go hop come on up it's not side to side this one's up and down
come on soft landings how are we doing come on guys five seconds give me some height give me some
height yes hop hop you'll be dunking the basketball and take a rest there we've only got one more to go
awesome work I hope you're feeling this power push-ups it's the last exercise we'll have a
little stretch straight after so come on come on come on here we go 15 seconds get yourself down
remember the aim here your press hands off the board hands off the board think about your core
muscles keep your abdominals in tight when we're doing this 15 seconds come on team let's go
beautiful come on come on 15 seconds that's all I need come on come on last few seconds
hang in there hang in there and take a little rest there well done well done well done okay
hope we get a little bit of a walk and if you guys can give me a little bit of a cool down so we're
going to cool down watch what the guys are doing some very simple gentle rhythmic movements just
like we did at the beginning yeah a few deep breaths is a really good idea I'm going to talk
while the guys are doing a little bit of a cool down for you you can join in with some
arm circles same as we did at the beginning some rotations some knee lifts just some very
gentle movements to bring your heart rate back down to gradually begin to bring your pulse down a
little bit and while they're doing that I'll just talk to you about a couple of things um
plyometric training hopefully now you'll agree is not easy that's why I said right at the top
this is not something we're going to do every day of the week but you can throw this into vary your
training it's great if you're doing any kind of sport because that explosiveness that power
is vital these are modified sports drills we're using but then also remember that what we're doing
here is burning a lot of calories we are burning a huge amount of calories because firstly it's a
demanding exercise but we're using big muscle groups compound exercises now remember in our
muscles lecture we talked about isolation and compound exercises and isolation exercises is
using just one muscle but here we're using here and here and here everything's working together
and that's where we get that huge calorie burn which at the end of the day remember in our weight
loss lecture we were talking about trying to get that calorie deficit at the end of the day so it's
really effective but also in lecture three in this series we talked about barriers to fitness
one of those barriers was time now hopefully you can see these guys regularly exercising but like
you they have time problems time issues we all have to work against work kids all sorts of pressures
the beauty of a plyometric workout hopefully you'll agree from that little section there
is that you don't need a lot of time it's intense yeah and also when we talked in our energy systems
lecture about getting fit about burning calories we said that the way exercise works the more you
put into it the more you get out so if it's intense you're going to get really good results I hope
you enjoyed your plyometric workout
