Hi, and welcome to our little step workout where we're going to be mixing our training
techniques.
We'll use some interval training techniques.
You may remember from our talk about the cardiovascular system, we talked about improving
its capabilities through interval training.
We also mentioned this when we talked about fuel in the energy systems lecture.
So we're going to get a mix of things here.
We're also going from cardio to strength, which is a great way to work out, going to
burn a lot of calories and help us tone up at the same time.
Importantly, as the guys are doing now, you need to get yourself a good warm up, and that's
working through all the major joints, mobilizing some basic movements.
You can do some basic stepping up and down on the steps since you've got one, just to
get you kind of warmed up a little bit.
And then remember for the workout, what we're going to do here is work in intervals of cardio
and strength.
So we're actually going to do one minute of cardio, and then we'll take 30 seconds and
then we'll go into one minute of strength exercises where your pulse will come down.
It's going to be doing a lot of that.
So with that one minute, what I'm suggesting is that we spend the first perhaps 15 seconds
making sure we've got the technique right, and then we really start to ramp up the rate
you're working at there.
So we want to be looking at getting to a 7, 8 out of 10 on your intensity scale there.
So let's get ourselves warmed up.
I'm assuming you guys are warmed up.
If not, press pause and make sure you get a few of these mobilizing exercises done first.
And we're going to move on to our first exercise.
Now we're going to run through the whole lot and just do one set.
You might want to do two sets, so you could always do a second set afterwards, second
circuit if you're feeling fit enough.
But for now, let's get ourselves started.
30 seconds rest in between each.
So since we're working for a minute and then doing a 30 second rest, we've got a 2 to 1
work rest ratio.
Remember, we talked about that before in our cardio training.
So the first exercise, don't do anything just yet with your little step platform, is one
foot on.
The shuffle is literally just a swap side to side.
Try not to stamp on it.
Just keep it nice and easy.
Are we ready to go, guys?
Get close to that step.
One foot on it.
I'm going to take a minute on.
Are you ready at home?
Let's go.
Hope we go.
Let's go.
Get into a good pace.
Oh, a little bit quicker than that.
Come on.
Beautiful.
Try and keep the feet nice and light.
Keep yourself smoothing.
Keep it pleased.
Now that's 10 seconds already.
Come on.
Keep going at home.
Onto the toes.
Beautiful.
Using the arms as well.
Keeping the abs in tight.
Good.
Foot on the board.
Excellent.
Yours is going for a walk, I think.
How are we doing at home?
We're halfway through already.
Can we go a little bit quicker?
It's not really a question.
Come on.
Keep it moving.
Keep your arms moving.
Up, up, up, up.
Come on.
Let's go.
We've only got 15 to go.
Let's go with the arms as well.
Come on.
Come on.
We're into our last 10 seconds.
Come on.
Come on.
Keep it going.
You're not out for a country hike, you know.
Come on.
Last few seconds.
And take a rest there.
Take a deep breath.
Straighten up that step for me.
You might find like Johnson's just done.
The step might move a little bit.
Take a deep breath.
Keep your feet moving.
Taking our 30 seconds, I'm going to show you the next exercise.
We're moving on to a press-up walk.
So this is what's going to happen.
One hand is on the step, one's off.
We're going to walk onto the step, press up, onto the step, press up.
If you start to get fatigued, you can drop your knees down.
But if not, starting the full press-up, are we ready guys?
Down we go.
One hand on, one hand off, and one minute's worth.
Let's go.
We're away.
Beautiful.
Get into a good pace and go with it.
Start with your full press-up position.
If you start to fatigue, then we'll take that down to resting your knees on the floor.
Let's go.
Walk on, walk off, and press up.
Chest down.
Was that a half press-up then, Jen?
I hope not.
Keep the abs in tight.
We're working into the chest here.
We're working into the front of the shoulders.
We're working into the triceps at the backs of the arms.
Excellent work.
Looking good, looking good, looking good.
We're halfway through already.
Come on.
All press-ups.
This is excellent.
Come on down we go.
Keep breathing.
How are we doing at home?
Little strength work here.
Getting into the chest, getting into the triceps, getting into the front of the shoulders.
Looking good, looking good, looking good.
Only about another 45 minutes to go.
I think I pressed the clock wrong.
No, keep going.
We've only got 10 seconds.
We can do this.
How are you doing at home?
Stay with me.
Do the last 10 seconds.
Come on.
We can do this.
We can do this.
And a couple more.
There's one more rep there, Jen.
And take a rest there.
Well done.
Well done.
Get yourselves up.
Keep yourself moving.
When you're taking that deep breath, just keep yourself moving on the spot.
Get ready for our next exercise, that strength we're moving on to cardio again.
So now we're doing an over the top.
We're going all the way over, tapping, and then coming back.
So stop from one side.
It doesn't matter which side you are.
We're going to go over the top, tap the feet.
It's a little, actually, if we're going to get into dancing terms, we're doing a chasse
across the top of the board.
Try not to go too far.
What we're trying to do is control our lateral motion.
And the idea is, light feet, keep them quick.
A little belly alias on the board.
Are we ready, guys?
So if we're facing outwards, please, facing that way for me, are we ready at home?
You're going across the board and back.
And let's go.
Over.
Good.
Quicker with the feet.
Quicker.
Quicker.
That's it.
Quicker.
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
So over we go.
And back.
Come on.
How are we doing?
Lovely.
Come on.
Keep going with us.
Over the top.
Good.
Come on.
Let's get that heart rate going.
Moving those big muscle groups.
Fabulous.
Come on.
We're working on that aerobic fitness now.
Come on.
A little bit quicker.
Straight over.
Straight over.
Don't dilly-dally.
Oh, we're over halfway already.
Good.
Keep the feet light.
Excellent.
Preferably keep it quiet.
Then we're getting less impact.
Beautiful.
Speed across the board.
Speed across the board.
Bring for the last 15 seconds.
Can we increase the pace on the last 15 seconds?
Apparently we can.
Up.
Good.
Good.
We're into the last five.
Good speed.
Good speed.
Excellent.
And take a little rest there.
Well done.
You've got 30 seconds.
Take a deep breath.
Keep your feet moving when you take that deep breath.
We're going to move on now to a little bit of strength work again.
Really getting into the hips and thighs in a three-direction lunge.
So what we're going to do here is put your right foot on the board.
What you're going to do here is to take a lift with the knee.
We're lunging forwards, first of all.
Take a long stride forward, drop down through the knee.
Lift it up.
Take it out to the side.
Squat down.
Take it round behind and back up.
So a three-direction lunge, we're going to the front.
We're lifting.
Going to the side.
Abs are in tight.
Lifting and down behind.
Okay.
Let's get our right foot on the board, guys.
Right foot on.
Okay.
Are we good to go?
Let's lift that knee, first of all.
Okay.
Get ready for your one minute.
Let's go.
Hands down and up to the side and up behind and up.
Let's go.
The lunge.
Good.
Out to the front, to the side, behind.
Excellent.
To the front.
Come on.
A little bit quicker.
Up.
Beautiful.
And down.
Good.
Let's make those lunges deep.
Can we go a little bit quicker?
We've only got a minute.
Come on.
That's nearly halfway already.
Come on.
Let's go.
Really working into the hips and thighs here.
Fabulous exercise.
A little bit of strength, but because we're using those big muscle groups now, it's beginning
to get into the heart and lungs as well.
We need to keep that oxygen getting through.
We're down to 45.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Deep lunge.
Down for the side.
Right the way behind.
Make sure you're on the ball of the foot on those lunges.
We're into the last five seconds.
Let's keep going.
Looking good, guys.
Looking good.
How are you doing at home?
I'm hoping you're still with us.
And take a little rest there.
Well done.
Keep yourself walking around.
Keep your feet moving.
Get some deep breaths in.
Get yourself set ready for our next exercise.
We've gone from strength.
We're moving back onto cardio.
This time we're going with jumping jacks.
So our jumping jacks, you'll know the move.
You know this jumping jacks move, but all I'm going to do with this is to use the board
as well.
So we're going to be jumping up and down.
That's all we're going to be doing for our jumping jacks.
OK.
You've got a couple more seconds.
Get your breath back.
How are we doing?
Keep yourself moving.
Remember, we talked about blood pooling when we talked about the cardiovascular system.
So it's important to keep moving.
You don't want to stop still.
Even if you need a breather.
I hope you're taking some sips of water along the way as well.
OK.
Let's get ourselves ready.
Feet either side.
Let's face outwards, please.
Get ready.
Feet straddle and away we go.
Let's go.
Jumping jacks up and down.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Light on your feet.
Light on your feet.
How are we doing at home?
Come on.
Up.
Up.
Up.
Come on.
Let's get that pace up.
Let's get that pace up.
That's 15 seconds.
Come on.
Light on your feet.
On the toes.
Does it go a little quicker?
Good.
Looking good, John.
Looking good.
OK, guys.
Use your hands if you need to.
Good.
Get into a good rhythm.
We're halfway through.
Let's go.
How are you doing at home?
Fabulous.
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
Does it go a bit quicker?
Excellent.
Thank you for not cursing at me then when I ask that question.
Come on.
We're into 15 seconds.
You're on your sprint for home.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Up.
Up.
Abs are in tight.
Lending the knees, softening the ankles so we get nice, soft landings.
Beautiful.
Last few seconds and take a rest there.
Keep yourself moving.
Get a deep breath.
Well done.
Well done.
You didn't fall off the board then, did you?
Fabulous.
Keep the feet moving.
You won't be surprised to know that the next exercise, opposite of what we just did on
the other side.
So this time we're doing our three-direction lunge on this side, the side, up and down
behind.
Self-ready.
We're going to be over to this side of our step.
Let's get the left foot on.
Get ready to lift your right knee up to the top.
Oh, we're nearly there.
That's our 30 seconds.
Remember that work to rest ratio, two to one.
And away we go.
Get up.
Up.
Up.
Abdominals in tight all the time.
Get a good stride forward for that lunge.
Sink down.
Sink low.
Keep going.
Good.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Can we get a bit lower?
Can we go a little bit quicker?
Not really a question.
Up.
Lift it up and out.
Really working into toning the hips and thighs.
Moving those large muscle groups.
So although we're on our strength exercise, still a little bit of cardio work going on
here.
Fabulous.
Up.
Good.
Good.
We're halfway through, team.
Come on.
Lift that knee up in between.
Get it right up.
Lift it right up.
Good.
Keep the abs in tight.
You'll get a little bit of a forward pinch from the hip on those lunges.
But don't be rounding your spine.
Keep the abs in tight.
Good.
Chest is lifted.
Fabulous.
Last few seconds.
How we doing at home?
And we'll take a rest there.
Keep the feet moving.
Well done.
Good work.
Good work.
Okay.
We're going to move on to our next cardio exercise.
Cardio exercise now is across the top.
So what we're going to do, just as we did when we went over the top, which was this
way, we're just going to make it a little bit more difficult now, and do it long ways
on the board.
So you're starting at the side of the board, you're going all the way over and all the
way back.
Yeah?
I'm going to go with you.
And let's go.
Up.
All the way over.
All the way back.
Come on.
Let's go.
Up.
Up.
How you doing at home?
All the way over the top.
Come on.
Come on.
Keep moving.
Good.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Keep going.
15 seconds already.
Come on.
Good.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Fabulous.
Quick feet.
Quick feet.
Don't worry about the height.
Get quick feet across the board.
Let's get that shuffle moving.
We're halfway through.
Come on, guys.
Doing well.
Is that a bead of sweat there, John?
I think.
Absolutely brilliant.
Well, that's the warm-up finished.
Come on.
Let's go.
You're smiling too much.
That worries me.
We've only got 20 seconds to go.
Come on, team.
How are you doing at home?
Hang in there in the across the top.
You're doing well.
10 seconds.
Come on.
We can do this.
Keep going.
Don't rest.
In fact, if anything, for the last five seconds, speed it up.
Speed it up.
Looking good.
Looking good.
Looking good.
And take a rest there.
Well done.
Keep your feet moving.
Get some deep breaths.
How are we doing at home?
So we're going to move on to our next strength exercise.
Keep yourselves moving for a second and just take a look at the next one.
So we're going into our tricep dip.
You're going to come around the front of your step for this one.
Okay.
Dead simple.
All I'm going to ask you to do is put the hands either side of your hips with the fingers
pointing in the same direction you're facing.
You're going to lift your backside off the bench.
The knees are slightly bent.
You're going down and back up.
See that bend in the elbow?
And then pressing from there gets into the tricep.
Keep your abdominals in tight.
Keep your chest lifted and your head up.
Make sure there's nothing going on in the middle just here for our tricep dips.
Okay.
Let's get ourselves in position, guys, at the front of the step.
Get yourself in position at the front of the step.
Hands are just slightly wider than the hips.
The fingers are pointing forwards.
Lift your backside off.
And are we ready to go?
One minute.
Let's go.
Now, this isn't too difficult.
So let's get a good pace going.
Down we go.
And back up.
Backside down to the floor.
And up we go.
Down let's get into a good pace and go with it.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Beautiful.
Working into the triceps now.
Getting into the back of the arm here.
But also a little bit of work on the core, keeping the abs in tight.
Can we feel something going on in these triceps?
That's what we're after.
Into the triceps.
Back of the arm.
Look at those triceps.
Wicked.
He's one I prepared earlier.
Fabulous.
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
We're over halfway through now.
So come on.
Get a good pace.
Turn it up.
Come on.
Can we get a few more done, please?
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You're into the last 15.
Yeah?
We should be getting a little bit of burn.
Remember that lactate we talked about?
The lactic acid system.
Remember we talked about that in lecture 13 in the energy systems.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Work with it.
Work with it.
Remember if we can push that forwards and take a rest there, well done, well done.
We'll be able to burn more fat sooner.
Good work.
Good work.
Well done.
Get yourself a breather.
Keep yourself moving.
We're going to move on to a knee repeater on your right leg.
So you're going to put your right foot on the board and you're going to be facing the
corner.
The right foot's going to stay on the board all the time and your left knee is simply
going to go up, touch the floor, up, touch the floor, but we're going to go as quickly
as you can for your one minute.
Are we ready, team?
Let's get the right foot on the board facing this way.
Get ready with your left knee to come up and down.
Keep that right foot on the board all the time.
Are we set?
One minute.
I hope you're ready at home.
Let's go.
Up, up, up, come on.
Use the arms.
Use the arms.
Come on.
Imagine we're sprinting now.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Fabulous.
Keeping those abs in tight.
Now any good sprinter will tell you how important their core strength is.
Now we define core strength as the ability to keep your trunk fixed and because of that
it'll improve the efficiency, the speed, the power in your arms and legs.
Look how Jen's staying fixed in the middle, really working those arms and legs.
Come on, John.
Let's get that knee up a bit quicker.
We've only got 20 seconds to go.
Come on, come on, come on.
We can do this.
Knees up, knees up.
We should be getting that temperature up.
We should be getting those heart and lungs working.
We're doing well.
We're into the last 10.
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
How are we doing at home?
Hang in there.
Last five.
Come on.
Come on.
Beautiful.
And take a quick rest there.
Well done.
Well done.
Keep yourself moving.
Going to move on to our next exercise.
So we're going to change it now.
Upper body, lower body.
Let's get that vascular shunt we talked about in our cardiovascular lecture.
That idea of moving the blood from one area to the other.
So what I'm going to do now, I'll show you this one straight on, is a little sit-up and
reach.
So I'm going to get myself down onto the bench for this exercise, starting from our normal
sit-up position.
But what I'm going to do is take one hand, reach it diagonally up and across.
So I'm going to start with them down at my chest, but I'm reaching and getting that twist.
So now I'm really getting into here, but I'm also getting into the obliques with that
twist.
So if you can get down on the bench facing outwards, brilliant.
And you can pick which arm you want to reach with, because it doesn't matter.
You know you're going to do the other one on the next set.
So the aim here is the feet are flat, the knees are bent.
We're looking for our neutral spine position.
What that means is a comfortable spine position.
That's what we're after.
Looking for a position where the lower back has got that little bit of an arch.
OK.
So the hands are up by the shoulders.
You can decide which hand you're going with, but when you sit up, I want you to reach across
to the diagonal.
OK.
So let's get ourselves set.
One minute away we go.
Sit up and reach across.
Beautiful.
And let's reach a little bit higher up to there.
Up to here.
Beautiful.
That's it.
Get a really good twist.
Fabulous.
Up and twist.
Good.
And a little bit higher on that reach.
Let's get it up here.
Fabulous.
And back down.
OK.
Let's go.
Looking into the six pack, into the rectus.
We're also working into the obliques.
Great work.
Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.
We're doing well.
Good work.
Come on, team.
Come on.
How are you doing at home?
Fabulous.
And reach.
Beautiful.
Up we go.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Up we go.
We've only got 15 seconds.
How are you doing at home?
Can we feel something going on in the abdominals?
I'm going to take that deafening silence and say yes.
Come on, come on, come on.
We're doing well.
We've only got 10.
This is it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get those last few reps.
Work those abs.
Work those abs.
And take a quick rest.
Well done.
Well done.
Get yourself up.
Have a little walk around.
We don't want any blood pooling.
Get some deep breaths.
Get some oxygen in.
Remember, getting that oxygen in is going to help to clear away the lactic acid.
And let me show you what our next exercise is going to be.
We're going on a side lunge.
So one foot's on, one foot's off the step.
And all we're going to do here is literally switch them over on the top.
Yeah?
Now what we're doing here is getting a little rotation through the waist as well at the
same time.
How quick can we move those feet?
Let's stand on the step facing outwards, please, team.
One foot on.
Get ready.
One foot on the board.
Are we ready to go?
And let's go.
One minute.
Come on.
Get that foot on the board and let's go.
These are our side lunges.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
A little bit quicker.
Don't go up.
Go across.
I feel the need for speed looking good.
There you go.
Come on.
Come on.
Does it go a little quicker?
How are we doing at home?
Come on.
Come on.
These are our side lunges.
Getting that heart rate up.
Burning calories.
This is what it's all about.
Improving our fitness level.
And remember, we've already discovered that the fitter we are, the sooner we start to
burn fat as an energy source.
Let's get rid of that fat.
Come on.
Beautiful.
Looking good.
We've only got 20 seconds, guys.
Let's turn it up.
Turn it up.
Turn it up.
Come on.
Come on.
Excellent stuff.
Doing well.
How are you doing at home?
I hope you're still with us.
Good work.
Good work.
Come on.
Come on.
Looking good.
Looking good.
Last five.
Can I get a couple more reps in there?
And beautiful.
Hold it there.
Round.
You've got your 30 seconds.
Remember, we talked about that work to rest ratio, two to one.
We're working for a minute, 30 seconds to get ourselves set.
Remember, we talked about the benefits of interval training.
Great stuff.
We're back down for our sit up and reach only this time, whichever hand you went with last
time.
You're reaching the other way this time.
Remember, you're going to sit up, reach up and across.
Get yourselves ready to go.
And you know what?
I'll take it now.
Let's go.
And reach up to that high diagonal.
Yeah?
So we're getting this work for the six pack muscle.
We're getting this work for the obliques as we sit up and reach across.
Sit up and reach.
Beautiful.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I'm trusting you to swap sides.
Don't let me down.
Fabulous.
Get into a good pace and go with it.
Remember, we talked about breathing in our respiration lecture and we talked about exhale
on the exertion.
Yeah?
So your exertion here is to sit up.
So breathe out as you come up, breathe in as you go down.
Good work.
Good work.
We've only got 20 seconds to go.
When I say we, obviously, I mean you, because I'm just checking the clock, but somebody's
got to do it.
It may as well be me.
Come on, guys.
Hang in there.
How are we doing at home?
If you need to have a quick rest, you can, but please join back in.
Don't forget, we've only got 10 more seconds and then you can have a rest.
Good work.
Good work.
Come on.
Come on.
Fabulous.
Get in there and take a little rest.
Well done.
Well done.
Get yourselves walking about.
We're going to go for a little speed skate movement.
So keep yourselves moving, but keep your eyes on me.
We're straddling the step and this time we're literally going to speed skate from side to
side.
Get that heel up over the board.
Let's get some lateral motion.
And this is, if you remember our balance lecture, we talked about dynamic equilibrium.
What we're doing here is controlling this movement.
Remember, it's one of our skill-related fitness components.
We talked about agility.
We talked about dynamic balance.
What we've got to control here is that whole lateral movement, that deceleration and back
into acceleration to the other side.
Secret to that is bending down on the knee, loading up the muscle so that we can go back
in the other direction.
Guys, let's get straddled.
That doesn't sound right, does it?
But you know what I mean.
Let's lift one leg, get ready, and let's go, side to side.
Let's go.
Come on.
Up, up, up.
Like you're speed skating.
Get those arms moving side to side.
Come on, get those arms moving.
Get those arms moving.
Can we go quicker?
What's happening here?
It seems to have gone in slow motion at the back here.
Come on, let's go.
You've done 20 seconds already.
Come on, guys.
Beautiful.
Shift the body right across.
Swing the arms across.
Good.
Look at the movement.
The more calories we're going to burn, so make it big, make it big.
You're halfway.
Come on, come on.
Looking good.
Looking good.
And looking very graceful.
I think we might be calling you the Torval and Dean.
Does Torval and Dean translate?
I'm sure you know what I mean here.
Looking good.
Speed skating.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Although I don't remember Ravel's Balera looking quite like this, but it doesn't matter.
We're nearly there.
Five seconds.
Go home, five seconds.
And take a rest.
Well done.
Well done.
Keep your feet moving.
Take some deep breaths.
I'm going to show you the next exercise.
We're going to move on here and put a little bit of work into the core muscles, but also
particularly into the bleaks at the side.
What I'm going to do is take one leg out, like so.
The other leg, you can put it wherever's comfortable in front, behind, wherever works
for you.
Drop the hips.
And I'm going to do a hip hitch.
Lift it up and drop it down.
Lift it up and drop it down.
I'm looking to avoid any rotation here and really get some work into here.
Stay long from the top of your head, down through your tailbone, down to your heel.
Keep a nice long position.
Yeah.
Drop the hip, lift it up.
Drop the hip.
No rotation.
Just drop and lift.
Let's face it.
Outwards, guys.
Beautiful.
There you go.
Are we set?
Get yourself balanced.
And hang on, hang on.
Let's go.
Drop the hip and lift.
Drop the hip and lift.
Beautiful.
Now, this one is a much smaller movement than most of the other exercises you've been doing,
but it's a really good exercise to work those core muscles, keep your abdominals pulled
in tight all the time, but also really working into the obliques here.
You can really feel how they work on stabilizing your lumbopelvic region, keeping your hips
in that position.
How are we doing?
We're halfway through.
How are you doing at home?
Great stuff.
Keep going.
Try to keep your breathing relaxed.
Try to keep your breathing constant while you're doing this.
We've only got 20 seconds to go.
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
That's beautiful.
How are you doing at home?
Looking good, looking good.
You'll be pleased to know we've only got a couple more exercises to do, so hang in there.
You can do this.
What a great way to spend 30 minutes.
Fabulous.
We've only got 10 more seconds.
Was that a moan and a groan there, I thought I heard?
That's why they haven't got mics, so you can't hear them complaining.
And take a rest there.
Well done, well done.
Walk about.
Get your feet moving.
Well done, well done.
Did we feel that?
Just nod.
Yeah, I'm going to take that as a yes.
Beautiful.
Moving to our last little cardio, and we've saved the best until last, it has to be said.
So we're going to do a, is it the Wizard of Oz?
It's the Wizard of Oz.
It's the Wizard of Oz.
Clicking your heels together, and you might want to wish that you were somewhere else
when we do this.
Because what we're going to do is click the heels together over the step.
So basically, whatever energy you've got left, I think we're going to squeeze it out now.
And remember we said, when it comes to fitness, the more you put in, the more you're going
to get out.
Yeah?
So I'm going to let you probably have about 10 seconds of getting into the rhythm of the
technique, and then we're just going to go like crazy.
Okay, so facing outwards, straddle the step, please.
Are we ready?
Okay.
Now, bearing in mind, this is the last little cardio one we're going to do, and then we're
just doing that hip hitch on the other side, and we're done.
So, whatever you've got, I want it now.
Let's go.
Hop.
Jump.
Touch those heels together.
Touch.
Oh, are you having a rest in between there?
Do you want me to bring you a coffee or something?
Just get straight on with the next one.
No rest in between.
Come on.
How are we doing at home?
Click those heels together.
I'm sure the Wizard of Oz never looked like this, did it?
I'm sure it didn't.
Come on.
Hop.
Hop.
Hop.
Come on.
Click those heels.
You'll be pleased to know we are now halfway.
Come on.
Come on.
If we can, please, softer the landings, the easier it is on the joints.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
A little bit quicker.
Come on.
Stop pretending you can't hear me.
I know you can.
A little bit quicker.
Good.
Good.
Last 20 seconds.
You'll never do this again.
Come on.
Come on.
Actually, I hope you will.
Just trying to make it sound easier.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're into the last 10 seconds.
Come on, guys.
Come on.
How are you doing at home?
This should be getting close to, we should be on about nine and a half.
Out of 10 here.
Definitely.
Last couple and take a rest there.
Keep your feet moving.
How did you do?
Oh, I can feel that.
I don't know why I'm saying that.
I wasn't doing anything.
They were doing all the work.
Okay.
So we're then on to the other side.
So you guys are going to be facing inwards this time when we go on to our last little
exercise, the hip hitch.
Remember this time, drop it down, lift it up, really getting into the core muscles
really getting into those oblique muscles.
So let's set ourselves up.
I think we're facing in this time.
One hand down.
We'll be pleased to know we're nearly there, guys.
Okay.
Hopefully, I'm not stretching our relationship too much and asking you for one more minute,
please.
Let's go.
These guys will never speak to me again after this.
Drop the hip down and lift it up.
Beautiful.
Was that a grimace or a smile?
I think it's a smile because we're nearly there.
It's the last exercise.
Good.
Well done.
Well done.
Well done.
That's not real sweat.
We just said that's makeup.
That's how we make that look.
Come on.
Come on.
But if you're getting a little bit of sweat on at home, that's good.
Remember we talked about waste products being carbon dioxide and water being heat.
This is what's happening.
Come on.
Come on.
We're halfway through.
You've got 30 seconds and then you'll never have to listen to me ever again.
Come on.
Come on.
But you will because you're going to play this again because as you get fitter, this
is going to get easier and who knows?
You might build up from one minute to a minute and a half or you might actually do the whole
thing in two circuits.
Who knows?
Come on.
We've only got a few seconds and literally I mean a few seconds.
Guys you're doing really well.
Really well.
And take a rest there.
Well done.
Well done.
If you want to sit yourself on the step and just have a couple of little stretches you've
done.
So what we're going to do now is go down into a little cool down and stretch.
You'll see we're doing a couple of mobilizing moves just like we did at the beginning.
And then we're going to have that stretch for the major muscle groups.
We're going to get into the quads because the legs have done some work.
We'll get into the hamstrings.
We'll have those little stretches.
And remember if you're not too sure on those stretch techniques, we've got that flexibility
workout for you.
You can do them then.
So we've got nothing more than a step.
That's all it is.
A little step platform.
You might have one gathering dust in the garage.
You might have one sitting around in the cupboard under the stairs.
It's going to be one of those places you don't often look for it.
You'll be covered in dust, but they're a great tool to use.
If you haven't got one they're easy to get a hold of, they're not too expensive.
And as you can see, all those cardio, all those strength exercises, you're going to
get some results with this.
So get yourself a step, get sweating.
