 Game theory is the study of strategic decision-making by multiple decision-makers who are assumed to be rational and aiming to achieve the best possible outcome for themselves. It involves three main components: players, strategies, and payoffs.

Players are the individuals or groups participating in the game. Strategies are comprehensive plans that dictate a player's decisions in every possible situation they might encounter. Payoffs represent each player's satisfaction or utility from the outcome of the game, often expressed as numerical values where higher numbers indicate greater satisfaction.

In any game, players choose strategies that can interact in complex ways. The combination of chosen strategies and the outcomes they produce leads to payoffs for each player. These payoffs are what guide players' decisions, assuming they are rational and aiming to maximize their utility.

Game theory goes beyond simple general plans or rules of thumb. It requires a detailed specification of behavior in every contingency. This level of detail is necessary to model the strategic interactions accurately.

In the next lecture, we will delve deeper into strategies and payoffs, explore the concept of rationality, and consider how common knowledge among players can affect the outcomes of games. We'll also examine cases where game theory's predictions do not align with actual human behavior, which highlights that payoffs in a game can be influenced by factors beyond mere financial gain.

1. **Risk Neutrality**: In game theory, if a risk-neutral player is faced with a 50/50 chance of winning $100 or losing nothing, they would consider this equivalent to a certain gain of $50, assuming they get to play the game repeatedly and can average out their risks.

2. **Personal Risk Profiles**: While risk neutrality is a useful assumption in many cases, it's important to remember that real people have varying levels of risk tolerance, which should be reflected in their payoffs and decision-making processes.

3. **Payoffs**: These reflect what the player cares about and can be adjusted to account for personal values, morality, or a sense of fairness. Game theory assumes rational players who act according to their own best interests, as defined by their payoffs.

4. **Common Knowledge**: A crucial assumption in game theory is that all players have common knowledge of the rules and the rationality of the other players. This means that each player knows the rules, knows that everyone knows the rules, and so on, ad infinitum. Common knowledge ensures that players can anticipate each other's actions based on mutual understanding.

5. **Example from "Mystery Men"**: The interaction between Captain Amazing and Casanova Frankenstein illustrates the concept of common knowledge. Frankenstein acknowledges that he knows what Amazing knows, but not necessarily what Amazing knows he knows. This highlights the importance of all players having a mutual understanding of each other's knowledge for the game to function as expected.

6. **Playing Games**: With the foundational concepts of risk neutrality, personal payoffs, rationality, and common knowledge in place, we are ready to explore various games in game theory to understand strategic interactions and decision-making under different scenarios and constraints.

1. **Rollback Equilibrium**: This concept is a method to find the optimal strategies in a sequential game of perfect information. It involves going backward through the game tree from the end nodes (terminals) to identify the best strategy for each player at each decision node, given the strategies of subsequent players.

2. **Sub Game Perfect Equilibrium**: This is a refinement of Nash Equilibrium that applies to sub games within the larger game. A strategy is sub game perfect if it is a Nash Equilibrium within every possible sub game of the original game.

3. **Kuhn's Theorem**: This theorem states that for any finite, deterministic, sequential, and non-cooperative game of perfect information (like chess), there exists a unique sub game perfect equilibrium. This means that either all games played according to this equilibrium will end in a win for one player (if such a winning strategy exists), or every game will end in a draw, similar to tic-tac-toe.

4. **Implications**: Kuhn's theorem implies that there is a definitive "best" way to play any such game. In the case of chess, this means that one of three possibilities must be true: White can always win if played perfectly, Black can always win if played perfectly, or chess will always result in a draw when both players play optimally.

5. **Complexity vs. Strategy**: Despite the vast number of possible strategies in chess, Kuhn's theorem assures us that there is one optimal strategy that would lead to a guaranteed outcome (win for either player or a draw). This is true regardless of the complexity of the game.

In essence, Selton's insight that if a strategy is good, you should be able to plunk players down anywhere in the game tree and have them play it out to a Nash Equilibrium, holds especially true for games with perfect information where the rollback equilibrium method can be applied.

1. **Prisoner's Dilemma**: This is a situation where two individuals (or entities) have a conflict of interest but can achieve a better outcome for both if they cooperate with each other rather than defect (betray the other). However, each individual has an incentive to defect because it provides a better payoff regardless of what the other does. The dilemma arises because mutual cooperation is in the best interest of both parties, yet the structure of the game leads each to choose defection, resulting in a suboptimal outcome for both.

2. **Cooperate vs. Defect**: In the context of our restaurant example, cooperating means choosing an alternative that provides a payoff of two for both individuals, while defecting means going to Le Moore, which results in a payoff of one for both. The challenge is convincing each individual that cooperation is the best choice, even if they believe the other will defect.

3. **Efficiency and Pareto Optimality**: The efficient or Pareto optimal solution is one where no party can be made better off without making another party worse off. In the prisoner's dilemma, the cooperative solution is efficient because both parties can be made better off if they both choose to cooperate.

4. **Real-world Applications**: The prisoner's dilemma and similar games (coordination game, battle of the sexes, chicken) are prevalent in various real-world scenarios, such as traffic encounters, market competition, contracting work for payment, and more. These situations often require a strategic approach to reach an efficient outcome.

5. **Escaping the Dilemma**: There are ways to escape the prisoner's dilemma, which we will explore in future lectures. Solutions often involve factors like trust, reputation, history, and commitment devices that can encourage both parties to cooperate rather than defect.

1. In the Simultaneous Games lesson, we learned about Nash Equilibria and how to find them in a 2x2 matrix game where two players decide on their strategies without knowing what the other will choose. We also discussed admissible strategies, which are not weakly dominated by any other strategy.

2. For the given matrix game involving a tour boat and a cable car, we identified all Nash Equilibria by highlighting the best response for each player in every row and column. This revealed three Nash Equilibria where both players' payoffs were maximized: (7, 60), (8, 50), and (6, 40).

3. Among these equilibria, only the (6, 40) combination was also admissible, meaning it is not weakly dominated by any other strategy. This suggests that in a non-cooperative play of this game, where players are rational and know the strategies of others, we expect the outcomes to be around the boat price of $6, the cable car price of $40, and both companies making $7 and $50 respectively.

4. The (7, 60) and (8, 50) equilibria are not Pareto efficient because there are other outcomes where both players could be better off without making the other player worse off. However, the (6, 40) equilibrium is not only a Nash Equilibrium but also admissible, meaning it is stable under the assumption that neither player will choose a strategy that leaves them worse off.

5. The lesson emphasizes that in non-cooperative games, players have an incentive to select strategies that are admissible because they cannot be improved upon without being improved upon for the other player as well. In this context, both players end up with outcomes that neither would want to improve upon unilaterally, leading to a stable equilibrium.

 In this scenario, we have three candidates for mayor in a large city—Rebecca, Dennis, and Indira. Rebecca leads with 45% of the votes, while Dennis has about 40%, and Indira, the independent candidate, has 15%. The election will be won by whomever receives the most votes.

Indira is more inclined to support Dennis than Rebecca, primarily because of her interest in zoning issues and a potential offer to head the zoning commission or another key commission under Dennis. Dennis, on the other hand, prioritizes getting elected above all else but is willing to consider Indira's endorsement post-election.

The game theoretic analysis of this situation reveals that without a binding commitment, Indira has no reason to support Dennis since he can renege on his promise after being elected. The non-binding nature of the offer from Dennis to Indira is akin to "cheap talk" in game theory terms.

However, if Dennis were to reveal a skeleton in his closet to Indira, he creates a situation where his own best interest aligns with Indira's—he needs her support to win, and she needs the position to avoid the scandal he has shared with her. This self-binding commitment makes the promise credible for Indira.

Knowing that failing to honor his promise would lead to the revelation of the scandal, which would be detrimental to him, Dennis is incentivized to follow through on his offer. Consequently, Indira has every reason to support Dennis, ensuring his election and securing her desired position. The scandal remains hidden, and both parties achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.

The key insight from this scenario is that sometimes it's advantageous to enter into agreements where each party holds something over the other, effectively binding themselves to honor their commitments through fear of mutual damage should they renege. This is a practical application of Thomas Schelling's principle that the power to constrain an adversary depends on the power to bind oneself. In this case, both Dennis and Indira are better off with a coordinated outcome than with the alternatives available to them if they act independently.

1. **The Game**: The game between Stephen and Mod involves three pure strategies (one, two, or three) where each player chooses one strategy per round. The payoffs are such that against a certain mixed strategy, there's an optimal pure strategy to choose from.

2. **Stephen's Strategy**: Stephen determines his best pure strategy to be 'two', which gives him a positive expected value. He can consistently win $1 per game by playing 'two' all the time if he knows that Mod will not change her mixed strategy of 67% 'one', 25% 'two', and 8% 'three'.

3. **Mod's Strategy**: Mod has a mixed strategy where she plays 'one' 67% of the time, 'two' 25% of the time, and 'three' 8% of the time. If Stephen switches to a mixed strategy of playing 'one' 40% of the time, 'two' 50% of the time, and 'three' 10% of the time, Mod should avoid playing 'two' because it would result in a negative expected value. Instead, she can achieve an average payoff of 30 cents per game by randomly choosing between 'one' and 'three', or any mix that includes these two strategies in equal proportions.

4. **Fairness**: The game is completely fair, with both players having a mixed strategy that yields the same expected payoff. Stephen's optimal mixed strategy is to play 'one' 30% of the time, 'two' 50% of the time, and 'three' 20% of the time, while Mod can play 'one' or 'three' all the time, achieving an expected payoff of 30 cents per game.

5. **Next Steps**: In the next lecture, we will explore how to find mixed strategy equilibria where both players' mixed strategies are optimal against each other. Von Neumann showed that such equilibria exist and provided a method to find them. This concept is crucial in game theory as it allows for understanding interactions in various situations, from economics to social dynamics.

1. **Two-Player Zero-Sum Games**: We examined a simple zero-sum game where each player has to choose between shooting once or twice. The goal is to find an optimal mixed strategy where neither player has a dominant strategy.

2. **Mixed Strategies**: Using the two-by-two technique, we calculated that both players should adopt mixed strategies. For Player 1 (mod), she should shoot one 7/12 of the time and two 5/12 of the time. Similarly, for Player 2 (Stephen), he also should shoot one 7/12 of the time and two 5/12 of the time.

3. **Game Fairness**: We determined that the game is not fair. Player 2 (Stephen) has an expected loss of 1/12 or approximately 8 cents per game, while Player 1 (mod) has an expected gain of 1/12 per game.

4. **Implications and Further Questions**: We considered the broader implications of mixed equilibria in games that are not purely competitive (zero-sum). We also pondered what happens when we introduce cooperative elements into the game, as well as how the logic changes with a larger number of players or more complex games.

5. **Historical Context**: The approach used today is based on the work of John von Neumann in 1928, which laid the foundation for game theory.

6. **Next Steps**: In the next lecture, we will explore the implications of mixed equilibria and consider how cooperative elements can affect game outcomes. We will also look at how the concepts apply to larger games with more players and discuss the broader applications of game theory beyond simple two-player games.

Checking Scott Stevens - Games People Play Game Theory in Life, Business and Beyond (VIDEO) Complete/09.Mixed.Strategies.and.Nonzero-Sum.Games.txt
1. **Zero-Sum Games**: In a zero-sum game, each player's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other player(s). The concept of an optimal mixed strategy is useful here because it ensures that neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, as any such deviation would make them worse off.

2. **Non-Zero-Sum Games**: In non-zero-sum games, the outcomes are not balanced, meaning one player's gain does not necessarily equate to the other player's loss. The optimal mixed strategy in these games is designed to make both players indifferent among their strategies, meaning they can't improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

3. **Stability of Mixed Equilibria**: In non-zero-sum games, mixed equilibria can be inherently unstable. A slight change in one player's strategy can lead to both players moving towards pure strategy equilibria that are more stable and often provide better payoffs for each player than the mixed equilibrium.

4. **Coordination Games**: In coordination games, mixed equilibria might not be as efficient as pure strategy equilibria. They can give worse outcomes for both players than if they had both chosen the best possible pure strategies.

5. **Real-Life Applications**: While mixed strategy equilibria have their uses and theoretical importance, in practice, they may not always represent the most realistic or stable set of strategies for players to use. It's important to consider the context and potential stability issues when applying these concepts to real-world situations.

1. **Engagement Rings as Commitment Devices**: Engagement rings serve as a form of escrow, where the costly ring acts as a non-refundable deposit that increases the credibility of a marriage commitment from the man to the woman. If the man decides not to marry after sleeping with his fiancée, he loses the investment in the ring, which discourages him from reneging on the promise.

2. **Credibility in Promises and Threats**: The concept of commitment is central to making promises or threats credible. In a simple experiment where a participant could either keep five dollars or give it to someone who might not fulfill a request, the return of the deposit to the participant illustrates how escrow mechanisms ensure credibility.

3. **Signaling Future Behavior**: The act of giving an engagement ring is a signal that differentiates between men who intend to marry and those who only seek temporary sexual relationships. This signal helps the woman assess the commitment level of her partner.

4. **Business Applications**: Similar to personal commitments, businesses can demonstrate their commitment to a project by investing in it visibly, such as through costly advertising campaigns for unfinished products. This investment serves as a commitment device that makes it less likely they will abandon the project.

5. **Future Topics**: In the next lecture, the topic of credibility will be further explored, with a focus on how individuals and businesses can establish credible commitments and how these commitments influence behavior. Understanding the mechanisms behind making credible threats or promises is crucial in many aspects of life, from personal relationships to international diplomacy.

Checking Scott Stevens - Games People Play Game Theory in Life, Business and Beyond (VIDEO) Complete/11.Credibility.Deterrence.and.Compellence.txt
1. **Types of Moves**: There are three types of strategic moves—threats, promises, and demonstrations. Threats are warnings about negative actions you will take if the other party doesn't act as you want. Promises are assurances of positive actions you will take if they do. Demonstrations show what you will or won't do without promising or threatening.

2. **Pathways to Credibility**: There are ten pathways to making your strategic moves credible:
   - Directness: Clearly and openly stating your intentions.
   - Explicitness: Making your messages unambiguous.
   - Observability: Ensuring that others can see what you're doing.
   - Frequency: Repeating your message or action to reinforce it.
   - Sincerity: Appearing genuine in your intentions.
   - Certainty: Conveying a firm commitment to your words or actions.
   - Responsiveness: Adapting to new information and changing circumstances.
   - Visibility: Ensuring that the audience for your message is clear.
   - Simplicity: Making your communication easy to understand.
   - Reasonableness: Basing your moves on logic and shared premises.

3. **Deterrence vs. Compelence**: Deterrence involves trying to prevent an action by the other party, typically using threats. Compelence involves trying to encourage an action, typically using promises. Threats are often more effective for deterrence because they set a clear response in case of undesired actions. Promises are often more effective for compelence because they offer a clear reward upon successful completion of the desired action.

4. **Effectiveness of Moves**: The effectiveness of threats and promises can vary based on their size and the context in which they are made. Threats should be calibrated to ensure they are believable but not so large that they cannot be carried out if necessary. Promises should be carefully considered to ensure they are both attainable and sufficient to motivate the desired action.

5. **The Importance of Credibility**: Credibility is crucial for both threats and promises to be effective. The pathways to credibility provide a framework for how to communicate your strategic moves in a way that maximizes their effectiveness and minimizes the risk of being misunderstood or disbelieved.

In summary, when trying to influence behavior through deterrence or compelence, it's important to choose the right type of move—threats for deterrence and promises for compelence—and to ensure that your moves are credible by following the ten pathways to credibility. The size and delivery of threats and promises should be carefully considered to achieve the desired outcome without overcommitting or overreacting.

 In this scenario, you and I are playing a simplified version of a card game where the objective is to obtain the two of anything, splitting the pot if neither player has the two, or the player with the two winning all the money. The game proceeds as follows:

1. Each player receives one card face down and looks at it without revealing it.
2. Each player must decide whether to quit (losing their initial $40), fold (losing their initial $40 plus an additional $70 if the other player continues), or continue by adding another $70 to the pot.
3. If both players continue, each reveals their cards. If one has the two of something, that player wins the entire pot. If neither has the two, the pot is split equally between the players.
4. The game involves imperfect information, as players do not know the other player's card until they decide to continue or reveal.

To solve this problem, we can express the game as a matrix game, which can then be analyzed using the concepts of simultaneous games and Nash Equilibria. This analysis will help us understand the optimal strategies for each player given the information they have and the uncertainty about the other player's hand. The solution involves considering how often each player should bluff (continue with a one) based on the other player's likely responses to different hands.

This scenario is an example of a more general principle that sequential games can be reformulated as simultaneous games, allowing us to apply a wider range of game theory concepts to solve them. The resolution of this specific game will involve understanding signaling and imperfect information, which are key concepts in game theory and economics.

 In this lecture, you explained the concepts of asymmetric information and incomplete information using examples from the movie The Princess Bride. Asymmetric information occurs when one party knows something that the other does not, as seen in the scene where Wesley pours poison into two goblets, one for himself and one for Vizini, the kidnapper. Vizini, who is a clever man, realizes he cannot know for certain which cup has the poison without Wesley revealing it, leading to Vizini's inevitable demise when he chooses a cup, as Wesley is of two types and the poison was in both cups (a situation of incomplete information).

Incomplete information means that each player has private information about their own type, and the other players must make decisions based on the possible types of the players involved. In the second example from The Princess Bride, Wesley is paralyzed and lying on a bed, pretending to be helpless while actually being able to stand if necessary. Prince Humperdink, who would have no qualms about killing a healthy Wesley, must decide whether to attack or surrender based on Wesley's behavior. Wesley's decision to either signal his true state (either healthy or paralyzed) by standing or to bluff and remain lying down creates a pooling equilibrium where both actions are taken by both types of Wesleys. However, when Wesley stands up, the prince assumes there is a separating equilibrium, concluding that Wesley must be healthy and therefore surrenders. This illustrates how signaling and the choice of equilibrium can significantly impact the outcomes in games involving information asymmetry.

1. **Example Context**: The story comes from a soccer match in the 1994 Shell Caribbean Cup where Barbados needed to win by two goals against Grenada to advance, or else they would be eliminated if they won by one goal or lost.

2. **Problematic Rule**: A rule was in place for this tournament that if a game was tied after regular play and continued into overtime, any goal scored during overtime would count as two points. This was intended to reward teams that could win in extra time, especially those who score the deciding goal.

3. **Game Outcome**: In the final minutes of the match, Barbados was leading 2-0 but played defensively and let Grenada score, reducing their lead to one point (2-1). This wasn't enough for Barbados to advance since they needed a two-goal margin of victory.

4. **Barbados' Strategy Failure**: In an attempt to advance by the new rules, Barbados scored on their own goal to tie the game 2-2, ensuring that if they scored first in overtime, they would win by two points and advance. The game went into sudden death overtime.

5. **Grenada's Strategy**: Grenada realized they could either score against Barbados or within two minutes of overtime to win outright or risk scoring against Barbados to avoid losing by one goal, which would have eliminated them.

6. **Outcome**: Barbados managed to hold off Grenada at both ends of the field and scored first in overtime, winning by two points and advancing, while also adhering to the strange incentive created by the tournament rule.

7. **Implications**: This example illustrates that incentives need to be carefully designed to encourage the desired behavior. The bizarre outcome of the match highlighted the unintended consequences of a poorly thought out rule.

8. **Real-World Analogy**: In business or policy, similar principles apply. Incentives should be structured to promote the intended outcomes and not lead to perverse results that contradict the original goals.

9. **Lesson for Designing Incentives**: When creating incentive structures, it's crucial to anticipate how participants might respond to the incentives and consider all possible scenarios to ensure that the desired behaviors are encouraged while unintended consequences are minimized.

1. **Grim Trigger Strategy**: A strategy where a player always cooperates on the first move and then does whatever their opponent did on the previous move (if they defected, you defect; if they cooperated, you cooperate again).

2. **Prisoner's Dilemma Resolution**: In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, two players can reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium by both adopting the Grim Trigger strategy, which leads to an average payoff of 6 for each player if the game has more than a 50% chance of continuing.

3. **Delta Factor**: The probability (delta) that the game will continue into another round beyond the current one is crucial. If delta is greater than one half, cooperation becomes the dominant strategy under the Grim Trigger strategy.

4. **Net Present Value Analogy**: The same principles that ensure a cooperative equilibrium in the Prisoner's Dilemma can be applied to financial decisions by considering the net present value of future payoffs. If the interest rate (r) is not too high, it's better to take payoffs now rather than later because they earn more interest over time.

5. **Other Equilibria**: While a cooperative equilibrium exists in the Prisoner's Dilemma when using the Grim Trigger strategy, it's important to note that there are also equilibria where both players defect, and these can give any average payoff between 2 and 3, provided that delta is sufficiently high.

In summary, the Grim Trigger strategy provides a way for two players to cooperate in a Prisoner's Dilemma and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, as long as the game has a reasonable chance of continuing and the players are willing to cooperate at least once to establish trust.

1. **Public Goods Game**: In this game, players collectively contribute to a common pool (the public good), from which everyone benefits regardless of their contribution level. The Nash equilibrium is often for players to contribute nothing since they receive the benefit whether or not they contribute. However, in practice, contributions tend to be higher due to social norms and cooperation.

2. **Ultimatum Game**: Here, one player proposes how to split a sum of money, and the other decides whether to accept or reject the offer. If the offer is rejected, neither player receives any money. The Nash equilibrium predicts a 50/50 split, but in reality, many players reject offers that seem too low, indicating a preference for fairness over guaranteed payment.

3. **Dictator Game**: Similar to the Ultimatum Game, but one player unilaterally decides how to divide the money, and the other has no say. Despite having no influence, most people give a portion of the money to the other player, suggesting that altruism or cooperation can still play a role even when it's not strategically necessary.

4. **Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma**: In this repeated game, players have the opportunity to cooperate or defect. Over time, cooperation can be sustained through strategies like 'tit for tat', which starts with cooperation and mirrors the opponent's previous action. The Nash equilibrium in this context is for players to consistently defect, but in practice, cooperative strategies often win tournaments because they foster a mutual desire to cooperate.

5. **Characteristics of Effective Cooperation Strategies**: Based on Robert Axelrod's experiments, successful cooperation strategies tend to be:
   - **Nice** (they don't start with defection)
   - **Provocable** (they retaliate if wronged)
   - **Forgiving** (once a transgression is made up for, they are willing to cooperate again)
   - **Straightforward** (their decision-making process is clear and predictable)

These characteristics can be applied to real-life situations where cooperation is desired, potentially improving relationships and outcomes.

1. **Social Contagion Model**: This model describes how behavior spreads through a population based on the proportion of individuals who have already adopted that behavior. It applies to phenomena like language usage (metric vs. English system), technological adoption (VHS vs. Betamax, Blu-ray vs. HDDVD), and keyboard layout preference.

2. **Equilibria in the Model**: The model has three potential equilibria: all individuals using the metric system, all using the English system, and an unstable mixed state at around 63% English usage. In reality, societies tend to converge on one of the stable equilibria, often the metric system.

3. **Many-Player Coordination Games**: These games explain why individuals may follow the majority even when they have a personal preference for a different option. This is due to social influence and coordination dynamics.

4. **Volunteers' Dilemma (Chicken Game)**: This game illustrates how individual responsibility can fail in situations where multiple witnesses are present. The diffusion of responsibility can lead to no one taking action, as each individual expects someone else to act, resulting in a collective failure to respond to an emergency.

5. **Kitty Genovese Case Study**: A real-life example of the Volunteers' Dilemma. Despite numerous witnesses, no one called for help during Kitty Genovese's murder in 1964. This tragic event highlights the phenomenon of diffusion of responsibility and the tendency for individuals to free-ride on the actions of others when multiple people are involved.

6. **Actionable Insights**: The lectures emphasize the importance of individual action despite the presence of others who might also be capable of taking that action. It encourages people to recognize situations where they need to step up and not assume someone else will take responsibility.

1. In a war of attrition, like an auction, both participants incur costs but only one wins the prize. This resembles the Olympics, where everyone trains but only one person gets gold.

2. The optimal strategy for such a game, according to evolutionary game theory, is not to stick strictly to a monomorphic strategy (either always buzzing early or always buzzing late). Instead, it involves adopting a polymorphic strategy where each participant has a random chance to buzz in as the clock reaches a new dollar amount.

3. The recommended strategy is to generate a random number from one to 100 every time the clock ticks up by one dollar. If the random number is 100, buzz in; otherwise, wait until the next increment and try again. This approach ensures that no fixed stopping point can outperform it on average.

4. The strategy of buzzing with a .995% chance when the clock reaches a new dollar ensures that participants will not always buzz in (like those who buzz before $100) or always wait (like those who buzz after $100). It's a balance that prevents being outperformed by either extreme strategy.

5. This analysis shows that in games of attrition, it's often better to not commit to a single strategy but to adopt a mixed strategy that adapts over time, maximizing the chances of winning while minimizing the costs paid.

1. The median voter theorem states that in a one-issue, two-candidate election, the candidate who captures the preference of the median voter will win, due to the distribution of voters across the left-right spectrum. This leads to a Nash equilibrium where both candidates position themselves at the midpoint of the electorate's preferences.

2. In real-world elections, candidates often move towards the center during general elections after primaries, to appeal to a broader range of voters.

3. Arrow's theorem, or Arrow's impossibility theorem, highlights the challenges in creating a fair voting system that can rank options without certain undesirable properties, such as the possibility of manipulation or intransitivity.

4. Alternative voting systems, like approval voting and range voting, are proposed to address some of the issues with traditional plurality voting. Approval voting allows voters to vote for multiple candidates, while range voting uses a scale (e.g., 0 to 10) for each candidate, with the winner being the one who receives the highest average score.

5. Range voting has shown promise in theoretical simulations but requires further research to understand its practicality and effectiveness. It is also assumed that voters are casting sincere votes rather than engaging in strategic voting, which can manipulate results.

6. Ultimately, the effectiveness of any voting system depends on voter participation. Despite the potential of new voting systems, low voter turnout remains a significant challenge for democratic processes.

1. **Duopoly and Competition**: In a market with two firms (a duopoly), competition can lead to lower prices for consumers. If one firm has a monopoly, it can charge a higher price ($400 per chair in the example given). However, when a second firm enters the market, it forces the first firm to reduce its quantity and price to maintain market share, ultimately benefiting consumers by offering chairs at a lower price ($250 in the example).

2. **Sequential vs. Simultaneous Decision-Making**: The example initially described a von Stackelberg duopoly, where one firm sets its production level first, and the second firm responds optimally to this decision. In a Cournot duopoly, both firms make their decisions independently or simultaneously.

3. **Nash Equilibrium in Duopoly**: The Nash equilibrium for a Cournot duopoly occurs when both firms' production levels are at the point where neither firm can increase its profits by unilaterally changing its own output level, given the other firm's fixed output level. In this case, both firms produce 100 units and sell their chairs for $300 each, resulting in a profit of $20,000 each.

4. **Monopolistic Collusion**: If only one firm (the threat of entry) is present in the market, it might be more profitable for the firms to collude and divide the market, effectively acting as a monopoly. This would allow them to make more money collectively than they could in a competitive environment. However, this leads to anti-competitive behavior and is often regulated by authorities like the FTC.

5. **Real-World Examples**: The concept of collusion through exclusive licensing agreements is not uncommon in the pharmaceutical industry, as seen with cases involving Andriks and Herkst, as well as Abbott Laboratories and Geneva Pharmaceuticals. These firms may enter into such agreements to prevent generic competition, thereby maintaining higher profits at the expense of consumer welfare.

6. **Simplification's Utility**: The simplicity of the duopoly model allows for a clear understanding of competitive interactions and strategic decision-making in markets with multiple firms. Even though real-world scenarios are more complex, the insights gained from these simplified models can be incredibly valuable.

1. **Auction Types**: We discussed three types of auctions—English, Dutch (or sealed bid, second-price), and first-price, sealed-bid auctions. The Dutch auction is considered the most efficient for determining the true market value because it allows bidders to easily determine how much they should bid based on their valuation without worrying about outbidding others.

2. **New Zealand's Spectrum Auctions**: New Zealand implemented a Dutch auction to allocate wireless communication licenses. This led to unexpected results due to the public's difficulty in understanding the bidding process, which was perceived as a government failure despite being a rational economic mechanism.

3. **Virtues of Auctions**: Auctions are an effective way to ensure that valuable public resources are allocated to those who can make the best use of them. It replaces cheap talk with bids that reflect true value, preventing companies from bidding more than what they believe they can gain from the resource.

4. **Spectrum Auction Structure**: The auction structure required bidders to keep bidding or quit, allowing participants to gauge the reasonableness of their evaluations by observing competitors' actions.

5. **Google AdWords**: Google's ad word system is an example of auctions closer to home. It operates on a modified Vicere auction model where advertisers bid for ad placements based on key words. The actual cost per click is determined by the second-highest bid, and advertisers can save money by shading their bids. Google's system tends to generate more revenue per ad impression than competitors.

6. **Perception of Auctions**: Despite their logical and efficient nature, auctions can sometimes be misunderstood or viewed negatively by the public due to their complexity or the outcomes they produce.

7. **Conclusion**: Auctions are an integral part of modern economic transactions, from allocating wireless communication licenses to determining ad placements on the internet. They are a powerful tool for converting rights to scarce resources into economic value. Despite some public misunderstanding and criticism, auctions continue to be a dominant method for trading goods and services in competitive markets.

1. In the Nash non-cooperative bargaining solution, each player proposes a split of resources that maximizes their own payoff, taking into account the reaction of the other player. The final agreement is the one where both players are mutually satisfied and cannot do better by deviating unilaterally.

2. If both players have the same degree of patience (R = S), the bargaining solution suggests that each player should keep 48.78% of the resources, with a slight advantage to the player who goes first by an amount of 2.44%.

3. In cases where R and S are small (both players are not too impatient), the difference in payout for going first is minimal, and the split can be close to 50/50.

4. If one player has a higher degree of impatience than the other (R ≠ S), the player with less patience will receive a larger share of the resources, often significantly larger if the difference in impatience is substantial.

5. In real-world applications, such as buying a home or international negotiations, patience can be a strategic advantage. A party that appears more patient may leverage this perception to gain better terms in an agreement.

6. The U.S., due to its political structure and popular pressure for immediate results, often finds itself in a less patient bargaining position, which can lead to less favorable international agreements.

7. Cultivating patience in negotiations can be beneficial, as it can lead to more equitable outcomes. Patience can act as a strategic tool that balances the power dynamics between parties with different levels of impatience.

1. **Players and Added Value**: The lecture continues the discussion on players (P) and their added values (A) in a game. It emphasizes that a player's participation can significantly change the dynamics of a game, which is sometimes overlooked.

2. **Nintendo's Market Position**: Nintendo illustrates how a company can arrange things to keep almost all of its product (the Pi) for itself, maintaining a strong market position due to a high demand for its product.

3. **Car Analogy**: The lecture uses the example of switching from a Nissan to any car to illustrate that the added value of owning a car is greater than the specific value of owning a Nissan. Similarly, in business, the value of a product (or competition) can be more significant than the product itself.

4. **Holland Sweetener Case Study**: The case of Holland Sweetener challenging Monsanto's monopoly on Aspartame is presented as an example. Despite having a potentially valuable product, Holland Sweetener failed because their competition (the added value they brought) was undervalued by the market's key players, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, who chose to maintain their existing relationship with Monsanto.

5. **Getting Paid to Play**: Bradenburger and Nell Buff suggest that sometimes it may be worth paying a company (getting them "paid to play") to enter a market or bid on a job. This can happen in various forms, such as:
   - Cash payments
   - Guaranteed sales contracts
   - Last look provisions
   - Access to additional information
   - The opportunity to bid on other parts of the company's business
   - Meeting with other decision-makers within the company
   - Quoting a price at which the company would guarantee their business

6. **Reflection on the Course**: The lecture sets up a reflection for the final part of the course, where we will discuss the concept of parts in greater detail and conclude with thoughts on the journey through game theory.

In summary, the lecture reinforces the importance of understanding both players and the added value they bring to a market. It also highlights the strategic considerations companies must make when deciding whether to enter a market or bid on a job, especially when their presence could benefit other players significantly. The course continues to explore game theory's complexities and its practical applications in business strategy.

1. **Nonzero-Sum Games**: The focus of game theory extends beyond zero-sum games where one player's gain is another's loss. Nonzero-sum games involve actions that provide mutual gains or losses, and their study can lead to better outcomes for all players involved.

2. **John von Neumann's Influence**: Von Neumann, a pioneer in game theory, may have seen the prisoner's dilemma in the context of the Cold War nuclear standoff between the U.S. and the USSR. This analogy is now commonly used to describe the dynamics of mutual assured destruction.

3. **Prisoner's Dilemma and Nuclear Weapons**: The prisoner's dilemma model suggests that in a conflict where both sides have nuclear weapons, each side might believe it's best to strike first. This belief can lead to an undesirable outcome: nuclear war.

4. **Cooperation vs. Aggression**: During the Cold War, there was a prevalent thought that war with the USSR was inevitable. However, the conflict never escalated into open warfare, and the cooperative solution of peace was achieved. The work of game theorists, including those who study behavioral aspects, will likely continue to elucidate why cooperation prevailed.

5. **Axelrod's Recipe for Cooperation**: Robert Axelrod identified key strategies that promote cooperative behavior:
   - Be nice (cooperate when others do).
   - Don't be the first to defect from a cooperative relationship.
   - Be provokable (punish those who defect).
   - Be forgiving (be willing to cooperate again after punishing a defection).
   - Be straightforward (let others know how your actions depend on theirs).

6. **Changing the Game**: The ultimate goal of studying games is not just to play them better, but to change them for the better. By understanding game dynamics, we can create more cooperative and mutually beneficial situations in both personal interactions and societal systems.

7. **Conclusion**: The lecture emphasizes that cooperation is a fundamental aspect of human behavior, as seen in brain scans and evolutionary studies. Game theory, particularly through the lens of nonzero-sum games, can guide us toward more cooperative and harmonious outcomes, ultimately making our world a better place to live.
