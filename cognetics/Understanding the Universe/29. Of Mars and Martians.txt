The fourth and final terrestrial planet is Mars, about one and a half times farther from
the Sun than the Earth is. It's at 1.5 astronomical units.
Now Mars is named after the God of War, largely because of its reddish-orange color. We now
know through studies of it that that color comes not from blood, but rather from rust,
from iron oxides. There's a lot of iron compounds on the surface of Mars and they've oxidized
and formed this color. Now the color is not really this red. The early pictures of Mars
had a wrong color balance and with the more modern, more proper color balance, its surface
actually appears sort of a yellowish-brown. Although in the sky when you look at it, it
does distinctly have a reddish or maybe orange color. So the association with the God of
the War was perhaps appropriate at early times. Now part of the fascination with Mars was
fueled by the report in 1877 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Shapirelli that he had
seen canali on Mars. Now canali in Italian means channels, but it was improperly translated
to canals in English and people then thought that, oh, this connotes some sort of intelligence
that built these canals maybe to send water down to arid regions or something and in any
case Mars seemed to have color changes over the seasons that might indicate vegetation
and stuff and with canals there, maybe there are actually intelligent creatures. So this
fueled huge public fascination with Mars and it inspired many science fiction novels and
books starting most famously with H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds written in 1898 and then
there was the radio broadcast by Orson Wells in 1938 which actually fooled a lot of people
into thinking that we are right now being invaded by hostile Martians and that was a
big, big problem actually. People really believed it for a while and there was widespread panic.
Well Percival Lowell of the Lowell Observatory, well it subsequently became named the Lowell
Observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona was especially intrigued by Mars and he made detailed telescopic
observations of Mars visually through an eyepiece and he thought he could really see a whole
network of straight line canals just criss-crossing the planet. Here's one of his early drawings
where there seemed to be these few centers of activity, maybe cities or regions where
there was a large population of aliens and connecting these regions were these fine striations
possibly suggesting either highways or what he thought water canals taking water to arid
regions from water regions. So this helped fuel our enormous interest in Mars. People
thought that there really might be some sort of life there, maybe intelligent life, maybe
not. You know through the 1940s, 50s and 60s as telescopes became better it became pretty
clear that Lowell's observations were probably flawed but it was probably an illusion and most
people doubted that there is intelligence on Mars just because the conditions seemed pretty
hostile with our more modern observations, we could tell that. Nevertheless there was some hope
that there might be plants or bacteria or microbes or something and so people wanted to go to Mars,
send spacecraft there and take a closer look and take some soil samples and analyze them.
So a whole series of spacecraft was sent for example in 1997 the Mars Pathfinder mission
landed and there were big headlines, greetings from Mars all over Newsweek, you know just huge
interest in this stuff and on Pathfinder there was a little robot called Sojourner that
buggyed around and took a close look at rocks and things like that so it was just great you know
it was almost like a human being there but it's sort of cheaper and safer to do this initially
at least with robotic missions. So with the spacecraft we received confirmation that there
really are no canals on Mars, there are no artificially produced channels between different
regions and that this was just an illusion that Shapirelli first had and then Lowell,
Percival Lowell, your mind tries to connect the dots when it wants to see something interesting
apparently and anyway that's just the way it goes. There's really no sign of intelligence,
a lot of people thought that this image at the left was a face on Mars built by some primitive
intelligent creatures and the spacecraft image on the right shows that it's just a pile of rocks
on which the shadows sometimes occasionally resemble those of a face and though there are
some other interesting features on Mars that sometimes appear as though they are produced
by intelligence we are unlikely to receive a Martian Valentine entitled from Mars with love
you know despite craters like this that do look like they're you know a heart-shaped thing or
perhaps carved by some sort of intelligence. Alright let's look at some of the basic characteristics
of Mars. It's about half the diameter of the Earth though somewhat larger than Mercury so
it's a fairly small planet and it has these two diminutive moons Phobos and Deimos only about
20 kilometers in diameter. In most pictures of Mars such as that at the left the planet is highly
overexposed in order to faintly show these two moons there and there. If you superpose a normally
exposed photo of Mars and accentuate the moons then you get an image something that looks something
like this but they're really very very small they're not much bigger than Manhattan Island so
you know they're probably in fact captured asteroids and one of them even goes around the
planet sort of the wrong way in a direction opposite to that of most moons going around planets.
Now Mars has polar ice caps and indeed this was known long ago and one of the things that fueled
the idea that there may be water sometimes running on the surface of Mars. We now know that those
ice caps are predominantly made out of frozen carbon dioxide what we call dry ice and they grow
and shrink with the seasons but underneath the dry ice caps there is a water cap as well so there
really is water on Mars although most of the polar cap is carbon dioxide and it comes and goes
with the seasons. Mars's seasons are quite similar to those of Earth because the tilt of Mars's axis
of rotation is 25.2 degrees relative to the perpendicular to the plane of the solar system
and you will recall that Earth's axis tilt is 23.5 degrees so they've got a very similar tilt
they also by the way have a very similar day-night cycle. Hours on Earth is 24 hours and on Mars
it's 24.5 hours so it's really a very similar day-night cycle and similar seasons. So here's
a photograph taken in 2005 by an amateur astronomer showing one of the polar caps and two years
earlier in 2003 that polar cap had much more dry ice because that was winter time when this
picture was taken in 2003 but summer time in that hemisphere in the previous picture taken
in 2005. So the polar caps sort of come and go. Now we get an exceptionally clear look at Mars every
two years when it happens to come pretty close to the Earth. This is a configuration called
opposition where you have the Sun here the Earth there and then Mars is on the side of the Earth
that's opposite to the Sun so you see it in a dark night sky opposite the Sun and Earth and Mars
happen to be pretty close to each other in their orbits. So every two years we get a pretty good
view. Mars looks big in the sky through a telescope and here you see a series of photographs taken
near the time of opposition in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2005. You can see that this 2003
appearance is very large. It had a rather large angular size in the sky about 25 or 30 arc seconds
and so a lot of details could be seen and indeed this August 2003 approach to the Earth was the
closest in recorded history in something like 50,000 years so it got people really excited and what's
really great is that a large number of people just from the general public got a chance to see Mars
through telescopes you know at local observatories and planetariums and schools and they could see
the polar caps and stuff and it almost made Mars feel Earth-like you know you almost felt like you
were there and it seemed almost like a hospitable planet. Here's Mars during its closest approach
in 2003 and you can see the two sides of Mars. These two photographs are separated by roughly
half a day and you can see one side on the left here and the other side of Mars on the right.
Mars does have a thin atmosphere. It's only about one percent of the thickness of Earth's atmosphere
so one one-hundredth of atmospheric pressure here on Earth and it consists mostly of carbon dioxide
90 percent of it is carbon dioxide but because it's such a thin atmosphere and because Mars is
significantly farther from the Sun than Earth is Mars goes through extreme temperatures and they're
usually pretty low down from minus 130 degrees Celsius so that's 130 degrees below the freezing
point of water up to about 30 degrees Celsius which is pretty balmy okay that's pretty warm
but that only occurs occasionally near the equator I mean you could you could sit around with shorts
and shirts and short sleeve in those kinds of conditions easily but they don't last long and
they're not over much of the planet's surface so it's mostly a pretty cold planet though not
in the deep freeze that some planets are in though thin this atmosphere supports ferocious winds
and there are sometimes major dust storms on Mars when the winds kick up the loose dust
on the surface and here you can see two photographs taken on June 26th 2001 when the
when the atmosphere was relatively clear and you could see a lot of details and then just a few
months later in September you can see this widespread dust storm that blocked the features
from our view and here in this movie you can actually see the development of that dust storm
over the course of a few weeks and months you can see how the surface features get get covered up
or blocked by the dust in the atmosphere and indeed a lot of people were worried that the 2003
closest approach would be blocked by this dust and it turned out that we got a pretty clear view so
that's good all right well spacecraft have been sent all ever since the 1960s a whole fleet of
spacecraft and the early spacecraft saw craters volcanoes canyons dunes since then we've also
seen dust devils little whirling dust almost like miniature tornadoes or something like that
here's one of the photographs that I particularly like it shows Mars sort of in the crescent phase
which you can see if you're beyond the distance of Mars we from earth never get this particular
view because we can't see Mars from the backside from earth and you can see the polar cap nicely
there but here's Olympus Mons the the greatest volcano on Mars and it covers an area the size
of the state of Arizona here on earth and the reason it became so big on Mars is that Mars has no
plate tectonics because it lost most of its heat long ago so the plates aren't moving there's only
one single thick crust and in the weak spots of the crust magma could come up from the interior of
Mars but since those spots didn't move away as the magma came up the volcano just kept growing and
growing and growing over very long periods of time and had a chance to become way bigger than Mount
Everest here on earth on earth what happens where there are hot spots is that as in the case of the
volcanoes making up the Hawaiian islands the hot spot is there but the the plate is moving across it
so new islands come up in a chain as the hotspots location relative to the plate change changes and
so so each of the Hawaiian islands is pretty big but not as monstrously big as Olympus Mons and the
other big volcanoes on Mars here's a recent picture of some sand dunes that I particularly like
taken just just a few years ago beautiful picture of sand dunes and here's one of these little dust
devils where you can see a little swirling plume of dust going across the desert there kind of cool
now the most striking feature on Mars is Valleus Marineris a giant canyon which if placed in the
U.S. would stretch from one coast to the other it's just a fantastic place here is another
photograph of it and now I want to show a movie that is based on over 500 high resolution images
from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft combined with over 50 million laser altitude measurements that
can give the topography of this Mariner Valley so let's play the movie now
the grandest canyon of all isn't on earth it's on the planet Mars Valleus Marineris
or Mariner Valley this canyon is so long it could stretch 3 000 miles from New York City
to Los Angeles and it's nearly as deep as Mount Everest is high lifting off in a cloud of dust
our scout ship heads for Mariner Valley a swarm of tornado-like dust devils whirls across the Mesa
just as in the deserts on earth dodging them we pass impact craters where large meteorites
violently struck long ago dead ahead in our race toward the rim winds are blowing dust clouds
up the valley slopes Mariner Valley is 10 times longer five times deeper and 20 times wider than
earth's grand canyon you could drop the entire Los Angeles basin inside with room to spare
the rim stands almost as high above the valley floor as Mount Everest on earth
looking westward all along the valley's length we find giant landslides that tumbled off its steep
rugged walls on the left lie numerous rocky spurs and narrow gullies formed by slumps and avalanches
after crossing a low ridge we fly up a tributary side canyon
inside the canyon twists and turns in a stream-like way geologists think this side canyon
was born as groundwater escaped and the surface collapsed several more tributary canyons cut
into the valley's rim these also grew where groundwater undermined the surface the valley
walls run far into the distance its cliffs and ridges were born through earthquake faulting
the main geologic forest that began to open the valley billions of years ago
tucked into the valley's widest part melas chasma are many layers of dust sediments and rock each
records a slice of time and fills a few pages in the geological record a head lies a catastrophic
landslide that crashed down 15 000 feet and shot debris nearly a hundred miles across the valley
floor beyond the landslide lies another basin containing more layered deposits these offer
glimpses of the past and record part of the valley's complex geological story farther into the basin
the floor is covered by hills made of layered sediments whose origin remains a puzzle winds
blowing for millions of years sculpted the soft ground into long ridges turning up a narrow canyon
and sailing over a gullied ridge we fly into oh fear chasma and find more sediments wind carved
ridges and a steep wall with rock rubble heaped at its foot a long parade of landslides widened
the valley collapsing walls made of hard volcanic rock a flight through mariner valley gives us
an exciting glimpse of its geological complexity buried in the rocks of this grand canyon of all
the planets lies a history book of mars that scientists have just begun to open one day perhaps
soon we'll read the full story of this beautiful and spectacular place wow well how would you like
to hike around in there huh wouldn't that be a great place to have a whole network of trails
or an even grander canyon than our us grand canyon although i should know that unlike our grand
canyon which was carved by the action of water most of valus marineris was created as a gash
due to tectonic motions early in the history of mars okay so the main canyon was this this
rupture in the in the plate however as the movie implied there are these little tributaries and other
pieces of evidence for liquid water having once existed on mars and that's a really important
topic so i want to discuss the water on mars uh for the next few minutes there's a lot of evidence
for this for this water having run on mars long ago there are ancient river beds and flood planes
and you know you look at structures like this which look a lot like places on earth where
rocks from outer space have hit meteorites have hit and they during their impact solidify
the rock they fuse the rock and make it harder than the surrounding soil and then when water
flows along it it goes around these hard areas and forms these teardrop shaped structures you
know in the wake of a hard area you don't have as much water going in and so it forms this teardrop
shaped structure so that that was known even long ago and you know photographs like this
show what look like ancient dry river beds and then there are areas where it looks like there
has been sedimentation and flowing water and other areas where it looks like even quite recently
some ice some of the permafrost where we think the water now exists melted and flowed down the
side of a crater rim or into a crater forming little gullies or channels like this i mean these
sorts of things are are all over the place on mars they're just abundant evidence for water
having once flowed there okay and several recent spacecraft have found indirect evidence for water
for example the mars odyssey spacecraft measured neutrons coming from the surface of mars and the
neutrons come from interactions of charged particles from the sun with the soil but if there's
water in the soil the hydrogen in that water helps block the neutrons that have been dislodged by the
charged particles interacting with the soil so you get fewer neutrons where there's water
or at least hydrogen which is thought to be associated with water in these cases you know
so this is similar to what i described as the evidence for water on the moon in the moon lecture
they look for these neutrons and where there's a deficit of neutrons they infer the presence of
hydrogen and by extension the presence of water because that's the most common compound containing
hydrogen so the blue areas here show where we think there's water and indeed near the polar
caps we do think there's a lot of water but there are other vast regions where it looks like there's
a lot of permafrost just you know ice underneath the exposed surface of mars so this led to headlines
in the weekly world news and other magazines like Noah's Ark found on mars you know Bible
shocker well okay we you know we haven't really found Noah's Ark on mars folks let's not get too
dramatic and sensationalistic about this but but there is a lot of evidence for water having
flowed on mars long ago and most recently the spirit and opportunity rovers in 2004 found
additional evidence for water on mars here's one of these rovers an artist's conception of spirit
the rover and the rovers took photographs of mars and showed what looked like sediments in
some places and also other fine sediments like in this rock outcrop known as El Capitan and in
addition you can see these little blue spheres those are affectionately called blueberries like
like in a blueberry muffin and they are made of hematite and hematite on earth often forms
in the presence of water so if these little globules which are just a few millimeters in size formed
in the same way on mars that suggests that there was water there at one time and moreover in these
and other rocks the geologists found a mineral known as gerusite it is hydrated sulf sulfate it
contains water it forms in the presence of water so there's lots of evidence and other chemical
evidence that i haven't described so if mars used to have water um how come it doesn't anymore
well mars's atmosphere is so thin right now only one percent the pressure of earth's atmosphere
that it can't support liquid water all right so if you go up to the mountains for example you find
that the boiling point of water goes down the higher up in the mountains you go because the
atmospheric pressure decreases and it starts getting easier for the molecules of water to
come off of the water and turn into gas well where you have no pressure or very little pressure the
molecules just come right off the liquid and the liquid doesn't exist okay so mars's atmospheric
pressure right now is far too low to support the presence of liquid water but if there was liquid
water long ago that implies then that the atmosphere must have been thick long ago and
we think that indeed mars had a lush atmosphere for the first half billion to billion years of its
existence and the water flowed freely and microbial life might might have formed you know so it could
well have had life early on so what happened to the thick atmosphere you know if it thinned out
where'd it go suppose there was initially for some reason a cooling trend on mars then some of the
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would freeze out that would decrease the amount of greenhouse
warming on mars that would lead to even lower temperatures causing more freeze out of the
carbon dioxide causing even less greenhouse heating causing even more freezing out and so on
this is similar to the greenhouse effect but running backwards it's it's called the inverse
greenhouse effect so mars may have became mars may have become too cold for the opposite reason
to that which you know formed the high temperatures on venus so venus became too hot mars too cold
and earth is just right like the goldilocks porridge you know so that may be what happened
to mars another hypothesis is that because mars is small and lost its heat early on and so there's
not much convection going on it didn't have a very strong magnetic field after about a billion
years or so and without a strong magnetic field the sun's solar wind could help blow away the
atmosphere so that may have contributed to perhaps some of the early loss of mars's atmosphere and
then maybe an inverse greenhouse effect took over something like that maybe that's what happened
well people have long been interested as i said in life and so
nasa sent two viking landers in the mid 1970s to mars to specifically look for chemical evidence
and biological evidence for life they looked for organic compounds and they also took some soil
um from from the surface near the viking lander and they took that soil and they put it into a
broth kind of like chicken soup thinking that if there are microbes there they will respond
in a positive way to that chicken soup and their metabolic processes will will increase and they'll
start respiration and other biological processes and so they they looked for these signs of life
and initially it looked like there really is life on mars it looked like the whatever was in
the soil was interacting with the nutrients and utilizing the nutrients and and perspiring and
stuff like that but later it was just determined that these were all these results were all
explainable in terms of normal non-biological chemical reactions and particularly bad for
the life hypothesis was that no organic compounds whatsoever were found in a soil analysis now that
doesn't mean that life never existed on mars on the surface of mars the ultraviolet rays from the
sun will destroy organic compounds and so maybe they've just been destroyed and if they dug deep
into mars maybe they would find organic compounds but but certainly the news wasn't as good as if
they had found organic compounds right so you know it's still possible that there was at one time
and perhaps still is microbial life on mars but there's no clear evidence for it there's no compelling
evidence the strongest evidence that has come has come from this martian meteorite that was found
in the Antarctic in 1984 near a place called allen hills its chemical composition is is that
of mars it clearly came from mars and it is thought to be a portion of mars that's four and a half
billion years old it was blasted away from the martian surface about about 15 million years ago
by a meteorite impact then it wandered around in the solar system landed on earth 13 000 years ago
and then was found in 1984 and analyzed in 1986 and this meteorite shows a number of signs of possible
life chemical evidence being the main sign for example there are these carbonate globules in
the meteorite that resemble carbonate globules that are known to form here on earth in the presence
of water and there are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah's which are not exclusively formed by
biological activity but can be formed by by by such activity and the kinds that were found in
this meteorite were unusual so so you know there's water there's pah's there's also magnetite which
is produced by some types of bacteria and there's other signs of chemical disequilibrium suggested
suggestive of life and finally and most famously there are these tube-like structures which were
widely shown in the news and were suggested by some people as being like the nano bacteria
found here on earth but these unfortunately are much smaller than the nano bacteria here on earth
all of these signs of life suggested that there may have been life on mars and there were some
pretty big headlines like on the canadian version of time magazine life on mars and in big letters
but i think that the consensus now is that the all of these explain all of these all of these
phenomena have more conventional non-biological explanations okay and though it is possible
that they all point to the presence of of microbes and and bacteria on mars as carl sagan used to
say extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence as long as there are other explanations
sort of not as sensational ones we shouldn't jump to the conclusion this amazing conclusion that
there was definitely life on mars you know that i mean that would be a wonderful discovery i hope
we find life on mars but we had better be darn sure before we go around saying that yep there
there really is life on mars interestingly given that this meteorite came from mars to earth it is
conceivable that if it did have primitive bacteria and microbes those could have polluted the earth
for the first time with life and then through evolution we came about and all the other
animals came about so if that's the case we may be the descendants of martians or some sort of
space space aliens you know that's pretty far-fetched but it's not completely impossible it's it's
conceivable that there was contamination of earth by a rock and microbes from from the planet mars
and if we ever get a good sample of the dna from one of these martian creatures if we ever do
find a martian creature and if it's very closely resembles the dna here on earth that will pretty
much seal the case but at this point i emphasize that it is very very speculative
