I ended the previous lecture with some sunset photos showing you pillars of light reflected
off of flat ice crystals and sun dogs and things like that.
And you of course noticed the vivid colors, the yellows, oranges and reds of sunset with
which we're so familiar.
What produces those colors?
We'll explore that in today's lecture.
But first let's consider the blue daytime sky.
Why is the sky blue during the day?
Well, let's look at this diagram here.
We are standing on the ground and we're enveloped in the air.
And suppose the sun's high in the sky and is shining in all directions, but let's follow
this ray right here.
The air molecules and also the particles of dust and other stuff in the atmosphere scatter
or reflect many of the particles of light, many of the waves.
And it turns out that the blues, violets and greens tend to be scattered or reflected
more easily than reds and oranges.
So violet is scattered best, then blue, then green and so on.
Well that means that the air molecules will appear some mixture of colors, violet, blue
and green, but the sun doesn't emit all that much violet light.
And moreover our eyes aren't all that sensitive to violet and the green isn't reflected
as well as blue is, so the predominant color ends up being blue.
So you're looking here at the sky and the light that reaches your eye tends to be mostly
blue.
That's why the sky is blue during the day away from the sun.
Now when the sun is high in the sky, the sun itself appears white, not yellow.
This is a myth that it's yellow.
You know all the coloring books that we ever have have the yellow sun and kids books portray
the sun as being yellow, but it really isn't yellow and there are many ways to demonstrate
that.
You could just hold up a sheet of paper like this during the daytime and see that it's
basically a white color.
And sunlight is what we define to be white light and there are other ways of seeing that
the sun is white like during an eclipse as I'll discuss in a few lectures.
Now when the sun is near the horizon, it often does have a yellow color and that's in fact
when it's safe to look at the sun, you can see it and it looks yellow or even orange
or red and so this myth has grown that the sun is yellow.
Really it's white.
Now it also often appears yellow or some other color in photographs, but that's because the
photographers simply used a filter.
In this particular case, a yellow filter was shown, was used and you know the sun looks
basically yellow, but if you were to observe it without a filter, it would look white.
Now as the sun goes from being high in the sky to low, the length through the atmosphere
that the light passes increases.
Alright, let me show you that.
Here we are standing on earth and the earth is a big sphere and the atmosphere is pretty
thin above us, so you can consider the atmosphere to a good first approximation to just be this
rectangular box on this screen, alright?
When the sun is high in the sky, way up off the screen of course, it's very far away,
93 million miles away, it passes through a certain amount of atmosphere.
When the sun is tilted, that is closer to the horizon, you can see that the path length
through the atmosphere is greater than when the sun was nearly overhead.
So as the path lengthens, there's more and more opportunity for the violets, blues and
greens to be scattered or reflected away from our line of sight.
And that means that the beam of light that filters through gets progressively more yellow,
orange and red because you are selectively filtering out the violets, blues and greens
as the sun's light is traversing progressively more of the atmosphere.
So what's left are the oranges, yellows and reds.
So as the sun gets lower and lower, that is closer and closer to the horizon and it passes
through more atmosphere, more of the blues and greens get scattered.
More of the blues and greens also get absorbed, that is there's dust and smog and smoke and
particulate matter in the atmosphere that tends to absorb the blues and greens more
than the oranges and the reds.
And that too contributes to the ever reddening color of the sun as it is setting.
So let me illustrate that with a little diagram here which shows incoming sunlight interacting
with Earth's atmosphere and the extent of the atmosphere is greatly exaggerated in this
diagram.
And I will show what happens when you increase the amount of dust and particles and other
things that are able to reflect the light.
You see more and more of the violet, blue and green rays get scattered or reflected
upwards away from the people who are standing here viewing sunset.
Let's do that again.
So we're dragging it over here, increasing the amount of particulate matter and the sun
is getting more orange and red and the sky is not as deep a blue, okay, now look at that.
Now that did not include the effect of absorption of light by dust and particles.
That was just showing the reflection, the scattering, but the absorption of dust and
by dust and particles also helps deepen the orange and red colors of the setting sun.
In this photograph you can directly see a sequence of images of the setting sun when
it was pretty high up and fairly white looking, a little bit of a tinge of yellow, down to
quite a bit more yellow and then orange and finally even red as the sun set in this fairly
dust filled environment.
The light rays here were being quite absorbed, at least the blues and violets were, whereas
up here they weren't being that much absorbed and yet the sun isn't all that high above
the horizon here.
So that suggests to me that right over this city there's quite a lot of particulate matter
that doesn't rise very high up into the air because even at a fairly low elevation the
sun here looked fairly white and not very red and then there's this dramatic shift to
reds as the sun got lower, so that's a particularly striking example of the effects of dust and
particles on the setting sun.
Now here the effect is so striking that even over a diameter of the sun you can see that
at the top the sun is a lot more yellow than near the bottom where it's sort of oranges
or even a little bit red.
So in this particular case there seems to be a fairly pronounced layer of stuff that's
fairly thick and then it rapidly thins out because you can see this gradient or this
change in color over the face of the sun, that's quite a dramatic effect.
Now as the sun is setting and it's blue and violet light has been filtered out, of course
what remains are the oranges and yellows and reds and those are the colors, those are the
light rays that then illuminate whatever clouds happen to be around, right?
So just as we see blue oranges and reds on the face of the sun, so too clouds if they
have eyes or if they had eyes would be able to see an orange and red sun and light reflecting
off of those clouds comes down to us and we see it.
So here's this diagram where there's the setting sun which is now red, the light that's streaming
through is orange or red and it hits clouds, whatever clouds it hits reflect that light
to our eyes.
The clouds reflect the colors that hit them and we see oranges and reds and yellows.
The degree to which the sky is yellow or orange depends on the amount of particulate matter,
how much of the stuff is there to absorb the blues and the violets.
So different sunsets of course have different conditions.
There's different amounts of smoke and smog in the air and so every sunset is different
and the locations of the clouds are different and so the whole patterns change from one
sunset to another in this almost endless variety of beautiful sunsets that we are privileged
to see down here from the surface of the earth.
It's just fantastic.
I love watching sunsets from Hawaii and other places and the clouds and the colors can change
over really short time intervals as many of you I'm sure have seen.
Here is a photograph taken at one instant and you can see in fact some sheets of rain
coming down and just a few minutes later the colors had changed quite a lot and here's
this sheet of rain having moved over a little bit but these changes occur very, very quickly.
Now you could look only toward the sun at sunset but then you'd miss the phenomena that might
be going on all around you.
Look away from the sun as well.
Here's a photograph taken about 90 degrees away from the direction of the sun and you
can see the beautiful sunlit clouds up here and even in the direction opposite to that
of the sun you can get these light rays filtering through, reflecting off of these clouds, suppose
the clouds had eyes they would see a very orange sun but here we see the light reflected
off the clouds back to us.
So look all around when you're looking at the sky.
Now the moon also can appear different shades of yellow or orange when it is rising or setting
for the very same reason.
The light gets reflected by the moon, it's sunlight of course but it gets reflected by
the moon and then it filters through our atmosphere and looking here at this photo you can see
that here the atmosphere was very clear it didn't have many dust particles or smoke and
so the rising moon looked nearly white, a little bit yellow but certainly not blood
red or anything like that, rising near these ancient Greek ruins.
Here's another photograph of the moon rising and in this case there was a little bit more
particulate matter in the air and so it appears sort of more orange than it did in that other
photograph and depending again on circumstances how much stuff there is in the air you can
get a variety of colors during moon rise and moon set just as you get a variety of colors
during sunrise and sunset.
It's just that there's not enough light from the moon to illuminate clouds and so you don't
see the cloud colors during moon rise and moon set the way you see the cloud colors during
sunrise and sunset.
It's interesting that when the moon and the sun are right at the horizon just a little
bit above the horizon they've actually already set so when the sun is setting and you see
it just above the horizon it's actually physically already below the horizon or when it's rising
and it's just above the horizon it's still slightly below the horizon and the reason
for that is that the light upon entering the atmosphere gets bent or refracted remember
I said that light entering glass or water gets bent well it gets bent ever so slightly
when it enters air because air is not a vacuum it's not nothingness so the air bends the
light a little bit and so here's the sun's true position below our horizon the ray of
light is coming in like this being bent and it enters your eye here but your eye and your
brain don't know that the light was bent along the way they only see the direction from which
the light was coming and that direction is this line here so you see the sun appears
higher than its true position because the light rays have been bent along the way and
the magnitude of this effect is about one full sun or moon diameter in other words when
the moon or the sun are just just kissing the horizon they're actually one whole diameter
below the horizon interesting effect so you get a little bit more daytime than you would
have had there not been this atmospheric effect now when the sun is that low and setting or
just about to rise an amazing phenomenon can be seen the green flash here's an example
of it so there's the sun setting and in this particular case there's not much dust in the
air so the sun appears a little bit yellow almost white and as it sets you begin to see
a tinge of green here and then even more green and this effect of a green setting sun can
last for several seconds in good conditions here's a pair of photographs showing this
green setting sun or called the green flash and it's a rare phenomenon but it can be seen
when you have exceptionally clear conditions and a very nice flat true horizon without
mountains and buildings and trees and here's how it comes about so remember the sun's true
position when it's setting is below the horizon but it appears above because of the bending
or refraction of light well remember that blue light gets bent more than red light so
what happens is that the blue light comes in to your eyes at a steeper angle than the red light
does so your eye thinks that the blue sun is higher up in the sky than the red sun and the green
rays which are not shown here but they would be intermediate between red and blue they come in
at an intermediate angle and so you see the green sun in between red and blue now in reality these
overlapping images are nearly coincident I've greatly exaggerated the effect here so they're
nearly on top of each other nevertheless green and blue are above red now when the sun is that
low most of the blue light has been scattered away you don't see any of that light anyway it's
been scattered and absorbed what remains is the green if you're lucky and the oranges and yellows
and reds so what's happening is that as the sun sets all these overlapping images are nearly
coincident but a little button of green light appears at the very top because all the others
have overlapped and there should be a little button of blue light at the very top but the blue
gets easily absorbed and scattered so you don't see that so as the sun sets the last bit to set
is this little green part here and that's the green flash or at least in principle it should be if
the story were this simple here's what we would see you'd have the setting sun setting below in
this case the blue horizon and there's a little bit of a green tinge at the top and it would just
go boom and there'd be a little bit of green there but really not much let's do that again
boy it sure doesn't last long there's a little green tinge up here see that and that's the last
part to go down so you would see it right there a bit of green but boy that's a pretty fleeting
effect you know that didn't last very long you'd never notice the green flash if that were all
there is to it so there's got to be something more and it turns out that the extra factor
is mirages the sun's light gets miraged let me explain what i mean here's a sequence of photographs
of the setting sun and you can see it's highly distorted by different amounts of bending by
different layers in the atmosphere layers having different temperatures and different densities
and stuff so here's a bit of the sun broken off and here it's all distorted and then you're looking
at the top of the sun here and it's almost like the top is breaking off look at that part of the
sun broke off holy cow what happened there well you know a physical part of the sun didn't break
off you know and sun didn't bifurcate into two or anything like that what happened is there was a
mirage and under exceptional circumstances the top part of the mirage can be this green button
this green top of the sun that gets lifted above the rest of it and causing it to be visible for
a slightly longer amount of time than you would otherwise have predicted so let's consider the
two main kinds of mirages the first is called the inferior mirage that's what happens when you have
hot ground heating up the air just above it with a cool denser layer of air above that
in that case an incoming light ray gets bent toward the denser cooler air so it gets bent
in this direction sort of concave up and it enters your eye like so now your eye and your brain
don't know that it was bent all they know is the direction along which the light entered your eye so
your eye thinks that the light came from over here and what you see is an image of the blue sky
and that's what forms the familiar lake or ocean mirage that wanders in the desert you know they
see this this lake in front of them they go ah an oasis we've been saved you know well unfortunately
for them it's just a mirage and as they get closer and closer to it the thing remains at the same
distance because it's just an illusion it's a mirage all right there's another type of mirage
called the superior mirage and that happens when you have cold dense air near the ground or near
the ocean is often the case with hotter less dense air above in that case if you have an
object down here light rays will get bent like this causing the eye to see the object as being
higher than its true position on earth or above the earth and the rays that start from higher up
are bent less than the rays that start from lower down because there's this change in the density
of the air that cold is densest air the kind that can cause the most bending is closest to the ocean
and if the light ray starts from well above that it doesn't get bent as much so that light ray
doesn't enter your eye at as steep an angle so what you get is an inverted image of your object
it's a fantastic phenomenon here's an example of it here's this ship on the ocean and you can see
the true image of the ship but also the inverted mirage image look at that the bottom of the ship
is now at the top it's incredible in fact here's an actual video taken by Pekka Parvianen in Finland
of a ship cruising by and it's like a double-decker it's fantastic there's the image of the ship as
it would normally appear but then there are rays of light that get refracted or bent like this causing
an inverted image of the same ship above the other image and the top of the ship is above
this layer of cold and dense air and so it didn't get miraged at all so that's really a fantastic
thing mirages are fun to look for okay so now let's look let's apply what we know about mirages
to the setting sun and see how it helps make a more enhanced green flash
here is the sun setting with this refraction taken into account and the mirage is taken into account
so notice how the sun got distorted on its way down and now a little bit gets lifted up
and causes and hovers above the horizon for a longer time than would have been the case had
there been no mirage you can tell there are mirages going on because the sun is all distorted
so now the top of the sun breaks off and it's that green piece of the sun that hovers above the
horizon for an extra few seconds allowing you to see the green flash here's another animation
showing a different temperature and density structure in the atmosphere of the earth so now
the mirages that you see differ in detail from the ones in the previous animation and still you
can see that there's a bit of the sun hovering above the horizon detached from the rest of the
sun and that part of the sun is that little green button that i was talking about enhanced a little
bit look at that boom it looked green so here's an actual video again taken by pekka parvianan
of the setting sun in real time and you can see that the different layers of air in the atmosphere
have tremendously distorted the shape of the sun but the basic idea is that a little part near the
top gets detached and that detached part is that little green button that i showed you in the
diagram and then it fades away so it's just a marvelous effect it's hard to see not many people
have seen the green flash in fact a lot of people think that it's sort of a myth but it's not a myth
you really can't see it then some people think that oh it's some sort of a physiological effect
the sun is red at sunset and if you look away from the sun the complementary color is green so
that's what you see well yes that is what you see if you stare at a red sun and then look away
but that's not the cause of the green flash you really can see the green flash for real if
if you have proper conditions in fact if conditions are really good and the sky is
exceptionally clear you don't have much dust in the air then you can even see a blue flash
so here's a sequence of four images of the sun as it's getting lower and lower and you can see in
that last image the sun actually looks blue not green and that's because this image was was taken
when this when the atmosphere was so clear that there was very little particulate matter
absorbing the blue rays so in that case there was a tiny fraction of the sun that looked blue at the
very top of the green image you could actually see the blue image and that was the last one
to disappear now you can see this really well sometimes during sunrise because during the
course of the night a lot of the particles settled out of the atmosphere and things kind of became
stable and all the junk that normally fills the atmosphere during the day got filtered out so
i've seen one blue flash at sunrise and it was a marvelous experience by the way if you observe
the green flash at sunrise you know that it's not a physiological effect because the first bit of
the sun that you see is the blue or green part it couldn't have been a physiological afterglow
of having seen a previously red sunset okay well when should you look for the green flash
it's of paramount importance to have a very nice true low horizon no mountains no trees
no buildings because those sorts of objects form a false horizon when something is setting on top
of a building it's not really setting below the earth's surface it's just a false horizon so
you don't get much bending of light and you don't get the green flash you also need conditions
to be very clear very few clouds at the position of the sun of course and very little particulate
matter not much dust and smog okay that's when you see the green flash so you don't want to be
looking at the sun when it looks deep orange or blood red like this because all the blues and greens
have been filtered out even the yellows have been filtered out you want to look at the sun when it
looks yellow or white that means there's not many particles in the sky and part of the sun can be
blocked as long as the part above the horizon is clear then you can see a green flash just as it's
setting when you're monitoring the sun just before sunset be very careful don't stare at the sun
never stare at the sun especially when it's high in the sky it's better not to stare at it even when
it's pretty low because it can burn your eyes okay maybe take a glance at it every once in a while
every 10 or 20 seconds glance at it to make sure that you haven't missed sunset and then look away
that'll also help save your eyes your eyes get desensitized if you stare at the sun and then you
won't see the green flashes easily or you could take a a piece of filtered glass like this and and
look at the sun every once in a while this is shade 14 welder's glass you can get it in welding
stores and if you look at the sun through this that is a safe way of monitoring its progress
and then maybe 10 seconds or so before sunset itself then you can start looking at the sun more
continuously and looking for the green flash okay well another phenomenon that you see around the
time of sunset is called sun rays or buddha's rays or crepuscular rays and here's an example
here's a cloud bank and the sun is behind the cloud bank and it's getting close to sunset but you
see all these apparently diverging rays of sunlight with dark bands in between here they're pointing
down but you can also have the sun below the clouds and these diverging rays basically point
up so the sun is right down there somewhere these are called sun rays or crepuscular rays crepuscular
means twilight or like twilight dim and hazy the rays are seen most easily around twilight
when the atmosphere is becoming pretty dark already because there's not much sunlight hitting
hitting the atmosphere so the sky is getting pretty dark but along some directions sunlight hits
that atmosphere those directions that are not blocked by clouds are still being hit by the sun
if there are clouds in the way well those clouds produce shadows so some parts of that atmosphere
are in this are in the shadow of the clouds other parts are still being illuminated by the sun
and the contrast is what forms these rays they appear to fan out because the rays are coming in
nearly parallel they only appear to be fanning out because of a perspective effect the vanishing
point okay this is something very familiar if you look at sunlight streaming through a forest
filled with smoke from campfires here it is and the light rays are coming in intrinsically parallel
but they appear to fan out diverge from the sun because of this perspective effect the vanishing
point and you can see this very nicely if you look in a hallway like this and see all the
intrinsically parallel edges of the roof or the or the sidewalk here converging at a distance
another example of course is if you're on railroad tracks they converge if you look far away so here
we see these sun rays apparently diverging from their convergence point but really they're coming
in parallel into the earth's atmosphere and they only appear to diverge because of this this
perspective effect now you can see the sun rays even when the sun is very close to or even below
the horizon if you have clouds near the horizon and the sun is below them then some of the clouds
block the rays and so you get a shadow other places where there are gaps between the clouds
allow the sun's rays to hit this darkening sky and so you get this effect of the rays fanning out
from a hidden sun because of the shadowing effect of the of the clouds and here it's kind of a bit
hard to see but very faintly you can see these these sun rays fanning out from below the horizon the
sun's actually below the horizon and there must be clouds below the horizon that are blocking
selectively sun paths and allowing other sun rays to filter through and so that's a beautiful effect
now in some cases you can even see rays on the opposite side of the sky these are called the
anti-solar crepuscular rays and they are just the rays that you would see in the opposite direction
to the sun so just turn around and look at the place opposite sunset and you will see these rays
converging they converge for the very same reason that if you're standing on a railroad track and
look in one direction the railroad track converges to a vanishing point then turn around and look at
the opposite direction the rays or the railroad tracks converge in the very same way so these
parallel streams of light are going through the atmosphere emanating from the sun apparently
diverging and then converging on the opposite part of the sky and finally when you're looking at
these phenomena you can sometimes see a dark blue band just above the horizon that's actually the
earth's shadow the earth is shadowing part of the atmosphere here you can see it nicely at lick
observatory above the shadow these parts of the atmosphere still see a little bit of sunlight
but those parts there are already in the earth's shadow and as sunset progresses the shadow grows
more and more and looms above you and twilight starts when the whole shadow envelops you and at
that point the planets and stars begin to begin to come out and it's time to start observing the night sky
