We now come to the third unit in the first major part of this course.
In this unit we will discuss some of the basic concepts and tools used by astronomers such
as what are the vast distances involved and how do we study objects that are far away
using their light and how do we collect that light with telescopes and detect it with detectors,
things like that. We'll start by trying to get some idea of the absolute size of the solar system
and of the rest of the universe. Now you will recall in lecture 13 where I showed a table
derived by Copernicus or at least the middle column. The left and middle columns were derived
by Copernicus for the relative distances between the Sun and the six known planets.
If you make the distance one for the distance of the Earth from the Sun, one so-called astronomical
unit, then you find that Mercury is about 40 percent of an astronomical unit from the Sun,
Venus about 70 percent, Mars about 50 percent more than the Earth's distance, Jupiter roughly
5 times Earth's distance from the Sun and Saturn roughly 9 or 10 times Earth's distance from the
Sun. And you can see from the table of the modern values that Copernicus had the relative distances
pretty well down. He was pretty accurate. But what is one astronomical unit? How many
miles is it? How many kilometers is it? How do we get the absolute physical scale of the solar system?
This was a big problem in science all the way through the middle of the 18th century.
People had some approximations but they didn't really have a very good
accurate estimate for the distances in the solar system. Now a key to getting the distance scale
was a transit of Venus across the face of the Sun. By transit I mean Venus goes between
Earth and the Sun and sometimes it is right smack along a line from the Earth to the Sun
and it's a little disk that passes across the face of the Sun. Here you can see it when it
last did this in 2004. It slowly traverses the face of the Sun taking a number of hours to fully
cross it. And you can see it's just like a little disk about a 30th of the diameter of the Sun
going across the face of the Sun. Now this is kind of a rare event. It happens about eight years apart
and then not for over another century. Okay so it happened in 2004 and it'll happen again in 2012
but prior to that it last happened in the late 19th century and prior to that it happened in 1761
and 1769. Those two transits provided a key to the determination of the physical length
of the astronomical unit as I'll now describe. The point is the following. Depending on the
location from which you look on Earth the exact position of Venus on the disk of the Sun will
shift a little bit. This is sort of like if I'm looking at two people in the audience say Noel
and Jane and say Noel and Steve and I look at Noel with one eye closed and the other open. My
finger is aligned along the line of sight to Noel and then if I close that first eye and open the
other eye my finger shifts toward the direction of Steve. So if I do this kind of a blinking exercise
my finger shifts relative to the distant background. Now the background shifts a little bit too
depending on how far away it is but in the approximation of an infinitely far background
just the nearby thing shifts relative to the unshifting background. All right so this is
known as a parallax and so if you look at Venus from different parts of the Earth you'll notice
that it shifts a tiny bit in relation to say the Sun's edge or the middle. This parallax technique
is used by surveyors to get the distances of objects. So here's an example of surveyors trying
to get the distance across the stream to a tree. They can measure the apparent position of the tree
from point A here and the tree looks as though it's along the line of sight to some other
background trees or hills. From a different point B separated by a baseline which you know
the tree looks like it's in a different direction. The tree of course is in absolute space in the
same place but it shifts relative to background objects and if you measure this angle that's
just the angle of the shift. It's the angle over which my finger seemed to move when I blinked my
eyes. So if you measure this angle and you know the length of this baseline here there is only
one triangle that can be consistently drawn having those properties. If you've got an angle here and
that angle there is the same and you know this baseline and you measure this angle that defines
one unique triangle and you can therefore determine the distance to the tree or whatever object you're
trying to measure. So let's take a look at Venus. Venus is projected onto the disc of the sun
and we can view it from two points P on earth P and P prime relative to each other they're
separated by some north south distance you can you can measure that and here's Venus and the sun
is farther away so relative to the sun Venus suffers a parallax or a shift by an angle which
we will call Greek lowercase alpha. Now a complication as I mentioned is that the sun shifts
as well relative to even more distant background objects so you have to take that into account
but you know you can figure all that out. So for simplicity we'll just consider this angle alpha
a measurement of the angle alpha with a known baseline between the two points from which you're
observing Venus solves this triangle completely and tells you the distance of Venus. Knowing the
relative distance between the sun, mercury, Venus, and earth you can then figure out the
distance of the astronomical unit because you've measured directly the physical distance of Venus.
Now the problem is that the shift for say two observers separated by an earth radius is only
about a third of the diameter of Venus it's very small so this would have been a tall order for
people in the middle 18th century it's a very difficult shift to measure but Edmund Halley of
Halley's comet fame realized that instead of measuring the actual parallax shift you can
measure the time it takes that is Venus to take to transit across the face of the sun. If you look
at this image this projection of Venus onto the face of the sun the transit as seen from point p on
earth takes some total time t and the transit as seen from point p prime on the earth takes some
total time t prime and the difference between those transit times is is correlated with the
angular parallax shift alpha and you can figure out one from the other. So this was done in 1761
and 1769 by a number of observers in 1761 the more famous ones were Charles Mason and his
surveyor partner Jeremiah Dixon of the famous Mason-Dixon line they did this measurement
and came up with a value for the astronomical unit and in 1769 even more accurate measurements
were made most famously by Captain James Cook who traveled to Tahiti funded by King George III
in order to make this measurement and also of course to observe the unknown lands down under
which then England claimed to be their own New Zealand and the east coast of of Australia in
particular and so from these observations in 1761 and 1769 the value of the astronomical unit
was determined quite accurately to be about 153 million kilometers now we know the value
through radar measurements and you know light rays bouncing back and forth and things like that
we know the value is more like 150 instead of 153 million but that's an error of only two percent
in the middle of the 18th century that's pretty darn good so the problem was was solved at that point
so now we know the distance to the sun there it is the setting sun and it's 150 million
kilometers away that's equivalent to about 93 million miles so let's write this out one
astronomical unit is 150 million kilometers now that's getting to be a lot of zeros maybe you can
keep track of those but we'll soon get to distances in astronomy where the number of zeros grows even
more so we like to use a type of notation called scientific or exponential notation or some people
now call it calculator notation I mentioned it briefly a few lectures ago let me consider it in
somewhat more detail now because we'll be using it quite a bit in this course 150 million can be written
as a number between one and ten that's 1.5 times 10 to the eighth power now this exponent eight here
tells you how many spaces you need to move the decimal point one two three four five six seven
eight to get that number back again okay so it's just a simple way of condensing the the notation
and on calculators this is often written 1.5 e eight now if you have a negative negative exponent
you just move the decimal point to the left so for example here's 0.000128 you know it's kind of
kind of awkward to keep track of all these zeros so you just write the number as 1.28 times 10
raised to some exponent and that exponent is some simply the number of spaces you had to move the
decimal point in this case one two three four five so it's 1.28 times 10 to the minus five
or 1.28 e minus five in calculator notation now 150 million kilometers is equivalent to 93 million
miles so you can write that as 9.3 times 10 to the seventh miles since one kilometer is about 0.62
mile while we're on the subject let me mention metric versus british units i will sort of use
the two interchangeably although i prefer the metric units to me they're more natural so let's
just be on the same page here and know what i'm talking about a meter is slightly bigger than a
yard it's 39.37 inches a yard is 36 inches a kilometer is simply a thousand meters kilo is
the prefix that means thousand some people call it kilometer that's fine too and that's about 0.62
of a mile a centimeter is one one hundredth of a meter centi means one one hundredth and that's
about 0.39 of an inch there are 2.5 centimeters per inch so that's the length units in mass
for the metric system we use grams or kilograms one pound is about 454 of these things grams
and a kilogram which is a thousand grams is about 2.2 pounds all right well the astronomical unit is
a convenient unit for for distances in our solar system for example the the planet Saturn is about
9.5 astronomical units away from the sun Jupiter is 5.2 all these numbers are of order
unity or 10 you know Pluto is maybe 40 astronomical units away from the sun so the astronomical
unit is a convenient unit for the solar system but when you go to stars like these here or galaxies
giant collections of hundreds of billions of stars or clusters of galaxies which are giant
collections of galaxies separated by large distances the astronomical unit is is just woe
fully inadequate need you'd be talking about so many millions and quadrillions of astronomical
units it wouldn't even be funny and even with scientific notation you'd have to keep track of
an awful lot of zeros so we want a different unit of measurement and a very convenient unit of
measurement is the light travel time the time it takes for light to travel from one place to another
now the speed of light is about 300 000 kilometers per second or 186 000 miles per second it's the
largest possible speed of transmission of information through the universe later i'll tell you that the
universe itself can expand faster than the speed of light yep i'm not just some guy from berserkly
telling you that it really is true the universe can expand faster than the speed of light but nothing
can travel through the universe and carry information at a speed faster than that of light
okay so that's like the speed limit here's this t-shirt from another one of my favorite t-shirt
companies called purely academic speed limit 186 000 miles per second not just a good idea it's the
law okay so that's just the way it goes and light is also very convenient because it always moves
with that speed at least through a vacuum now in water and air and ice and glass it can slow down
i'll talk about that later but in a vacuum it always travels at that speed so given that it's a
rapid speed and it's always the same we can determine or talk about the distances of objects
in units of how long it took for light to travel from that object to us so for example
the moon is 384 000 kilometers away you can ask how long did it take for the light that we see
from the moon to reflect off of the moon you know it came from the sun but once it reflected off the
moon how long did it take to reach us it's 384 000 kilometers away how long did it take for
that light to reach us well when something is traveling at a constant speed the equation for
distance traversed in a given amount of time is distance equals speed times time for a constant
speed that's what you get so if you're going at 60 miles an hour after two hours you've gone 60 times
two or 120 miles it's that simple so d distance equals v speed times t so i can divide both sides
of the equation by v the v's cancel out here and you get t equals d over v or in the case of light
where v equals c we have t equals d over c so let's calculate how long it takes light to travel
from the moon 384 000 kilometers away at the speed of light 300 000 kilometers per second how long
does it take to get to us well 3.84 times 10 to the fifth kilometers divided by three times 10 to
the fifth kilometers per second is just 1.3 seconds the 10 of the fives conveniently cancel out
it takes light 1.3 seconds to travel from the moon to us we say that the moon is 1.3 light seconds
away now there's a practical application to this when the astronauts went to the moon in the late
60s and early 70s stepped on the moon at neil armstrong's famous footstep and there there they are
standing around planting the american flag and everyone was ecstatic and the people at mission
control said hey neil you know how does it feel to be on the moon you know and like three seconds
went by and neil said oh you know it's great you know one small step for man one giant leap for
mankind you know and then they'd ask something else and there'd be this delay this awkward three
second delay and you wonder you know are the astronauts oxygen deprived or something you
know well are they thinking slowly or something like that well no they were wearing oxygen tanks
and they were not oxygen deprived the point is is that it would take 1.3 seconds for the question
from mission control traveling along weighty traveling along radio waves we will discuss later
that radio waves are a form of light they travel at the speed of light so it would take 1.3 seconds
for the question to reach the astronauts on the moon and then even if they answered instantaneously
it would take another 1.3 seconds for that answer to come back for a total round trip time of 2.6
seconds and that's the minimum round trip time for even the shortest conversation if you pause a
little bit to think well that brings you up to three seconds so you know the the conversation
was sort of halting in this way now you might say okay well 1.3 light seconds away big deal
that's not all that useful we could have dealt with 384 000 kilometers after all well that's true
but let's go on to bigger distances and see where the light travel time really pays big
dividends the time it takes light to travel from an object is proportional to and it's this little
symbol here that kind of looks like a Greek alpha proportional to the distance of the object
t is proportional to d why do i say that well i already told you that t equals the distance d
over c so that's like 1 over c times the distance and c is a constant so the inverse of c is a
constant so what you have is a constant multiplying d so 1 over c is the constant of proportionality
and the interesting variable is the distance d so the sun for example is 390 times more distant
from us than the moon is so it should take 390 times longer for light to reach us from the sun
than from the moon well 390 times 1.3 seconds is about 500 seconds which is about eight and a
third minutes it takes about eight and a third minutes for light to travel from the sun to us
i mean the light that the sun could suddenly be blinked out by some supreme being and we wouldn't
know it for 8.3 minutes because there's already light along the way all right the sun has already
emitted some light so we wouldn't know for 8.3 minutes that it has been blinked out we say that
the sun is 8.3 light minutes away now a light minute is simply are just like a regular minute but
but less filling so haha anyway bad bad joke anyway so there's the sun 8.3 minutes away
in terms of travel time for the for the for the light so then let's ask okay well how far does
light travel in one year well distance is speed times time okay which is ct so you could write
d equals the speed of light 300 000 kilometers per second times one year but if you just multiplied
that out you'd get some weird units kilometer years per second well you know that's perfectly
permissible but it doesn't give you a very good intuitive feeling for what's going on you have
to convert one year into seconds in order for the units to cancel out and to be left with
a unit of distance kilometers so how many seconds are there in a year well there's 60 seconds in a
minute and 60 minutes in an hour so you see the minutes cancel out and there are 24 hours in a day
so you see the hours cancel out and there are 365.25 days per year so the days cancel out
and you multiply all those numbers together and you get that there are 3.156 times 10 of the seven
seconds so 31.56 million seconds and pi is 3.14159 and so on so I simply remember this that
there are pi times 10 of the seven seconds per year kind of an interesting number that's not
where pi comes from but it just happens to turn out that that's the number of seconds in a year
all right so now let's substitute for one year pi times 10 of the seven seconds we get that one
light year is 300 000 kilometers per second multiplied by 3.156 times 10 of the seven seconds
in one year and you get 9.5 times 10 to the 12 kilometers nearly 10 trillion kilometers and
now you're beginning to see the benefits not only of the light travel time but also of using scientific
notation 10 trillion kilometers is 10 million million kilometers okay it's one large distance
and that's how far light travels in one year it's about six trillion or six million million
miles wow okay all right well the nearest star is four of these things four light years away
4.2 in fact so here it is alpha centauri actually the nearest star is its companion you can't see it
in this photograph but the companion proximus centauri is 4.2 light years away alpha centauri
is a tiny bit farther away so you're actually seeing the star as it was a little over four years ago
because it has taken that long for the light to travel from it to us that's the nearest star the
other stars you see here are tens hundreds even thousands of light years away so you're seeing
them as they were tens hundreds or thousands of years ago you are looking back in time and that
is a fundamental concept a very very fundamental concept the nearest big galaxy to our own the
andromeda galaxy is 2.4 million light years away so you're seeing it and you can see it with the
naked eye by the way or a good pair of binoculars you can see it and yet the light has been traveling
to you for 2.4 million years right around when early hominids were wandering around on earth
that's when the light that you are now seeing from the andromeda galaxy first left the andromeda
galaxy and you see other galaxies even farther away and hence even farther back in time here are
galaxies 60 million light years away and that's still pretty near on a cosmic scale
here are some galaxies billions of light years away maybe a maybe that one's a billion light
years away and this one might be four billion light years away and that little spec there might be
seven billion light years away and so we are we are seeing them as they were one four and seven
billion years ago back in time the finite not infinite speed of light gives us sort of a
fossil record of the history of the universe by looking progressively farther and farther away
we see a movie of the history of the universe farther and farther back in time we do have to
make the assumption that the typical things we see out there are like the typical things we have
here in other words we evolved from structures like that all parts of the universe are basically
similar and if you look back in time you can see not us specifically but things that look like what
we look like what our galaxy looked like billions of years ago it's wonderful it is wonderful that
the speed of light is not infinite if it were infinite we'd see the whole universe as it is
right now and that wouldn't be nearly as interesting well distance scales naturally
bring us to time scales so now i'd like to discuss for a few minutes the vast time scales in the
universe lots of interesting things happened in the history of the universe i will concentrate here
on just seven that were critical to the eventual emergence of humans of intelligence the first
is the universe the universe is about 13.7 billion years old with an uncertainty of something like
half a billion years and we will discuss all this much more later but this is the measured time
since the big bang all the galaxies are moving away from each other and if we extrapolate backwards
in time we find that these galaxies or at least the material of which they consist was all in
the same place 14 billion years ago the birth of the universe now shortly after the birth of the
universe within the first billion years or so galaxies started to form out of the material
the material of the big bang our milky way galaxy and others like it like in this photograph we think
formed by and large about 13 billion years ago and the way we know this is by measuring the ages
of the oldest stars in galaxies such as these this is a globular cluster measured to be about 13
billion years old and here's a so-called elliptical galaxy whose stars we've dated we've measured
their ages to be about 13 billion years third major step formation of the solar system about four
and a half billion years ago 4.6 billion years ago and we determined that through radioactive dating
of meteorites and moon rocks we can tell through analysis of the elements in them and the relative
proportions how long these rocks have existed they'd existed about four and a half billion years
next step emergence of unicellular unicellular life over 3.5 billion years ago there are actually
fossil records from that far back and there's indirect evidence for life even as far back as
3.8 billion years ago but the fossil records come in the form of stromatolites giant colonies
of cyanobacteria that are now fossilized into these rocks these particular ones are two and a
half billion years old then life sort of kind of puts along for a long time and then suddenly
around 550 million years ago there was the cambrian explosion a giant diversification
of complex hard-bodied animals like this trilobite that i have right here this is an animal that's
been fossilized and you can see its imprint in the rock there were many many of these at the bottom
of the ocean floor 550 million years ago whereas prior to that there were basically no or very few
hard-bodied animals here's a photograph of a trilobite then the dinosaurs ruled the land for
over 150 million years but then suddenly something extinguished them and about two-thirds of all
living species roughly 65 million years ago the great cretaceous tertiary extinction probably the
result of a comet hitting the earth that allowed room for the emergence of mammals culminating
with early hominids and finally homo sapiens the early hominids appeared perhaps four and a half
million years ago here's the famous lucy about 3.4 million years old and then homo sapiens
emerged about 150 160 000 years ago here's a skull of the rhodesia man about 120 000 years in age
these are huge timescales to get a sense of what i'm talking about
suppose we compress the history of the universe 14 billion years into one day 86 400 seconds
so 14 billion years equals 86 400 seconds in that case the big bang occurred at t equals 0
now equals 24 hours okay our galaxy formed just a few hours just a couple of hours after the big bang
our solar system formed at about 16 hours so two-thirds of the day had passed before the
solar system had formed homo sapiens humans appeared one second ago and a long human lifetime of 100
years is 0.00006 seconds less than a thousandth of a second our lives though important to each
of us and our loved ones and our friends are a blink of an eye in the history of the universe
