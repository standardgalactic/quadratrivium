We
now enter the second unit of the third major part of this course, cosmology. It will consist
of about a dozen lectures on the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole,
its age, shape, global size, its fate, some of these really grand questions. Now this
differs from the areas of cosmology that we were discussing in the past few lectures where
we considered the evolution of galaxies and quasars and things like that. There we had
to understand that these objects are far away and we got their distances by using Hubble's
law which is ultimately the expansion of the universe. So we used cosmological inferences
to study galaxies and quasars and indeed how they evolve is a part of cosmology. But this
part of cosmology is where we will discuss now the universe as a whole and we will utilize
certain objects in it like galaxies and type 1a supernovae and things like that to draw
inferences about its behavior. But it really will be focused on the birth and evolution of
this grand structure that we call the universe. Well a great way to start this subject is to
ask yourself a deceptively simple question. Why is the sky dark at night? Now you might say,
because the sun has set you numbskull. I mean who is this crazy professor from Berkeley wasting
our time asking us why is the sky dark at night? No wonder it sometimes is known as
berserkly not Berkeley. So anyway you might think this is crazy why even ask that question when
the sun has set. But it turns out that actually the darkness of the night sky has profound
implications for the nature of the universe. There are a number of possible reasons that the sky
could be dark and we look at it and you say well it must be because just the sun has set.
Ah yes but you know all those stars are distant suns and as I will show you
their combined brightness should far exceed the brightness of our sun visible during the daytime
sky. So not only should the night sky be bright but the daytime sky should be much much brighter
than it is. It turns out as we will see that there are a number of possibilities for the
resolution of this paradox. The main ones are that maybe the universe has a finite size so there
aren't an infinite number of stars contributing to the light. Or maybe the universe is infinite
but the stars are concentrated only in a certain region and the rest of the universe is empty.
Or maybe the universe has a finite age and so there hasn't been enough time for the light from
distant stars to reach us. Those are the main possibilities as we will see. So let's try to
understand why the night and daytime skies should be much brighter than than they're observed to be.
For simplicity we will initially assume that the universe is static that is not expanding.
And we're going to make three other assumptions that it's infinitely old, infinitely large,
and uniformly filled with stars. Now that doesn't mean that there's a star everywhere
but rather that you know just on average everywhere in the universe the number density,
the number per unit volume of stars is about the same. Then I claim that the collective light
from all these stars should make the sky at least as bright as the surface of the sun.
Now you look at the sun and you know you can't do that for very long maybe for a little while
it's setting and the light is diminished by absorption through our atmosphere.
But you don't want to look at the sun especially when it's high up for a very long. Well imagine the
whole sky being the brightness of the sun. That's what you would expect from all these very distant
stars. Why you might say why would that be the case? Well it's like looking through a forest.
Suppose we're standing here on earth looking out in the sky. Along this line of sight there's a star,
along that line of sight there's a star, and so on. Now you might say okay but there are a lot of
lines of sight along which there are no stars. True in this finite picture you can find many
such gaps between the stars but remember I'm now assuming that the universe is infinite. If the
universe is infinite every line of sight is going to hit a star just like if you're in an infinite
forest every line of sight is going to hit a tree. You can't escape them right no matter which
direction you look there will be a tree. Well okay you might say that's fine every line of sight will
hit a star but most of those stars you might say are so far away that according to the inverse square
law of light they contribute very little light you know they're very faint. Distant stars are faint
that's what we learned a long time ago as the light spreads out in an ever increasing area like this
along this cone of of constant opening angle a given amount of light goes through progressively
more and more square units of space and so each square unit sees a dimmer star that's the inverse
square law of light. So you might say that distant stars contribute very little light
and you'd be right but the amount of light they contribute per unit of emitting area for the star
the so-called surface brightness the brightness per unit area remains the same and that's because
the size the apparent area of a star decreases in proportion to the square of its distance
as well and so if the light the total light decreases in proportion to the square of the
distance but the emitting area decreases by that same proportion the brightness per unit area
remains the same because the two are squared or distance squared factors cancel out. Let me show
you explicitly. Distant stars look dim that's the inverse square law of light the apparent brightness
is proportional to one over the distance squared but distance stars also have a smaller angular
area than nearby stars here's the opening angle subtended by the radius of a star as seen at
some distance d at a greater distance the physical size of the star is the same but it subtends a
smaller area it's like your finger that you put farther and farther away it looks smaller in the
sky the angular area is smaller by a factor of one over d squared because the radius is smaller
by a factor of one over d and the area is just essentially pi times the radius squared or the
angular radius theta so that's proportional to one over d squared so if you now form a term called
the surface brightness the brightness per unit area you get that b over a is something proportional
to one over d squared that's the inverse square law divided by one over d squared that's the
factor by which the angular area appears to decrease and that ratio is one it's a constant
it's independent of distance so if you look at the sun it appears bright per unit area if you
placed it twice as far away its brightness per unit area would remain the same its total brightness
would decrease but the brightness per unit area is independent of distance put it a hundred times
farther away it looks one ten thousandth as bright but it also looks one ten thousandth as big and
so the brightness per unit angular area remains the same so if every line of sight hits a star
and if the sun is a typical star everywhere we look in the sky we will see the surface brightness
of the sun therefore the sky should be incredibly bright like the surface of the sun
an analogy is white paint on these trees regardless of how far away the trees are the white paint
just looks the same you know brightness it's the brightness per unit area is the same because
it reflects a certain amount of light from the sun and the brightness the total brightness decreases
for the more distant trees but their apparent angular size decreases by the same amount their
area that is and so you get a uniform appearing color for or a uniform appearing brightness for
this white paint on the trees let's look at this another way because this is a sufficiently weird
concept that most people need several ways of looking at it let's suppose we consider shells
centered on us and the shells have constant thickness one light year let's say
the stars in the more distant shells look fainter than the stars in the nearby shells
but there are more stars in the distant shells than there are in the nearby shells
in a three-dimensional view like this the volume of a shell is given by the surface area of a sphere
four pi r squared multiplied by the thickness of the shell delta r or the change in radius
that's the volume of that shell of that spherical shell it's proportional to the square of the
shells radius so if stars uniformly fill the universe and the volume of a shell is proportional
to the square of the radius then the number of stars is proportional to the square of the radius
of the distance from you their individual brightness decrease decreases according to the
square of the radius as well but those two squares of the radius cancel out and the total amount of
light contributed by stars in ever increasing shells is the same so if you add an infinite
number of shells surrounding you you get an infinite amount of light an infinite surface
brightness now you might say okay stars will eventually start blocking one another so you
might only get the surface brightness of the sun okay fine but actually if you let the universe
get infinitely old there's enough time for everything to heat up and shine within infinite
brightness anyway so depending on how you look at it either get an infinite surface brightness for
the sky or you get a finite one but it's still very very much higher than the observed darkness of
the night sky so basically you've got a paradox you would expect the sky at night or during the
day to be much brighter than it is if you have an infinite universe uniformly filled with stars
infinitely old this paradox has been considered for a long time Kepler and Newton knew about it
but a fellow named Wilhelm Ulbers popularized it in the mid-19th century he pointed out how
profound this is and so the paradox is given the name Ulbers paradox his name was Wilhelm
Ulbers already with an s so the possesses of the possessive of that is Ulbers or Ulbers is you
know sometimes people spell it Ulber apostrophe s and that's not correct his name wasn't Ulber it was
Ulbers but anyway not that that's a big deal but if I were Ulbers I'd be a little bit mad if people
called it Ulber apostrophe s paradox that's not the way it is all right so the point is is that
at least one of our assumptions must be wrong and that's a profound conclusion whatever whatever is
the solution to Ulbers paradox it must be something profound about our universe either our universe is
not infinite in size it's finite that would be an amazing conclusion or maybe it's infinite in size
but there aren't stars everywhere maybe they're only clumped around us or maybe that the universe
has an age that's short enough that even though there are stars way way out there the light from
those stars has not yet had a chance to reach us that might be the solution each of these is profound
now go and tell your friends tomorrow or whatever that the darkness of the sky tells you something
amazing about the universe you may not know what it is yet you may not know the solution
but it's one of these three now it turns out there's a few other possibilities you know
some are interesting but can be ruled out pretty easily others are just not right for for obvious
reasons or they violate the Copernican principle for example if you have stars all lined up along
spokes like the spokes of a bicycle wheel and we're in the middle of these spokes then there
are gaps between the stars but they're lined up along spokes so there's an infinite number of them
but that's a very special geometry and we don't think that we live in any special place in the
universe and moreover there are other more subtle observations that can help rule that out so that's
sort of an anti Copernican you know geometry where things are all lined up centered on us
or you might say well what if there's dust along the line of sight and it blocks the stars and that's
what hides the most distant ones that's actually quite a reasonable idea the trouble is is that
in an infinitely old universe that dust heats up and it either glows brightly or it heats up so
much that it completely evaporates dust at a certain temperature a couple of thousand degrees
evaporates and then that clears the fog you know so then you see the distant stars once again
so then you might say okay maybe it's not dust maybe it's some sort of weird kind of dark matter
that blocks our view well that's an interesting idea um it turns out that in most types of
if you if you invoke most types of dark matter you need far too much of it and we would know
about its presence in some other ways it turns out but there may be some kind of dark matter that
that blocks our view that itself would be a profound conclusion that you know the universe
is filled with dark matter so that's not any of that's not one of the favored ones and it's not
one of the three that Olbers and Newton and Kepler thought about because they didn't know
about dark matter you know but but it is a possibility though most astronomers think that
it's not one of the possibilities it's more most likely to be correct but the one that's most likely
to be correct is that the universe is basically pretty young he might say wait wait haven't I
told you several times during the course that the universe is 14 or so billion years old you
call that young it's a lot older than I am okay it's a lot older than most of us are in fact it's
a lot older than all of us are but it's still too young to have allowed enough time for light from
very very very distant stars to have reached us it turns out that stars are so rare in a sense
and galaxies are so rare in the universe that there are a lot of gaps in between them unless
you're able to look to a truly vast distance now with a universe that's only about say 10
billion years old close enough to 14 okay approximation we can only see basically 10
billion light years out in each direction there are lots of gaps between the stars and the galaxies
if we were to look out to 10 to the 22 or 23 power light years that's a much bigger distance okay
then the gaps would fill in okay we would be able to see that there's a star everywhere we look
but the universe isn't 10 to the 22 or 10 to the 23 years old it's it's only 10 to the 10 years old
so light from those very distant stars and galaxies has not had time to lead to reach us and so if
you look at for example the Hubble ultra deep field here you can see lots of gaps between the
galaxies there may be galaxies there but the light from them hasn't had a chance to reach us yet
because the universe isn't old enough going back to my simple example of shells suppose you had
stars that suddenly turned on or maybe they were always on but there was a fog and then the fog
cleared let's suppose you're in a foggy area and then suddenly the fog clears in the first year
you would only see those stars or light bulbs that are within one light year of you because the
ones that are two or three light years away are not visible yet because the light has not yet
had a chance to reach you that is the universe has only been clear for one year the stars only
formed you know one year ago after two years you get to see all the stars within two light years
after three years you get to see all the stars within three light years the more years that
pass the more of the universe you see and the more stars appear in the sky as their light
finally reaches you but if not enough time has gone by for you to see a star in every direction
there will be lots of gaps between the stars that's what we're saying when you look at the sky
even though there's myriads of stars out there there are lots of gaps between the stars if you
look at them through a telescope there are a lot of dark regions of the sky which may have stars
and galaxies way out there somewhere but the light hasn't had a chance to reach us so the universe
is reasonably empty basically and it takes a long time for light from the most distant objects to
reach us and there simply hasn't been enough time for that to have occurred that we think
is the major explanation of Ulber's paradox the universe is basically pretty young but the point
is it's not infinitely old there has not been enough time for the light from distant stars to
have reached us now in textbooks another explanation is often given and it turns out to be a contribution
to the answer but not the main factor and the explanation it's often given is that well the
universe is expanding and so the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted out of our
visible window it becomes infrared or radio that's true it does and this effect is especially
prominent in an accelerating universe we will soon see that the expansion of the universe is
actually accelerating speeding up with time so this redshifting of the light out of the optical
window does contribute to the darkness of the night sky but but the more important factor right
now by a long shot is that in fact the universe is simply too young to have allowed us to see
most of the distant stars so you might say well is the universe getting brighter the answer is yes
and no it is getting brighter with time because we're seeing more and more stars go back to the
example I showed the fog has cleared away or the stars have turned on and you see more and more of
them as as time progresses because the photons have a chance to reach you so the starlight is
getting brighter with time but right now at the present time it turns out that the dominant
contribution to the electromagnetic radiation the photons in the universe is the afterglow of
the big bang an echo from the big bang that we are still seeing it's called the cosmic microwave
background radiation and it'll be a major topic in a few lectures I'll discuss it later so given
that most of the light in the universe is light from the big bang and that light is stretching away
because of the expansion of the universe and becoming progressively more and more redshifted
progressively lower and lower energy given that that's the dominant contribution of
electromagnetic radiation to the universe right now and given that that is fading overall the
universe is fading with time but the starlight contribution is actually brightening okay kind
of interesting well you might say okay that sounds kind of interesting but how do I really
know that the universe is 14 billion years old this topic of the age of the universe is is one
that you know people really are interested in when did the universe begin cover of time magazine
you know I mean this is the kind of thing that people want to read about people are curious
about these questions so one way to address how old the universe is is to say that it must be at
least as old as the oldest objects within it that is no object within the universe can be
older than the universe itself the universe must be older than its contents so for example the
universe is at least as old as I am or as as you are now that's not a very interesting lower limit
to the age of the universe you know but but you can say definitely it's older than than each of our
ages it's older than about 120 years because the Eiffel Tower was built about 120 years ago so
universe has to be at least as old as that again that's not very interesting more interesting it's
got to be at least as old as the fossils of the dinosaurs which go back to starting 65 million
years ago going back to about 200 million years ago so you could say that the universe has to be at
least as old as the oldest dinosaurs 200 million years ago but that's getting more interesting
still more interesting is the age of the moon 4.6 billion years and the age of the whole solar
system the universe has to be old enough to have accommodated the birth of the solar system
four and a half billion years ago roughly that's getting quite interesting now the oldest discrete
objects in the universe by discrete I mean not just a bunch of radiation like the cosmic
microwave background radiation but radiation from well-formed objects you know we see them and we
can figure out how old they are well these globular clusters are the oldest objects whose
ages we've determined with a reasonable amount of certainty and they are 12 to 13 billion years old
so the universe has to be at least that old 12 to 13 billion years old to have accommodated the
birth of the globular clusters it could be considerably older but it is interesting that
we have never found any objects that are a lot older than the globular clusters the first few
generations of stars seem to have occurred before the birth of the globular clusters we see
the globular clusters polluted with some heavy elements that were clearly formed by a generation
or two of stars before the formation of the globular clusters but that may have preceded the
globular clusters by just a few hundred million years or maybe at most a billion years so a reasonable
thing to say is that the universe is maybe a billion years older than the globular clusters
13 to 14 billion years old now that's not a compelling argument because there could have
been older things that were destroyed by some process after their formation but it is at least
interesting that the age of the universe that you get or at least sort of a ballpark age is perhaps
13 or 14 billion years if you assume that there weren't any older objects that were subsequently
destroyed well you might say how do we really know that the globular clusters are that old
we get their ages by looking at how long it takes stars of various initial masses to burn out and
we think we know how long that takes and we look at the temperature luminosity diagram of a
globular cluster and here's one for example m3 this one right here it has g type stars and k
and m type stars but it doesn't have f and a and b type stars so we can figure out how long it takes
for the cluster to reach a the stage where its temperature luminosity or Hertzsprung Russell
diagram looks like this and you might say okay that gives us an age of 12 billion years but maybe
that age is wrong 12 or 13 billion years might not be the true age of this cluster there are other
ways of estimating ages of clusters if you look at white dwarfs you can figure out how old they are
by looking at how dim they are now here's an animation of the sun and let's say the sun is this
big thing it's 109 110 times the size of the earth we've learned that before white dwarfs are about
the size of the earth so here's a white dwarf and when the white dwarf first forms it's hot
but as it ages it cools and it cools more and more as it ages more and more billions of years
and as it cools it becomes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer you know it's staying about the same size
it's made out of this degenerate matter so it remains the size of the earth but as it ages it
cools it radiates energy and it becomes dimmer and by looking at how dim the white dwarfs are in
globular clusters you can figure out their age and we deduce that they are 12 to 13 billion years old
here's a globular cluster M4 in Scorpius in the direction of the star Antares or close to
Antares the heart of the scorpion if we take a look at an animation where we zoom in on it using
the Hubble Space Telescope there's this globular cluster M4 consisting of many many tens of thousands
of stars even a hundred thousand stars but when you look carefully with the Hubble Space Telescope
you can see not just the normal stars the main sequence stars and the giant stars
but you can see the dim white dwarfs there they are circled and they're incredibly dim
in this cluster M4 they're incredibly dim and from their dimness we conclude that that globular
cluster is something like 12 or 13 billion years old consistent with the argument I used where the
the main sequence in a temperature luminosity diagram gradually burns down like the wick of a
candle as the massive stars burn out turn into something else and then lower mass stars burn
out turn into something else that is this main sequence turnoff point that we used earlier to
deduce the ages of clusters gives an answer that's consistent with the ages of the coolest white
dwarfs so we think we have some ballpark estimate of the age of the universe based on the oldest
objects and there are other estimates that are done as well I don't have time to go into them
but we think that maybe 13 14 billion years is the oldest is how old the the universe is because
you know it's only a little bit older than the oldest objects we found but that's not completely
compelling evidence because there could have been older objects that somehow then were wiped out were
disappeared you know disappeared because of some cataclysm or something you know a flood or something
like that you know okay so there must be some independent way that we'd like to have to figure
out the age of the universe that independent way is known as the expansion age the universe is
expanding all the things are flying apart so if you look at these galaxies that are flying apart
from one another and you extrapolate their expansion from one another backward in time
you come to a time where the galaxies or more correctly the material of which they are now made
was basically in the same place that wasn't necessarily the center of the universe I've
already discussed how the center may be in a different dimension but at least the density was
high all the stuff was in about the same place and then for some reason it started expanding
and it's been expanding for billions of years since then we want to extrapolate the current
expansion back in time and figure out when the universe began when it was dense so here are all
these galaxies or more correctly the material of which they are now made moving away from each other
and back in time all that stuff used to be in the same place well if their expansion speeds are
constant then the distance they traverse is equal to the speed multiplied by the time that's just
distance equals rate times time that's that's how far you go if you're moving for a time t
at a constant speed v but we also know Hubble's law v equals Hubble's constant times d if we divide
by Hubble's constant we get that d the distance of a galaxy is its speed multiplied by the inverse
of the Hubble constant and you could call that big t not well this equation d equals v t not
looks like this equation here d equals v t so you can say t not the inverse of the Hubble
constant is the time over which the galaxies have all been moving away from one another
the two equations have the same mathematical form so you can equate the inverse of the Hubble
constant with the expansion age of the universe if at least it has been expanding at a constant
speed so here we have a plot of the separation between two clusters of galaxies versus time
they started out in the same place they weren't clusters yet but that's the material from which
they later formed for whatever reason there was a big bang they started expanding from one another
at a constant speed that time it has taken since the beginning t not big t not is the inverse of
the Hubble constant however there is gravity in the universe all the galaxies are pulling on one
another so you expect the universe to be slowing down with time if the universe was expanding
more quickly in the past then it's expanding now then in fact the total time it has taken
to reach its present size or present separation between any two galaxies is less than the time
you would have calculated by simply taking the inverse of the Hubble constant so in a
decelerating universe the age the expansion age should be less than the reciprocal of the Hubble
constant if the Hubble constant is 50 billion if the Hubble constant is 50 kilometers per second
per megaparsec turns out the maximum age of the universe is 20 billion years if the Hubble
constant is 100 kilometers per second per megaparsec turns out the maximum age of the universe is
only 10 billion years by knowing the current Hubble constant and the expansion history of the
universe we should be able to tell or determine how long it's been since the big bang in the next
lecture we will do that
