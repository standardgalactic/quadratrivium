0	18240	Hi.
18240	22500	In this lecture, we're going to take a tour of the surfaces of the world in the solar
22500	23880	system.
23880	29380	Our focus will be on the rocky planets, but we'll also visit many of the larger moons.
29380	33380	We'll do this in the context of comparative planetology.
33380	39300	And in comparative planetology, we learn about other worlds by comparing their features
39300	41140	to those of Earth.
41140	46500	But we also learn about Earth by exploring the range of possibilities available in the
46500	50300	solar system and where our planet fits in.
50300	52180	Let's just jump right in.
52180	54640	We'll start with mountains.
54640	60440	Mountains are found on several worlds and each formed in a different way.
60440	66880	Here on Earth, if we look at the global map, we can see several very long mountain chains
66880	72360	such as along the west coast of the United States in North America and along the west
72360	75040	coast of South America.
75040	80920	If we look closer at South America, we can see the very long chain of the Andes Mountains
80920	84280	running all along its west coast.
84280	90920	This is a result of plate tectonics, where the oceanic plate of the Pacific has run
90920	96240	into the continental plate of South America.
96240	99240	This is not the highest mountain chain in the world.
99240	102160	The highest mountain chain in the world are the Himalayas.
102160	105520	And they're pictured here north of India.
105520	111440	And this is where two continental plates have collided, the Indian plate moving northward
111440	116160	smashing into the Asiatic plate and lifting up the Himalayas.
116160	121040	The highest mountain in the world is in the Himalayas and it's Mount Everest.
121040	126520	And here is Mount Everest rising high over the Tibetan Plateau and it reaches 28,000
126520	128880	feet high.
128880	134800	Mountains are not only on Earth, but they also exist on other worlds and here is an example
134800	137520	of a mountain on the moon.
137520	140600	Looks somewhat like that picture of Mount Everest.
140600	146080	But this is Mons Hadley Delta and this is the Apollo 15 mission.
146080	153440	And Mons Hadley Delta rises about 15,000 feet above the Lunar Mare where the astronauts
153440	154440	landed.
154440	159800	So mountains on the moon are similar in height to those of Earth.
159800	161880	Matter of fact, there's even a mountain chain.
161880	168000	If we back off a bit, we can see running right across the center of this image, the Apennine
168000	172440	chain of mountains on the moon or the Alps of the moon.
172440	176920	These are probably the mountains that Galileo saw when he first turned his telescope to
176920	182480	the heavens and was able to see that not all of the bodies of the heavens were perfect
182480	183480	spheres.
183480	187960	He could see the mountains on the moon and that violated the principles of Aristotelian
187960	190120	philosophy.
190120	196880	However, if you look even further out to the full moon, you can see that these mountains
196880	200000	are not the result of plate tectonics.
200000	205680	These mountains are actually just part of the rim of a very large crater.
205680	210380	The mountains on the moon are the result of impacts.
210380	216640	On Venus, we also have mountains and this is a topographic view of Venus from its north
216640	223000	pole where blue represents the lowland regions and white represents the high regions.
223000	227480	It's rather easy to pick out the highest region, it's down here, and if we zoom in
227480	231720	on it, it's called Laxmi Planum.
231720	235600	And the white region here is Maxwell-Montz.
235600	240360	Maxwell-Montz is the highest point on Venus, it's the tallest mountain on Venus.
240360	247280	It is also, coincidentally, the only feature on Venus that is named for a man.
247280	251480	It's named after James Clerk Maxwell, the man who derived the equations of electricity
251480	252920	and magnetism.
252920	258400	But every other feature on Venus is named for a woman, as you might expect.
258400	265600	Maxwell-Montz also did not form by plate tectonics, and it's not the result of impact, it's rather
265600	268640	result of compressional tectonics.
268640	273720	Venus is a single plate planet, instead of having multiple plates like Earth, it's one
273720	277320	plate over its entire surface.
277320	282960	But compression within that plate is what probably caused Maxwell-Montz to rise up
282960	285680	so high over the surface.
285680	290880	Next, let's explore volcanoes.
290880	294080	This activity is abundant in the solar system.
294080	301000	And on Earth, the most common form of volcano formation is when an oceanic plate hits another
301000	303360	plate and subducts underneath it.
303360	310480	The pressure created in the subduction zone sends magma to the surface and creates a volcano.
310480	315000	This volcano here is very recognizable, it's Mount St. Helens.
315000	320780	It is caused by the subduction of the Wanda-Fuka plate underneath the North American plate.
320780	326760	This image here shows Mount St. Helens as it was before its 1980 eruption.
326760	331800	And this image shows it after its eruption.
331800	335840	That is the definition of blowing your top.
335840	340160	These volcanic explosions can be incredibly powerful.
340160	345180	There are maybe a few thousand volcanoes across the surface of the globe, and they are generally
345180	348000	located on these plate boundaries.
348000	353840	When we think of volcanoes, we often think of the ring of fire around the Pacific Ocean,
353840	359840	where the Pacific plate meets the continental plates on either side.
359840	363200	Volcanoes are also observed on Venus.
363200	369000	This is Matt Mons, and it's one of about a thousand volcanoes on Venus.
369000	374900	I note that there isn't a ton of volcanic activity on Venus, because 85% of its surface
374900	378880	is covered by volcanic plains.
378880	387520	Venus also features a unique volcanic feature that appears nowhere else on any other planet.
387520	394720	This is Vahet Corona, and an oval-shaped volcanic uplift.
394720	402360	Apparently, there are these volcanic uplifts that take entire regions of Venus' surface
402360	405680	up, and then compress them back down.
405680	411160	And you can see all these fractures that form this oval-shaped region of the corona, and
411160	416000	this corona is about 200 kilometers across.
416320	420080	We get much more volcanic activity on Mars.
420080	426280	Here is one of the most volcanically active regions of Mars, it's the Tharsis uplift.
426280	433600	There are several very large shield volcanoes, three down here, and the largest one up here.
433600	438640	Shield volcanoes are created through very fluid lava that has been spewed out over a
438640	441640	very long period of time.
441640	445840	That's why these volcanoes are as large as they are.
445840	447360	How large, you may ask?
447360	453240	Well, this large one up here is called Olympus Mons, and here's a close-up of it.
453240	459040	Olympus Mons is by far the largest volcano in the solar system.
459040	466480	This volcano, by itself, is about the same size as the state of Arizona.
466480	470240	It's about 600 kilometers across.
470240	474040	In height, it's about 27 kilometers high.
474040	479000	And if I compare it to Mount Everest, the comparison looks like this.
479000	483360	Olympus Mons basically dwarfs Mount Everest.
483360	488000	It really does deserve the name Mount Olympus.
488000	493680	But Mars is not the most exciting place for volcanic activity in the solar system.
493680	499280	That claim goes to a large moon of Jupiter, Io.
499280	502040	This is what Io looks like on its surface.
502040	507800	And all of these pock marks are not, I don't know, they look like pimples or such.
507800	509640	They're actually volcanic regions.
509640	516400	It's literally covered with volcanoes, and they are continually erupting.
516400	523400	When the Galileo probe flew past it in April 2007, the region around the Palae volcano
523400	525240	looked like it did on the left.
525240	534280	And when it came past it again in September 2007, an entirely new volcano had erupted.
534280	541080	This incredible amount of volcanic activity is due to Io's elliptical orbit and Jupiter's
541080	542320	gravity.
542320	546440	As Io comes closer to Jupiter, its surface gets pulled in.
546440	548800	As it goes farther away, it flexes out.
548800	554920	And this flexion in and out of Io's surface creates the heat that causes the volcanic
554920	556640	activity.
556640	559520	Now normally this process should dissipate.
559520	565400	The process of surface flexion should help circularize the orbit.
565400	571560	But Io is in a resonance orbit with the other Galilean moons Europa and Ganymede, and they
571560	578360	keep Io on its orbit and maintain Io's volcanic activity.
578360	584720	One of my favorite images in all of astronomy is this.
584720	591760	Because the plumes of Io's volcanoes stretch so far up above its surface, you can see them
591760	592760	on the limb.
592760	594600	And here's a close-up of it.
594600	600760	It's just amazing to me to think on Earth, to get a plume that high, you would have to
600760	605800	be going, what, three or four hundred kilometers into the air.
605800	608720	And our volcanoes don't do anything like that.
608720	615160	Now this was one of my ultimate favorite images, but then the New Horizons missions went past
615160	623200	Jupiter and it got this sequence of five images of the Tavastar volcano on Io.
623200	631200	And you can see five images that show it erupting and the plume spreading out across Io.
631200	634800	Just an amazing sequence of images.
634800	638080	Next we'll turn to canyons.
638080	643320	Canyons are carved both by water and by geologic forces.
643320	647920	On Earth, the most impressive canyon is in Arizona.
647920	652520	Here is the view of the state of Arizona from space.
652520	656800	And if we look in the upper region, we can see the Grand Canyon.
656800	662920	It is stretches from the upper right along down through the center and wiggles around
662920	666320	and continues off to the left on this image.
666320	672840	The Grand Canyon is about 150 kilometers long and about two kilometers deep.
672840	677960	And it's been carved by the Colorado River over millions of years.
677960	684400	Now Venus has canyons as well and they're called chasma or plural chasmata.
684400	691080	In this image, all of the bright yellow regions across the center and curving over here around
691080	694200	on the right are these chasmata.
694200	699720	They are very deep, very narrow canyons that stretch for hundreds of kilometers.
699720	702200	They are not caused by water erosion.
702200	707200	Instead, they're caused by geologic faulting.
707200	711760	On Mars, we have perhaps the most impressive canyon in the solar system.
711760	714880	This is an image of Valles Marineris.
714880	722920	It is a very extensive canyon system on Mars and it shows both fault scarps and water erosion.
722920	729320	So it has both of the processes that we see on Earth and Venus occurring on Mars.
729320	736880	This canyon is so large that it can be seen when we take a picture of the entire globe.
736880	740880	Here is Mars and here is Valles Marineris.
740880	745360	It is roughly 4,000 miles long.
745360	755360	That is so long that if I compared it to the United States, it would stretch from California to New York.
755360	761680	The canyon is about seven kilometers deep and makes for a spectacular feature.
761680	769960	We have a wonderful movie that can take us on a fantasy trip through Valles Marineris.
769960	774600	This movie is based upon topographical data from the Mars Orbiter.
774600	781920	We begin on the western edge of Valles Marineris and then fly down the main canyon.
781920	791120	The canyon was originally created by earthquake faulting many billions of years ago.
791120	795120	As we come to the central region, it's a region called Melis Chasma.
795120	797840	You can see a lot of sediments there on the right.
797840	805760	I imagine an old ancient lake.
805760	816400	As we pass to the north, we pass over an ancient landslide and into another basin.
816400	819480	Notice the atmospheric effects on the sun.
819480	827880	They're rendered realistically so that it looks what it would look like on Mars.
827880	832120	One thing that is not realistic is the vertical exaggeration.
832120	842760	This is the same enhanced relief that you would find on a globe that has relief on it.
842760	849080	To pass to the northernmost wall of the canyon, you can see large landslides and examples of water
849080	858080	erosion that have widened the valley over time.
858080	863800	This really is a magnificent structure extending for hundreds and hundreds of kilometers across
863800	868800	the face of Mars.
868800	875680	Now they say they do things big in Texas, but considering Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris,
875680	879040	Texas ain't nothing compared to Mars.
879040	883320	Next, let's take a look at riverbeds.
883320	887680	Riverbeds provide existence of flowing liquids on many worlds.
887680	891880	On Earth, rivers provide distinctive and recognizable patterns.
891880	897480	We've already seen one example with the Colorado River in Grand Canyon.
897480	902360	We also see images that look something like this.
902360	910000	These are dendritic channels and are a drainage pattern coming from a river channel.
910000	916640	It's very similar to the same features that we see on Mars where we can see these same
916640	922640	dendritic-like channels and show evidence of water flow on Mars.
922640	926360	Not water flow currently, but water flow in the past.
926360	931680	And Valles Marineris, as you follow it down through to its end, you can see that water
931680	934000	once flowed along it.
934000	939440	There are many other features on Mars that show water flowing in the past, as well as
939440	944440	catastrophic releases, miniature floods on Mars.
944440	948320	But liquid water cannot exist on Mars' surface today.
948320	954320	Its atmosphere is too thin, and there's just simply not enough pressure to hold water in
954320	956960	its liquid form.
956960	962600	One place that's very surprising where we see these same riverbed channels is Saturn's
962600	965960	moon Titan.
965960	973320	These are methane channels on Titan, channels carved by liquid methane.
973320	979720	We have also seen methane lakes on the surface of Titan, although you wouldn't want to go
979720	986640	swimming in these lakes because methane is liquid at a temperature near minus 200 degrees
986640	988400	centigrade.
988400	993920	There are other riverbed-like features that appear on other planets.
993920	999120	Here is one on Venus, and we call it a sinuous channel.
999120	1004320	It looks like a river, but it's really been created by a lava flow.
1004320	1010440	There is another one called the Hadley Reel on the moon.
1010440	1014640	The Hadley Reel was observed by the Apollo 15 astronauts.
1014640	1020480	In matter of fact, if you follow the Reel to the north, right about here around the
1020480	1024640	bend of the Apollo 15 landing site was up in here.
1024640	1030480	And this mountain right here is Mon's Hadley Delta that we showed you before.
1030480	1035440	The astronauts took the rover out to explore the Hadley Reel, and you can see what it looks
1035440	1037720	like from the ground.
1037720	1043480	Basically what it is is a collapsed lava tube that once flowed across the moon.
1043480	1047720	The next topic to take a look at are geysers.
1047720	1050680	They can spew a variety of substances.
1050680	1058400	On Earth, the most famous geyser is this one, Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park.
1058400	1064840	It erupts for a few minutes on average every hour and a half, and it is one of about 300
1064840	1067160	geysers in Yellowstone Park.
1067840	1075080	Matter of fact, nearly half of all the geysers in the world are in Yellowstone Park.
1075080	1081200	Geysers are geologic features that release heated water from beneath the surface.
1081200	1086720	Ground water makes its way down through the rocks of the crust, reaches the magma underneath
1086720	1091160	it, heats up, and is periodically released.
1091160	1099160	These are rare features that exist only in very specific spots on our planet.
1099160	1104280	But we also see geyser-like features elsewhere in the solar system.
1104280	1111520	This is Neptune's largest moon Triton, and on the upper half of this image you see what
1111520	1115040	they call the catalope terrain.
1115040	1119920	Triton is extremely cold, it's out at the edge of the solar system, and its surface
1119920	1122520	is covered with ice.
1122520	1131280	In the bottom half, you can see streaks of black, let me zoom in on these, these streaks
1131280	1137160	of black look like they're all streaming away from the South Pole of Triton.
1137160	1143880	Triton does have a very, very thin atmosphere, and what we have determined these black streaks
1143880	1153120	are, are methane fountains, liquid methane spewing up from the interior of Triton, and
1153120	1162920	being blown back by very, very thin winds moving from Triton's South Pole away.
1162920	1170440	These methane fountains rise nearly 8 kilometers into the air before being streamed back, and
1170440	1173960	are carried back by the thermal currents.
1173960	1179040	There is another moon that has even more impressive fountains.
1179040	1186240	This is Saturn's moon Enceladus, now Enceladus is a rather small icy moon, not a particularly
1186240	1191240	important moon, except for these fountains.
1191240	1196920	It orbits about twice the distance from Saturn as the main rings of Saturn, so the rings
1196920	1201560	end about here, and Enceladus is way out here.
1201560	1207200	The important surface feature of Enceladus are these cracks in the south, they call them
1207200	1214880	the tiger stripes, they're very deep crevices into the surface of Enceladus, and for some
1214880	1217840	reason they seem to be heated.
1217840	1223240	We're not exactly sure why they're heated, but they do seem to have excess heat associated
1223240	1224800	with these tiger stripes.
1224800	1230240	That extra heat appears to power some ice fountains.
1230240	1235720	Here is an image of Enceladus that is backlit, and down the bottom here you can see just
1235720	1241640	these wispy fountains coming off the bottom part of Enceladus.
1241640	1248400	Perhaps these tiger stripes are heated by tidal heating like Io, but we're really not
1248400	1249680	sure.
1249680	1255440	The interesting thing is this may indicate the presence of liquid water just below the
1255440	1259640	surface of Enceladus, again we're not sure.
1259640	1266000	The one thing we are sure of is that these fountains contribute to and may even be the
1266000	1271040	main source of the faint E-ring of Saturn.
1271040	1276640	Saturn has some very bright main rings, but it also has some very faint rings on the outer
1276640	1284360	part of it, and Enceladus may be the main source of one of its outermost rings.
1284360	1288040	Next thing to look at, polar ice caps.
1288040	1293160	These exist on both Earth and Mars, and they grow and shrink with the seasons.
1293160	1299240	Now Earth has ice covered poles, simply because they receive less sunlight.
1299240	1301440	It's colder at the poles.
1301440	1305040	Earth also has a 23.5 degree tilt.
1305040	1312140	So in some months the poles get no sunlight, and in some months they get continuous sunlight.
1312140	1320160	It makes sense that the ice caps would shrink in the summer and grow in the winter.
1320160	1325880	This is what the northern ice cap on Earth looks like in March of 1998.
1325880	1331720	The ice cap is largest right after northern winter, and here is what it looks like in
1331720	1333960	September 1998.
1333960	1337480	It is smallest right after northern summer.
1337480	1342200	Quite a change between largest and smallest.
1342200	1345280	The same thing occurs on Mars.
1345280	1350160	In this Hubble image of Mars, you can see that Mars also has polar caps, but these polar
1350160	1355840	caps instead of being water ice are mostly carbon dioxide ice.
1355840	1362560	Mars's atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide, and as we said, you can't have liquid water
1362560	1365280	on the surface.
1365280	1368960	Mars similarly has a tilt of 25 degrees.
1368960	1372700	So very much the same type of tilt that Earth has.
1372700	1378560	So you would expect to see seasonal changes in its ice cap, and we do see them.
1378560	1381600	Here is Mars over the course of many months.
1381600	1387280	In the Martian winter, you can see it has a very large polar ice cap, and as it progresses
1387280	1392000	towards the Martian summer, the polar ice cap shrinks.
1392000	1396640	But this shrinking is not melting as it is on Earth.
1396640	1401480	On Earth, the polar ice caps are melting into the polar ocean.
1401480	1404720	Here is a process called sublimation.
1404720	1411240	The carbon dioxide ice in the polar caps of Mars are going from ice directly into gas,
1411240	1415320	and that gas is joining the Martian atmosphere.
1415320	1420120	It's actually kind of interesting because we see the polar cap shrink on one pole of
1420120	1425920	Mars, the ice goes into the atmosphere, and actually freezes back out at the other pole
1425920	1426920	of Mars.
1426920	1434480	We're going to finish off this planetary comparison with somewhat of a non-comparison,
1434480	1438160	because Earth does have one unique feature.
1438160	1442840	And if you just look at it, you see it stares you straight in the face.
1442840	1444640	It is the oceans.
1444640	1449200	Oceans cover nearly 70% of Earth's surface.
1449200	1455160	The important idea about the oceans is that water is a necessary ingredient for life as
1455160	1456720	we know it.
1456720	1462240	When we look for life in the universe, we are looking essentially for the presence of
1462240	1463520	water.
1463520	1469760	Life as we know it requires carbon chemistry, water, and a source of energy.
1469760	1474640	Well, carbon chemistry and a source of energy are relatively abundant throughout the solar
1474640	1479600	system, but water is the main ingredient we're looking for.
1479600	1486560	Now it's kind of interesting to note that only recently have we found another planet
1486560	1491520	in the solar system, another world in the solar system that has liquid on its surface,
1491520	1496200	and that is Titan, and it has the methane lakes.
1496200	1501600	So while Earth has been unique for having water on its surface, it is no longer unique
1501600	1506080	for having a liquid on its surface.
1506080	1510380	Let's take a look at a global overview of the rocky planets.
1510380	1515200	Take a look at their overall surfaces and compare them.
1515200	1521360	Each of the rocky planets shows a dichotomy that has rougher upland regions and smoother
1521360	1523680	lowland planes.
1523680	1526720	Earth and Venus are very similar.
1526720	1528440	We look at this diagram.
1528440	1531680	We see Venus on top and Earth down bottom.
1531680	1534360	They are dominated by the blue color.
1534360	1537480	That represents volcanic planes.
1537480	1543840	Venus has had many epics of volcanic resurfacing, and its surface is almost entirely covered
1543840	1547000	by volcanic planes.
1547000	1553060	Earth has been dominated by plate tectonics, and you can see the dichotomy between the
1553060	1558500	ocean bottoms, which are volcanic planes, and the continental plates.
1558500	1564400	You also see on Earth and Venus the pink regions that represent mountains.
1564400	1569440	Venus has rather strange shaped mountains compared to Earth because we are used to long
1569440	1572960	mountain chains that you do not see on Venus.
1572960	1580020	Venus' mountains would occur because of compressional tectonics, not because of plate tectonics.
1580020	1586040	You also see a unique feature on Venus of these orange, these very small orange circles.
1586040	1589560	Those are the coronet that we mentioned earlier.
1589560	1594240	On Earth, the colors that you don't see on Venus are green and tan.
1594240	1599920	The green represent deposits on top of the continental plates, and the tan represents
1599920	1601640	cratered regions.
1601720	1607120	Although we have a lot of erosion on Earth, we still have a few regions that have significantly
1607120	1613320	more craters, and this of course occurs on the continental plates.
1613320	1618440	When you look at Mars and the moon, you see volcanic planes, the blue volcanic planes
1618440	1620880	that we saw on Venus and Earth.
1620880	1627120	It's very small on the moon, but really dominant in the northern half of Mars.
1627120	1632480	The dominant feature on both of these planets is the tan that represent the cratered regions,
1632480	1636600	as well as the yellow which represent the heavily cratered regions.
1636600	1641880	On moon, we also see red regions that represent the ejecta.
1641880	1646880	The moon is a geologically inactive body, and almost all of the surface features you see
1646880	1653080	here are due to the heavy bombardment era and the cratering that has occurred since then.
1653080	1658960	On Mars, we see a very strong dichotomy between the volcanic planes in the north and the heavily
1658960	1661480	cratered regions in the south.
1661480	1666800	We don't know why this strong dichotomy exists, and it's something that the planetary scientists
1666800	1668320	are studying.
1668320	1674640	It is natural to marvel at the diversity of surface features across the solar system.
1674640	1684040	We have looked at mountains, volcanoes, canyons, riverbeds, geysers, ice caps, and oceans.
1684040	1689760	And in looking at them, we have seen that the seven wonders of the solar system far outpace
1689760	1693160	the seven natural wonders here on Earth.
1693160	1698640	But I think one learns more by identifying the similarities rather than looking at the
1698640	1704440	differences, because when you look at similar features, you recognize that similar forces
1704440	1706160	are at work.
1706160	1712720	Similar geologic and hydrologic forces are at work across the solar system.
1712720	1717640	Now if you think back to what we just discussed on the moon and Mars, and something that doesn't
1717640	1722240	really appear that strongly on Earth, we skipped something.
1722240	1723240	What was it?
1723240	1726120	Well, the moon and Mars are covered with craters.
1726120	1733240	It doesn't appear so strongly on Earth, but it's a very important effect, surface feature,
1733240	1734800	across the solar system.
1734800	1739320	And they are so important and so prevalent that they get their own lecture.
1739320	1742440	And we'll discuss them next time.
1742440	1742880	See you then.
