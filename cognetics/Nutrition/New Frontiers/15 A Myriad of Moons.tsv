0	22560	Today's topic is the lunatic fringe of the solar system.
22560	26080	Now I use the word lunatic in the astronomical sense.
26080	33200	The Latin root luna means moon, and an old definition of lunacy is an insanity that increases
33200	36280	and decreases with the phase of the moon.
36280	42200	Now I don't know of any scientific evidence that says the moon can drive you crazy, but
42200	45000	there is a well-known optical illusion.
45000	51320	Have you ever seen a full moon on the horizon and said, wow, that's a huge full moon?
51320	54800	And then later you see it high in the sky and you go, well, it doesn't seem quite as
54800	56200	big.
56200	58320	That's actually an optical illusion.
58320	63080	And there's much psychological debate about why the moon appears larger when it's on the
63080	66520	horizon than it does when it's high in the sky.
66520	68360	I really don't know why it occurs.
68360	75400	Maybe it sort of seems closer because it's over the treetops, but I do know that even
75400	78240	professional astronomers like me experience it.
78240	81480	When I see a low moon, it really does look bigger.
81480	87000	Even though I know mathematically, it's still the same size.
87000	92480	Here is an image of the full moon in the sky, and I find it rather powerful.
92480	98960	You know, sometimes I just find myself staring at the moon, and I really don't know why.
98960	105080	I just, you know, am pondering something, and I can't really tell why I'm staring,
105080	108840	but it's just drawing me there.
108840	114840	As a word for it, we call it being moon struck, and it's easy to see how the moon was very
114840	119560	important in earlier cultures because it provides light in the evening.
119560	123560	If you want, without electric lights, if you wanted to work in the evenings, it helped
123560	127740	to have a full moon, and that, of course, is the source of the harvest moon.
127740	132000	You could gather crops well into the evening and into the night when the full moon was
132000	135680	up in September.
135680	140600	And the phases, the phases of the moon, or the moon goes through its phases in 29 and
140600	141840	a half days.
141840	145200	That, of course, led to the definition of our month.
145200	149480	Now in folklore, that leads to the idea of a blue moon.
149480	153720	And what we talk about as the blue moon is the second full moon in a month, because the
153720	156640	month is just slightly longer than the phases of the moon.
156640	160080	There's a possibility of having one full moon in the beginning and one full moon at the
160080	161600	end.
161600	166520	And that's the idea of a blue moon, and this occurs once in a blue moon, every two and
166520	167520	a half years.
167520	171320	Now that's not the original folklore meaning of a blue moon, that's sort of the common
171320	173880	accepted definition today.
173880	179480	But even today, the moon is a powerful symbol in our culture.
179480	183880	We find the moon in the sky to be comforting familiarity.
183880	188880	There's romance in moonlight, and it evokes dreams of faraway places.
188880	194080	The moon is very important for astronomy, because it fuels our imagination of the universe.
194080	199320	I mean, the space race would not have been the same had we not had the moon available
199320	201080	as a destination.
201080	207680	However, I think that moons in general are not really given their due in the solar system.
207680	211880	Everyone memorizes the eight planets, used to be nine planets, but now it's eight planets.
211880	213640	Everyone memorizes those.
213640	218040	But how many of you have memorized the seven large moons of the solar system?
218040	222800	See the moons are seen as secondary, and what I'd like to do in this lecture is take
222800	227320	a look at these moons as worlds unto themselves.
227320	231680	We'll start with those seven large moons, and our moon is one of them.
231680	236000	Here is a comparison of Earth and the moon.
236000	239040	The moon is about one fourth the size of Earth.
239040	245480	Earth is around 13,000 kilometers, the moon is around 3,500 kilometers in diameter.
245480	249360	Now you may see images like this out there.
249360	252440	This is an image of Earth and moon taken from space.
252440	254480	Actually, it's a really cool image.
254480	259740	This is the first image of the Earth and moon taken from the planet Mars.
259740	264400	This is from the orbiter going around Mars, looking back at the Earth and moon.
264400	268600	Now when you see this image, you think that the Earth and moon are pretty close together,
268600	269760	but they're not.
269760	274880	Actually, the real distance between Earth and moon looks more like this.
274880	280360	And the way I memorize it is that the Earth, as shown here in this image, is about 30 Earth
280360	283800	diameters away from the moon.
283800	287080	That's about 380,000 kilometers.
287080	294320	It looks really far in this image, but we have traversed that gap.
294320	300720	This image of the moon shows that this is the only place in the solar system that humans
300720	302760	have visited besides our planet.
303440	305160	It is our closest neighbor in space.
305160	311440	It is also the furthest distance we have traveled into space in person.
311440	315560	Now when we looked at the moon, when we study the moon, well, we find out the basics about
315560	316560	it.
316560	320720	We already have discovered that in this course, that its surface is dominated by craters, and
320720	326360	from those craters we understand the history of impacts throughout the solar system.
326360	330720	And when you look at the full moon here, you can see that there are some dark regions.
330720	335520	These are the mares, which we originally believed to be lunar seas, but we now know them to
335520	337600	be lava-filled planes.
337600	341760	And you can see a lot of them have circular boundaries around them indicating that they
341760	346680	are lava-filled planes due to very large impacts, impacts that punch through the crust
346680	352560	of the moon, and the lava then flows up and fills the circular basin.
352560	357280	Now compared to the other large moons of the solar system, our moon is actually quite
357280	359040	respectable.
359040	361560	Here is an image of the seven large moons.
361560	371120	They are in decreasing order of size, Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Io, Armon, Europa, and Triton.
371120	376440	Now Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa are the four Galilean moons that Galileo saw in
376440	378320	1610.
378320	383080	Titan is the large moon of Saturn, and Triton is the large moon of Neptune.
383080	385880	Now I note for Triton in this image, it's not a full disc shot.
385880	389320	There are some full disc shots of Triton, but they don't really show much detail.
389320	394120	This is just one where part of Triton is in shadow.
394120	397080	These large moons are comparable to the rocky planets.
397080	402080	Matter of fact, Ganymede and Titan are even larger than Mercury, and all of these are
402080	403960	larger than Pluto.
403960	407360	So I consider these to be the major moons, and these would be the ones that you would
407360	411720	really want to know about if you were studying the solar system just a little bit.
411720	414600	You can tell because we've discussed many of these in previous lectures.
414600	418800	We talked about the volcanoes on Io, we talked about the ice rafts on Europa, we talked
418800	424040	about the methane geysers on Triton, and there's only a little bit more I would want to add
424040	425960	in this lecture.
425960	429040	What I would like to talk about is Ganymede, the largest one.
429040	432000	I haven't really covered Ganymede before.
432000	436120	Ganymede is ice covered, and you can see on it these bright sort of spots on it.
436120	442240	These are impact spots where the impact has broken up the ice and extruded fresh snow on
442240	444960	top of the ice.
444960	449840	There's also a very strong contrast between the lighter regions of Ganymede and the dark
449840	450920	regions.
450920	455640	The dark regions are heavily cratered and much more ancient terrain than the lighter regions.
455640	458640	The lighter regions have been reprocessed.
458640	462160	The color in the dark regions come from some rock material.
462160	469840	Basically, if some of the ice diffuses away, then what is left is more rocky material and
469840	472360	it has a darker appearance.
472360	477080	Now the boundary between these shows the details of the light regions.
477080	481360	Here is the boundary, and on the left hand side of this image is a dark region of Ganymede,
481360	484640	and on the right hand side is a light region.
484640	488120	These light regions show long parallel grooves.
488120	492400	This indicates the surface of Ganymede has extended and flexed.
492400	499120	Basically, this is ice tectonics, the sort that we saw on Venus, where Venus stretched
499120	504240	and flexed, but this is happening on the ice moon of Ganymede.
504240	508940	There is also some evidence of what we call cryovulcanism.
508940	515480	These are icy flows from the interior, where the ice underneath wells up and spreads out,
515480	520720	and sort of like vulcanism, but in this case the lava would be a slush.
520720	526240	So the ice that we see here on Ganymede and these icy features is a key to understanding
526240	532200	a lot of the moons, because most of the outer solar system is ice, and most of the moons
532200	534760	are out in the outer solar system.
534760	537640	Another moon out there is Callisto.
537640	542720	Callisto is ice covered like Ganymede, and it has that very dark surface, so you would
542720	547120	expect it to be an older surface, like the dark regions of Ganymede, and you would be
547120	548120	right.
548120	554000	It has an abundance of craters, you can see numerous of these white spots all over it.
554000	559600	So when Galileo went to visit Callisto, we expected to see lots and lots of small craters,
559600	562040	sort of like we see on our moon.
562040	564600	They did not find them.
564600	570520	There is some erosion process on Callisto that is erasing the small craters.
570520	573160	It's possibly due to the sublimation of the ice.
573160	578280	The ice sublimates and diffuses away from the moon, and the surface then is a little
578280	583280	more porous and is able to collapse and erase these small craters.
583280	588640	The sublimation would, as on Ganymede, expose the dark material and give Callisto its darker
588640	590480	appearance.
590480	596840	There are only a few signs of ice geologic activity on Callisto, similar to what we see
596840	599540	on Ganymede.
599540	602880	The third moon, large moon I'd like to talk about today, is Titan.
602880	607560	Now we've talked about this before, it's the only moon with an atmosphere, but what makes
607560	612760	it really special is it's the only other moon besides our moon that we have landed
612760	614080	on.
614080	620320	And here we have a movie of the Huygens probe released from the Cassini satellite landing
620320	622440	on Titan.
622440	627840	Now the movie starts with a little bit of computer graphics to orient you, but this is all real
627840	629840	data moving on.
629840	634280	And the movie takes about four and a half hours before landing to when it lands on the
634280	635280	surface.
635280	640640	You can see we quickly pass through the smog layer of Titan, and then slowly be able to
640640	644320	see the terrain underneath.
644320	647720	As we get through the clouds, we can see the dark regions that we originally thought to
647720	658240	be methane oceans on Titan, but we now know are just ice.
658240	662800	As the Huygens probe descends, you can begin to see the terrain, the icy terrain, it's
662800	668760	just hills and plains on Titan.
668760	672200	And slowly we come down to a descent, and as we hit the ground, we're going to switch
672200	677840	to the side view.
677840	682320	You can see the icy rocks, these are basically ice balls, you can see the parachute shadow
682320	688880	passing across, and in the lower right hand corner, there is a lamp spot.
688880	693960	Now the surface of Titan looks here to be kind of bright, but this is basically just
693960	699480	due to the very long exposure they're taking and the lamp that they have there to light
699480	700680	it up.
700680	705360	One scientist who was looking at this described it as trying to take pictures of an asphalt
705360	708600	parking lot at dusk.
708600	713080	So this is what the surface of Titan looks like, and it's sort of historic, you know,
713080	716080	this is the second moon of the solar system we have landed on.
716440	722440	Well, those are the major moons, but these moons are vastly outnumbered by the smaller
722440	723440	moons.
723440	728480	If there are seven large moons, there are about 160 smaller moons.
728480	733280	There are about nine, what I would call medium sized moons, I guess I would say the large
733280	737520	moons are several thousand kilometers, they're sort of, you know, rocky planet sized.
737520	743200	Then there are about 10 medium sized moons, greater than about a thousand kilometers,
743280	747800	then there are about 20 small moons, greater than about a hundred kilometers, and then
747800	752800	about 50 tiny moons, only about 10 kilometers to 100 kilometers.
752800	757600	And that leaves about, oh, 70 moons that are even smaller than that, that are just a few
757600	760400	kilometers or even less across.
760400	765960	So let's take a look at some of these moons to see examples of the features.
765960	771040	Here is image of the second largest moon of Saturn, it's called Rhea, and it's a medium
771080	774880	sized moon, it's about 1500 kilometers across.
774880	781080	You can see in the upper right of Rhea, there's a very large impact basin called Tirawa.
781080	784440	This is 360 kilometers across.
784440	789360	Such large impacts, they seem to be common among Saturn's moons.
789360	793000	Another one of them is found on the moon Tethys.
793000	799160	This is also a medium sized moon, and it features a very prominent crater called Odysseus.
799200	805200	This is a multi-ringed impact basin, and the rings arise both from the impact and from
805200	808080	the shock waves that ripple through the surface.
808080	812080	So this is a little bit larger than just the sort of crater that you would see from a single
812080	816160	impact, because the shock waves have rippled through and broken up the surface for a much
816160	818320	larger region.
818320	823080	Now when we think of the classic Saturn moon with a large crater, it would have to be this
823080	825680	one, Mimus.
825720	832120	Now Mimus is a small moon, only about 400 kilometers in diameter, and Herschel Crater,
832120	835720	as it is called, is one third of that.
835720	840920	This crater was first seen by Voyager 1 in 1980, and this was during the original Star
840920	846120	Wars trilogy, so we commonly refer to this as the Death Star moon, because it resembles
846120	849600	the Death Star in the original Star Wars trilogy.
849600	856120	Now however, this is no longer the moon I think of with a giant impact crater, because
856120	862520	Cassini has observed another moon that has even more of giant impacts.
862520	867360	So the moon I think of most now is this moon, Iapetus.
867360	872840	Iapetus is a medium sized moon, about 1400 kilometers in diameter, and if you look on
872840	877600	the left side, you can see one hemisphere with a very large impact basin, and if you
877600	881480	look on the right side, you can see several other impact basins on it.
881480	886760	There are at least nine large impact basins on Iapetus.
886760	893320	It's really had a turbulent history, and as is evident from this image, we also think
893320	896600	of Iapetus as the black and white moon.
896600	902320	This shows you both hemispheres, and one hemisphere is basically as bright as snow, and the other
902320	905960	hemisphere is as dark as coal.
905960	906960	Why?
907080	913480	Well, the best hypothesis is that it's due to accretion of materials while it orbits.
913480	918640	Like our moon, Iapetus is in a tidal lock around its planet, which means it always shows
918640	921240	the same face to Saturn.
921240	926400	The dark hemisphere of Iapetus is always the leading hemisphere as it's orbiting around
926400	932100	Saturn, so you could see how the leading hemisphere could sweep up material, and perhaps this
932100	938140	material is ejected from outer moons, and is infalling, spiraling in towards Saturn,
938140	943580	and Iapetus is just sort of swinging around and sweeping it up.
943580	947780	Let's move on to some moons of Uranus, and see what they have to show us.
947780	953280	When we look at the moons of Uranus, we actually see lots of icy geologic features.
953280	958900	This image is of Uranus' largest moon, Titania.
958900	965180	It is about 1,600 kilometers in diameter, and if you look along the right-hand side,
965180	968460	you can see some very long canyons.
968460	973540	The longest canyon that has been measured on Titania is almost as long as the planet
973540	974540	is wide.
974540	977340	It's about 1,500 kilometers long.
977340	983060	These canyons are thought to indicate expansion and contraction of the surface, and the fracturing
983060	986860	of that icy surface to create these long canyons.
986860	992900	You can see even more of that on another moon of Uranus, Aerial.
992900	994700	Aerial is another medium-sized moon.
994700	999460	It's a little smaller, about 1,200 kilometers in diameter, and you can see an extensive
999460	1000740	canyon system.
1000740	1007140	You can see these canyons running north and south and east and west and all over the place,
1007140	1013340	and these ones, unlike the ones on Titania, appear to be extensively filled in with these
1013340	1015500	cryovolcanic flows.
1015500	1021220	So while you have the fracturing on Aerial, you also have the cryovolcanism, which appears
1021220	1024460	to be filling in these canyons.
1024460	1031620	The fracturing is taken to even greater lengths when we look at Uranus' moon, Miranda.
1031620	1038740	Miranda is a small moon of Uranus, and if you look at it, it's got a very jumbled terrain,
1038740	1042340	and you have to look a little closer, and you can see sort of like a chevron shape in
1042340	1043340	the upper right.
1043340	1048020	It's sort of like a puzzle piece here, and if you look down here, there are very strong
1048020	1053260	contrasts between some smooth regions and some jumbled regions and some striped regions,
1053260	1057780	and it looks really like a whole bunch of puzzle pieces put together wrong.
1057780	1062180	That's actually what we originally thought when we saw Miranda after Voyager.
1062180	1067180	It was initially suggested that the moon had been hit by a giant impact, smashed it to
1067180	1072940	pieces, and eventually reassembled itself, and so that Miranda was just a moon that
1072940	1076100	had been broken apart and reassembled.
1076100	1077380	We no longer think that.
1077380	1082900	We now think it's just very extensive ice tectonic activity that is stretching and flexing
1082900	1088580	and twisting the moon and producing these amazing shapes that we see here.
1088580	1093540	Moving down in scale, we then move to the tiny moons of the solar system, and as we
1093540	1097300	go smaller and smaller, the shapes are no longer spherical.
1097300	1101500	Gravity is not massive enough to make these objects spherical, and they start to resemble
1101540	1105340	things that we think of more as asteroids.
1105340	1108100	Here is a moon Janus.
1108100	1114260	It is about 200 kilometers across, and that's just not big enough for it to be spherical,
1114260	1119220	and you can see it has a sort of, I don't know, trapezoidal type shape.
1119220	1122900	Here's another Hyperion that's a moon of Saturn.
1122900	1128780	It has a very oblong shape, but what really is strange about Hyperion is that it almost
1128780	1131620	has sort of a sponge-like appearance.
1131620	1136020	If you look at all these craters across the side and running across the middle, it looks
1136020	1142500	like the craters have really punched through, and that's really what has happened.
1142500	1149220	We believe Hyperion is a very low density moon, and that when the meteorite hits and
1149220	1155500	smashes, it actually smashes deep in and creates this sponge-like appearance on the surface
1155500	1157020	of Hyperion.
1157740	1164340	Now you'll notice that we haven't mentioned any moons of Jupiter yet, and that's because
1164340	1170140	Jupiter doesn't have any medium or even small moons.
1170140	1175500	Its largest moon is actually this one here in the center of this image, Amalthea.
1175500	1181540	So after the large Galilean satellites, where it's got four very large moons, the next
1181540	1186300	largest one is about 250 kilometers across, and that's Amalthea.
1186300	1188660	And it is not large enough to be spherical.
1188660	1195780	Matter of fact, these are the four inner moons of Jupiter.
1195780	1198420	These are once interior to the four large moons.
1198420	1203140	They are Thede, Amalthea, Adrastea, and Metis.
1203140	1206780	And as you can see, they're just, you know, flotsam and jetsam.
1206780	1211900	These are the small moons that probably are captured asteroids.
1212500	1219540	Finally, let me note that even asteroids themselves can have moons.
1219540	1227740	This image here is of an asteroid named Ida, and it was very surprising when Galileo passed
1227740	1234540	by Ida on its way to Jupiter to find that Ida had a little moon, Dactyl.
1234540	1238860	Ida is only about 56 kilometers across, a very small asteroid.
1238860	1243980	You wouldn't think it would have enough gravity to hold a moon, but Dactyl is only about one
1243980	1246060	and a half kilometers across.
1246060	1250940	And the orbit radius of Dactyl around Ida is around 100 kilometers.
1250940	1254180	So it's really a small little moon orbiting around it.
1254180	1260380	And as an astronomer, I have to look at this and wonder, how does it really stay in orbit?
1260380	1267580	Because the gravitational field of Ida is really oblong and really oblate, so it's kind
1267580	1273620	of interesting to wonder whether or not that orbit is really any sort of stable orbit.
1273620	1277220	It's got to be processing and wobbling and going all over the place.
1277220	1281260	Would be quite interesting, actually, if we could ever follow it.
1281260	1285100	So those are the physical characteristics of the moon, what they look like, how big they
1285100	1290180	are, but in terms of classifying the moons, it's actually a little more useful to look
1290180	1291780	at their orbits.
1291780	1296660	And when we classify them by their orbits, we come up with two classes, regular and
1296660	1299780	irregular satellites.
1299780	1303860	This is an image of the inner moons of Jupiter.
1303860	1308180	And they are the four Galilean moons, and the four moons I just showed you.
1308180	1313260	You can see that they all lie in a plane, and their orbits are roughly circular.
1313260	1316420	It sort of resembles a mini solar system around Jupiter.
1316420	1320700	And really that's how we describe the four Galilean moons of Jupiter, but here you can
1320700	1324060	see that it also includes four other moons.
1324060	1327340	These are what we call regular moons.
1327340	1333660	If instead we back out and see all the rest of the moons of Jupiter, you look right in
1333660	1338340	close, you can see the orbit of Callisto, that's that circular feature in the center,
1338340	1347660	and all the other moons, the other 50s or so, so odd moons of Jupiter have no such organization.
1347660	1351060	The orbits are all over the place at many inclinations.
1351060	1355700	They have ellipticities, you know, they're not really circular.
1355700	1359140	This would be what we call the irregular moons.
1359140	1364500	And all of the giant planets have both regular and irregular moons.
1364500	1369420	The regular moons will have generally circular orbits, they'll generally be near the equatorial
1369420	1374420	plane of the planet, so they orbit around it as it rotates.
1374420	1378700	And the irregular moons will have a variety of orbits, they'll be tilted, they'll be
1378700	1379700	elongated.
1379700	1383780	And they'll even be going backwards around the planet compared to how the moon rotates,
1383780	1388700	and they'll generally be found in the outer parts of the moon's systems.
1388700	1393020	The regular moons are considered to have formed along with the planet.
1393020	1397820	You can imagine if the planet's rotating, that you could form a nice disk around it,
1397820	1400180	and those moons could form in there.
1400180	1404740	The irregular moons are those that have thought to have been gravitationally captured, such
1404740	1409660	as these outer moons of Jupiter, which would be the small moons that can be captured in
1409900	1412460	any type of orbit.
1412460	1416940	Another example of irregular moons would be Mars moons.
1416940	1424140	And this is an image of Mars's moons Phobos and Deimos compared to the asteroid Gaspera.
1424140	1428180	Each of these objects is between 10 and 20 kilometers across.
1428180	1433380	And you can look, and just by comparison, and there's really not much doubt that Mars's
1433380	1437340	moons are really captured asteroids.
1437380	1444020	The most surprising of all of the irregular moons would be Triton.
1444020	1450660	Here is a diagram of Neptune's orbits, and you can see the regular moons in the interior
1450660	1455540	out to the moon Proteus, and then you see Triton on the outside.
1455540	1460100	And you can tell, all right, it's somewhat inclined, about 23 degrees compared to the
1460100	1461100	regular moons.
1461100	1463580	That really doesn't make it hugely different, does it?
1463580	1464580	No.
1464580	1469860	What really makes it different is that it's in retrograde rotation.
1469860	1475260	So Triton is actually orbiting in the opposite direction compared to all the other moons.
1475260	1480180	All the other moons are orbiting this way, Triton is orbiting this way.
1480180	1486740	This makes it amazing because this is a large moon of the solar system, and it must be a
1486740	1488460	captured object.
1488460	1493660	Triton could not have formed in the place where he is found today.
1493660	1499100	Now Triton is similar in many characteristics to Pluto.
1499100	1504620	So what we believe is that Triton did not originate at Neptune, rather originated out
1504620	1508620	in the Kuiper Belt, where Pluto and the other Kuiper Belt objects are.
1508620	1515300	Now, speaking of Pluto, recently we've discovered Pluto to have three moons.
1515300	1519100	Here is an image of Pluto and its three moons.
1519100	1523860	The moon that we've known about for a couple decades is Charon, and the two new moons
1523860	1526900	are Nyx and Hydra.
1526900	1532540	The surprising thing was, first of all, that it had two other moons, and second, that all
1532540	1536380	of the moons orbit in the same plane.
1536380	1543580	Here is a diagram of the Pluto system orbits, and you can see that Charon, Nyx, and Hydra
1543580	1546140	all share the same plane.
1546180	1551500	This suggests a common origin for these moons, that they all somehow form together.
1551500	1559940	Now, another thing this diagram also shows is that Charon is not really a moon.
1559940	1565780	Charon is massive enough that the center of mass between Pluto and Charon is not inside
1565780	1569860	the figure of Pluto, it's actually outside of Pluto.
1569860	1573820	You can see in the diagram this point, the center of mass is called the Berry Center,
1573820	1578500	and you can see that Pluto actually orbits around the Berry Center.
1578500	1584460	So instead of Charon orbiting Pluto, like we think of as a normal moon, Charon orbits
1584460	1587020	the Berry Center, and Pluto orbits the Berry Center too.
1587020	1590580	So they're moving around like this, okay?
1590580	1593660	This is what we would call a double system.
1593660	1598540	So Pluto and Charon really form a double system at the center, and then they have two moons
1598540	1602060	orbiting around that double system on the outside.
1602060	1608180	So Pluto system is really quite a complex and interesting little system.
1608180	1612660	We're going to end this lecture with what is perhaps the biggest anomaly anywhere in
1612660	1616660	the solar system, and it's really what we see every night.
1616660	1623860	It is our moon, and the anomaly about our moon is that it is so large compared to the
1623860	1625940	size of its planet.
1625940	1629940	I told you before that the moon is about one quarter the size of Earth.
1630420	1634820	Well, if you take Ganymede, that's about what?
1634820	1641020	Well, Jupiter's 10 times larger than Earth, so it's about one 40th the size of Jupiter,
1641020	1642020	okay?
1642020	1648580	Compared to its planet, even Ganymede is 10 times smaller in comparison than moon is
1648580	1649580	to Earth.
1649580	1654220	Now, you might think that would be enough to make Earth and moon into a double planet.
1654220	1656500	Well, it's not quite.
1656540	1662420	Because here's a diagram, totally not to scale, and the center of mass of Earth is definitely
1662420	1665220	not at the center of Earth.
1665220	1669180	The center of mass of the Earth-moon system is definitely not the center of Earth.
1669180	1673020	It's actually about three quarters of the way out Earth's radius.
1673020	1674820	So the moon orbits around Earth.
1674820	1681820	Earth is actually wobbling around that center of mass, but it doesn't actually orbit it.
1681820	1685620	And really for most people, the definition between a double system and a moon is that
1685620	1689340	the center of mass is outside the figure of both objects.
1689340	1695700	So just for now, it's not called a double planet.
1695700	1701540	But the big question is how did Earth get such a large moon?
1701540	1706460	The only other rocky planet moons are those captured asteroids around Mars, and the only
1706460	1710300	other large moons are around the giant planets.
1710300	1716460	And Earth doesn't have Neptune's mass, so it can't capture a large moon like Neptune
1716460	1718740	captured Triton.
1718740	1725620	The best hypothesis of how Earth got its large moon is a giant impact.
1725620	1730900	Early on in the Solar System, about 10, 20, 30 million years after the Earth formed, a
1730900	1735220	Mars-sized body smashed into Earth.
1735220	1741460	The material from that collision was spewed into the space around Earth, and that coalesced
1741460	1743580	to form our moon.
1743580	1748420	I know that sounds crazy, but we actually have computer simulations these days that can
1748420	1753420	check whether these crazy ideas work, and they actually do show it's reasonable.
1753420	1757900	Now here is a movie that shows the impact.
1757900	1760540	It goes relatively quickly.
1760540	1763940	What you want to look for is that we're going to take a Mars-sized body, smash it into Earth,
1764140	1771140	and the material is then strewn out into a disk surrounding Earth.
1771140	1774980	You can see the material getting sprayed out, some of the material gets eaten up, some of
1774980	1780780	the material of the Earth gets thrown out, and the result at the end of the simulation
1780780	1785420	is a disk of material containing both the impactor and the crustal material of Earth
1785420	1787940	thrown out into a disk.
1787940	1794380	Now we have a second simulation that picks up where that first simulation left off, and
1794380	1799460	in this second simulation we start with a disk of material that's about 2 to 4 times
1799460	1805860	the mass of the moon, and as that material orbits around the Earth, gravity naturally
1805860	1810940	creates these spiral patterns, and gravity gathers the materials into these spiral patterns,
1810940	1815580	these spiral patterns exert torque on things, and then the clumps develop.
1815580	1819940	Now in order for a big clump to develop, the spiral patterns have to sort of move the
1819940	1825060	material out to the outer regions, out to beyond what we call the Roche limit, so this
1825060	1830980	is where larger things can collapse without being tightly stretched apart by the gravity
1830980	1837580	of Earth, and as these big clumps develop out there, the spiral patterns then torque
1837580	1843420	the material and send it out beyond the Roche limit, where it can then accrete onto this
1843420	1844860	larger body.
1844860	1849020	So developing in the simulation you can see that it's developing a very large body way
1849020	1854700	out at the outer part of the disk.
1854700	1860980	The material flows outward, accretes onto the big body, some material flows inward and
1860980	1862980	collapses back onto Earth.
1862980	1869540	Eventually, after all this accretion, you form a protomoon, and the crazy thing about
1869540	1876180	this is that the simulations show it takes about 30 days to form the moon.
1876180	1881420	After they impact about another month, and you have the basics of your moon.
1881420	1885020	Now when we say it's formed, we really don't mean that it's got its full structure and
1885020	1890260	everything, you know it's condensed and collapsed and cooled, but really that just most of the
1890260	1893260	matter that will make up the moon has accreted onto it.
1893260	1898580	Now this giant impact hypothesis explains several things about the moon.
1899260	1901100	It explains why the moon is low density.
1901100	1903980	Earth has a density of 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter.
1903980	1907140	The moon about a little over 3, it's much lower density.
1907140	1910660	The moon couldn't have formed out of the same material that the Earth formed, otherwise
1910660	1913140	it would have closed to the same density.
1913140	1918420	It explains why the composition of the moon would be similar to Earth's upper mantle because
1918420	1922860	a good portion of the moon would actually be made out of stuff that was originally part
1922860	1925740	of the outer part of our Earth.
1925740	1930940	It also explains why the moon's orbit is not in Earth's plane of rotation, as you would
1930940	1935460	expect for a regular moon, or in the plane of the ecliptic, as you would expect for a
1935460	1938180	captured moon.
1938180	1946940	Giant impact hypothesis allows the orbit to vary and fit the observed orbit of the moon.
1946940	1951380	Now I say this is the leading idea for the formation of the moon, but it's not quite
1951380	1952380	proven.
1952380	1957540	However, I can say I know of no other idea for the formation of the moon that does nearly
1957540	1960860	as well as this one does.
1960860	1968980	So in the end, it seems that our moon, with all its impact on our culture and its sociology,
1968980	1975620	on our science and our technology, it was just the result of some solar system pinball
1975620	1976620	dynamics.
1976620	1981660	It's a chance smashup that happened billions of years ago.
1981660	1988620	But this was quite a happy accident because it also had a biological impact as well.
1988620	1994380	The moon has played a significant role in the development of life on Earth.
1994380	1998420	We'll discuss that more in the last lecture of this course.
1998420	2002980	In our next lecture, however, we'll discuss the other major orbiting bodies around the
2002980	2003980	planets.
2003980	2007660	These would be the ring systems around the giant planets.
2007660	2008180	We'll see you then.
