0	28000	October 4th, 1957.
28000	47000	This was the beep heard round the world.
47000	55000	The Soviet Union had launched Sputnik 1, an 84-pound satellite, just a 23-inch sphere,
55000	60000	but it orbited Earth every 98 minutes for 22 days.
60000	69000	The beeping could be heard by amateur radio operators, and it spread the immediate message that the space age had begun.
69000	77000	For astronomy, no other event in history changed our view of the solar system like the ability to explore it.
77000	85000	It is not a coincidence that NASA was founded almost a year to the day after Sputnik 1 launched.
85000	90000	Considering the magnitude of the knowledge explosion that happens during the space age,
90000	95000	it's helpful to explore what we knew at the dawn of the space age,
95000	102000	and take a look at the technological advances that would enable a plethora of new discoveries.
103000	108000	By the mid-1900s, our model of the solar system was well established.
108000	113000	There was the Sun, the nine planets, remember Pluto was still a planet back then,
113000	117000	there are moons, some asteroids, and some comets.
117000	123000	And most folks' idea of the solar system was one of the orbits of the planets around the Sun.
123000	130000	I have an interactive 3D program here that I can use to illustrate this idea.
130000	136000	We start by looking at the orbits of the inner planets, the rocky planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars,
136000	143000	and you can see that they are ellipses, or nearly circular ellipses, around the Sun.
143000	153000	The rocky planets are in close, but if I back away, you can begin to see the outer planets and Pluto.
153000	159000	Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and you can see that Pluto's orbit looks like it crosses Neptune's orbit,
159000	162000	but that's really just a projection effect.
162000	173000	It's a highly inclined orbit, and if I put things edge on, you can see that the four giant planets lie mostly in a plane,
173000	176000	while Pluto lies distinctly out of that plane.
176000	183000	If I wiggle it back and forth just a little, you can see that Pluto's orbit doesn't really cross Neptune's orbit.
183000	186000	It is totally distinct from Neptune's orbit.
186000	192000	Let's go back into the inner planets, and you can see that they too lie in a plane,
192000	199000	so all of the planets basically lie in the same plane as Earth's orbit.
199000	206000	If I go back to the face-on view and turn on time, you can see that Mercury orbits much faster than Venus,
206000	210000	which orbits faster than Earth, which orbits faster than Mars.
210000	216000	This is the Keplerian motion that comes from universal law of gravitation.
216000	222000	As we go out, you can see the same thing is true for Jupiter, and we turn on time a little faster here.
222000	230000	Jupiter moves faster than Saturn, we move faster than Uranus, we move faster than Neptune, and slowest of all is Pluto.
230000	240000	The planets orbit in time scales of a few months for Mercury, up to a few centuries for Pluto.
240000	246000	Now, what that interactive couldn't show you was the size scale of these objects,
246000	250000	and the size scale of the solar system is really vast.
250000	259000	It's almost too vast to be comprehensible, so I like to shrink the solar system down to a manageable size scale in order to understand it.
260000	268000	My favorite comparison is what if the Sun were the size of a basketball?
268000	272000	Standard basketball is 9 inches across.
272000	276000	Well then, what would be the sizes of the planets?
276000	283000	Jupiter would be a sphere about 1 inch in diameter.
284000	290000	Saturn would be about 3 quarters an inch, or 2 centimeters.
290000	301000	Uranus and Neptune are both about a third of an inch across, or a little less than a centimeter.
301000	307000	Earth is very small, and it's only 2 millimeters in size.
307000	313000	Actually, I had to put it inside some pieces of tape, otherwise I would lose it, because it's so small.
313000	320000	That is the true size of our planet compared to a basketball Sun.
320000	327000	It's really only about the size of these little nibs, these tacky nibs to give you a grip on the basketball.
329000	336000	Venus is about the same size as Earth, again, 2 millimeters in size.
336000	341000	Once you get smaller than that, I couldn't find any spheres to fit things.
341000	349000	So, for Mars, I found a large paperclip, and if you hold it up edge on, that's about the size of Mars.
349000	355000	Mars is only 1 millimeter in diameter in this scale model.
355000	361000	Mercury, well that's about the size of a small paperclip, a normal paperclip.
361000	365000	It's less than a millimeter in size.
365000	376000	And finally, Pluto. Pluto is so small that the only thing I could find was a piece of pencil-led half a millimeter in diameter.
376000	379000	That's really small.
379000	384000	So, that's it. That's the scale of the solar system.
384000	392000	You know, a basketball Sun, you've got a 1 inch Jupiter, all the way down to a half millimeter size Pluto.
392000	401000	From this, you can easily see that the Sun contains 99.86% of all the mass in the solar system.
401000	405000	Basically, you can forget all this stuff. This is just flotsam and jetsam.
405000	408000	This is really the whole solar system.
408000	419000	Now, the natural question asked here is, how far away would I have to put these planets in order for them to be at the right distances?
419000	424000	In order to get enough space, I would have to use a football field.
424000	431000	Here is a diagram of this basketball Sun-based solar system laid out on a football field.
431000	439000	If the Sun is on the goal line, then our millimeter-sized Mercury is out at the 21-yard line.
439000	442000	Venus is out at the 39-yard line.
442000	452000	Earth is across midfield at the opponent's 46-yard line, and Mars is all the way 80 yards away on the opponent's 20-yard line.
452000	459000	These tiny millimeter-sized objects are spread out across the length of a football field.
459000	464000	When you go out to the outer solar system, then you're going much further away,
464000	469000	and our 1 inch Jupiter is more than two and a half football fields away.
469000	473000	Three-quarter inch Saturn, five football fields away.
473000	480000	Uranus is a bit less than a kilometer, and Neptune is a little less than a mile.
480000	489000	Pluto, which is only half a millimeter in diameter, is over two kilometers away from this basketball-sized Sun.
490000	492000	So you have to try to imagine that.
492000	506000	For four kilometers across, there is just one basketball, a couple big-sized marbles, a couple small marbles,
506000	513000	some really tiny BBs, and then a bunch of really small things, and even smaller than that.
513000	516000	Then there are the asteroids and comets, which are there just flotsam and jessem.
516000	519000	They don't even add up to a good small moon.
519000	524000	The solar system is really mostly empty space.
524000	534000	It's really kind of amazing that we've actually been able to traverse it.
534000	538000	With space age, we were able to extend across the solar system.
538000	540000	How do we do that?
540000	542000	Well, with a lot of technology.
542000	549000	Technology has really brought about a revolution in our ability to observe and understand the solar system.
549000	555000	Some of this technology allowed us to build telescopes in other wavelengths of light.
555000	563000	You see, we see visible light, but visible light is just a tiny fraction of the full electromagnetic spectrum.
563000	570000	Visible light is depicted here in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it has a small range in the middle,
570000	577000	but extending on to very long wavelengths, we have radio light, microwave light, and infrared light.
577000	583000	And going to shorter wavelengths, we have ultraviolet light, X-ray light, and gamma ray light.
583000	588000	Light is really just the same phenomenon, whether it's gamma ray light or radio light.
588000	595000	It just has different wavelengths, and that's what this wave is supposed to depict here in the middle of the diagram.
595000	600000	The wavelengths for gamma ray go all the way down to 10 to the minus 13th of a centimeter,
600000	607000	whereas wavelengths for radio light go on up to a kilometer or larger, so it expands a huge range.
607000	615000	And visible light is just about a factor of two, a very small region right in here in the center of that.
615000	622000	When we use telescopes in these other wavelengths, we see a lot more of the universe.
622000	626000	For example, when we look at Venus in visible light, it's rather bland.
626000	633000	It's kind of boring because it's entirely cloud covered, and it really just reflects most of it's light back to space in the visible.
633000	642000	But if you use ultraviolet light, you're able to see through those clouds and actually start to see structure in the atmosphere of Venus.
642000	649000	This image here I know has to be in ultraviolet light because I can see the cloud structure in the atmosphere of Venus.
650000	656000	If we look at the sun in visible light, again, like Venus, it looks a little bit bland.
656000	664000	It's basically a nice smooth sphere, and maybe it has a few dots on it, the sunspots on it.
664000	666000	These don't look terribly impressive.
666000	672000	However, when you look at it in x-ray light, the sun comes alive.
672000	682000	Those sunspots are areas of fierce magnetic storms and are emitting huge amounts of energy in ultraviolet and x-ray light.
682000	693000	By studying all the different wavelengths of light, it gives astronomers a more complete picture of the physical processes taking place in our universe.
693000	699000	Another major technology that has helped astronomy is digital technology, computers.
699000	704000	When we used photographs for astronomy, there were an analog medium.
704000	710000	The emulsions of a photograph respond in a complex way to the amount of light that is absorbed.
710000	719000	Because when a photograph absorbs twice as many photons of light, it's not necessarily going to be twice as bright.
719000	727000	And as astronomers, we need to know how much light had been absorbed from an object in order to understand it.
727000	732000	So we had to measure what we call the response curve of a photographic emulsion.
732000	740000	When we moved to digital images, we bypassed that and were able to get a quantified numerical measure of the light received.
740000	745000	We use something called CCDs. It stands for Charge Coupled Devices.
745000	748000	These are the same things that are in your digital camera.
748000	751000	You might even have a digital camera on your phone these days.
751000	755000	Well, astronomers have been using CCDs for about 20 years.
755000	760000	And they were actually an important secondary market for the makers of CCDs.
760000	766000	So astronomers in a way helped bring about the camera that you may have in your phone today.
766000	773000	And once our data has been recorded digitally, we have it available for computer processing.
773000	778000	And that can bring out details that are impossible to extract from a photograph.
778000	783000	Now, for example, this is an image of a nebula.
783000	789000	And it is done at a low stretch so that we can see the details in the very bright regions in the center of it.
789000	798000	If instead, I computer processed it to bring out the faint details, while the central region will be overblown,
798000	803000	but I could see the details in the outer region, you see how much nebula there really is.
804000	811000	We can then work with it to try and come up with a balanced stretch digitally and come up with an image like this.
811000	816000	We can also take multiple images of it and digitally combine them together
816000	819000	so that we can get a color composite of various wavelengths.
819000	824000	Looking at it in different filters, red, blue and green,
824000	830000	also filters that respond to different hydrogen atoms or calcium atoms or helium atoms.
830000	835000	And you can get a wonderful color picture like this.
835000	841000	Using computers also opens up ideas for using simulations.
841000	845000	We have supercomputers that can process data very quickly
845000	852000	and we can take ideas that we could never observe in nature and simulate them on a computer.
852000	857000	For example, there are two images of a galaxy collision sequence.
857000	861000	In the top image, you see the two galaxies before they've collided.
861000	866000	They're trapped in each other's gravity and they're about to smash through one another.
866000	872000	The bottom image shows the computer simulation after the two galaxies have collided.
872000	879000	This simulation was run on a supercomputer about a decade ago and took about a week's worth of calculation time.
879000	884000	In nature, the process would have taken about a billion years,
884000	888000	but we can simulate it on the computer and study it.
888000	894000	Now, I know this is a course in the solar system and these galaxies aren't part of the solar system,
894000	899000	but trust me when I say we use computer simulation all the time in solar system objects as well,
899000	906000	specifically for calculating orbits and observing the stability of the orbits within the solar system.
906000	911000	Computers are also very useful in working with our telescopes.
911000	915000	A computer-controlled telescope are easier to operate.
915000	919000	They can be larger and they can be more accurate.
919000	925000	Matter of fact, professional astronomers never move a telescope anymore.
925000	929000	For one, there are telescope operators on the mountain.
929000	933000	And number two, even the telescope operators don't move those big telescopes anymore
933000	935000	because they're all controlled by computers.
935000	939000	And sometimes you don't even have to go to the mountain.
939000	944000	Sometimes you can actually control the computer over the internet
944000	947000	and you don't even have to leave your research institution.
947000	953000	As an example of telescopes that are heavily controlled by computers,
953000	956000	let's look at the Twin Keck Telescopes.
956000	961000	Here they are on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.
961000	966000	The Keck Telescopes are 10-meter reflecting telescopes.
966000	972000	But 10 meters is larger than the largest piece of glass we can make for a mirror.
972000	974000	How do they do that?
974000	978000	Well, the Keck Telescopes are actually a segmented mirror.
978000	983000	In this image, you can see the mirror stretching 10 meters across.
983000	988000	And I've overlaid these hexagons to show you the segments of the mirror.
988000	994000	There are actually 36 hexagonal segments that build up this entire mirror.
994000	998000	Behind each mirror, there are sensors and actuators.
998000	1003000	And twice a second, computers line up the edges between those segments.
1003000	1006000	The edges have to be lined up to a very precise amount
1006000	1010000	because we have to get down below the wavelength of light.
1010000	1014000	They are lined up to 4 nanometers twice a second.
1014000	1019000	Without computers, the Keck Telescope would be impossible.
1020000	1024000	You can also use computers to link together telescopes.
1024000	1028000	And this is very common in radio observations.
1028000	1031000	Here we have a radio telescope array.
1031000	1036000	And each of these dishes is a radio telescope in itself.
1036000	1041000	But all of the radio telescopes in this long array are linked together by computers.
1041000	1046000	And all of their observations are brought into the central computer and correlated together.
1046000	1049000	And by combining the signals from all of them,
1049000	1054000	you effectively get one radio dish as large as the entire array.
1054000	1060000	What's even more impressive is that you can take an array here in the United States,
1060000	1065000	an array in Europe, an array in Australia, all around the world,
1065000	1067000	and tie them together.
1067000	1071000	And you effectively get a radio telescope as large as Earth.
1071000	1076000	This is being done, and it's called very long baseline interferometry.
1076000	1083000	They provide radio telescope observations that are the highest resolution that we can get.
1083000	1090000	As good as that is, it still helps to get off our planet and above our atmosphere.
1090000	1096000	Because Earth's atmosphere actually blocks most of the light reaching it.
1097000	1100000	As we can see in this diagram here,
1100000	1104000	the visible light is transmitted through Earth's atmosphere,
1104000	1108000	and radio waves mostly get through Earth's atmosphere.
1108000	1112000	Infrared light can be seen pretty well from mountaintops,
1112000	1116000	but most of the rest of the radiation doesn't get through our atmosphere.
1116000	1122000	Most of it absorbed either high in the atmosphere or about halfway down through the atmosphere.
1122000	1130000	Now, this may sound strange because we use sunblock to protect us from the UV radiation of the sun.
1130000	1134000	Not that much UV radiation is truly getting through.
1134000	1138000	If the complete amount of UV radiation was truly getting through,
1138000	1141000	we'd need some really serious sunblock.
1141000	1147000	The other thing Earth's atmosphere does is, of course, it distorts the light that does come through.
1148000	1153000	The observations we make from telescopes on the ground are a little bit blurry
1153000	1156000	because of the motions within Earth's atmosphere,
1156000	1162000	and we can really only see resolutions down to about one arc second on most telescopes on the ground.
1162000	1168000	So getting above Earth's atmosphere will enable us to see wavelengths that we can't see from the ground,
1168000	1174000	and it will also give us better observations in the wavelengths we can see.
1174000	1179000	The most famous satellite telescope is the Hubble Space Telescope.
1179000	1184000	Here it is shown in its orbit above the Earth.
1184000	1192000	It is about 360 miles above Earth, and if you look on this image, you can see along the Earth's atmosphere.
1192000	1199000	The atmosphere is only about 60 miles high, so Hubble skims along just above Earth's atmosphere.
1199000	1202000	We say that it's in low Earth orbit.
1202000	1212000	I often describe Hubble as having a bird's eye view because it's up high and it has very fine resolution.
1212000	1220000	Hubble not being limited by Earth's atmosphere has a resolution down as fine as one twentieth of an arc second.
1220000	1224000	This gives it the finest resolution in visible light of any telescope,
1224000	1231000	and most of the spectacular nature of the images from Hubble comes from this vantage point in space.
1232000	1235000	Now, this is low Earth orbit.
1235000	1241000	In contrast, the Spitzer Space Telescope is much farther away.
1241000	1248000	Instead of being hundreds of miles from Earth, it is tens of millions of miles from Earth.
1248000	1251000	It's actually farther from Earth than the Moon.
1251000	1258000	Spitzer is an infrared telescope, which you may know is associated with heat radiation.
1258000	1266000	And it is advantageous for Spitzer to be out at that distance so that it gets away from the heat of Earth.
1266000	1272000	Hubble and Spitzer are just two of NASA's great observatories.
1272000	1278000	The other two are the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory that observes in gamma rays, that's already completed its mission,
1278000	1283000	and the Chandra X-ray Observatory that observes in X-rays.
1283000	1290000	These are a suite of observatories placed in space to do general observing in four major wavelength bands.
1290000	1300000	But we also sent a fleet of other, more specialized observatories to look at the universe in many, many different wavelengths.
1300000	1307000	In this chart, we show many of the space missions that have been launched and the wavelength coverage that they've got.
1307000	1319000	We can see we have several missions out here in gamma rays, many in X-rays, some in UV, visible, or through the infrared microwave,
1319000	1323000	and we even have some radio telescopes in space.
1323000	1333000	These missions allow us to see the universe in new ways and in finer detail than we could from the ground.
1334000	1342000	Finally, beyond just looking at the universe, in the space age, we have gone there.
1342000	1347000	We have taken the next step and become explorers of our solar system.
1347000	1357000	We have manned and satellite missions that have gone across the solar system and uncovered details that enrich and have transformed our scientific views.
1357000	1362000	The most famous of these is, of course, the Apollo missions to the moon.
1362000	1372000	These Apollo missions transformed the moon into a real place and transformed humanity into adventurers across the universe.
1372000	1374000	Here's one of the most famous images.
1374000	1382000	This is Buzz Aldrin and the American flag on the moon, and it evokes sort of patriotic sense that we have conquered,
1382000	1389000	well, I don't think anyone thinks we've really conquered the moon, but at least we have conquered the way to get to the moon.
1389000	1392000	As an astronomer, there are two things I notice about this.
1392000	1394000	Well, three things, actually.
1394000	1399000	First is that the flag is being held up, all right?
1399000	1406000	That waving in the flag, that's not real, because the second thing I know about this is there's no atmosphere on the moon.
1406000	1410000	If you look beyond the horizon, it's pitch dark.
1410000	1414000	The third thing I notice about it is all these footprints down here.
1415000	1425000	And if you think about it, there is no atmosphere, there is no rain, there is no erosion on the moon, and those footprints are still there.
1425000	1430000	Those footprints will be there for billions of years.
1430000	1437000	Another thing as an astronomer that I like about the Apollo missions to the moon is not necessarily the pictures of the astronauts,
1437000	1440000	but they're the pictures of the moon itself.
1440000	1447000	This image of a crater taken from the Apollo orbiter somehow speaks to me.
1447000	1454000	It really brings up a visceral sense of the moon, and you've got this giant crater and all these small craters around it,
1454000	1460000	and I immediately start imagining the impact events that must have formed this surface.
1460000	1469000	To me, the close-up images that we have of the moon and all the other planets from our space missions have taken these places
1469000	1478000	and put them into my mind and provoked my imagination about what the universe is really like.
1478000	1483000	They give me, I don't know, texture to the solar system.
1483000	1488000	But even before we went to the moon, we started visiting other planets.
1488000	1495000	This image here is a drawing of the first interplanetary probe, Mariner 2.
1495000	1500000	It was launched August 27, 1962, on a mission to Venus.
1500000	1503000	It was followed by many other missions.
1503000	1510000	There were the Venera probes to Venus, which by the way landed on its surface, and then promptly melted,
1510000	1512000	because the temperatures on Venus are so hot.
1513000	1521000	There are the Mariner missions to Mercury, the Vikings missions to Mars, Galileo to Jupiter, Cassini to Saturn.
1521000	1528000	We even have the New Horizons mission going out to Pluto, and it'll get there around 2015.
1528000	1534000	There are two missions in particular that struck me as I was growing up.
1534000	1539000	The first one are the Voyager missions to the outer solar system.
1539000	1543000	Shown here in this diagram are the plots of the Voyager missions.
1543000	1552000	Voyager 1 went past Jupiter in 79 and Saturn in 80, and then continued on out of the solar system.
1552000	1562000	Voyager 2 followed shortly thereafter and continued on to visit Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989.
1562000	1565000	They took some amazing pictures of these planets.
1565000	1572000	They discovered moons and rings, and they transformed our ideas about the outer solar system.
1572000	1580000	It really ignited my imagination, and what's really nice about these Voyager missions is that they're still going.
1580000	1588000	They have exited the inner part of the solar system, and now they're about 100 AU away from the Sun,
1588000	1592000	and they're on what they call the Voyager interstellar mission.
1592000	1600000	In a few years, they're going to reach the edge of the solar wind and explore the heliopause.
1600000	1609000	These two small satellites, launched in the late 1970s, are still going 30 years later.
1609000	1615000	The other missions that really excited my imagination have been this fleet of Mars missions,
1615000	1621000	starting with Viking in the 70s and extending on through the several missions we have at Mars today.
1621000	1628000	We have orbited, we have landed, and we have explored the red planet.
1628000	1633000	This image here is one of the best images of Mars that we can get from Earth.
1633000	1640000	It's an image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and it's fantastic for an Earth-based image,
1640000	1646000	but if you really want something cool, well, we've been there.
1646000	1652000	This is a famous image called Twin Peaks, referring to the two peaks in the background,
1652000	1656000	and basically it looks like a rock garden on Mars.
1656000	1661000	It was taken by one of the rovers, and the rovers have moved throughout the landscape
1661000	1664000	and examined the geology and searched for water.
1664000	1670000	But more powerful is the infusion of this as a place into my imagination.
1670000	1676000	We have transformed those tiny spots of light that I've seen through telescopes
1676000	1679000	and made them into known worlds.
1679000	1688000	We have begun to explore our neighborhood and space, and it has become part of our thinking.
1688000	1694000	When historians write the history of the Solar System, they tend to focus on the Copernican Revolution.
1694000	1698000	It's often cited as, ah, the biggest change in our view of the Solar System,
1698000	1702000	that we went from the Earth-centered to the Sun-centered.
1702000	1706000	Ah, as an astronomer I have to disagree.
1706000	1712000	I think that the space age is the more important epoch.
1712000	1719000	The space age brought us new ways to observe the Solar System in more wavelengths and with bigger telescopes,
1719000	1724000	new ways to analyze with better data and faster processing,
1724000	1732000	and also a new way to explore both with robots and with our own eyes.
1732000	1736000	We have gone through the breadth of the Solar System.
1736000	1745000	This image here, very famous image, Earthrise, symbolizes the change in perspective.
1745000	1752000	When we as humans see our own planet rising and we see it in space as it truly is,
1752000	1756000	we no longer think of the system as out there.
1756000	1760000	It has become real, up here.
1760000	1767000	It has become part of our mental model, and we see our place in the Solar System anew.
1767000	1775000	The capabilities enabled by the space age have changed our perspective more than anything else in history.
1775000	1787000	And in the next several lectures, we will explore in detail the range of observations, ideas, and discoveries enabled by the space age.
1787000	1790000	Until then, have a wonderful day.
