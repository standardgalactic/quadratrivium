0	25540	I would like to start today with an amazing image taken by the Apollo 12 mission.
25540	31240	This is an image of a solar eclipse, but it's not by the moon.
31240	34960	This is the sun being eclipsed by Earth.
34960	42400	The Apollo 12 mission flew through Earth's shadow and was able to get this amazing picture.
42400	46400	Now I know that this picture was not staged, they didn't really have to change the mission
46400	51080	profile in order to get this picture done, because the Apollo missions were generally
51080	56880	done during full moon, so the moon was at opposition, and flying through Earth's shadow
56880	59320	was not really a detour.
59320	66200	Now it's a beautiful image, but what excites me is looking at that thin crescent of Earth's
66200	67400	atmosphere.
67400	74200	It's even exaggerated a bit by the backlighting, and it helps me appreciate what a thin blanket
74200	76400	Earth's atmosphere really is.
76400	82520	It's just a tiny margin that separates us from space, and in this sort of an image
82520	88320	it seems so fragile against all that empty blackness of space.
88320	95400	And it's especially so because within that protective layer exists all the life we know
95400	98560	of in the universe.
98560	107680	On our 13,000 kilometer-sized planet, just a 100 kilometer thick air bubble is where
107680	110000	we exist.
110000	113720	So let's take a closer look at that atmosphere and the other atmospheres across the solar
113720	119440	system, and how they are structured, how they behave, and how they affect the prospects
119440	122120	of life.
122120	131960	Our atmosphere on Earth consists of 77% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% water vapor, and 1% argon.
131960	135720	Now this is not what most folks expect.
135720	140560	Oxygen is not the main component of our atmosphere, rather nitrogen is.
140560	144760	And nitrogen is not something we really think of much, maybe we think about spreading some
144760	151400	nitrogen in our garden, but it really is all around us in the air.
151400	158000	Another surprise from a lot of people is that carbon dioxide is not an important constituent.
158000	162680	For all that one hears about carbon dioxide as being a greenhouse gas, it's really less
162680	168400	than one-thirtieth of 1% of our atmosphere.
168400	172680	In contrast, Venus has plenty of carbon dioxide.
172680	176200	It makes up 96% of Venus's atmosphere.
176200	181360	The other 3% is nitrogen, and then there's some minor amounts of water vapor and argon.
182360	185200	Venus has a much thicker atmosphere.
185200	189840	The atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is about 100 times that of atmospheric
189840	192360	pressure at the surface of Earth.
192360	199920	Earth's atmosphere, in turn, has about 100 times the atmospheric pressure of Mars' atmosphere.
199920	206520	Mars has a very thin atmosphere, but it's also mainly carbon dioxide, about 95%, with
206520	210280	nitrogen and argon.
210280	217480	These bar graphs summarize the compositions of these atmospheres, where you can see strongly
217480	224320	that Earth is the odd man out here, whereas Venus and Mars are dominated by carbon dioxide,
224320	230600	Earth is dominated by nitrogen, and has enough oxygen for us to be able to breathe.
230600	235360	Another way to look at the atmospheres is through their vertical structure.
235360	241280	We say that Earth's atmosphere is about 100 kilometers thick, but really, how do you
241280	244880	measure the top of an atmosphere?
244880	250760	Earth's atmosphere has four different levels, the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere,
250760	252680	and the thermosphere.
252680	258240	The troposphere extends from the ground up to about 15 kilometers, and it contains 80%
258240	260680	the mass of our atmosphere.
260680	267360	It is dominated by heat absorbed by the ground and re-radiated, so the temperature decreases
267360	273440	a few degrees for each kilometer you go up in height in the atmosphere.
273440	277800	And well, you've been through the troposphere, because if you've taken an airplane flight,
277800	281160	airplanes fly at about 10 kilometers, and that's about two-thirds of the way up the
281160	283320	troposphere.
283320	287600	Above the troposphere is the stratosphere, and in the stratosphere, ozone molecules
287600	293240	absorb the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, and that causes the atmosphere to heat up.
293240	298920	That continues on up to about 50 kilometers, which in there we encounter the mesosphere,
298920	302880	and again the temperature then starts to decrease with altitude.
302880	307360	That continues up to about 85 kilometers, where we hit the thermosphere, and the temperature
307360	312560	then starts to increase with altitude, because the atmosphere is absorbing the high energy
312560	315000	radiation from the Sun.
315000	320360	The thermosphere includes the ionosphere, the electrically charged region, where we
320360	322600	see the auroras.
322600	327760	Now the height of the atmosphere, we say is about 100 kilometers.
327760	331520	Now that's almost the top of the mesosphere, but not quite.
331520	334000	Actually, here's a secret for you.
334000	337960	It isn't really derived from the properties of the atmosphere.
337960	344560	It basically was a calculation as to what is the highest altitude a plane could fly,
344560	351080	and basically it's the boundary between what you would call aeronautics and astronautics,
351080	354080	and they got a number around 100 kilometers, and they rounded it off to 100 kilometers,
354080	356560	because it's a good, honest number.
356560	363720	And so you are not officially an astronaut unless you cross the 100 kilometer barrier.
363720	370320	Here is a graph of the atmospheric temperature with height, and the blue line here is that
370320	376720	of Earth's, and you can see how it decreases through the troposphere, increases through
376720	383080	the stratosphere, decreases again through the mesosphere, and increases in the thermosphere.
383080	387200	We can compare these regions to those on Venus and Mars.
387200	392440	For Venus, we define the same levels, but you can see that the troposphere, the region
392440	396040	where it's decreasing with temperature, goes up much, much higher.
396040	399760	It goes up to about 65 kilometers.
399760	405080	Now I've heard the region on Venus between 65 kilometers and 95 kilometers, both called
405080	408200	both the stratosphere and the mesosphere.
408200	412040	So I'm not really sure which to call it, we'll just call it the middle atmosphere.
412040	416280	And then the thermosphere begins around 95 kilometers.
416280	424040	And so while the atmosphere of Venus is 100 times heavier than that of Earth, its height
424040	429720	is about the same, 95 kilometers versus about 85 for Earth.
429720	433680	And surprisingly, the same is true for Mars.
433680	437040	Its upper atmosphere starts at about 110 kilometers.
437040	441520	Its middle atmosphere extends down to about 45 kilometers, and the lower atmosphere goes
441520	443600	from there to the ground.
443600	449680	For three atmospheric pressures of vastly different scales, it is surprising that they
449680	454440	have roughly similar vertical extent.
454440	460320	Also similar and surprising is the atmosphere of Saturn's large moon, Titan.
460320	465800	Here's an image of Titan, with it being backlit by the sun, somewhat like that solar eclipse
465800	467920	image I showed you.
467920	472880	And it's surprising, first of all, that Titan even has an atmosphere.
472880	479440	The other moons of the same size, Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Armon, as well as Mercury,
479440	484320	which is smaller by the way than Titan, they do not have atmospheres.
484320	490720	Secondly, it's surprising that its atmosphere extends to about 600 kilometers away from
490720	491920	the moon.
491920	496800	This is six times the extent of the atmospheres of the rocky planets.
496800	503160	And third, it's surprising that for a moon, its atmospheric pressure is one and a half
503160	505520	times that of Earth.
505520	511040	Now, considering the wide range of pressures on Venus and Mars, this sort of counts as
511040	517680	a similarity as well, because Venus is 100 times larger and Mars is 100 times smaller,
517680	522880	so being only one and a half is really quite similar to Earth.
522880	526600	Another similarity is that it is predominantly a nitrogen atmosphere.
526600	531680	It is 98% nitrogen and about 2% methane.
531680	536840	Methane reacts with the sun's ultraviolet radiation and forms a very dense smog layer
536840	539080	high up in Titan's atmosphere.
539080	541240	This is why you can't see through it.
541240	546680	What you are seeing in this yellow region over here on this image is the smog layer high
546680	548600	up in Titan's atmosphere.
548600	553920	The Huygens probe that landed on the surface of Titan could not see the sun.
553920	559440	So finally, out in the solar system, we have found worse smog than exists in Mexico City
559440	562760	or Los Angeles.
562760	566600	A couple other moons have a rather tenuous atmospheres.
566600	570040	Io has an atmosphere that derives from its volcanic emissions.
570040	575320	It's basically sulfur dioxide that has been spewed out by the volcanoes, or actually sublimated
575320	580000	from the surface after the volcanic spewing condensed on the surface.
580000	585240	It is one billionth the pressure of Earth, and even that is lost to space relatively
585240	586240	quickly.
586240	593600	If you could suddenly turn off all the volcanoes on Io, eventually its atmosphere would disappear.
593600	599920	Titan's large moon Triton has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane just like Titan.
599920	601720	Triton is like Titan.
601720	603880	Sometimes you get those words mixed up.
603880	609800	However, Titan's atmosphere is over 10,000 times more dense than Triton's.
609800	616640	Triton is a very, very thin wispy atmosphere that rises about 10 kilometers above its surface.
616640	622200	Pluto's atmosphere is essentially the same as Triton, and due to its elliptical orbit,
622400	624720	Pluto's atmosphere isn't permanent.
624720	629480	It will actually freeze out as it gets further from the sun.
629480	634800	Now the New Horizons mission is headed toward Pluto, and it will arrive there in 2015.
634800	641280	I hope there's enough atmosphere left that they can study it when they get there.
641280	646400	The giant planets have deep atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, and they descend down
646400	649360	to very high temperatures and pressures.
649400	654720	So instead of asking where is the top here, you can also ask where is the bottom?
654720	660600	Well, since there is no surface on these giant planets, the thickness is irrelevant.
660600	663360	It goes down for thousands of kilometers.
663360	668240	What really is relevant is that the atmospheres are a significant percentage of mass of the
668240	669520	planet.
669520	674320	On the rocky planets, the atmospheric mass is a tiny, tiny percentage of the total mass
674320	675320	of the planet.
675480	679440	But here in the gas giant planets, it's a significant percentage.
679440	685520	Now as with the discussion of their interiors, Jupiter and Saturn followed a little different
685520	689640	category from that of Uranus and Neptune.
689640	693240	Here are the temperature curves for Jupiter and Saturn.
693240	701640	The zero point here, I will note, is arbitrarily set at the pressure of 0.1 times Earth's atmosphere,
701640	707800	and the y-axis shows you the altitude in kilometers above or below that arbitrary zero point.
707800	712320	The first thing you should notice is that these are very cold atmospheres.
712320	718960	The temperatures on the x-axis are in the Kelvin scale, where zero is the absolute zero.
718960	726400	The degree range is the same as Celsius, but with water freezing at 273 degrees Kelvin.
726400	731320	So if you take these temperatures and subtract 273 degrees, you get temperatures on the Celsius
731320	732760	scale.
732760	738400	The warmest temperatures on these plots are basically normal temperatures on Earth, and
738400	746040	when you look at the tops of the atmospheres, they're about 200 degrees below zero.
746040	749320	You see the same pattern as we saw for the rocky planets.
749320	752920	The temperature decreases as you go up with height through the troposphere, and then it
752920	757520	increases with the height as you get through the thermosphere.
757520	762480	The image here also shows the major cloud layers on Jupiter and Saturn.
762480	766520	The different substances in its atmosphere will condense out at different temperatures
766520	767880	and pressures.
767880	773440	There are three distinct cloud levels in the atmospheres, one of ammonia ice, one of ammonium
773440	777520	hydro sulfide, and one of water ice.
777520	781640	So when you're looking at different clouds on Jupiter and Saturn, you're really looking
781640	786360	to different depth and temperature within the atmosphere.
786360	791680	For example, here's a picture of Jupiter from the Hubble Space Telescope.
791680	794360	Note that it has many brown and white bands.
794360	798080	Now the top is brown, and then you've got a couple of brown bands up in the northern
798080	803720	hemisphere and some brown bands and a little bit of brown towards the south pole.
803720	809680	Contrast that to an infrared telescope image of it that sees the heat.
809680	814280	When looking at the heat signature, those brown bands then become very bright in the
814280	815640	infrared.
815640	820400	What is happening is you're seeing deeper into the atmosphere and seeing higher temperatures
820400	821400	through those brown bands.
821400	830280	The brown bands are the lower clouds at higher temperature within Jupiter's atmosphere.
830280	834320	These are the atmospheric temperature curves for Uranus and Neptune.
834320	840200	The situation on Uranus and Neptune involves the same ideas we've already discussed, except
840200	843120	we're dealing with even colder temperatures.
843120	848760	You can see that to the depths we've probed in these two planets, the temperatures are
848760	856720	still 100 to 150 degrees below freezing, and at their coldest near the tops of the atmosphere,
856720	860600	they're over 200 degrees below zero.
860600	866680	This allows clouds that we would never see on any other planet, methane ice crystals,
866680	872880	because methane doesn't freeze until minus 180 degrees centigrade.
872880	875360	Here is an image that shows you these clouds.
875360	881440	These are the white streaky features here on the planet, Neptune.
881440	887280	Note that the blue color of Neptune is also due to methane.
887280	892560	Methane absorbs red light and only blue light is reflected, and that gives Neptune its beautiful
892560	894820	blue color.
894820	898880	This reminds you a little bit of what we see on Earth.
898880	902680	On Earth, we see blue skies with white clouds.
902680	907880	This is visually similar, but physically it's entirely different.
907880	911400	Earth clouds, as you probably know, are made of water vapor.
911400	916440	They occur at many different levels, but they actually have distinct levels.
916440	920480	And again, if you've taken an airplane ride, you've probably noticed that sometimes you
920480	926000	have to pass through the cloud deck, and it can be one type of weather beneath the cloud
926000	929600	deck and a totally different type of weather up above the cloud deck.
929600	933360	But there's a distinct level of clouds that you pass through.
933360	939720	Also, Earth's sky is blue because the air molecules are scattering blue light better
939720	941440	than they scatter red light.
941440	945360	Now, when you ask people, why is the sky blue?
945360	949480	Sometimes they'll give you a crazy answer like, oh, because it reflects the water, and that's
949480	950480	just wrong.
950480	951480	Okay?
951480	954240	I just got to get rid of that misconception.
954240	958040	If that were true, why would the sky be blue in Kansas, huh?
958040	959800	When there's no water around.
959800	965600	The sky is blue because the air molecules preferentially scatter blue light better than
965600	967440	they scatter red light.
967440	969560	All right.
969560	973000	Now Mars also has some wispy clouds.
973000	977680	Here is an image of the clouds on Mars, and you can see them in the northern hemisphere
977680	982520	up towards the North Pole, these very wispy white things.
982520	988120	They have lower clouds that are made of water vapor and the higher clouds that are cold
988120	991200	enough to beat carbon dioxide ice.
991200	997240	Venus's clouds, well, I think Venus's clouds are probably the coolest clouds anywhere in
997240	1004560	the solar system because get this, they are actually made of sulfuric acid droplets.
1004560	1007200	That's right, sulfuric acid clouds.
1007200	1009120	How cool is that?
1009120	1015240	They have a very thick cloud layer about 50 kilometers up in the atmosphere that's continual
1015240	1020520	clouds for about 10 kilometers, a 10 kilometer thick cloud deck.
1020520	1026640	So if you're on the surface of Venus, just like on the surface of Titan, you can't really
1026640	1028800	see the sun.
1028800	1033640	This also means that Venus is rather featureless when seen in visible light.
1033640	1038160	The image I'm showing here uses ultraviolet light to sort of pierce through some of the
1038160	1041400	clouds and be able to see the patterns in it.
1041400	1046760	That sort of chevron pattern, you see this sort of Y-shaped pattern, that leads us to
1046760	1051960	our next topic, which is that of winds.
1051960	1057080	And the basic idea for Earth and Venus is something we call Hadley-Sell Convection.
1057080	1060160	It's really simple, you already know it.
1060160	1065240	It's basically hot air rises, cold air descends.
1065400	1068440	We'll apply that to Earth.
1068440	1070080	Where is it hottest?
1070080	1071080	Along the equator.
1071080	1073400	So hot air will rise at the equator.
1073400	1074520	Where is it coldest?
1074520	1075680	At the poles.
1075680	1077480	Cold air will descend at the poles.
1077480	1081800	So you have a simple, natural circulation pattern from rising at the equator, streaming
1081800	1084880	up to the poles, and descending at the poles.
1084880	1089440	On Venus, it has a relatively slow rotation.
1089440	1097720	Venus rotates in about 243 days, and that allows it to have one Hadley-Sell per hemisphere.
1097720	1102480	This is a beautiful example of Hadley-Sell circulation.
1102480	1107160	And then the winds, and you've got these circulation patterns going up, the winds,
1107160	1111680	the jet stream on Venus, drive that chevron pattern.
1111680	1116400	So take a Hadley-Sell circulation, and then start to move it with jet stream winds, and
1116400	1119280	you get that chevron pattern.
1119280	1125600	I note that these winds are about 200 miles per hour.
1125600	1134480	While Venus rotates in 243 days, the winds circulate around the planet in only four days.
1134480	1141240	On Earth, we have faster rotation, and instead of producing one Hadley-Sell, we actually produce
1141240	1142920	three cells.
1142920	1147720	Near the equator, we're familiar with the trade winds, and they blow from east to west
1147720	1150480	along the equatorial latitudes.
1150480	1155520	At the mid-latitudes, such as that of most of the United States and Europe, the winds
1155520	1161760	blow from west to east, and then the third cell near the poles, again, blow back in the
1161760	1164880	opposite direction, east to west.
1164880	1170200	I note that Antarctica has become a really great place for balloon-born science.
1170200	1176040	Because you can launch a balloon, it will follow its winds all the way around the pole
1176160	1180080	and come back towards the launch area, where you can recover it.
1180080	1185640	In the U.S., we see these different trade wind motions in hurricanes.
1185640	1190720	The familiar pattern is that a hurricane will form out in the Southern Atlantic Ocean.
1190720	1193440	It will move westward towards the U.S.
1193440	1198400	It will turn up the coast and move back eastward as it dissipates.
1198400	1204000	It's born in the trade winds, and then it dissipates in the westerlies.
1204000	1211040	The wind speeds on Earth, or in these hurricanes, at level one hurricane, is 75 miles per hour.
1211040	1216400	They go all the way up to a level five hurricane, that's 150 miles per hour.
1216400	1221560	On Earth, we have recorded wind speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour.
1221560	1223560	Is that amazing?
1223560	1228720	Well, no, not when you view it in context of the solar system.
1228720	1238320	Because the fastest speeds on Earth are equivalent to the 200 miles per hour jet stream that is seen on Venus all the time.
1238320	1244160	And that's to say nothing of what we see on the giant planets.
1244160	1250080	Jupiter is ten times larger than Earth, but it rotates in half the time.
1250080	1254080	Jupiter spins on its axis once every ten hours.
1254080	1259120	This produces a large number of zonal winds.
1259120	1262760	These are the banded structure that we see on the planet.
1262760	1268240	The lighter regions are called zones, and the darker regions are called bands.
1268240	1273640	Like on Earth, one region is blowing west, and the region adjacent to it is blowing east,
1273640	1277240	and the next one is blowing west, and the next one is blowing east.
1277240	1282120	You can see from the image there are about a dozen or so of these regions.
1282160	1288160	And sometimes we sort of think of these bands as permanent features, but they can change.
1288160	1292160	Here are two images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
1292160	1299160	And what I want to point out to you in the left hand image, in March, you can see this white zone in the north.
1299160	1305160	When we looked at it again in June, that white zone had become a dark band.
1305200	1314200	Likewise, in the southern part of Jupiter, there's a sort of turbulent region that is dark in June,
1314200	1321200	but looking back into March, it sort of had an inverted structure and a lot more calm in March.
1321200	1327200	So while a tiger can't change its stripes, it appears Jupiter can.
1327200	1331200	The wind speeds on Jupiter are relatively calm.
1331240	1336240	Most of them are about 40 miles per hour, especially as you go towards the poles.
1336240	1341240	The central band reaches about 200 miles per hour.
1341240	1345240	Here is a plot of the Jupiter wind speeds with latitude.
1345240	1350240	The x-axis is plotted in meters per second, but it is relatively simple.
1350240	1356240	You can just multiply that by 2.2 and you'll get miles per hour.
1356280	1360280	The fastest winds in the solar system are on Saturn.
1360280	1364280	And here in comparison to Jupiter, it's the same plot for Saturn.
1364280	1369280	And you can see where Jupiter's speeds reach about 200 miles per hour.
1369280	1373280	Saturn's speeds reach 1,100 miles per hour.
1373280	1377280	That's five times the maximum ever recorded on Earth.
1377280	1383280	And this isn't just blowing once or twice. This is blowing all the time every day.
1383280	1388280	Now when you think about the giant planets and wind speeds, it should bring up a question.
1388280	1391280	Wind speed relative to what?
1391280	1394280	On Earth, it's relative to the ground.
1394280	1398280	On Saturn, it's relative to the internal rotation rate.
1398280	1405280	However, recent Cassini observations have made us unsure exactly what the internal rotation rate of Saturn is.
1405280	1412280	So although this is a record in the record books, we may have to put an asterisk next to it because it could be revised later.
1412280	1419280	Still, no matter what we discover about the internal rotation rate, these winds are really fast.
1419280	1425280	Now when we look at Saturn, we can see that these winds produce the same banded structure that we see on Jupiter.
1425280	1429280	Although it's much more muted than we see on Jupiter.
1429280	1432280	One unusual feature of Saturn is found in its poles.
1432280	1436280	Remember how we had circular polar winds on Earth?
1436280	1443280	Same thing appears on Saturn, but here it's in the shape of a hexagon.
1443280	1447280	Don't ask me why. We just don't know.
1447280	1451280	But you can see from this animation that it's a stable pattern.
1451280	1457280	It was seen 30 years ago by Voyager and was seen again recently by Cassini.
1457280	1463280	The situation on Uranus and Neptune is a little less clear because we have fewer observations.
1463280	1469280	Uranus and Neptune have only been visited by one satellite, Voyager 2.
1469280	1477280	Here are the winds on Uranus and Neptune, and you can see one thing that's interesting about them in comparison to Jupiter and Saturn
1477280	1482280	is their equatorial jet streams flow west instead of flowing east.
1482280	1487280	These jet streams are slower than their internal rotation period.
1487280	1492280	The pole flow, as you can see, is more towards the east.
1492280	1497280	Now, in preparing for this lecture, I looked up things on the Internet.
1497280	1503280	I found a lot of references that say Neptune has the fastest wind speeds in the solar system,
1503280	1510280	and they were claiming 1,500 mph winds on Neptune, and I couldn't reconcile it.
1510280	1517280	The only way I could reconcile it is if you look at Neptune and you take the peak of the eastward motion
1517280	1525280	and the peak of the westward motion, if you stretch that, you could probably get on order 1,500 mph winds.
1525280	1532280	It seems that there was a press release in 1989 that quoted this as the measurement,
1532280	1539280	but it ignores the internal rotation rate of Neptune, so it really isn't there.
1539280	1545280	Neptune's strong winds produce that same banded structure, and it's somewhat evident,
1545280	1549280	like it's even subtler than it is on Saturn.
1549280	1555280	On Uranus, if we just look with visible light, you don't see much,
1555280	1560280	but if you enhance the image, and this right-hand image is the exact same as the left-hand image,
1560280	1564280	but only enhanced, you can find the banded structure.
1564280	1568280	It also shows up really well when looking in infrared.
1568280	1575280	The last topic that I would like to discuss today is on balance of atmospheres,
1575280	1578280	specifically the heating and cooling.
1578280	1583280	Here's an image that discusses the heat balance of an atmosphere.
1583280	1589280	The atmosphere absorbs energy from the sun, some light is reflected back by clouds,
1589280	1594280	some is absorbed by the atmosphere, like the ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet light,
1594280	1600280	some is absorbed by the surface, and then the surface re-radiates that energy in infrared light.
1600280	1607280	Some of that re-radiated energy is also absorbed by the atmosphere, and some is radiated back to space.
1607280	1613280	The major point of this balancing argument is that the inflow of energy from the sun
1613280	1620280	must be balanced by the outflow of energy from reflection and re-radiation of that energy.
1620280	1626280	If not, the planet will either be heating or cooling.
1626280	1631280	Now the greenhouse effect is the trapping of infrared radiation within the atmosphere,
1631280	1637280	and the major molecules responsible of this are water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane.
1637280	1646280	The extra heat absorbed by these molecules acts like a blanket and keeps Earth's surface warmer.
1646280	1650280	Here is that same temperature plot that I showed you before,
1650280	1659280	but now I have an arrow here showing you where Earth's temperature on the surface would be if there were no greenhouse warming.
1659280	1667280	Earth's average surface temperature without greenhouse would be minus 16 degrees Celsius, or 3 degrees Fahrenheit.
1667280	1674280	The oceans would mostly be frozen, so a little bit of greenhouse warming is a good thing.
1674280	1684280	Now, Venus is just a little closer to the sun, but because the amount of energy is proportional to the orbit radius squared,
1684280	1688280	it actually absorbs twice as much energy from the sun as Earth.
1688280	1694280	It has a 96% carbon dioxide atmosphere, which traps a lot of infrared radiation.
1694280	1704280	So that caused the surface to heat up, and heat up, and heat up until enough infrared radiation could escape to balance the incoming light from the sun.
1704280	1707280	This turned into a runaway greenhouse effect.
1707280	1715280	And if you look, the surface temperature of Venus is way out here at 475 degrees centigrade.
1715280	1717280	That's 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
1717280	1727280	If you add in the fact that its atmospheric pressure is 100 times that of Earth, it is hot and dense enough to melt lead.
1727280	1734280	The Soviet Venera probes that actually landed on the surface of Venus only lasted for about 20 minutes.
1734280	1737280	Eventually, they probably just melted.
1737280	1745280	And if you look at the plot, without a greenhouse effect, Venus would be colder than Earth.
1745280	1753280	Now, we also have Mars plotted here, but its atmosphere is too thin, even though it has plenty of carbon dioxide.
1753280	1760280	It's too thin for much of a greenhouse, and its temperature without a greenhouse is pretty much the same as its temperature is with a greenhouse effect.
1760280	1765280	So Venus is a caution. You can have too much of a good thing.
1765280	1768280	So how does this relate to global warming?
1768280	1775280	The point is that the Earth has about the same amount of carbon dioxide as Venus.
1775280	1781280	But on Earth, most of it is locked up, mostly in the limestone deposits on the sea floor.
1781280	1791280	If we look in the ice cores, we can sort of see how much carbon dioxide has been in the atmosphere for the last 400,000 years.
1791280	1799280	Here is a plot from the Vostok ice core from Antarctica, and it shows the carbon dioxide record for the last 400,000 years
1799280	1805280	has ranged basically between about 190 and 290 parts per million.
1805280	1810280	Again, carbon dioxide is a very small part of the atmosphere, and here is its historical range.
1810280	1817280	The low points correlate where when Earth was experienced ice ages and the high points with interglacial periods.
1817280	1820280	We happen to be in an interglacial period right now.
1820280	1830280	If we look at a more recent historical record, we can see that over the last 1,000 years, there's a sharp spike in the carbon dioxide from the Industrial Revolution.
1830280	1838280	And if we look at current data over the last 50 years, we show a continued consistent rise.
1838280	1842280	The level is now 380 parts per million.
1842280	1850280	This is the same jump since 1750 as from 1750 back to the last ice age.
1850280	1859280	The big question that comes from this is will the increased CO2 levels change the temperature of Earth's atmosphere?
1859280	1863280	Evidence says that this is indeed happening.
1863280	1870280	Here's a movie that shows you the sea ice at the North Pole over the last 20 or 30 years.
1870280	1874280	It begins in 1979 and slowly steps through every year.
1874280	1878280	You can see it growing and shrinking and growing and shrinking.
1878280	1887280	And these measurements are made in September of every year, which is actually the seasonally smallest time for the sea ice.
1887280	1892280	You can see in 2007 that it's quite small.
1892280	1901280	Just to remind you, here is the sea ice in 1979 and here is the sea ice in 2007.
1901280	1905280	It is the smallest ever recorded in September 2007.
1905280	1912280	For the first time in history, the Northwest Passage above Canada opened up for a brief time.
1913280	1923280	The trend has been downward and if it continues, for a few decades the polar cap will melt completely during the summer.
1923280	1930280	Now the scientific evidence of global warming is real, but the atmosphere is a very complex system.
1930280	1938280	There are a lot of feedback processes, but it's certainly clear that something is changing.
1938280	1943280	And Venus shows us what a worst case scenario looks like.
1943280	1952280	On the other hand, how we react to this scientific evidence and what we plan to do about it is a social and a political issue.
1952280	1956280	But I think it's something that we should seriously consider.
1956280	1958280	I'll leave it there for today.
1958280	1967280	And next, we'll talk about the weather, but not just any weather, some really serious extreme weather.
1967280	1969280	We'll see you then.
