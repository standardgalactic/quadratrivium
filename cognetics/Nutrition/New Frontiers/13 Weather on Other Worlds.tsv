0	29800	Today, let's talk about the weather.
30120	34960	Now, often when people talk about the weather, it's sort of just filler conversation.
34960	36760	When you talk to somebody, you say, how's the family?
36760	38480	Hey, did you catch the game last night?
38480	40600	Oh, is it hot enough for you?
40600	47160	So weather sort of acts as this universal touchstone, this common bond between people.
47160	51560	Mark Twain is often quoted as saying that everybody talks about the weather, but nobody
51560	53200	does anything about it.
53200	54920	Unfortunately, that's a misquote.
54920	56280	Mark Twain never said that.
56280	59200	It's actually from Charles Dudley Warner.
59200	62600	But it indicates that most of the time, when people are talking about the weather, they're
62600	64280	really complaining about it.
64280	65520	It's too hot.
65520	66520	It's too cold.
66520	67520	There's too much rain.
67520	68920	There's not enough rain.
68920	72760	And when the weather is good, it's sort of taken for granted.
72760	77800	Now, I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, and it was generally pleasant all year round.
77800	83720	I guess the worst thing was the afternoon fog in July when the fog rolls into San Francisco.
83720	88920	It could go from very balmy day to a chilly day very fast.
88920	91880	You learn that you always carry a sweater in July.
91880	94840	This leads to another Mark Twain misquote.
94840	100640	He's quoted often as saying that the coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.
100640	103640	And actually, again, he never said that.
103640	107600	It's actually been attributed to H. L. Menken and Will Rogers.
107600	111240	But when I looked up, I couldn't actually find out who really said it.
111240	115760	See, California, the nice weather is sort of taken for granted.
115760	120480	When you think of going outdoors to do something, if you don't do it today, we can do it tomorrow.
120480	122160	It'll be nice tomorrow.
122160	126600	And I think that's really the source of the laid back California attitude.
126600	130920	When we got rainstorms and there was thunder and lightning, it was like, ooh, we're having
130920	132080	weather.
132080	136600	This was a strong contrast to my East Coast upbringing, because it would be hazy, hot
136600	138200	and humid in the summer.
138200	142720	And then we'd have blizzards and 12-foot snowdrifts in New England in the winter.
142720	147000	So when I was growing up, you learned to make hay while the sun shines.
147000	150440	Well, I usually enjoy a change in the weather.
150440	153000	I like to see the variety in nature.
153000	156640	And really, we have nothing to complain about.
156640	163400	When we look at it from a solar system perspective, this is nothing, because things really can
163400	165760	get much worse.
165760	172440	In this lecture, we're going to examine the worst weather known to science.
172640	174240	Let's start with temperatures.
174240	178040	On Earth, the temperature is proportional to the amount of sunlight.
178040	181640	There's more sunlight at the equator, so you expect higher temperatures.
181640	185840	There's less sunlight at the poles, so you expect lower temperatures.
185840	190200	The seasons on Earth, from summer to winter, are caused by the tilt of Earth's rotation
190200	191280	axis.
191280	196560	Earth is tilted 23 and a half degrees relative to the plane of its orbit.
196560	202000	And that tilt rotation axis stays fixed in space.
202000	207200	This is why you see these globes, generally, tilted at 23 and a half degrees.
207200	212200	So if this is Earth and this is the sun over here, when it's tilted toward the sun, the
212200	216800	northern hemisphere is getting more light, and the northern hemisphere is in summer.
216800	220920	When halfway around its orbit, when it's over here and it's tilted away from the sun, the
220920	225720	southern hemisphere is getting more light, so the southern hemisphere is in summer.
225720	233600	I do this simply to make a major point that it is not the distance from the sun that determines
233600	235640	whether it's summer or winter.
235640	240360	The Earth is actually closest to the sun, a point called perihelion, in January.
240360	244720	And it's furthest from the sun, a point we call apheleon, in July.
244720	249720	And so for the northern hemisphere, it's closest in winter and it's furthest in the summer.
249720	253320	Of course, that's just reversed for the southern hemisphere, where it actually is closest in
253320	256000	summer and furthest in winter.
256000	261800	The variation in the distance is only about 2%, and the energy received will go as the
261800	267320	square of the distance from the sun, so the variation in energy is about 7% from perihelion
267320	268320	to apheleon.
268320	274600	Now this is significant and it adds to a modulation of the seasons, but it's not really the cause.
274600	280480	Furthermore, as we talked about for Mercury, there is a procession of the perihelion of
280480	281480	Earth's orbit.
281480	288280	This whole orbit precesses around at 11.5 arc seconds per year, at a very slow rate,
288280	294240	but the whole orbit will actually make a rotation around the sun in 113,000 years.
294240	300560	So 56,000 years ago, during chromagnon times, things were reversed, and perihelion was then
300560	306080	in July, and apheleon would have been in January.
306080	310400	Knowing the tilt is the true explanation for the seasons, you expect the hottest temperatures
310400	314240	near the equator and the coldest temperatures at the poles.
314240	320760	I find it very interesting that one of the hottest places on the planet is 36 degrees
320760	322680	north latitude.
322680	327200	It's this place, Death Valley.
327200	334320	This is Badwater, the lowest point in Death Valley, and it's 282 feet below sea level.
334320	337440	It's the lowest point in the western hemisphere.
337440	343840	They recorded a record temperature there of about 134 degrees Fahrenheit, or 57 degrees
343840	345360	Celsius.
345360	350600	So that shows you it's not just your latitude that determines your temperature, it's also
350600	352960	the elevation within the atmosphere.
352960	356840	Remember in a previous lecture, we talked about how the atmosphere heats up as you're
356840	359760	going down through the troposphere.
359760	365320	Now this Death Valley is a national park, and in all national parks you see it's fun
365320	366840	to watch the animal behavior.
366840	372680	There's particularly crazy animal behavior in Death Valley, and it looks something like
372680	375240	this.
375240	379440	This is a marathon runner in Death Valley.
379440	386080	They actually hold not just a marathon, but an ultra marathon starting in Death Valley.
386080	394880	You run 135 miles starting at Badwater, across Death Valley, and then up a mountain.
394880	401200	So you're starting at 282 feet below sea level, you're finishing at 8,000 feet.
401200	407800	The record time for this ultra marathon was broken, they broke 24 hours.
407800	411960	Crazy animal behavior in some extreme heat.
411960	414440	But it's not the hottest heat in the world.
414440	420480	The world record is of course in the Sahara Desert, and it was recorded in Libya at 136
420480	423520	degrees, or about 58 degrees centigrade.
423520	427640	Now this is the official record, recorded at a measuring station.
427640	432240	The true extreme on earth is probably a little bit hotter.
432240	437520	And I also note that this is the air temperature measured about 5 feet above the ground.
437520	441120	The surface temperature, if you go all the way down to the ground, that has been measured
441120	445240	to be up to about 150 degrees.
445240	449120	The coldest temperatures on the planet, you would expect to be at the poles, and you would
449120	450280	be right.
450280	457480	The world record was recorded at Vostok in Antarctica of minus 129 degrees Fahrenheit,
457480	460280	or minus 89 degrees Celsius.
460280	465440	And there we see some more strange animal behavior.
465440	468240	This is a colony of emperor penguins.
468240	471440	They spend the winter on the Antarctic ice.
471440	476400	They travel about 100 kilometers inland from the sea to be somewhat sheltered by these
476400	478200	ice cliffs.
478560	483360	Even so, even if they're a little bit sheltered from the wind, during that long winter, and
483360	488880	about a month when they don't have any sunshine, the penguins must huddle together for warmth.
488880	492480	And here's a picture of the penguins huddled together.
492480	497960	And the penguins actually have to change their position, because if you stay on the outside
497960	502440	of the huddle, you'll freeze to death, and so they rotate inward and outward in order
502440	504280	to survive.
504280	508600	So this is the extremes we encounter here on Earth.
508600	515440	The hottest is about 60 degrees Celsius, the coldest is about minus 90 degrees Celsius,
515440	522520	and life can survive there, but really just barely.
522520	527640	If you look at it from a solar system perspective, and you really think about it from that perspective,
527640	533240	if you look at these guys and you say, what a bloody bunch of whips, I mean if you want
533280	535560	cold, you want cold.
535560	537080	Let's go out and look at things.
537080	539360	Let's take Mars, okay?
539360	540560	Here's a picture of Mars.
540560	543920	Mankind has been fascinated with Mars.
543920	545800	We really want to learn as much as we can about it.
545800	550000	We aspire to go there, and some people want to colonize the planet.
550000	552200	I'm not sure why.
552200	554720	Yes, it's about the same tilt as Earth.
554720	556440	It's got about 25 degree tilt.
556440	561560	Yes, it rotates in about the same amount of time, around 23 hours or so.
561560	564320	But there the similarities end.
564320	568520	If you overlook the idea that it has almost no atmosphere, okay, the pressure of its atmosphere
568520	570680	is less than 1% that of Earth.
570680	575200	And we overlook the idea that there's no liquid water on the surface, because the water sublimes
575200	581400	directly from ice into water vapor, just the temperatures are a huge challenge.
581400	585760	It has a very thin atmosphere and is unable to retain the heat.
585760	590040	It's also farther from the sun, so it only gets about one-third the energy per square
590040	592440	meter as the Earth does.
592440	596280	Fortunately, we sent an advanced scouting party.
596280	599320	Here is a self-portrait of one of that scouting parties.
599320	601600	It is the Spirit Rover.
601600	604200	And I note that this is a real picture.
604200	608680	Most of the images that you see of the rovers on Mars are actually computer graphics drawings.
608680	614960	This is a real picture from its camera looking down on top of it, and that's why they assembled
614960	619960	many pictures together to get this panoramic viewpoint and the self-portrait of the Mars
619960	621240	rover.
621240	625400	But they've been able to provide temperature monitoring for us, and we have a temperature
625400	628320	graph from the Mars rovers.
628320	632400	Now if we look at the maximum, okay, you can see that there are seasonal variations.
632400	637600	Mars has summer and winter just like Earth does, and it can reach, you know, a high near
637600	641720	about 25 degrees Celsius, about 80 degrees Fahrenheit in summer.
641720	643680	And in the winter, its highs are near freezing.
643680	645720	Well, that's somewhat temperate.
645720	648040	The daytime temperatures are sort of temperate.
648040	649560	It's what we're used to.
649560	654120	I will note, however, that it's very low pressure atmosphere, so you really won't feel any of
654120	655800	that warmth.
655800	663320	But then take a look at the lows down here in the bottom, the lows at night.
663320	667560	Because of that very thin atmosphere, the heat is radiated away very efficiently to
667560	676800	space, and so the daytime heat is gone, and the lows around minus 75 centigrade all year
676800	678560	round.
678560	685280	The penguins were there, they'd have to huddle every single night just to retain their warmth.
685280	689480	So this whole idea of Mars colonization really doesn't make much sense to me, because it's
689480	692960	got no air, no water, no heat.
692960	695800	This is a real fixer-upper of a planet.
695800	699320	Still, it's better than Mercury.
699320	703960	Now Mercury is closest to the Sun, so you expect it to be hot, and you'd be right.
703960	709320	It has about 7 times more energy per square meter than Earth receives.
709320	716680	The Sunward side is, coincidentally, nearly 7 times higher in temperature than Earth is.
716680	720080	It's about 400 degrees centigrade.
720080	726120	But Mercury is also cold, because Mercury has no atmosphere, it can't retain any of
726120	732960	its heat, and it rotates very slowly, it takes about 2 months to complete a rotation.
732960	739200	So in the 30 days that it rotates in darkness, it can effectively radiate all that heat away.
739200	744440	And the nighttime temperature is minus 180 degrees centigrade.
744440	748840	This is the greatest range of temperatures in the solar system, from a daytime high of
748840	754360	400 degrees to a nighttime low of minus 180 degrees.
754360	755920	That's incredible.
755920	760720	And while that's a record for the range of temperatures, it's not a record holder for
760720	764560	either the hottest or the coldest.
764560	769160	Venus is our record holder for the hottest, because it has a very thick atmosphere.
769160	773840	And this atmosphere is 96% carbon dioxide.
773840	777800	In that carbon dioxide atmosphere, acting as a blanket, we have the greenhouse effect,
777800	782840	and on Venus it has become a runaway greenhouse effect, so the surface temperature is around
782840	786120	475 degrees centigrade.
786120	788840	That's 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
788840	794680	And because the cloud cover is constant, and the greenhouse effect is global, that's
794680	799840	the temperature you get at the equator, and at the poles, and everywhere on the planet.
799840	804520	Matter of fact, the daytime temperature, the nighttime temperature all over the planet
804520	809440	is basically constant around 475 degrees centigrade.
809440	814200	And note, this is about double the broil setting on your oven.
814200	819960	On the other end of the spectrum, and on the other end of the solar system, we have
819960	823200	this object, Pluto.
823200	828120	Now Pluto is going to be a representative of the icy worlds of the outer solar system.
828120	833240	When you're way, way, way, way out away from the sun, you get very little solar energy.
833240	839080	And at Pluto's orbit, you get about one one thousandths the energy that Earth receives.
839080	843840	And there's no atmosphere to retain any heat, so the temperatures reach a record low of
843880	848640	over 200 degrees below zero centigrade.
848640	852180	So now we've got the high and low temperatures.
852180	855640	What about the precipitation forecast?
855640	860800	Rain on Earth is our hydrologic cycle that's dominated by the oceans.
860800	865800	We have evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.
865800	869400	Evaporation is simply that the air near the surface contains water vapor.
869400	873540	The heated air then rises into the atmosphere.
873540	880540	As it gets higher up and cools down, the water vapor condenses into clouds.
880540	885820	Water droplets in the clouds condense around dust particles, and when they get large enough,
885820	890900	the water droplets fall out as rain or snow, precipitation.
890900	895500	There is, of course, a variation on this that we see in Earth's atmosphere, a variation
895500	897580	of acid rain.
897580	900900	And this happens when you have sulfur dioxide in the rain.
900900	904980	Instead of the water droplets condensing around dust particles, they condense around
904980	910900	the sulfur dioxide particles, and when you mix water with sulfur dioxide, you end up
910900	912900	with sulfuric acid.
912900	921140	So you have a concentrate of sulfuric acid in water, and we see that basically associated
921140	923180	with power plants.
923180	928380	So here is a map of the major sources of sulfur dioxide in the United States.
928980	935220	Basically these are coal burning power plants, predominantly located here in the Midwest.
935220	940700	And remember, at mid-latitudes, the winds blow from west to east.
940700	945860	So the sulfur dioxide that's released into the atmosphere in the Midwest is then going
945860	948780	to blow towards the east.
948780	955060	This image here shows you the pH level of lakes in the United States.
955060	960300	This is sort of the acidity, where the green is basic and the red is acidity.
960300	965900	And what you can strongly see here is this red region over the northeastern United States,
965900	971540	where the sulfur dioxide has mixed with the water vapor in the atmosphere, blown eastward,
971540	974820	dropped down as acid rain.
974820	981580	Now, this is bad and changes the pH balance of the lakes and kills off fish, and we can
981620	987180	complain about it a lot, but it's actually much worse in Europe, because if we look at
987180	992700	the world map, they have severe problems in Western Europe and Scandinavia.
992700	998580	It's estimated that over 14,000 lakes in Sweden are affected by this problem.
998580	1003220	Now sulfur emissions have been identified as being a major pollutant, and they are on
1003220	1007420	the decline, but this problem will not go away soon.
1007900	1016900	Still, it's bad on Earth, but it's even worse elsewhere, and it's even worse on Venus.
1017340	1022740	In Venus, there's enough sulfur dioxide in the air that the main constituent of the clouds
1022740	1026780	is drops of sulfuric acid.
1026780	1032780	Here's the profile of Venus' atmosphere, and at about 50 kilometers, you see there's
1032780	1036220	a layer of sulfuric acid clouds.
1036220	1043220	Below that, it is constantly raining sulfuric acid, and that descends for about 10 kilometers
1043660	1050660	or so, but Venus' surface is so hot that it evaporates before it reaches the surface.
1051540	1056460	So the weather report that we can give for Venus is always going to be the same.
1056460	1062260	Today, it will be 900 degrees, it will be constantly cloudy, and you have a 100% chance
1062260	1065340	of sulfuric acid rain.
1066340	1072340	The only place that has even perhaps stranger precipitation would be Saturn's large moon
1072340	1073820	Titan.
1073820	1079340	This is the only moon that has an atmosphere, and its atmosphere is 98% nitrogen and about
1079340	1081300	2% methane.
1081300	1085500	It also has a higher atmospheric pressure than Earth, about one and a half times the
1085500	1089340	atmospheric pressure at sea level on Earth.
1089340	1093860	Now before the Huygens probe landed on Titan, we thought there was a pretty good chance of
1093860	1099340	finding oceans on Titan, because we could see images that looked somewhat like this.
1099340	1103580	This is better than we could see before the Huygens probe, but you can see these dark
1103580	1110580	bands around the center of Titan, and we thought these dark regions could be oceans, but when
1112220	1117140	Cassini got to Saturn, Cassini looked to try and see the specular reflections, the
1117140	1121460	glint of sunlight off the oceans, and was unable to observe it.
1121460	1127620	So we started to think, maybe not, but when Huygens landed, it did find that the surface
1127620	1129020	was frozen.
1129020	1136020	However, it saw river channels, so presumably there was some flowing methane on the surface.
1136980	1142580	Later Cassini observations had suggested that we were seeing lakes, but in the northern
1142580	1145180	part not at the mid-latitudes.
1145180	1150180	And these are these darker regions up here at the top of this picture that might possibly
1150380	1151820	be lakes.
1151820	1157500	And when Cassini passed later, it used its radar imager to do some close-ups of it, and
1157500	1159540	it found an image that looked like this.
1159540	1165500	This looks remarkably like characteristic features of lakes on Earth.
1165500	1171860	The dark areas are smooth to radar, which is highly indicative that they might be lakes.
1171860	1178860	Matter of fact, they released this image comparing one suspected lake on Titan in size to Lake
1179060	1182660	Superior on Earth.
1182660	1187380	The arguments for these being lakes are even more supported when you look at the atmosphere
1187380	1192540	of Titan, and you can see methane clouds.
1192540	1197260	This is an infrared image of the North Pole of Titan above where those lakes are suspected
1197260	1204060	to be, and you can see the methane clouds encircling the North Pole.
1204060	1210700	The implication here is that you have a hydrologic cycle on Titan that is based on methane.
1210700	1215060	It's similar to the water cycle on Earth that you would evaporate, condense out methane
1215060	1218460	clouds, and then precipitate back out methane.
1218460	1224180	And it's also interesting that the moisture probably doesn't come directly all from the
1224180	1230580	North Pole, but actually from the equator, and gets transported up to the North Pole.
1230580	1234900	One reason why they might think the equator is so dry is that the moisture all gets transported
1234900	1236820	up to the North Pole.
1236820	1242340	But this whole hydrologic cycle is totally different from Earth because it operates at
1242340	1248340	a temperature of about minus 180 degrees centigrade.
1248340	1254380	Methane freezes out just below that, so it has to operate in these incredibly cold temperatures.
1254380	1258020	This gives you some really serious cold rain.
1258020	1265140	And I've got to say, that's my least favorite weather, so I won't be visiting Titan anytime
1265140	1268180	soon for vacation.
1268180	1270420	Now let's move on to storms.
1270420	1273020	On Earth, storms have associated seasons.
1273020	1276100	We say that April showers bring May flowers.
1276100	1281820	We have summer thunderstorms, and the Atlantic hurricane season goes from late summer through
1281820	1283540	early fall.
1283540	1286500	And our storms can go grow pretty large.
1286500	1293180	Here is an image of Hurricane Isabel, which came up the East Coast in 2003.
1293180	1297820	And you can see from this image, it stretches all the way from South Carolina on up to,
1297820	1299820	you know, well up into Maine.
1299820	1301860	This is about 1500 kilometers across.
1301860	1306980	This is, you know, the size of a decent sized country on our planet, okay?
1306980	1308580	And this lasts for a while.
1308580	1310300	It passed through in about a week.
1310300	1316300	Actually, it hit our house, and we were without power for three or four days.
1316300	1321300	And again, this is nothing when you look at the solar system.
1321300	1323860	So let's compare it to Jupiter.
1323860	1328220	Jupiter shows a large number of storms all the time.
1328220	1331700	There are many of these oval shapes on Jupiter.
1331700	1336660	Each of them is a hurricane-like storm on Jupiter.
1336660	1340740	Now note these sort of three white ovals down here.
1340740	1341940	Those are going to be important a little later.
1341940	1343580	We'll talk about them in a minute.
1343580	1347700	The one we really want to talk about is the largest one, which is the Great Red Spot
1347700	1349460	of Jupiter.
1349460	1353660	Here is an image from Hubble, or actually several images from Hubble, looking at the
1353660	1357060	Great Red Spot over about a decade of time.
1357060	1362780	You can see that as it was observed over the years, the Great Red Spot has stayed relatively
1362780	1363780	constant.
1363780	1365060	Yeah, it changes its shape.
1365060	1368780	It gets a little bit more elongated, a little bit fatter, you know, small changes to its
1368780	1369780	structure.
1369780	1372820	But overall, it's a relatively constant feature.
1372820	1379420	And the Great Red Spot may have been seen as early as 1665.
1379420	1385620	If so, about 350 years this storm has lasted.
1385620	1390620	Now certainly, we're not sure it's actually been around for 350 years, but we have continuous
1390620	1393540	observations for at least 200 years.
1393540	1398180	So this is an incredibly long-lasting storm.
1398180	1399860	What's the secret to its longevity?
1400740	1403220	Well, that's shown in this animation here.
1403220	1408300	And this is taken from the Cassini spacecraft, and it's showing Jupiter over the course of
1408300	1412820	about one orbit, about 10 or 12 hours.
1412820	1416460	And you can see the winds, zonal winds are blowing this way, and they're blowing that
1416460	1417460	way.
1417460	1421500	And if you look at the Great Red Spot, you can see that one wind, the wind above it,
1421500	1427660	is going westward, and the band below it is going eastward, and the Great Red Spot is
1427660	1430680	rolling in between this.
1430680	1436220	This is feeding into the Great Red Spot and continuing its rotation.
1436220	1443460	You can also notice in the band moving westward that there are some small ovals that may be
1443460	1449980	feeding into the Great Red Spot, being eaten up by the Red Spot and adding to its power.
1449980	1453980	The next image I'm going to show you is one of my favorite in all of astronomy.
1453980	1458580	This is a close-up of the Great Red Spot from Voyager 2.
1458580	1463420	And here you can see all the details, all the cool hydrodynamic features.
1463420	1468900	I know I'm a geek because the Raleigh-Taylor instabilities here excite me.
1468900	1471140	I just love all the turbulence that you see.
1471140	1476060	There's a sort of dynamicism to this image that just speaks to me.
1476060	1482060	But it can speak even louder if you can do this sort of comparison.
1482060	1488980	Here at the correct relative size is Earth compared to the Great Red Spot.
1488980	1496780	The Great Red Spot is a hurricane as large as our entire planet that has been lasting
1496780	1498540	for centuries.
1498540	1503700	This just dwarfs anything we have here on our planet.
1503700	1508460	And recently, you remember those three white ovals I pointed out to you before?
1508460	1512500	They have merged to form a new red spot.
1512500	1517420	This is the first time in history we've ever seen the formation of a red spot because we
1517420	1520740	actually didn't get to see the Great Red Spot form.
1520740	1525260	Here is an image from Hubble where you can see the Great Red Spot over here on the right.
1525260	1528620	And in the center, you can see the little red spot.
1528620	1533540	This is what those three small ovals merged to form.
1533540	1538100	We're very interested in this because, as I said, we've never seen a red spot form.
1538100	1541180	So we don't really know how long it will last.
1541180	1545100	Now if you look at its latitude, you say, oh, well, it might be passing by the Great
1545100	1546100	Red Spot.
1546100	1547740	Maybe it will merge.
1547740	1548740	That's not really expected.
1548740	1552540	Actually, it's passed by it several times now and they haven't done anything.
1552540	1557620	We're really watching to see what happens next.
1557620	1559380	Let's move on to Saturn.
1559380	1565740	In contrast to Jupiter's stormy appearance, Saturn can appear somewhat bland.
1565740	1569140	Here it is viewed with visible light from Earth.
1569140	1570860	This is an image from Hubble.
1570860	1577540	And there's not much to it, but this one is actually quite special because in 1994, there
1577540	1579500	was a major storm on Saturn.
1579500	1581380	This is a very rare event.
1581380	1585540	It's this wedge shaped brights feature just above the rings here.
1585540	1590660	These major storms occur only once, only a few times per century, approximately every
1590660	1591660	30 years.
1591660	1595700	And they appear to be correlated with the summer in the northern hemisphere of Saturn.
1595700	1599460	Remember, Saturn has a 29 and a half year orbit.
1599460	1605820	But what's interesting is that 15 years earlier, there are no storms correlated with the summer
1605820	1607860	in the southern hemisphere.
1607860	1611300	That's a mystery we're still yet unraveling.
1611300	1616500	Now when you stretch these visible light images, you can actually see some small storms.
1616500	1619540	Here's another Hubble image where if you look in the southern hemisphere, you see these
1619540	1625180	small little ovals, somewhat similar to what we saw on Jupiter, although a little bit smaller.
1625180	1630100	So it appears that minor storms are abundant on Saturn.
1630100	1635020	And if you take close-ups and look in the infrared from Cassini, this is an infrared
1635020	1641340	image, and here you can see at least three major of these small ovals occurring on Saturn.
1641340	1647140	And these show you that underneath it all, when you look carefully, Saturn shows about
1647140	1651460	the same storm patterns as Jupiter does.
1651460	1653300	Let's take a look at Neptune.
1653300	1655060	This is the classic image of Neptune.
1655060	1661140	It was taken by Voyager 2, and it features a very prominent storm, the Great Dark Spot.
1661140	1666380	It looks a lot like the Great Red Spot, and again, it's about the size of Earth.
1666380	1673660	But it's rather dynamic, because over the course of Voyager 2's visit, it changed significantly.
1673700	1678900	This is a four-and-a-half-day sequence showing the varied appearance of the Great Dark Spot.
1678900	1683460	You can see it gets elongated and stretched out to the left, and then elongated and stretched
1683460	1688460	out to the right, and it was also noticed that it's drifting towards the equator, moving
1688460	1691620	at about 15 degrees per year.
1691620	1695700	It was then predicted that it would actually cross the equator several years after Voyager
1695700	1697540	passed.
1697540	1703420	There was one other storm on Neptune when Voyager passed by, and it's shown here in
1703420	1707780	this image, it's called the Little Dark Spot, down here.
1707780	1713060	So when Hubble was put into orbit, it was with great anticipation that we looked at
1713060	1716260	Neptune trying to see, oh, is the Great Dark Spot still there?
1716260	1717660	What about the Little Dark Spot?
1717660	1720820	Is it like the Great Red Spot?
1720820	1722500	Neither of them was long lived.
1722500	1728140	They had both dissipated five years later, in 1994, when Hubble looked for it.
1728140	1733460	Now we have found a few more northern dark spots, some dark spots in the northern hemisphere
1733460	1738420	of Neptune, but the ones that we saw in 1989 are no longer there.
1738420	1744580	Unfortunately, we lack the detail that Voyager had when it flew by, so we know that Neptune
1744580	1749420	has a dynamic atmosphere, but we won't be able to study it in as great detail until
1749420	1753740	we get another satellite mission to fly past.
1753740	1759500	What we can see from Earth is that Neptune shows strong seasons.
1759500	1763900	Neptune's orbit takes 165 years to go around the Sun.
1763900	1769500	That means each season lasts for 40 years, and Neptune has about a 29 degree tilt, so
1769500	1776260	it should show seasons somewhat like Earth, although the energy it's receiving is really,
1776260	1779940	really small from the Sun, so is it really going to show seasons?
1779940	1782420	Well, apparently so.
1782420	1789100	Here are three images from Hubble from 1996, 1998, and 2002.
1789100	1794420	And what you see is a stormy reaction, a very slow reaction to the seasons, because the
1794420	1798180	seasons on Neptune last for decades.
1798180	1803220	And what you're seeing here is the development of storms in Neptune's southern hemisphere,
1803220	1806460	basically springtime on Neptune.
1806460	1811980	Finally, we're going to turn to one other type of storm, dust storms.
1812020	1817980	Now, a few years ago, I saw a movie in which the hero is racing away from a giant dust
1817980	1818980	storm.
1818980	1824940	This is the movie here, and I do computer graphics as part of my astronomy, and I just
1824940	1828940	looked at that and I said, oh, fantastic, really good computer graphics.
1828940	1834700	And you know that Hollywood exaggerates for a story, it's just huge, gigantic dust storm.
1834700	1841180	But then when I started looking into this, I found images like this.
1841180	1846980	That is a real dust storm on Earth, and the dust storm, just like in the movie, is about
1846980	1851140	a hundred feet high, boom.
1851140	1852140	There goes the neighborhood.
1852140	1856900	I mean, I don't like getting sand in the house after I go to the beach, imagine cleaning
1856900	1859100	up after a dust storm like this.
1859100	1863020	But the dust storms can be even bigger.
1863020	1869060	When the dust storms occur off the Sahara, they can actually sweep huge swaths of dust
1869060	1870980	out into the Atlantic Ocean.
1870980	1877820	Here is one that covers thousands of kilometers of ocean, and it lifts the dust several kilometers
1877820	1880500	up into the atmosphere.
1880500	1885740	There it can get carried around the planet through global circulation, and so dust storms
1885740	1890620	in the Sahara can cause air pollution alerts in the Caribbean.
1890620	1896340	A really good example of this was the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
1896340	1900820	This was the second largest volcanic eruption of last century, and it had global effects
1900820	1906380	on the atmosphere, because so much ash was spewed up into the atmosphere, it was carried
1906380	1907940	globally.
1907940	1912260	Here are some observations of our planet before and after Pinatubo.
1912260	1918900	In the April and May of 1991, before the eruption, you can see how clear the atmosphere was.
1918900	1927460	And then directly after the eruption, there's an immediate effect, whereas this band of material
1927460	1931260	encircling the globe around the equator.
1931260	1937540	In the lower left here, three months later, the material had diffused in latitude and now
1937540	1940260	covered most of the planet.
1940260	1947580	The final image shows that three years later, or two and a half to three years later, the
1947580	1950180	effects were still lingering.
1950180	1958460	So dust raised high in the atmosphere, local dust storms can have global effects.
1958460	1964140	This is even more true when you look at Mars, because Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
1964140	1969580	It allows the dust to be kicked up relatively easily, and dust storms are common.
1969580	1975460	Here are two images of Mars, one in June 2001, one in September 2001.
1975460	1979780	And in June, if you look carefully in the lower right of that image, there's a storm
1979780	1982580	in the Hellas Basin, that giant impact basin.
1982580	1986780	There's a dust storm starting there, and they tell me there's also a dust storm around the
1986780	1992540	North Pole, although it doesn't seem obvious to me that there is a dust storm.
1992540	1997140	By September, dust storm had spread planet wide.
1997140	2001580	You can see there's a global haze across the planet.
2001580	2007180	This is the biggest storm that we've seen on Mars in decades, and it lasted about three
2007180	2008180	months.
2008180	2016100	Matter of fact, in July 2007, the Mars rovers, that spirit shot that I showed you before,
2016100	2018660	they had to survive a month long dust storm.
2018660	2022260	And during that dust storm, there was not only decreased sunlight because the dust was
2022260	2026900	blocking sunlight coming through the atmosphere, but also the dust was covering the solar panels
2026900	2031420	and we're really worried whether we'd lose the rovers to a dust storm.
2031420	2035300	So they went into a low power hibernation mode in order to survive.
2035300	2039660	And fortunately, they were able to come out of it and resume operations.
2039660	2047380	So from an interplanetary perspective, Earth's most extreme weather is really rather tame.
2047380	2051500	The extremes of the temperatures in the solar system, they are well beyond what humans could
2051500	2052500	withstand.
2052500	2058180	And we really can't complain about rain because water is mild compared to showers of sulfuric
2058180	2060900	acid or even methane.
2060900	2068580	And our fiercest hurricanes, well, they might only qualify as a brief minor storm on Jupiter.
2068580	2075780	And these dust storms on Mars, well, they show us what going global is really all about.
2075780	2080900	So the next time you're tempted to complain about the weather, take the larger view.
2080900	2087500	Take the perspective of the solar system and see how good we really have it.
2087500	2095460	It's probably not a coincidence that Earth's weather is the most hospitable to life.
2095460	2101220	In our next lecture, we'll take a look at even larger storms, not storms on any planet,
2101220	2105500	but giant magnetic storms on the sun.
2105500	2106020	We'll see you then.
