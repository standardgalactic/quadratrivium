0	29500	Welcome.
29500	32500	Today we begin a journey in rediscovering our solar system.
32500	37500	Now, I say rediscovering because everyone is familiar with the basics.
37500	40500	We learn about the solar system in elementary school.
40500	44500	It's stuff we've known about for hundreds or even thousands of years.
44500	47500	The solar system is our backyard in the universe.
47500	52500	And we've explored it thoroughly with telescopes on the ground and in orbit,
52500	57500	with manned missions to the moon, and satellites crisscrossing the solar system.
57500	60500	We even have an expression for it.
60500	63500	There's nothing new under the sun.
63500	68500	This course will show you just how wrong that maxim is.
68500	75500	So my first goal of the course is to teach you that scientific knowledge is never static.
75500	80500	This has always been true, but recently it's become more prominent.
80500	83500	And I can summon up in just one question.
83500	88500	Why is Pluto no longer a planet?
88500	91500	For 70 years, Pluto was a planet.
91500	96500	And then a few years ago, people started talking about kicking Pluto out of the solar system.
96500	100500	In 2006, we moved to having 12 planets for about a week,
100500	104500	and then Pluto became classified as a dwarf planet.
104500	109500	What's the matter? All of a sudden it's too small?
109500	112500	Well, the truth is a little more straightforward.
112500	118500	Because originally, we thought Pluto was several times larger than Earth,
118500	122500	but we now know it to be smaller than our moon.
122500	126500	In fact, it's smaller than seven moons of the solar system.
126500	130500	Over the years, we've learned that Pluto is unlike any of the other planets.
130500	133500	It's basically a giant ice ball.
133500	136500	It's got a very elliptical elongated orbit.
136500	138500	It's got a tilted orbit.
138500	140500	If you try to put it in with the rocky planets,
140500	142500	or you try to put it in with the gas giant planets,
142500	146500	it ends up being the ugly duckling of the solar system.
146500	150500	Pluto is so small and so far away
150500	157500	that this is one of the best images we can get of it in visible light.
157500	160500	This is not an image from a ground-based telescope.
160500	165500	This is an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
165500	167500	That's all we get.
167500	170500	That's not what most people expect for a planet.
170500	174500	That brings me to my second goal of this course,
174500	176500	and that's good to get you to recognize
176500	183500	that some of what you think you know about the solar system is actually wrong.
183500	186500	Misconceptions about the universe are rampant,
186500	188500	and for the solar system,
188500	193500	we've got sort of a been-there-done-that hubris that leads to mistakes.
193500	198500	We generalize and assume everything follows the same basic rules.
198500	204500	We oversimplify, and sometimes the cartoon version replaces the complex reality.
204500	211500	We can exaggerate and select facts out in order to make a story for a book or a movie.
211500	218500	Too often, our invented reality replaces the scientific view.
218500	223500	For Pluto, press coverage created a reality distortion field,
223500	228500	because the reason for Pluto's demotion is not the fickle astronomers
228500	231500	who couldn't figure out whether it is a planet or isn't a planet
231500	234500	or is a dwarf planet or whatever that really means,
234500	237500	and it's not really Pluto itself.
237500	242500	The fact is that our knowledge of the solar system has changed.
242500	247500	We have discovered a brand new region of the solar system
247500	251500	that contain over a thousand new objects.
251500	257500	And so my third goal in this course is to change your perspective,
257500	260500	not on the facts of the solar system.
260500	262500	You're going to get a ton of new facts about the solar system,
262500	268500	but more importantly, how you organize and understand those facts.
268500	271500	In education, we call this a mental model.
271500	276500	It's your framework for discussing things and for understanding new things.
276500	279500	If you have errors in it, these misconceptions,
279500	283500	they can impede the development of new learning.
283500	285500	So we want to correct those errors,
285500	292500	but we also want to augment or even entirely replace your mental model.
292500	297500	And we're going to replace it with something I call the 21st century solar system.
297500	300500	This is the modern view of the solar system.
300500	304500	You see, Pluto hasn't been kicked out of the solar system.
304500	308500	Really, the solar system has been reorganized,
308500	311500	and Pluto has a new place within it.
311500	314500	Now, before describing this new organization,
314500	317500	let me just sort of review the previous perspectives
317500	321500	we've had on the solar system throughout history.
321500	325500	The first perspective is be the earth-centered solar system,
325500	329500	what we call the geocentric model of the solar system.
329500	332500	This is associated with Ptolemy,
332500	337500	who wrote the book, The Almagest, in 150 CE.
337500	340500	Now, when we think about the earth-centered solar system,
340500	344500	it sort of gets a bad rap because we talk about it, we focus on the errors,
344500	349500	why it's wrong, we know today that it's not the correct model.
349500	352500	But really, it was quite a success
352500	358500	because it was the model that first explains the motions of the heavens.
358500	361500	The next version would be the sun-centered model of the solar system.
361500	363500	We call this the heliocentric model.
363500	366500	This is associated with Nicholas Copernicus,
366500	371500	who published his book on the revolutions of heavenly spheres in the 16th century.
371500	374500	But then Copernicus starts to get too much credit
374500	379500	because really, the heliocentric model, as presented by Copernicus,
379500	384500	could not provide better predictions of the positions of objects in the sky
384500	387500	than the geocentric model.
387500	389500	What Copernican model really did
389500	393500	is it moved from a mathematical description of the motions on the sky
393500	397500	to a model that represents reality.
397500	401500	The next model is something I like to call the gravitational solar system.
401500	404500	This has its derivation in the laws of motion,
404500	408500	specifically the law of gravity from Isaac Newton.
408500	411500	At this point, our perspective on the solar system changed
411500	414500	and that we could develop a mathematical basis
414500	417500	that there is physics underlying the astronomy
417500	420500	and that we could use that physics to predict motions
420500	426500	and predict how the solar system would behave.
426500	429500	The next view, change in perspective on our solar system,
429500	431500	really came about with the space age
431500	436500	because then we moved from observing the solar system to exploring it.
436500	438500	We had manned missions to the moon.
438500	441500	We have satellite missions across the solar system.
441500	445500	With the space age, we have developed new technology
445500	448500	and new ways of exploring our solar system
448500	453500	to develop a rich and detailed knowledge of the objects within it.
453500	458500	Finally, we get to the modern perspective, the 21st century solar system.
458500	460500	This one is still developing
460500	464500	because we have got observations of a new region,
464500	468500	but we also had discovered other solar systems,
468500	471500	planetary systems around other stars.
471500	476500	So not only are we gaining perspective on the structure of our own solar system,
476500	480500	we are comparing it to solar systems around other stars
480500	485500	and gaining perspective on its structure and its universality.
485500	489500	Now, let's describe this perspective in a little detail.
489500	493500	When I first learned the solar system,
493500	496500	the method of teaching it was what I would really refer to
496500	498500	as a factoid-based solar system.
498500	501500	In our books, we had one chapter on the sun,
501500	504500	one chapter on Mercury, one chapter on Venus,
504500	506500	one chapter on Earth, and so on and so on.
506500	510500	And really, some of the focus was on memorizing a lot of facts.
510500	514500	So if we went through that version of teaching the solar system,
514500	516500	it would be something like this.
516500	517500	This is the sun.
517500	520500	It's a great big ball of hot gas.
520500	522500	It's 100 times larger than Earth,
522500	525500	and there are gigantic magnetic storms on it
525500	529500	that spew fierce radiation at Earth.
529500	531500	Then we go to Mercury.
531500	534500	And Mercury, well, it's cratered like the moon.
534500	537500	It's 450 degrees hot on one side
537500	541500	and minus 200 degrees cold on the other.
541500	543500	Venus.
543500	546500	Venus is Earth's hot-headed twin.
546500	548500	It's totally covered in clouds,
548500	554500	and on surface is so hot that you can melt lead.
554500	557500	Earth. Earth would be our planet.
557500	559500	It's sort of the water planet,
559500	561500	and it has plate tectonics on it
561500	563500	that rework its entire surface.
563500	568500	But most importantly, Earth is the planet with life.
568500	572500	And then to Mars, which is rusty, dusty, and red,
572500	576500	it has no air, no water, and subzero temperatures,
576500	580500	but for some reason, we still want to go there.
580500	582500	Jupiter.
582500	584500	Jupiter is the biggest planet.
584500	588500	It's got this great red spot here that's as large as Earth,
588500	592500	and this is a storm that has lasted for over 350 years.
592500	598500	It's also got four big moons that were seen by Galileo 400 years ago.
598500	601500	Saturn. Saturn is the ringed planet.
601500	604500	It's got about 60 different moons,
604500	611500	and it's got the only moon in the solar system that has an atmosphere.
611500	616500	Uranus. Uranus is just a pale blueish-green planet,
616500	618500	but it rotates on its side,
618500	622500	and that means its poles see 44 years of daylight,
622500	626500	followed by 44 years of night.
626500	628500	Neptune.
628500	632500	Neptune is the blue planet, but it has no water.
632500	636500	It's got methane ice clouds that are 200 degrees below zero.
636500	640500	It's got this great dark spot that was there in the 80s
640500	643500	but somehow was gone in the 90s.
643500	645500	And Pluto?
645500	647500	Well, it's our most distant member,
647500	651500	and although it was closer than Neptune for two decades,
651500	653500	Pluto is smaller than our moon,
653500	656500	and it has a moon about half its size.
656500	661500	It's the coldest place in the solar system, minus 220 degrees.
661500	665500	And then you might get a chapter on the moons
665500	668500	when you learn that Earth has one.
668500	671500	As many giant planets have many, there are about 150 total moons,
671500	674500	and they feature some really weird ones, like Mimas,
674500	677500	which is a moon that looks like the Death Star from Star Wars,
677500	681500	or Iapetus, which is a moon that's entirely black on one side
681500	683500	and entirely white on the other,
683500	687500	or Europa, a moon that has a subsurface ocean,
687500	691500	and perhaps might harbor life in that ocean.
691500	695500	Finally, you might get a chapter on asteroids and comets,
695500	698500	and these would be rocks in space or snowballs in space,
698500	701500	and these are on these elongated elliptical orbits
701500	704500	crossing throughout the solar system, smashing it to things,
704500	709500	and one of them killed the dinosaurs.
709500	715500	So, the way I learned the solar system was focused on memorization,
715500	719500	really just gathering together a whole bunch of facts.
719500	724500	And what I don't like about it is that it highlights the differences between the objects.
724500	729500	You really get little or no feel for the big picture of the solar system.
729500	733500	What's the worst thing about this way of teaching the solar system
733500	737500	is that it's often presented in an image like this.
737500	741500	This is a horrible way to present the solar system.
741500	744500	Just, no, don't go there.
744500	747500	It's just plain wrong.
747500	750500	And the sizes of the planets are sort of done to scale,
750500	752500	but the sun is totally off scale.
752500	755500	The spacing between the planets, totally wrong.
755500	758500	The orbits are all in a plane? Wrong.
758500	765500	There's just characteristic ideas that fundamentally skew your mental model.
765500	770500	The most important one is that the planets are all lined up.
770500	778500	The planets will be lined up in the solar system once every three quadrillion years.
778500	784500	That's 600,000 times the current age of our solar system.
784500	792500	So you can say that the planets have never been aligned in the entire history of the solar system.
792500	795500	Improving on that model of learning the solar system,
795500	798500	we move to comparative planetology.
798500	805500	With the space age exploration, which I remember being highlighted by Viking to Mars
805500	808500	and the Voyager missions to the outer planets,
808500	816500	we learn to go deeper and see more things and understand more ideas about the objects in the solar system.
816500	826500	The basic premise of this is to discuss broad ideas and compare them across the solar system.
826500	831500	It's a comparison and contrast where you highlight the similarities.
831500	835500	An example would be to discuss storms.
835500	841500	Here is a picture of Hurricane Isabel, which arose in 2003.
841500	849500	It's a very big storm on Earth that formed out in the Atlantic and then swept across the east coast of the United States.
849500	859500	Now, this is an impressive image of a storm, but when you compare it to Jupiter and the great red spot,
859500	869500	it can seem rather small, especially when you put the great red spot in context and put the earth in for scale.
869500	882500	The great red spot is a giant storm on Jupiter that has been swirling for 350 years and is as large as our entire planet.
883500	889500	Doing that comparison allows you to see that what we think is huge here on Earth,
889500	893500	ain't so huge out in the solar system.
893500	896500	Now, you can do many other comparisons for craters.
896500	902500	You can look at Berenier Crater in Arizona and compare it to Mari Oriental on the moon
902500	905500	or the great ringed Valhalla crater on Callisto.
905500	912500	You can look at canyons and compare the Grand Canyon on Earth to Valis Marineris on Mars.
912500	919500	Volcanoes, Mount St. Helens versus Mount Olympus on Mars versus Jupiter's moon Io,
919500	924500	where an average of seven volcanoes are erupting at any time.
924500	928500	You can look at weather. You've got these 100-year hurricanes.
928500	932500	You've got methane lakes. You've got sulfuric acid rain.
933500	941500	These comparisons can continue for rings, moons, magnetic fields, and many other ideas.
941500	950500	The messages that comparative planetology sends are that what happens here on Earth happens elsewhere in the solar system.
950500	953500	The solar system is understandable.
953500	959500	We can model processes here and understand them as they occur out there.
960500	965500	So the progression that you go through is that first you have to establish the facts,
965500	972500	then you group these facts into themes, and then these themes can illuminate many different aspects.
972500	978500	However, the true big picture is still a little lacking,
978500	983500	and that's where the 21st century solar system comes in.
983500	989500	Instead of talking about the sun and nine planets, asteroids, and comets,
989500	994500	what we do is we group the solar system into six families.
994500	999500	These are classes of similar objects, objects that have roughly the same size.
999500	1004500	Their composition is the same. They're made out of roughly the same type of stuff.
1004500	1010500	They're orbit sizes, and their orbit shapes, whether they're circular or elliptical.
1010500	1014500	The inclination of the orbits, whether they're highly tilted or whether they're mostly in the plane.
1014500	1021500	These are all similar. How many moons they have? Do they have rings? How strong is their magnetic field?
1021500	1029500	You look at the characteristics of all these objects and then create families out of them.
1029500	1035500	So let's go through the solar system one more time and use this modern perspective.
1035500	1042500	Well, there's the sun. The sun is a singular object. It is the only star in the solar system.
1042500	1053500	It contains 99.9% of the mass of the solar system, and things both literally and figuratively revolve around the sun.
1053500	1059500	Outside of the sun, in the nearest orbits, we have the rocky planets.
1059500	1064500	And in this image, I will note that I'm showing to them as they should be seen.
1064500	1070500	Many times you will see images of these planets that do not show them as they appear with visible light.
1070500	1076500	These are all done approximately what the human eye would see, especially Venus here.
1076500	1083500	Venus doesn't look too interesting with visible light, so people often show you a radar image or how it looks in ultraviolet light.
1083500	1090500	So you can see the rocky planets. They're all made of rock. Their orbits are close into the sun.
1090500	1095500	They have few to no moons, and they have relatively thin atmospheres.
1095500	1103500	In the next layer in the solar system is the asteroid belt. These are small to tiny rocks.
1103500	1106500	They contain mostly rock, but they have some ice.
1106500	1116500	The orbits are concentrated between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and their orbits are more elliptical and more tilted orbits.
1116500	1123500	Then outside of that, we have the giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
1123500	1130500	These are very large planets, hence we call them the giant planets. They have deep gaseous atmospheres.
1130500	1140500	All of them have rings, and all of them have moons. Some of them have very many moons, and they all have very large magnetic fields.
1140500	1148500	Beyond that is a region called the Kuiper Belt. This is the new region of the solar system.
1148500	1154500	There are over a thousand objects that we have discovered in this region since 1992.
1154500	1160500	These are small to tiny objects. They're mostly made of ice, with some rock.
1160500	1167500	Their orbits, like the asteroids, are more elliptical and more tilted than the planet orbits.
1167500	1174500	What do they look like? Well, here's an artist's illustration of one. It's an object called Quarwar.
1174500	1178500	No, I'm not making that up. It really is named Quarwar.
1178500	1185500	It was named by a friend of mine for a goddess of a Native American tribe in Southern California.
1185500	1192500	It is basically a giant ice ball, and you can see that the artist has drawn some craters on it.
1192500	1199500	But you've got to wonder, what would happen if this ice ball ventured near the sun?
1199500	1205500	Well then, it would look like this. It would become a comet.
1205500	1210500	The ices on its surface would melt a little bit, and it would develop a tail.
1210500	1218500	And that is what the Kuiper Belt is. It's a reservoir of our short period comets in the solar system.
1218500	1225500	Well, if there's a reservoir of short period comets, that implies there must be a reservoir of long period comets.
1225500	1230500	And that is what is shown here in this illustration of the Oort Cloud.
1230500	1239500	Now, let me note that this illustration is logarithmic. If you look at the axis drawn here, it goes from 1 to 10 to 100 to 1000.
1239500	1249500	So the distances aren't linear, where the orbits of the planets extend out to about 30 astronomical units,
1249500	1253500	where one astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun.
1253500	1261500	The Kuiper Belt extends out to 50 AU, and the Oort Cloud extends out to about 50,000 AU.
1261500	1266500	It's about a thousand times more distant than the Kuiper Belt.
1266500	1277500	Now, we have no observations yet of the Oort Cloud, but we do have a few tantalizing ideas from observations of an object called Sedna,
1277500	1283500	which seems to exist in the no man's land in between the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.
1283500	1290500	So the 21st century solar system can be summarized with a relatively simple diagram.
1290500	1294500	This is what I call a bullseye diagram of the solar system.
1294500	1300500	It was just a simplified diagram I created to just show off the basic organizational structure.
1300500	1309500	But as I've presented it to teachers and to students, I recognize that in its simplicity, it has a lot of power.
1309500	1315500	Because what it shows, it shows the families of the solar system in embedded shells.
1315500	1323500	You have the Sun at the center, around that you have the rocky planets, around that you have the asteroid belt,
1323500	1328500	around that you have the gas giant planets, around that you have the Kuiper Belt,
1328500	1333500	and finally, on the outer edges, you have the Oort Cloud.
1333500	1337500	You can see the distribution of the family's objects in the solar system.
1337500	1341500	And when you look at it, you can see that it has a compositional gradient.
1341500	1346500	The rocky stuff, the rocky planets in the asteroid belt are on the inside.
1346500	1351500	The icy stuff, the Kuiper Belt in the Oort Cloud, are on the outside.
1351500	1353500	In between, you've got the gaseous stuff.
1353500	1359500	Well, that makes sense, because this gives you some clue to the formation of the solar system,
1359500	1364500	where you've got this hot sun in the center, and you couldn't have the ices forming close to this hot sun.
1364500	1369500	They had to be way out on the edge, and the rocks, well, they could be in there.
1369500	1376500	So this, this is the perspective that changed Pluto.
1376500	1379500	Because when you look at this 21st century solar system,
1379500	1384500	Pluto is best understood as a member of a Kuiper Belt.
1384500	1388500	I presented some of this material to my daughter's kindergarten class.
1388500	1395500	And at first, they weren't too happy, because it seems that Pluto is every kid's favorite planet.
1395500	1400500	I don't know, being small, maybe they associate with the smallest planet.
1400500	1405500	But as I presented it, and as I gave them the ideas,
1405500	1409500	they came up back to me with a fairy tale.
1409500	1415500	And the moral of their fairy tale was that Pluto has now found his family.
1415500	1422500	It was an ugly duckling story where Pluto goes from not fitting in to eventually being a member,
1422500	1425500	fitting in with the Kuiper Belt.
1425500	1431500	Now, this is just one of many other new perspectives I want to present to you in this course.
1431500	1435500	And to do it, we've structured the course in three sections.
1435500	1440500	What we're going to do is sort of build the knowledge of the solar system from the ground up.
1440500	1444500	In the first section, we're going to establish the foundations of astronomy.
1444500	1447500	We'll explore the historical perspectives.
1447500	1450500	We'll go through the fundamental observations of the sky.
1450500	1457500	We'll lay down the concepts in physics of gravity, motion, light, and other things.
1457500	1460500	We'll go through astronomical observing.
1460500	1467500	The basic idea is to work into creating scientific models of the solar system.
1467500	1475500	These are all the ideas necessary to develop a scientific picture of how the solar system works.
1475500	1483500	In the second section, we'll go through the detailed knowledge of the sun, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets,
1483500	1486500	especially that provided by the space-age solar system.
1486500	1494500	There's been an exponential growth in our knowledge, and there's some really, really cool ideas that I'm going to love to present to you.
1494500	1499500	We have literally volumes of new information, and we'll use that modern approach.
1499500	1509500	We will use comparative planetology to go through lectures on craters, or lectures on weather, or lectures on atmospheres,
1509500	1512500	and cross-cut the solar system.
1512500	1517500	In the third section, we will go through the current revolution in our understanding.
1517500	1522500	We'll explore the outer parts of our solar system, the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud,
1522500	1529500	and we will also gauge our understanding of planetary systems around other stars.
1529500	1535500	So the development as we go through this course will be, first, how we understand the universe,
1535500	1540500	second, how the Earth fits in within our solar system,
1540500	1546500	and third, how our solar system fits in with other planetary systems.
1546500	1553500	The philosophical basis for this course is really just curiosity,
1553500	1560500	because the study of astronomy today, the knowledge gained, has to be its own reward.
1560500	1569500	When we look at distant planets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies, we find very little of immediate practical value.
1569500	1577500	The practical aspects of astronomy, be it timekeeping, or the calendars, or navigation,
1577500	1582500	well, these were all discovered long ago, and we sort of take them for granted today.
1582500	1586500	We don't observe the sky the way we once did.
1586500	1591500	It used to be very important to keep track of the sky.
1591500	1594500	The full moon used to be important.
1594500	1600500	If you wanted to do something in the evening, well, knowing when the full moon occurred would be very good.
1600500	1603500	You could do things in the evening during the full moon,
1603500	1609500	and this is probably the source of stories about werewolves coming out of the full moon, or lunatics,
1609500	1613500	where luna, the root word, stands for the moon.
1613500	1619500	We have electric lights now, and so we no longer need to track the phases of the moon,
1619500	1624500	and these electric lights also greatly diminish our view of the night sky.
1624500	1628500	As astronomers, we fight something we call light pollution,
1628500	1637500	and it's really just all the lights of cities going up into the sky and reducing our view of the Magnificence in Heavens.
1637500	1643500	We have atomic clocks, and they can provide ultra-precise time,
1643500	1646500	so there's no need to tell time by the sun anymore.
1646500	1652500	Now, it's true that the observations of the sky still define our system of time,
1652500	1658500	but it's not something that you and I have to be worried about.
1658500	1661500	We also have global positioning satellites.
1661500	1664500	They can give us ultra-precise information on where we are.
1664500	1670500	We have one in my car. It tells me where my car is to within a few tens of meters.
1670500	1678500	The sun and the stars have now become obsolete as navigational tools.
1678500	1688500	But despite all this modern technology, our innate wonder for astronomy still exists.
1688500	1693500	The view from a dark mountain top is still awe-inspiring.
1693500	1697500	A few summers ago, I was vacationing in Yosemite National Park,
1697500	1699500	and I wanted to go out and look at the stars.
1699500	1702500	My son was the only one who'd come with me late at night,
1702500	1706500	so we went out to the center of the valley and just looked up.
1706500	1709500	And wow, what a sight!
1709500	1716500	You know, for those of us who spend our lives in suburbia to get out to a dark site and really see the sky,
1716500	1718500	it's just amazing.
1718500	1725500	And my son, he's getting to be a teenager, and his dad is no longer the coolest guy.
1725500	1730500	He's been learning about astronomy for me since he was, you know, knee-high to a grasshopper.
1730500	1733500	So he's heard it and been there and done that, right?
1733500	1739500	Well, underneath that incredible sky, dad was suddenly cool again.
1739500	1743500	Astronomer dad was suddenly cool again.
1743500	1749500	And he had questions, and he wanted to learn, and he wanted to listen.
1749500	1755500	And there's something humbling, you know, but very uplifting about looking at the sky.
1755500	1758500	And it always evokes questions.
1758500	1762500	Whenever people learn that I'm an astronomer and we're out at a dark site looking at the sky,
1762500	1764500	I get tons of questions.
1764500	1768500	But that's really where I want to begin this course.
1768500	1773500	I want you to think about standing there and looking at the night sky
1773500	1777500	and wondering, gazing at the wonder of the night sky.
1777500	1782500	Because when you start to wonder about it, that leads you to make observations.
1782500	1788500	And when you make those observations, you'll eventually find patterns in those observations.
1788500	1795500	And the patterns in those observations will lead you to create explanations about those.
1795500	1799500	In that way, you're not only building the mental model,
1799500	1806500	but you're also understanding the observations upon which it is based.
1806500	1811500	We'll begin building that mental model in our next lecture.
1811500	1817500	There, and throughout the course, I'm going to introduce you to a ton of new images
1817500	1819500	that present incredible new discoveries.
1819500	1823500	We'll float some really cool new ideas.
1823500	1830500	But mostly will lead you to new perspectives in how you think about the solar system.
1830500	1832500	I'm really looking forward to it.
1832500	1837500	Because it's a wonderful story to hear, but it's also a wonderful story to tell.
1837500	1839500	We'll see you next time.
