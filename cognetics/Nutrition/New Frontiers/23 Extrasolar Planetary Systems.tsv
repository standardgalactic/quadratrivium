0	21760	In the previous lecture, we started the discussion of extrasolar planets.
21760	27800	We discussed the techniques for finding planets around other stars, and I also gave you some
27800	28960	examples.
28960	33880	We found that there were hot Jupiters, these giant planets with orbits that are smaller
33880	35940	than the orbit of Mercury.
35940	41360	We also discovered that they had many elliptical orbits, planets that were in orbit stretched
41360	46200	out that they looked like comet orbits in our solar system.
46200	51160	In this lecture, we're going to discuss the characteristics of the planetary systems we've
51160	53000	so far discovered.
53000	57520	And there's so much to discuss, we're just going to jump right in.
57520	62080	Now to establish a broader overview of the whole population, we're going to begin with
62080	64440	some statistics.
64440	70920	Here is a plot of the number of planets versus their semi-major axis.
70920	74220	And so these are the distances from the Sun.
74220	77840	And over here on the left hand side of the plot, you can see that there are many planets
77840	79080	in close.
79080	81920	These are mainly your hot Jupiters.
81920	84480	And these were the unexpected ones.
84760	90840	As you look further away from the stars, you see more planets, and it starts to rise up
90840	95840	around 1 AU, the distance of Earth from our Sun.
95840	102080	This was what we expected, because as you go further out in the nebula, you are expecting
102080	104640	to see Jupiter-sized orbits.
104640	109520	You're expecting to see Jupiter-sized planets in Jupiter-sized orbits, and Jupiter orbits
109520	112480	actually are out towards the edge of this plot.
112480	115920	And that's where you start to see a drop-off, but that's not real.
115920	121840	That's just a selection effect, because Doppler spectroscopy needs many years in order to
121840	124160	see these very long orbits.
124160	132960	Remember that Jupiter orbits our Sun in about 11 years, Saturn orbits in 30 years.
132960	138480	Most searches that have been using this technique have only been looking for a decade or so.
138480	143600	So that means we would not have seen those very long orbits yet.
143600	148680	It also means that we're sort of getting to the end of the low-hanging fruit.
148680	155320	If you have to wait two more decades in order to see a Saturn, then perhaps we might want
155320	160520	to start moving to a new technique, because in 20 years we can develop a lot of technology
160520	163360	to see a lot of planets.
163360	169280	Now there's an interesting effect noticed for these hot Jupiters.
169280	173800	Here we have the number of planets plotted against their orbital period.
173800	178720	And you notice a very interesting effect in that there is a pile-up of planets around
178720	181440	a three-day orbit.
181440	185600	Now there's no bias in the observations that would produce this effect.
185600	190560	There's no reason why we would favor seeing planets in three-day orbits, versus five
190560	193200	or ten or fifteen-day orbits.
193200	198000	So there must be some dynamical effect that favors this orbit.
198000	203040	Perhaps it's the tidal effects of gravity from the star onto the planet.
203040	205600	We're not sure.
205600	213720	If we look at the mass distribution of extrasolar planets, we see that there are many more at
213720	220600	low mass, and the falloff going towards high mass falls off as what we call a power law.
220600	226920	And again, this is the trend we expect, because it's easier to make smaller things, and so
226920	232400	you expect in a planetary system that you would get few bigger things.
232400	239120	The slope of the power law will be studied and debated, and the falloff is probably stronger
239120	247000	than shown, because the larger objects are easier to find.
247000	254080	So the low mass peak is likely to be even larger than is shown in this diagram.
254080	261600	Now even though this low mass distribution is not yet well known, we do have one intriguing
261600	263680	observation.
263680	269320	This is a plot of 30 planets that have their minimum mass, the M-sine I, less than a hundred
269320	271360	earth masses.
271640	277680	What you see here is a strong peak just below 20 earth masses.
277680	281080	We call this a Neptune mass peak.
281080	287000	One third of the objects when this plot was made are of Neptune mass.
287000	289640	This might indicate a characteristic mass.
289640	292480	Again the data here is incomplete.
292480	299080	Is there a class of hot neptunes, as well as a class of hot Jupiters?
299080	306640	You can see these classes in a plot of mass versus semi-major axis.
306640	309440	Here is one Jupiter mass on the y-axis.
309440	314880	The y-axis is in Jupiter masses, so here's one Jupiter mass, and so these objects over
314880	319560	here on the left would be the hot Jupiters.
319560	328240	These objects down here would be the hot neptunes, the ones that are, oh, maybe one-tenth, one-twentieth
328320	334000	the size of Jupiter, and these would be the more normal Jupiter mass planets, the ones
334000	336360	out here at a few AU.
336360	340400	So the ones that are interior would be the hot ones, the ones that are out at a few AU
340400	345200	would be what we would consider more normal Jupiter mass planets.
345200	350760	The diagonal lines drawn on this plot show the rough selection effects of finding these
350760	356400	planets, and the green dots are the solar system planets.
356400	361800	All of these green dots are below the line, except for Jupiter.
361800	367800	You can see the lower masses, but only in very small orbits.
367800	373800	You would not be able to discover a neptune in a neptune size orbit just yet.
373800	381800	If we take a look at the orbit shape, this is a plot of eccentricity on the y-axis versus
381800	385320	semi-major axis on the x-axis.
385320	389120	The close-in objects have lower eccentricity.
389120	395880	You don't see any objects less than, say, 0.1 of an AU having very high eccentricity.
395880	400520	So the hot Jupiters have more circular orbits.
400520	404520	But further out, all of the orbit shapes are seen.
404520	409860	They go from zero all the way up through 0.9, etc.
409860	416500	This is definitely not typical of what we see in our solar system, because the green
416500	422420	dots again represent our solar system objects, and here are all of these objects way down
422420	423420	here.
423420	428180	The one that comes up here is Mercury, and that's only at about 0.2.
428180	436780	The average eccentricity of the extrasolar planet population is about 0.25 or 0.3.
436780	443820	Solar planets tend to have much more elliptical orbits than what we see in our solar system.
443820	449320	If we plot the same eccentricity versus the mass of the planet, we get another scatter
449320	450820	plot.
450820	457040	Now you might expect for the larger objects that it would be harder to alter their orbit.
457040	462420	How do you get a really massive planet to go into this really elliptical orbit?
462420	467180	When you scatter things, it's usually the big mass guy scattering the small things, and
467180	471380	so you can get the smaller things into elliptical orbits, but how do you get the big mass guys
471380	473720	into these elliptical orbits?
473720	478460	What we see here is that there are elliptical orbits for all of the masses of these extrasolar
478460	480460	planets.
480460	486980	Now I will say that the circular orbits, the ones that would be further away like Jupiter
486980	493460	is now, will take longer to find because those circular orbits don't come in close to their
493460	494460	star.
494460	498780	When you've got an elliptical orbit and it comes in close, you get a strong velocity
498780	500740	kick on the star, and you can see the wobble.
500740	505340	If you're out in nice big circular orbit, they're a little harder to find, so this finding that
505340	509340	we see here might change in the future.
509340	515100	The last statistic I have to show you today is not about the planets, but about the stars
515100	516860	they orbit.
516860	523060	This shows you the percentage of stars that have planets compared to the iron content
523060	525380	of their host stars.
525380	529980	What we do is we measure the strength of the iron lines in the star's spectrum and compare
529980	531740	that to the sun.
531740	539180	So one on the x-axis is having the same amount of iron as we see in our sun.
539180	546260	There is a very strong trend here that if the star has more iron in it, then it's more
546260	548980	likely to find planets around it.
548980	555180	There are none in the left bin, but you'll also note that there are about one tenth as
555180	558700	many stars surveyed in that left bin.
558700	561260	Now iron isn't the point here.
561260	565860	Iron is just being used as a proxy for all the heavy elements.
565860	569340	The universe started out with just hydrogen and helium.
569340	573100	After the Big Bang, all we had was hydrogen and helium.
573100	579460	These are the lightest elements and the stars fuse these light elements into heavier elements
579460	585340	and then they blow these heavy elements out into space either via gently via winds or
585340	588980	violently by supernova explosions.
588980	595580	So that stars that form early, early in the universe or early in the life of their galaxy
595580	599900	will have few heavy elements to incorporate into them.
599900	604740	Stars that form later will be able to form from gases that have been enriched by these
604740	609620	winds and supernova explosions and they will have more heavy elements.
609620	615260	So the stars that form early will tend to have fewer planets and the stars that form
615260	619740	later will tend to have more planets.
619740	625100	And those are the stars where we want to concentrate our searches for planets for looking for extra
625100	627220	solar planets.
627220	632300	So the implications of this are that we would expect to find more extra solar planets in
632300	638700	the disks of spiral galaxies and fewer in the bulges of the spiral galaxies or the halos
638700	643660	around those spiral galaxies and even fewer in things like globular clusters which are
643660	646940	some of the oldest star clusters in our galaxy.
646940	652060	Furthermore, we have two satellite galaxies called the Magellanic Clouds.
652060	655020	They have very few heavy elements.
655020	659780	And unfortunately this result implies they will also have few planets.
659780	662940	Well, that's enough statistics.
662940	669420	The real questions we want to address is are there any planetary systems like ours?
669420	673460	And are there any planets like Earth?
673460	676740	The answers are both yes and no.
676740	680580	Let's first look at a nearby star.
680580	686420	This one is Epsilon Aridani and it's 10 and a half light years away.
686420	692060	This is a microwave observation of the star and it reveals a ring of cold dust.
692060	696500	I showed you several rings of dust in the previous lecture.
696500	703980	This one has a scale of about 40 astronomical units in radius and it looks very much like
703980	705740	the Kuiper Belt in our solar system.
705740	709900	It's at the same distance that Kuiper Belt is in our solar system.
709900	716740	Now of significance is that it is a ring and it has an empty interior and that may indicate
716740	718820	that planets have formed.
718820	724900	However, Epsilon Aridani is very hard to study with Doppler spectroscopy because it shows
724900	731620	a lot of magnetic variation in its spectrum and those variations could mimic a signal
731620	734100	of a planet.
734100	739340	Success in looking at Epsilon Aridani came through astrometry, measuring the positional
739340	746700	wobble of the star in the sky, not measuring its spectroscopic wobble and it's only possible
746700	753180	because it is a very nearby star, as I said, only 10 and a half light years away.
753180	760180	What they found was a one and a half Jupiter mass planet on a rather elliptical orbit and
760180	764900	here you can see the gray represents the orbit of Mercury, the red represents the orbit of
764900	769580	Mars and the orange represents the orbit of Jupiter.
769580	775500	This planet has a similar mass to Jupiter but a rather different orbit, but that's not
775500	778020	really even the important thing.
778020	784580	What's really important about this planet is indicated in this drawing here.
784580	789300	You can see the planet and you can see the star in the background and you can also see
789300	793460	that dusk disc that I showed you before.
793460	799340	When examining this planet, the planet and the dusk disc have the same orientation.
799340	807060	This is the first time that we have a direct connection between a planet and a dusk disc.
807060	814300	The idea, the sort of assumption we have that planets formed from discs has now been observationally
814300	821580	verified and it's always good when a basic assumption of your theories turns out to be
821580	823660	true.
823660	828060	We have also found some multiple planet systems.
828060	835900	This is a diagram, at least the top is a diagram of the planetary system around the star 55
835900	837020	Cancri.
837020	841020	The bottom is our solar system for comparison.
841020	848180	Now both stars are about the same, both stars are about the same size, mass and brightness.
848580	851980	55 Cancri has 5 planets.
851980	859260	It has a 4 Jupiter mass planet at 5.8 AU and that compares well to our solar system, where
859260	862820	we have Jupiter at 5.2 AU.
862820	865580	So the comparison here, well looks pretty good.
865580	874940	55 Cancri also has a planet at 0.8 AU, 80% of Earth's distance from the Sun, but that
874940	879660	planet is almost 50 times Earth's mass.
879660	886220	It's about 3 times the mass of Neptune, and that's not so good for the comparison.
886220	891180	And the two solar systems actually get even more different in the inner region.
891180	896220	If you look at the inner region of the 55 Cancri system, you see 3 planets, one has
896220	902260	a highly elliptical orbit, two of them have relatively circular orbits, the outer one
902260	904700	has Jupiter mass.
904700	911060	The middle one is another 3 Neptune mass planet, and the inner one has about two thirds of
911060	913060	Neptune's mass.
913060	919460	So in summary for this system, it's really incredible that we have found a 5 planet extra
919460	924340	solar planetary system, but they're all giant planets.
924340	929860	So there's some similarity to our own solar system, but I would say on balance there's
929860	932540	more differences here.
932580	937460	Now I could go through other multiple planet systems, but it would be the same story and
937460	939300	even more differences.
939300	944340	Generally, all of the extra solar planetary systems that we have found, the ones with
944340	948940	multiple planets, are very different from our own solar system.
948940	952020	But in a way, that's to be expected.
952020	959500	Because if our solar system was out there, we would only see one planet, Jupiter.
959500	966460	Many multiple planet systems we see now are basically guaranteed to be different.
966460	972180	Because if you see more than one planet, then you're not structured the way our solar system
972180	973180	is.
973180	977820	We're going to have to wait a bunch of years before we can start to see solar systems like
977820	982100	our multiple planet systems like our own.
982100	986620	So it's a little premature to give statistics on multiple planets, I mean I think we really
986620	991220	need more data before we give statistics, but people always ask.
991220	997900	So about 15% of the surveyed stars have planets.
997900	1000780	The count is woefully incomplete.
1000780	1007660	And 25 of the planetary systems we've discovered so far are multiple planet systems.
1007660	1014300	And so that works out to be about 10% of the total number of systems that have multiple
1014300	1016660	planets.
1016660	1018800	Now to the other question.
1018800	1022140	What about seeing other Earths?
1022140	1027820	Now we have found a few planets that have been nicknamed Super Earths, although some
1027820	1031660	theorists tell me they might be called, better be called mini-neptunes.
1031660	1035220	We're really not sure of their composition.
1035220	1042620	And Doppler spectroscopy can not yet see the signal from a real Earth.
1042620	1045580	The period of Earth is short enough, it's only one year.
1045580	1048580	But the velocity signal on the Sun is much too small.
1048580	1051300	It's of order one-tenth of a meter per second.
1051300	1054620	And the best we can do these days is about one meter per second.
1054620	1058700	So we need a market improvement or we need to rely on other techniques to really find
1058700	1060940	Earths.
1060940	1067820	The first extra solar planets that were discovered around the pulsar were actually Super Earths.
1067820	1074660	The planets around pulsar, PSR 1257 plus 12 are all in mercury sized orbits and they
1074660	1077820	have orbital periods of one to three months.
1077820	1083940	Their masses, well C on the outside, planet C on the outside is 2.8 times the mass of
1083940	1085340	Earth.
1085340	1092020	Planet B just inside the reference orbit of Mercury is 3.4 Earth masses.
1092020	1098140	And planet A, way down in here, is only 2% the mass of Earth.
1098140	1101140	That's only twice the mass of the Moon.
1101140	1105900	Now folks tend to discount these planets because they're orbiting a pulsar.
1105900	1107780	They're incapable of supporting life.
1107780	1112540	You expect this extreme wind of atomic particles from the pulsar and any atmospheres that they
1112540	1116260	might have would be stripped.
1116260	1121700	The low mass Doppler spectroscopy results can only find objects that only several Earth
1121700	1126220	masses and would be very close to their star.
1126220	1134420	In this system, Gliese 876, again we see three planets in mercury sized orbits.
1134420	1141940	The outer one B is two Jupiter masses, the middle one C is half of a Jupiter mass, and
1141940	1148500	the one in way down close D is 5.9 Earth masses.
1148500	1154380	Its orbit is only three million kilometers from its star.
1154380	1160700	Now this star is a red dwarf star and its energy output is only two thousandths that
1160700	1165020	of the Sun, but its distance is one fiftieth that.
1165020	1171700	So if you do the math, the energy per unit area on this planet is about four times the
1171700	1174220	energy that we receive here on Earth.
1174220	1177060	So it's too hot for life.
1177060	1186500	Another super Earth was found by microlensing and this is the Ogol 2005 BLG390L system.
1186500	1189420	You can see they have some really long names.
1189420	1194060	It has similar masses to the planet in stars, the one I just showed you.
1194060	1200060	This is a 5.5 Earth mass planet, again around a red dwarf star.
1200060	1202460	Earth's orbit however is much larger.
1202460	1206380	It's about three astronomical units, three times Earth's orbit.
1206380	1210340	So the energy received by this star is very low.
1210340	1212420	This one will be too cold for life.
1212420	1218740	You can see the artist has depicted it here as an icy rocky planet in this image.
1218740	1225300	Now the amazing point about this system is that its star is located twenty thousand light
1225300	1227420	years away.
1227420	1232380	Most of the known extrasolar planets are less than two hundred light years away.
1232380	1237320	Gravitational microlensing has a potentially huge discovery space because it can see these
1237320	1242620	lensing events all the way across our galaxy.
1242620	1246180	So the first super Earth we talked about was too hot.
1246180	1248540	The second one was too cold.
1248540	1250900	Now we come to just right.
1250900	1253740	Well, almost.
1253740	1259940	This is a 5 Earth mass planet around the star Gliese 581.
1259940	1266740	Again this is a red dwarf star, and again there are three planets in mercury sized orbits.
1266740	1271100	The trend here is probably not nature that there are always these three planets with
1271100	1275620	these super Earths, but it's more the selection effects of the observations.
1275620	1283100	This system contains a fifteen Earth mass planet at six million kilometers and an eight
1283100	1287500	Earth mass planet at forty million kilometers.
1287500	1292660	The five Earth mass planet, which if it was made a rock would have a diameter about twice
1292660	1300420	Earth is in a thirteen day orbit at a distance of eleven million kilometers.
1300420	1307140	This is at the hot edge of where surface water could be liquid.
1307140	1312140	The region in a planetary system we sometimes call the habitable zone, but I don't really
1312140	1313140	like that term.
1313140	1316180	I would like to call it the liquid water zone.
1316180	1324380	Now we have no idea if water is there on this planet, but this is the first extrasolar planet
1324380	1331100	we've discovered where liquid water on its surface would even be possible.
1331100	1336940	These observations also underscore the importance of small red stars.
1336940	1344300	Because they emit less light, the water zone is closer in, and because they are smaller
1344300	1348580	stars it's easier to detect Earth mass planets.
1348580	1354500	So around small red stars will probably be the first place we will find an Earth like
1354500	1356620	planet.
1356620	1362700	So if there is water on this planet, how would we tell if it existed?
1362700	1368020	How can you tell from afar that Earth has water, especially if you can't see the blue
1368020	1369660	oceans?
1369660	1374820	The answer is to look for water vapor in its atmosphere, and we've already started that
1374820	1377780	search in a way.
1377780	1382180	This is a drawing of HD 209458.
1382180	1385700	This is a hot Jupiter that eclipses its star.
1385700	1390500	It has a close enough orbit that its atmosphere is heated and puffed up.
1390500	1396420	Now sunlight from the star passes through that planet atmosphere, and if you take a spectrum
1396420	1402620	during the transit, and a spectrum when it's not in the midst of transit, and you subtract
1402620	1407980	the two, then you get the spectrum of this planet's atmosphere.
1407980	1413620	We have found that we are able to detect the chemical signatures of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon,
1413620	1417580	and sodium in this other planet's atmosphere.
1417580	1424260	There's also a possible detection of water, although it's stronger for another planet,
1424260	1428820	one around the star HD 189733.
1428820	1431460	There neither one of them is fully convincing.
1431460	1438100	We haven't quite gotten to detecting water in an extrasolar planet, but it points the
1438100	1444180	way to gaining detailed knowledge by looking at the spectra of extrasolar planets.
1444180	1450620	We can tell the composition of their atmospheres and possibly detect signs of life.
1450620	1459380	Again, doing this for an Earth-sized planet in an Earth-sized orbit is many years away.
1459380	1465860	The overarching result from extrasolar planets is that many, if not most, planetary systems
1465860	1468780	look nothing like our solar system.
1468780	1474820	A few lectures ago, I developed the idea of planet formation for our solar system, and
1474820	1480380	it's demonstrated by the plot I've been using over and over again that everything forms
1480380	1486580	in a disk, you naturally get circular orbits, and you naturally get rock in the interior,
1486580	1489660	gas in the middle, and ice on the outside.
1489660	1495820	It all works very well for our solar system, but it doesn't really work for other planetary
1495820	1496820	systems.
1496820	1503420	It just fails miserably because Jupiters can't form right next to a star.
1503420	1508060	And if you have highly elliptical orbits, it would disrupt planet formation.
1508060	1514900	So if our solar system scenario were true everywhere, nearly all the planets we discovered
1514900	1517580	would not be there.
1517580	1525580	Clearly, our solar system is not a generic solar system, and how we form it is not a
1525580	1527820	generalized formation theory.
1527820	1535620	Now, the greatest time in a scientist's career is when he realizes that he has no idea what's
1535620	1537540	going on.
1537900	1543580	Ignorance really is bliss because it tells you that there's new knowledge just waiting
1543580	1545460	to be discovered.
1545460	1550020	And in this case, it's revisions to our planet formation theory.
1550020	1551860	Now disk formation has been confirmed.
1551860	1557060	We have plenty of observations of disks, but two aspects have changed.
1557060	1559380	Planet migration and planet scattering.
1559380	1565980	I'm going to play for you a planet formation simulation, and in this simulation, the disk
1565980	1572980	is seen face on, the red is disk material, and the yellow will be planet material.
1572980	1578540	It starts with a three earth mass planet, and the plot in the lower left shows the disk
1578540	1579940	density.
1579940	1585060	As the planet orbits in the disk, it develops a spiral density wave.
1585060	1590340	That spiral density wave feeds material into the forming planet.
1590340	1601020	And eventually, the material feeding onto the planet starts to clear a ring of material.
1601020	1606260	After the ring is cleared, material still keeps forming on, but very slowly.
1606260	1613060	The planet ends up at 20 Jupiter masses, and that's a growth by a factor of 2,000.
1613060	1616700	Now there are three stages to note in this simulation.
1616700	1620820	This first image shows a time when the spiral wave has developed.
1620820	1625580	This exerts torque on the planet, and its orbit will decay.
1625580	1630340	Now it doesn't decay in the simulation because it was held fixed for demonstration purposes.
1630340	1634060	This is what we call type 1 migration.
1634060	1638700	The orbit, however, might not decay because of other density variations in the disk.
1638700	1643620	What we've got here is a smooth disk, and a realistic disk will have clumpiness, and
1643620	1646820	that will provide other torques on a small planet.
1646820	1652940	It really could be a random walk in and out, and as I said before, that's what we call
1652940	1657980	type 1 migration, where the disk is acting on the planet, and the density profile, as
1657980	1662820	you see in the lower left, the density profile of the disk hasn't been heavily modified.
1662820	1668180	The second stage is when a gap opens in the disk.
1668180	1673600	The planet has now modified the disk density, and you can see a strong change in the plot
1673960	1675800	in the lower left.
1675800	1681960	Both the planet and the disk are equal players at this time, and some details are not known
1681960	1688720	how the remaining gas interacts with the planet, but eventually the remaining gas is either
1688720	1693960	brought onto the planet or scattered away, and the gap is fully cleared.
1693960	1699240	In what we call type 2 migration, the gap is basically empty.
1699680	1704240	As you can see in the lower left, the density plot goes all the way down, except for the
1704240	1707000	planet in the middle of the gap.
1707000	1712040	Some gas continues to be captured from the edges of the gap, and so there's a coupled
1712040	1713640	evolution.
1713640	1720140	The disk controls most of the system, but the planet controls its gap region.
1720140	1726640	Furthermore, the planet can modify the disk, and this can explain some of the features
1726640	1733240	seen in the previous lecture about disks, the rings that are cleared out on the inside,
1733240	1737520	the clumping you see in the disks, and even the lopsided disks.
1737520	1743080	That formation of these planets can then modify the disk from which they came.
1743080	1750580	Also, I like to note the resemblance to the structures that we saw in Saturn's rings.
1750580	1755680	Here is an image of the spiral waves along the anky gap.
1755680	1762280	The moon pan excites these spiral density waves in the anky gap, just like the spiral
1762280	1765400	density waves we saw in the simulation.
1765400	1771920	And in the Keeler gap, the small moon Daphnis, in this image it was pulling material off
1771920	1776880	the edge of the Keeler gap, similar to the disk and planet interactions that we saw in
1776880	1782160	the simulation, but on the disk and planet it's on a much larger scale.
1782160	1788520	Now beyond migration of the planets, there is also an increased emphasis in solar system
1788520	1791320	formation on scattering.
1791320	1797960	The gaseous material in the disk is collisional, and that will generally produce circular orbits,
1797960	1801360	somewhat like Saturn's rings that we were just looking at.
1801360	1807240	You expect the protoplanets' initial orbit to be circular, and in order to produce elliptical
1807320	1812240	orbits, the protoplanets have to scatter off each other, or there have to be interactions
1812240	1814120	with the disk.
1814120	1821240	These interactions will be chaotic, and you can predict the probability of the various
1821240	1829240	outcomes, but you can't specify exactly which outcome will happen for any situation.
1829240	1835040	This puts an emphasis on the increased role of randomness in the formation of planetary
1835040	1836240	systems.
1836240	1844240	Just like the formation of the moon, the end result may be determined by chance encounters.
1844240	1849240	So looking at these extra-solar planetary systems grants us a whole new perspective
1849240	1851840	on our own solar system.
1851840	1855360	We have learned so much about our planetary neighborhood.
1855360	1860160	Think back on all we've covered in this course, the motions, the orbits, the surfaces, the
1860160	1865760	interiors of the atmospheres, the moons, the rings, the families.
1865760	1870320	We've developed a coherent picture of the structure, formation, and evolution of our
1870320	1872160	solar system.
1872160	1879320	And now, looking at these extra-solar planetary systems, we learn that it may be the exception.
1879320	1887440	We learn, as happens so often in science, just how much more there is to learn.
1888160	1895320	We're really only beginning to see the galactic perspective on planetary systems.
1895320	1901680	And if most planetary systems are not like ours, what does that say about the prospects
1901680	1904080	for life in the universe?
1904080	1907320	Is what makes our solar system special?
1907320	1909800	What enables it to have life?
1909800	1917320	We'll explore that question in our last lecture, a lecture on life in our solar system and
1917320	1918840	beyond.
1918840	1920880	Until then, have a great day.
