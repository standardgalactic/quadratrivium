9560	15280	Science Institute, or STSCI, in Baltimore, Maryland, where he works in the Office of
15280	19840	Public Outreach. Dr. Summers received his undergraduate degree
19840	25560	Summa Cum Laude in physics from Virginia Tech and his master's and doctoral degrees in
25560	32320	astronomy from the University of California at Berkeley. Before joining the STSCI, Dr.
32320	38440	Summers researched cosmology and galaxy formation at Princeton University and Columbia University.
38440	46000	Dr. Summers' work at the STSCI presents the findings of the Hubble Space Telescope and
46000	51240	developments in general astronomy to the public through a variety of media and educational
51240	55960	programs. Dr. Summers specializes in combining research
55960	62440	data and supercomputer simulation with Hollywood-level animation and rendering techniques to create
62440	70000	accurate and aesthetic scientific visualizations. Dr. Summers directed, co-wrote, and created
70000	76840	the 3D visualizations for the IMAX short film Hubble, Galaxies Across Space and Time, which
76840	83600	won the Large Format Cinema Association's Best Short Film Award in 2004. For the 1996
83600	90440	Academy Award-nominated IMAX film Cosmic Voyage, Dr. Summers provided supercomputer data sets,
90440	95440	assisted the scientific visualization team on a four-minute sequence, and served on the
95440	101320	film's Scientific Advisory Committee. As one of only a few professional astronomers
101320	107800	working in outreach, Dr. Summers has expertise that spans a broad range, from public astronomy
107800	114840	presentation to research astrophysics. Dr. Summers also lectures widely to public audiences,
114840	119600	students, and teachers, training to teach at all educational levels.
119600	125160	Dr. Summers prepared the course guidebook that comes with these lectures. The course
125160	130840	guidebook includes a detailed outline of each lecture, a timeline, a glossary, biographical
