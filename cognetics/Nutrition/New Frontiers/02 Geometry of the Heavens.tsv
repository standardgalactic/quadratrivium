0	23280	Hi. In this lecture, we're going to explore creating a scientific model of the solar system.
23280	29920	And a scientific model must be based on observations. We're going to keep it simple and use only
29920	34520	human eye observations, the observations you could do without a telescope. And we're going
34520	40160	to create the kind of model that you could create yourself. We're going to follow the
40160	45760	development of the ancient Greeks as they put together their model of the solar system
45760	52840	and we'll examine the perspective of an Earth-centered universe. The Earth-centered universe is
52840	60000	really the most natural and simplest of model. We call it geocentric, geomeaning Earth, Earth
60000	66920	at the center. And if you just observe the sky, it's the model you would come up with.
66920	74080	This image here shows a time lapse of the sun. We see it rise in the east, we see it
74080	79880	set in the west. It certainly looks like it's circling around Earth. At night, you can go
79880	86280	out and look at the stars. And here's a gorgeous image of stars in the area around the constellation
86280	91760	Orion. But if you look in the poles and you watch the stars over time using a time lapse
91760	99680	of the stars, you can see the stars also make circles in the sky all night long. So the
99680	107360	most natural model is that everything is circling around Earth. So this would be your first initial
107360	112320	model. The Earth would be here at the center and all the rest of the solar system would
112320	118880	be circling around Earth. Now, to make this scientific, we have to add in some specifics.
118880	124320	What are the sizes of the objects, what are their distances and how do they move? The problem
124320	129600	with the geocentric model in modern society is not really with the geocentric model, but
129600	134600	it's with the mythos that has developed around it. We have this idea that the geocentric
134600	141640	model was way too complicated, that the Tomeic system that was developed by the Greeks started
141640	146680	simply and then added in this feature and added in that feature and then needed this
146680	149960	feature and needed that feature and needed this feature and sort of collapsed under its
149960	157080	own weight. This is definitely not true. It's a nice story. It makes us feel good. Oh, we
157080	163160	don't believe such simplistic stuff anymore, but it's a disservice to science education
163160	168600	because the geocentric model has a lot to teach us, not only about the solar system,
168600	175840	but also how you construct a scientific model. The geocentric model and all scientific models
175840	183560	should be judged on whether they can account for observed behavior. Can you explain the
183560	191360	observations of the sky? You also need to be able to predict future behavior. The simplicity
191360	197200	and accuracy of the model that can explain observations and predict future behavior is
197200	205140	really all that's required. One question we'll also examine today is the truth of the model
205140	212720	really necessary. If the model can explain what we see, does it really matter if it corresponds
212720	219800	to reality? We'll start with the basic ideas. Let's just simplify things to the earth, the
219800	227400	sun and the moon. What can we tell by simple observations? One thing we can tell is that
227400	232520	the earth is round. Now, I know many of you were taught that Columbus showed the earth
232520	240160	was round when he sailed across the ocean. He gets way too much credit. Actually, it
240160	246020	was known the earth was round by the ancient Greeks and Aristotle in about 400 BCE could
246020	251860	offer several different arguments for why the earth must be round. Aristotle had this
251860	257620	thing for spheres, but he had some scientific arguments behind them. The easiest way to see
257620	263980	it is take a look at a lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipse is when the moon passes into the shadow
263980	269700	of earth. Here's an image that shows a time lapse. On the left hand side, you see the
269700	275940	full moon. As it progresses to the right hand side, the shadow of earth slowly creeps across
275940	283500	the surface of the moon. What you notice when you look at this is that the shadow of earth
283500	289860	is curved. If you look at many lunar eclipses and many parts of earth shadow, you find that
289860	296900	it is always curved. Aristotle reasoned that the only shape that would always cast a curved
296900	304540	shadow would be a sphere. Thus, he concluded that the earth was round. The moon can also
304660	311420	be used to tell us about the relative distances to it and to the sun. If you watch the moon
311420	317780	over a period of weeks, you see it change its phases. It goes from a crescent moon up
317780	324220	to a half moon to a gibbous moon to a full moon and then backwards through those same
324220	331540	things gibbous, half and to crescent. This is caused by the changing of the angles between
331540	336820	our direction to the moon and our direction to the sun. Basically, the lit part of the
336820	346380	moon varies according to the moon's orbit around earth. If you look at the half moon
346380	354620	and think about it, it actually is a special time because when the moon is half lit, that
354620	361460	means the sun is perpendicular to the moon, that there's a 90 degree angle between our
361460	367100	direction to the moon and the moon's direction to the sun. When you have a right angle, you
367100	373940	then get a right triangle and you can use trigonometry to deduce answers. Here's a simplistic
373940	380860	drawing of a triangle that would be formed when the moon is at half phase. The earth looking
380860	385500	directly at the moon sees the moon at half phase, the sun would be at 90 degrees. In
385500	392220	order to measure the sizes of the lengths of this triangle, it suffices simply to measure
392220	398100	the angle on the sky between the moon and the sun. If you can measure that angle, which
398100	403420	is going to be very large, almost 90 degrees itself, but if you can measure that angle,
403420	408980	you can then get the scale of this triangle and you can understand the relative distance
408980	415100	to the moon compared to the distance to the sun. Aristarchus was able to do this in about
415100	421780	270 BCE and I note that this was just after Euclid's Elements, the textbook of Geometry,
421780	428220	was published at about 300 BCE. He got his angular measure a little bit wrong and estimated
428220	434700	that it was about 20 times that the sun was 20 times farther away than the moon. Real
434740	444220	answer is it's about 400, but the method, the geometrical method was sound. We can get
444220	452020	the relative sizes of the moon and the sun by looking at solar eclipses. This is an image
452020	457700	of a partial solar eclipse and here instead of the earth shadow going across the moon,
457700	464980	we have the moon passing between earth and the sun and you can see the limb of the moon
464980	470660	passing in front of the sun. It turns out, and it's a very lucky coincidence, that the
470660	475700	angular size of the moon on the sky is about the same as the angular size of the sun on
475700	482220	the sky and when they pass directly in front of each other, we get a total solar eclipse
482220	488460	and this is a spectacular event and during that time the entire disk of the sun is blocked
488460	493700	out and you can see this wonderful corona around the sun, this amazing stuff that you
493700	500900	can't see at any other time, at least not with the human eye. The geometry of the solar
500900	505980	eclipse would look like this. Earth is over here, the moon is blocking the light from
505980	512500	the sun and we can form triangles again. There are two similar triangles here, the
512500	519380	earth and the diameter of the moon and the earth to the diameter of the sun. They form
519380	525220	similar triangles and because you can get a total solar eclipse where the moon just blocks
525220	532300	out the sun, that means that the size ratio of those diameters is the same as their distance
532300	540620	ratio. If the sun is 400 times farther away than the moon, then that means it's also 400
540620	549580	times bigger than the moon. Lunar eclipse can be used to get the relative sizes of the earth
549580	557380	and moon. If we take a look at this image, it shows you the full sequence of a lunar
557380	564260	eclipse. The moon starts out not being an earth shadow, it slowly passes through earth
564260	571020	shadow and then emerges from earth shadow and if you time the length of the lunar eclipse,
571020	576340	you can estimate the size of earth shadow and specifically you can estimate the size
576340	581900	of the earth shadow relative to the size of the moon. If you take a look at the geometry
581900	588100	of it, it's really just the same thing as before, the sun casting its light, the earth
588100	593100	creating a shadow and the moon moving through that shadow.
593100	600660	Parastarcus looked at this and he estimated that the size of earth shadow was about three
600660	606100	times the size of the moon. The real answer is that it's about four times the size of
606100	613540	the moon but the method again was sound and you're able to then tell that earth is about
613540	619420	four times larger than the moon by examining lunar eclipses.
619420	626260	The last piece you need to complete this basic model is the size of earth and you can get
626260	632900	this with a remarkable observation by when the sun is directly overhead. A man named
632900	639700	Eratosthenes was able to do this and he lived in Alexandria and he noticed that on a certain
639700	647420	day in Alexandria you could look down an entire deep well and see the bottom. The light from
647420	652940	the sun would go all the way to the bottom of a deep well. That meant the sun was directly
652940	661820	overhead. On that same day in a nearby city named Sain, the sun was not directly overhead.
661820	668780	If you put a vertical rod in the ground you could measure the shadow that it made. Looking
668780	674300	at the geometry of it you can see that the length of the shadow at Sain would enable
674300	680940	you to measure the angle between Alexandria and Sain along the circumference of the earth.
680940	686540	Then knowing the distance between Alexandria and Sain you could calculate the full circumference
686540	692260	of the earth and he was able to do this and get a very accurate estimate for the size
692260	698820	of earth. Combining these pieces of information you get the size of earth then you get the
698820	703700	size of the moon and the size of the sun and from that you get the distances to the moon
703700	710540	and sun and you end up with basically looking at eclipses and observations of the moon and
710540	717540	sun you could have a full model of earth, moon and sun. To make this into a more complete
717540	723340	scientific model you would also want to look at motions and motions can provide a basic
723340	730100	way on how to order the distances to objects the sun, the moon and the planets. If we look
730100	737340	at the periods of the various objects the moon goes through its phases in about 27 days
737340	744540	about a month, it's the origin of the month, Mercury about three months, Venus goes through
744540	752980	its period in about three quarters of a year, the sun in one year, Mars about two years,
752980	761220	Jupiter 12 years and Saturn about 30 years. Though we don't know at this point from the
761220	766020	human eye observations the distances to the planets, we can get the distances to the moon
766020	774220	and the sun, we can estimate which one is further away than the other from their motions.
774220	780500	It's really just basic idea that something nearby will move across your field of view
780500	786220	at a faster speed than something far away will tend to appear that it's moving slower.
786220	792620	So the basic structure, the ordering of the planets was determined by the periods and
792620	799300	so in the geocentric model the earth was at the center and the planets were around
799300	808100	it moving at slower and slower speeds, the moon and Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter
808100	815740	and Saturn. Now I've drawn them here as circles and that would be the basic way you would
815740	821860	model them but the motion that they make across the sky is not constant, it's not uniform
821860	828140	circular motion. The speed varies along its orbit and we can tell that by looking at the
828140	836300	sun's motion. The sun's motion can be measured by the seasons and the seasons are basically
836300	841780	spring, summer, fall and winter. They are measured by the equinoxes and the solstice,
841780	846980	the equinox being the start of spring, the infernal equinox being the start of spring,
846980	851420	the autumnal equinox being the start of fall, the summer solstice being the start of summer
851420	855700	and the winter solstice being the start of winter. And they, as you can see, they occur
855700	862380	in March, June, September and December, approximately three months apart and if you look at that
862380	868700	in a diagram of the sun's motion around earth, the solstices are opposite each other on the
868700	873060	circle and the equinoxes are opposite each other on the circle and they divide the circle
873060	881380	into four equal parts. If the sun were undergoing uniform circular motion then the length of
881500	889860	each season would be about the same, one quarter of a year or about 91 days. However, when
889860	897740	you look at the measured time for the seasons, you can see that they are not the same. In
897740	904020	this table I've added in the length of the seasons and spring is 92.8 days, summer is
904020	913700	93.7 days, fall is 89.8 days and winter is 89 days. The length of the seasons is not
913700	920260	the same and therefore the sun cannot be going through uniform circular motion. How are we
920260	925900	going to model that? Well, we're going to look at the model created by a man named Ptolemy
925900	933140	and this is a drawing of him and it is called the Ptolemaic model but that's really giving
933140	939700	him a little too much credit. What Ptolemy did is he took about 500 years of Greek astronomical
939700	947340	knowledge and organized it and put it into a systematic presentation. He based the geometry
947340	953700	of it upon that founding Euclid's elements and we're going to look at how they solved
953700	961340	these ideas of creating motion. So, if we look at the sun's motion and the real seasons we
961340	969740	can see that summer is much too long for this arc. This arc needs to be longer and winter
969740	975420	is too short for this arc. Winter needs to be shorter. How would you reconcile that?
975420	980060	Well, they came up with the idea that we're going to preserve uniform circular motion
980060	987560	for the sun but we're going to move earth off center. If you take earth and shift it
987560	993080	off center and then the solstices and the equinoxes shift with it, you can see that
993080	999240	you create a much longer arc for summer and a much shorter arc for winter and you can
999240	1007240	justify the lengths of the seasons by uniform circular motion seen by an observer who's
1007240	1016320	not at the center. Now, this is a little bit exaggerated here but we have a more accurate
1016320	1024000	model to show it to you. This is the motion of the sun in an eccentric circle. The observer
1024000	1031160	is located here at O and the center of the circle is actually at Z. The green line is
1031160	1037960	the motion of the sun circling around Z and the blue line would be the mean sun, the sun
1037960	1045640	as if it were orbiting around the observer at O. Now, if I put this in motion, you can
1045640	1052360	see that the green line and the blue line move at different speeds. When, if I pause
1052360	1060560	it here, when the sun is closer to the observer, the green line catches up with the blue line.
1060560	1068560	It moves faster and actually gets ahead of it. Then, as the sun gets further away from
1068560	1074240	the observer, the blue line catches up to the green line and the sun observed in an eccentric
1074240	1082640	circle moves slower. This is what the eccentric circle allowed us to do. It allowed for the
1082640	1088080	sun to move faster when it was closer to the earth and move slower when it was further
1088080	1094840	away from the earth. So, the eccentric circle could explain the motion of the sun. What
1094840	1101080	about the motion of the moon? Well, it didn't quite work for the motion of the moon. For
1101080	1107200	that, we needed a different geometrical construct called epicycle and deferent. These are really
1107200	1113360	cool words. They're a little bit scary, but they really are a concept you already know.
1113360	1121360	If you think about a star and a planet orbiting around that star and then a moon orbiting
1121360	1128080	around that planet, you already know epicycle deferent because this construct of one object
1128080	1133600	orbiting another, orbiting a third, is exactly what epicycle deferent is about. We just have
1133600	1139560	to take this diagram and re-label it. For epicycle deferent, we have earth at the center,
1139560	1145880	the deferent circle is the first circle around the earth, and the epicycle circle is the
1145880	1151040	second circle around the point on the deferent circle. We're doing uniform circular motion
1151040	1158480	both in the deferent and in the epicycle, and this was used by Tommy in order to create
1158480	1167240	a basic moon model. We have that for you here. The observer, again, is at O. C is the point
1167240	1176600	moving around the deferent circle, and M is the point moving around the epicycle circle.
1176600	1186000	You can see that it makes an interesting motion, but if I only put turn on the trail, because
1186000	1190760	when you think about it, epicycle and deferent could produce some very complex motions, but
1190760	1196280	the motion done for the moon here, as the trail makes its first orbit, you can see produces
1196280	1202960	a relatively smooth orbit, relatively smooth here, and you're able to create a nice orbit
1202960	1211560	for the moon. Unfortunately, it doesn't explain the full motion of the moon. A single epicycle
1211560	1216160	really couldn't explain the speeding up and slowing down of the moon through its orbit
1216160	1222560	that we observed. Instead, he found he needed to use two epicycles. This is the diagram
1222560	1229360	of Tommy's full moon model, and it's a little complicated. We have the observer here at O.
1229360	1237200	We have the first deferent circle at Z. We have the epicycle around Z, C, which is also
1237200	1243640	serving as a second deferent circle, and then we finally have the epicycle M moving around
1243640	1250560	the point C. The strange thing about this model is that the interior epicycle is rotating
1250560	1256000	in the opposite direction of the exterior epicycle, and so the motion is kind of funky.
1256160	1260640	As a matter of fact, they refer to it as the crank mechanism necessary to get the moon's
1260640	1269760	motion. Let me turn that on. Now you can see the motion of the moon on the exterior epicycle,
1269760	1274840	and then it moving around the interior epicycle, and it's a little bit complex. If I turn
1274840	1281320	on the trail, you see that once again we have a relatively smooth orbit, even though it's
1281360	1292360	got a relatively complex behavior behind it. Okay, so you can see that the moon was modeled
1292360	1298240	by a double epicycle deferent because it had a much larger variation in its motion between
1298240	1304400	its slowest point and its fastest point in its motion. The interesting thing about the
1304400	1310680	epicycle deferent is that it's actually equivalent to the eccentric circle. You can construct
1310680	1317240	an epicycle deferent to exactly match the eccentric circle, and I go back to the sun
1317240	1321440	model, and you'll notice down here I have a slider that I can go to the eccentric version
1321440	1326760	of it, and so this is the eccentric version of the sun, but I can also take the slider
1326760	1334240	over to the epicycle version of the sun and produce exactly the same motion. A properly
1334240	1339880	configured epicycle deferent in which the rotation of the epicycle exactly matches the
1339880	1345240	rotation around the deferent can produce the same motion, and you can see that clearly
1345240	1352240	when I put the slider halfway in between, and in that case you can see both the epicycle
1353720	1359360	and the eccentric circle produce the same motion for the sun. So the epicycle deferent
1359360	1366360	is sort of like a generalization of the eccentric circle. There is still one more geometrical
1367120	1373620	construct that we need to finish off Ptolemy's model. It's called equant motion, and it's
1373620	1379680	sort of like an extension of the eccentric circle. This diagram here shows you circular
1379680	1386280	motion, and the motion, the time it takes to go between any one of these sections is
1386280	1393280	the same. That's basic circular motion. Then we can think about having that motion
1393640	1399680	respect to an off-center point. If we move the center of the circular motion off from
1399680	1406680	the center of the circle, then you can see these top arcs are shorter than these longer
1406920	1413840	arcs, and if it still takes the same amount of time to go between any of these two points,
1413840	1419520	then the planet must be moving slower between T1 and T2, for example, than it would be moving
1419520	1425280	between T4 and T5, because it has a shorter distance to cover between T1 and T2, and a
1425280	1431780	longer distance to cover between T4 and T5. Equant motion extend this just like a little
1431780	1438780	bit further by also moving the observer off-center, and so the center of the circle is here in
1439320	1445000	this gray dot, the center of the circular motion is this unfilled dot, and the observer
1445160	1451720	is here in this blue dot, the result of which is the equant motion observed by the observer
1451720	1457040	has a very strong differential from one side to the other. You can see that the distance
1457040	1463720	here between T1 and T2 is much, much shorter than the distance between T4 and T5. Again,
1463720	1468360	when the object is closer to the observer, it moves faster, and when it's further from
1468360	1474240	the observer, it moves slower. So we've got the sun and the moon, and now we're going
1474280	1481280	to add in the planets. The planets were modeled with the equant motion and the epicycle deferent.
1481880	1487080	You need the epicycle deferent because you've got to explain the strange motion of the planets.
1487080	1492880	The derivation of the word planets is wanderer. They were the objects that wandered across
1492880	1499380	the sky. The sun and the moon always moved in the same direction across the sky and
1499380	1506380	never in the reverse direction. The planets did not. Mercury and Venus, shown here, would
1509060	1513500	always be found near the sun. Whenever you see a picture of Mercury or Venus, you're
1513500	1518180	going to see it at twilight, either in the evening or in the morning, because it's always
1518180	1524680	found within a certain angular distance from the sun, Mercury about 28 degrees and Venus
1524680	1531400	about 46 degrees. And their wandering motion is that they would wander back and forth on
1531400	1537000	the sky around the point of the sun. You would never find them opposite the sun. They would
1537000	1543400	always be over in the same region of the sun, wandering back and forth. The other planets,
1543400	1548880	Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, they showed a different kind of wandering motion, something we call
1548880	1555520	retrograde motion. And here's a diagram of the path of Mars in a retrograde motion.
1555520	1560840	And it is moving across the sky in the normal direction, same direction as the sun and the
1560840	1567120	moon move across the sky. And then it slows down and stops at what we call a stationary
1567120	1574120	point. And then it backs up and goes backwards relative to the stars, hits another stationary
1574880	1581880	point, stops and then moves forward again. And this retrograde motion was found to occur
1582320	1587800	when the planets were opposite the position of the sky of the sun. If the sun was over
1587800	1594800	here and Mars was over here, that's the time that Mars would go through retrograde motion.
1595000	1601360	And so with the equant and the epicycle deferent, you're able to model these motions for Mercury
1601360	1608360	and Venus and for Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. This is a model of the motion for Mars, Jupiter
1608480	1615480	and Saturn. And the observer here is at O. The center of the deferent circle is at D.
1617560	1624560	The equant motion offset is E. The center of the motion on the deferent circle is C.
1625300	1632300	And the planet is moving at P. Let me put this in motion for you. And you can see it
1632640	1639640	basically looks like the basic epicycle deferent. You can't really tell that the center of the
1639640	1643520	circular motion is at the equant point. It looks pretty much like a standard epicycle
1643520	1650520	deferent. The important point for these exterior planets is that when they come in the inside
1651520	1658520	part of their epicycle, they make that little curly Q. This is the time when you would see
1658800	1665800	the retrograde motion. The proper ratio of motion around the epicycle with motion around
1665800	1672300	the deferent produces these little curly Q's and produces the retrograde motion on the
1672300	1679300	sky. It also shows you why Tom only is famous. He invented Spirograph and he invented Spirograph
1680800	1687800	about 2,000 years before it came out as a kid's toy. Now this is how they produce the
1690040	1697040	entire model of the solar system in the geocentric model using these three basic geometric constructs.
1698160	1704960	The eccentric circle, the epicycle and deferent, and equant motion. And so to put it all together
1705080	1711840	we have a complete model of the Tamaic solar system. And so here we look at this and on
1711840	1717240	the exterior we see the sphere of the stars, which is basically unmoving it in this. And
1717240	1722560	the blue represents Saturn, the purple represents Jupiter, the red represents Mars. And we've
1722560	1727160	got a wonderful slider down here where we can move in closer because the scale of this
1727160	1732800	is much, much too large to look at in one thing. And we move down, we see the sun here
1732840	1739840	in blue, we see Venus here in green, going in further, we see Mercury here in red, and
1742560	1749560	the moon here in blue, and way down deep at the center we find the Earth. And the person
1749720	1756220	who created this model was cute. He added in Ptolemy's map of the Earth. This is a map
1756260	1763260	produced by Ptolemy as a texture onto the Earth. So let's back out a little bit and put
1764860	1770860	this in motion. So here you can see the moon working with its crank mechanism and its double
1770860	1778360	epicycle deferent. And as we pull out, you see Mercury in red moving with its epicycle
1778360	1785360	deferent. And then to Venus in green working with its epicycle deferent and the sun. And
1786340	1793340	moving in its eccentric circle. One thing to notice is that the epicycles for Mercury
1795140	1802060	and Venus, Mercury in red here and Venus in green here, are always aligned with the sun.
1802060	1808380	The motion on the epicycle allowed for this bounded elongation of Mercury and Venus, that
1808380	1813020	the planets would be able to go in front of the sun and behind the sun as long as the
1813020	1818220	center of the epicycle circle always pointed towards the sun. So the model naturally is
1818220	1825220	tied to the sun and explains the abounded elongation. We move further out. You see Mars
1829980	1836980	in red, Jupiter in purple, and Saturn in blue. Let me speed it up a little bit. And you can
1836980	1843980	see the eccentric motion of the epicycle, the sort of the curly cue motion. The other
1843980	1849980	thing you want to notice, if I pause it here, is that the position of Mars, Jupiter, and
1849980	1856980	Saturn in their epicycles are tied exactly to the position of the sun relative to earth.
1857740	1864740	That allows the retrograde motion to occur at opposition. Put it back in motion again.
1865740	1871740	And you can see that the motion on their epicycles is tied to the sun's motion around the earth.
1872740	1878740	When viewed in this manner, the full Ptolemaic model looks very complex. But the secret is
1878740	1884740	that it's complexity derived from simplicity. Remember that there are just three geometric
1884740	1890740	constructs that underlight all the motions observed in this model. And in that manner,
1891740	1896740	and in many other respects, this should be considered a triumph. Not just because you
1896740	1902740	can create a complex model out of simple ideas, but because this was the first time that the
1902740	1908740	motions of the heavens had been scientifically predicted. And it could not just predict the
1908740	1913740	motions of the planets and the sun and the moon, it could also predict other events like
1913740	1918740	eclipses, which had never been able to be predicted before. Ptolemy did not think this was
1919740	1926740	a real physical model, but rather just a mathematical device for predicting. He entitled
1926740	1933740	his book, Mathematical Systematic Treatise. It was later called AmmaGest by Arabic astronomers.
1934740	1939740	This geocentric model provided accurate enough predictions that it remained the standard for
1939740	1946740	1,500 years. The only work I know of that lasted longer was Euclid's Elements, which
1946740	1951740	was a standard textbook of astronomy well through the 19th century. Matter of fact, the
1951740	1957740	geocentric model is the model you would derive today if you just based your observations on
1957740	1963740	what the human eye could see, you would come up with a model like this. And that shows a
1963740	1969740	basic tenet that underlies astronomy and all of science, that the universe is understandable,
1969740	1978740	that it's explainable, and that it is predictable. That is the construct of science. However,
1978740	1987740	this model leaves one question open. Is mathematical prediction enough? A scientific model that
1987740	1993740	can explain the observations is great, but one that actually represents reality would be
1993740	2000740	better. Does a model actually have to represent reality, or is just the mathematical prediction
2000740	2006740	enough? We'll explore that question in our next lecture. Until then, have a great day.
