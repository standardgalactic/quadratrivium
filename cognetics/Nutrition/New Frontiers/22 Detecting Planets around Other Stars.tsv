0	22780	In this lecture, we are going to discuss how to look for planets around other stars.
22780	28380	Now this is a quite difficult observation because stars are really, really, really far
28380	35580	away and they're also very small in comparison to their distance.
35580	40820	This is an image of the largest nearby galaxy called the Andromeda galaxy.
40820	44740	Now it is two and a half million light years away.
44740	49300	However, it's also a hundred thousand light years across.
49300	53680	And that is large enough that even at two and a half million light years, it's stretched
53680	57220	out about three degrees across our sky.
57260	62680	That's about six and a half times the apparent diameter of the full moon.
62680	70520	Stars that are even just a few light years away appear only as a point of light in our sky.
70520	78980	So seeing the details of most stars requires resolution well beyond today's optical telescopes.
78980	83080	We can only image stars in a few special cases.
83080	91560	This 1995 image from Hubble was the first direct image of a star other than the sun.
91560	98880	And it was only possible because the star's atmosphere extends one thousand times farther
98880	101600	than our own sun's atmosphere.
101600	110880	If Betelgeuse were in place of the sun, then Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter would
110880	115040	all be orbiting inside its atmosphere.
115040	126920	So generally, we can only see stars if they are very, very, very big and or very near.
126920	133280	If it is that hard to see a star, then seeing planets around it is going to be more difficult
133280	138800	because planets are smaller, so they'll require even a higher resolution to see, and they
138800	145640	are fainter so that the light can be buried within the glare of the star.
145640	153360	I find it therefore amazing that we do have some direct detections of planets.
153360	159800	This is an infrared image of a star 2M1207A.
159800	163320	Well actually, it's not really a star.
163320	168520	It's a brown dwarf, sort of an almost star, bigger than a planet but smaller than a full
168520	169960	grown star.
169960	174840	The brown dwarf has 25 times the mass of Jupiter.
174840	179680	And if you look in the lower left, you see this tiny little spot here.
179680	185160	This is a Jupiter mass planet of five Jupiter masses.
185160	190600	Now this is only visible because first of all, the brown dwarf is faint.
190600	196520	Second of all, the planet to star contrast is generally better in the infrared, but most
196520	201360	importantly is because it's at a very wide separation.
201360	205960	This five Jupiter mass planet is at 55 astronomical units.
205960	208400	That's out beyond the Kuiper Belt.
208400	215280	But this is the first direct image of a planet around another almost star.
215280	220560	However, it's not really the type of planetary system that we want to see.
220560	227120	Many planets in our solar system would be lost within the glare of even a brown dwarf.
227120	232440	Now there are a couple other direct images and they're all of similar character.
232440	236640	Planets out at very large distances from small objects.
236640	244000	So direct imaging won't become a general technique without significant advances in our telescopes.
244600	251360	Instead, we can examine a star and look for indirect evidence of planets.
251360	258360	Now, do you remember that the center of the Earth-Moon system was not at the center of the Earth?
258360	265240	That as the Moon orbits around Earth, Earth wobbles around the center of mass of the system?
265240	268960	The same thing is true for stars and planets.
269000	274320	The center of our solar system is not at the center of our Sun.
274320	279600	The Sun also wobbles while the planets orbit, mainly Jupiter.
279600	284720	Jupiter's mass pulls the Sun and causes it to wobble just a little bit.
284720	291720	Now for an extra solar planet, if the planet is large enough and orbiting close enough to its star,
291720	294320	then its star will wobble.
294360	300280	And if that wobble is large enough, we could see it in the motion of the star.
300280	308800	We call this astrometry, and here is a diagram of it, that normally we see stars move across the sky.
308800	311120	This is called their proper motion.
311120	317520	But if we measure a position of the star over the years and we see that proper motion instead of moving straight,
317520	323560	it starts to wiggle up and down, that would be evidence of a planet.
323560	326760	And the point is that it must be a periodic motion.
326760	331480	It doesn't have to be an absolutely perfect sine curve, but it does need to be a periodic motion,
331480	335680	because that's how planets would orbit around the stars.
335680	342400	So success in astrometry requires that you have a nearby star, so that the motion will be observable,
342400	346240	and the larger the planet you've got, well then the larger the motion,
346240	352000	and the closer the planet orbits into that star, excuse me, then the larger the motion.
352000	356160	So again, this is not really a general technique.
356160	362280	There have been a couple astrometric planet results, and some astronomers think they're quite solid,
362280	366400	although some of them think they're not quite 100% proven.
366400	370600	I'll give you one example in the next lecture.
370600	379040	So if you can't easily see the star's position changes, all that's left to examine is the light from the star.
379080	383440	Now, how would a planet affect the star's light?
383440	389520	The simplest idea would be an eclipse, or more properly called a transit.
389520	394520	Here is a time-lapse image of Venus transiting the sun.
394520	400320	You can see all of these small dark disks across the bottom of the sun
400320	405560	are the planet Venus getting between us and the view of the sun.
405600	411560	A tiny portion of the sun's light is blocked by Venus at this time.
411560	419240	Now imagine the same thing for an extra solar planet passing in front of its star.
419240	421360	Here is a movie to illustrate it.
421360	426120	The graph at the bottom of the light curve is the brightness of the star versus time.
426120	432600	So as the planet passes in front of the star, the light from the star drops down,
432640	434960	and while it's in front of the star, it remains constant,
434960	440440	and then when it goes away from being in front of the star, the brightness goes back to normal.
440440	445760	And if we have sense of enough detectors for a bright enough nearby star,
445760	448280	we can measure that change in the light.
448280	453840	We've found the change in light would be on order 1 or 2% at most.
453840	459640	And that way we can determine how big an object is blocking the light
459680	464360	and figure out how big a planet is transiting in front of that star.
464360	471520	The key again here is that it must be periodic, that it happens over and over again,
471520	478080	seeing multiple times will convince you that it's a planet causing the transit.
478080	481400	The problem here is that this is a chance alignment.
481400	486480	How many times are we going to get a planet just passing in front of the star from our point of view?
486520	490120	A lot of the time it's going to be passing around it.
490120	496160	So in order to find these transits, we need to search many, many stars.
496160	499080	So that's just what we do.
499080	502800	Here is an image from the Sweeps project.
502800	508200	This is the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search.
508200	516440	And what they did is they looked in this field and there are about 150,000 stars in this field.
516440	520880	And about half of them would be useful to search for transiting planets.
520880	528400	They collected 520 images over a week and put together the light curves of all these stars.
528400	532800	From all of those observations and all of those light curves,
532800	537240	they found 16 candidates that might be hot Jupiters.
537240	540080	Because remember they only observed for a week.
540080	544000	And so these planets had to orbit around very quickly.
544080	548160	16 out of 100,000.
548160	551320	And they're only just candidates.
551320	555000	So you need longer term monitoring or spectroscopy.
555000	560160	You can need more than just a week's worth of observations to really know that they are true.
560160	563440	So this is a very low efficiency technique.
563440	571320	However, it would not be that hard with computers to monitor tens or hundreds of millions of stars.
571400	576280	This would be similar to the automated searches that we do for Kuiper Belt objects.
576280	584120	There are projects already in progress that should net thousands of planets using this transiting technique.
584120	589360	Transits so far have only discovered a small percentage of the extrasolar planets.
589360	594360	But they will become more important in the near future.
594360	598600	Now, while most transits decrease the light of a star,
598680	603280	in some cases it can actually increase the light of the star.
603280	607880	This is called microlensing and it comes from general relativity.
607880	611400	Remember, there's a three word summary for general relativity.
611400	614840	Mass warps space.
614840	617040	Here's an illustration of it.
617040	625280	The mass represented by the yellow ball in this image is warping the fabric of space represented by the grid in this image.
625280	633920	The presence of matter changes the structure of space and light waves passing through that space.
633920	637720	When they pass through curved space, they change direction.
637720	644880	Light curves through warped space and in particular it curves inward around the mass.
644880	651560	In this way, gravity can act like a lens and focus the light.
651560	660880	Here is a diagram of microlensing and on the left hand side we have a star just about to pass in front of another star.
660880	664800	The light of that background star is normal.
664800	669640	In the center part, as the foreground star passes directly in front of the background star,
669640	678400	for a brief time the light of the background star is amplified, it's brightened by this gravitational lens.
678400	684240	And then when it passes away, the light of the background star returns to normal.
684240	694200	This is gravitational microlensing and the shape of the light curve, the brightening of that background star allows us to recognize these events.
694200	700320	Now, what happens if the foreground star has a planet around it?
700320	704720	Then you can get two bumps in the light curve.
704760	712040	This is a light curve from the microlensing event Ogil BLG-071.
712040	719400	It represents about two months of observations and if you look at the top of the light curve, you see a double peak.
719400	732000	This indicates that there were two lensing objects and the varying heights of those two peaks and the timing between those two peaks shows that the second object is a planet.
732040	734360	It could of course be a double star, right?
734360	739240	But the way you analyze this, it comes up and it has to be a planet.
739240	751080	However, even more so than with planets transiting their own star, when you're trying to get a star transiting in front of another star, it requires a near exact alignment.
751080	755080	So again, you have to use a needle in a haystack approach.
755080	761800	You have to study hundreds of thousands of stars in order to find just a few events.
761800	768200	And there's a problem with this for planetary studies because the lensing only occurs once.
768200	772840	So there's no chance for follow-up and you can't verify it independently.
772840	782360	So it's while these microlensing planets do exist, it's somewhat unsatisfactory for detailed study.
782360	786520	So far, I've discussed some low probability planet finding techniques.
786520	792440	And if these were the only techniques, we would not have found many planets in the galaxy.
792440	798000	The dominant technique for finding planets depends upon the idea of Doppler shift.
798000	800520	Now you're all familiar with the idea of Doppler shift.
800520	806760	It's the reason why a race car has a higher pitch sound when it's approaching and a lower pitch sound when it's going away.
806760	810080	It sounds niiiiiuuuu, right?
810080	815440	This is just a change in wavelength due to motion.
815440	821560	So if a wave emitter is stationary, the waves will go out in circles around it.
821560	826960	And as more waves go out, they will continue to create circles.
826960	834160	And you'll end up with sort of a bullseye pattern of these circles, of these waves being emitted around the emitter.
834160	841000	And the important point is that these wavelengths are seen to be the same in all directions.
841000	851760	Now however, if the wave emitter is moving, the first wave is emitted as before, but it moves a bit before it emits the second wave.
851760	858360	The first wave is still centered on the old position, and the second wave is now offset.
858360	860840	It's centered on the new position.
860840	868160	The third wave will be offset from both the second and the first, and so on, and so on.
868160	874480	The result is that the wavelength you observe is not uniform in all directions.
874480	883400	You will have shorter wavelengths in front of the direction of motion of the emitter and longer wavelengths behind it.
883400	892360	Thus, the change in wavelength you observe for an object can tell you about the motion of that object.
892400	902160	And a star that is wobbling due to a planet has wobbling around a little bit of motion will show Doppler shift that we can observe.
902160	912360	The first extrasolar planets discovered were not around a normal star, but they were around a stellar remnant, something called a pulsar.
912360	917080	Now, when a high mass star dies, it explodes as a supernova.
917080	920680	It basically blows its guts across space.
920680	923480	It's really quite pretty.
923480	931200	This is the supernova remnant called the crab nebula, and most of the star is blown into interstellar space.
931200	938280	However, the core collapses to a neutron star, and a neutron star is very, very dense.
938280	939520	How dense?
939520	943000	Well, at the Hayden Planetarium, we came up with this.
943040	951680	To achieve the density of a neutron star, you simply cram a herd of 50 million elephants into a fimble.
951680	953720	That's dense.
953720	960200	The pulsar also has a very high magnetic field, as shown in this diagram.
960200	970840	These green loops are meant to represent the magnetic field, and generally it will emit radio waves along the poles of the magnetic field.
970880	980280	Further, the conservation of angular momentum makes these things spin really, really, really fast, up to thousands of times per second.
980280	988080	And so if the pole sweeps through our line of sight, we'll see regular bursts of radio emission.
988080	993520	And that's what we call the pulsar, these regular pulses of radio emission.
993520	996000	And these pulsars are exotic objects.
996040	1002240	They're the dense remnant of a supernova explosion, and they have these extremely precise radio pulses.
1002240	1008880	So any motion of the pulsar will show up as Doppler shift in those pulses.
1008880	1015080	The signals of planets, and even objects as small as asteroids, would be relatively easy to find.
1015080	1019600	But why would one expect planets around a pulsar?
1019600	1026480	Well, we found not one, but three planets around the pulsar, 1257 plus 12.
1026480	1030960	And these were the first extrasolar planets ever discovered.
1030960	1040520	It threw astronomers quite a curveball, because if planets existed before the supernova, they would not have survived the supernova to be there afterwards.
1040520	1046480	And there are some possible ways these planets could have formed, but it's certainly not the standard scenario.
1046480	1049800	And these are certainly not the planets we were hoping to find.
1049800	1058280	I'm still not sure what to make of them, but let the record show they are there, and they were the first to be found.
1058280	1068360	Shortly afterwards, Doppler spectroscopy found planets closer to our expectations, although still not really what we wanted.
1068360	1073000	Now, remember that white light can be spread out by a prism.
1073000	1082920	Here's a diagram. Actually, it's a picture of white light being spread out by a prism into the rainbow of colors, and this rainbow of colors is called a spectrum.
1082920	1094920	Now, if you look really, really, really close at the sun spectrum, you see this, and this is the sun spectrum taken out into multiple lines, and then going down the page with each of the lines.
1094920	1098640	And you can see all of these dark regions.
1098640	1112680	These are spectral lines. These indicate the elements in the sun's atmosphere, and these elements absorb specific wavelengths, so they tell us the composition of the sun's atmosphere.
1112680	1126360	Similar spectral lines to these are found in the spectra of all stars, and if the star is moving, these wavelength markers in the spectrum will show Doppler shifts.
1126400	1141680	So if the star is wobbling due to a planet, these spectral lines will wobble back and forth. There will be periodic Doppler shifts, and finding those is what we call Doppler spectroscopy.
1141680	1151360	The problem is that these shifts are incredibly tiny. They're way too small to see reliably for any one line.
1151360	1157360	So the solution is to use many, many lines and statistics in order to see the pattern.
1157360	1174360	The big idea that got this ball rolling on this technique was that you put a cell of iodine in the light path, and iodine has many spectral lines, and those spectral lines are then imprinted on top of the star's spectra.
1174360	1189360	These iodine lines serve as reference lines, and you can measure the motion of the star's lines relative to these iodine lines, and using a lot of statistics, you can measure extremely small shifts.
1189360	1199360	The result is basically a graph. It's the velocity shift of these lines over time.
1199360	1219360	Here is one for the star HD9407 that shows no planet, and you can see that the velocity, well, basically is a scatter around a mean, and we've subtracted out the mean, so the mean here is zero, and you can see it just, it's up and down a little bit, but there's no particular pattern to it.
1219360	1235360	Here is one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, 51 Pegasi, and this has a very strong signal. The velocity of the star shifts significantly. It varies between plus 50 meters per second to minus 50 meters per second.
1235360	1253360	The question is, is this periodic? So after some analysis, you can find a nice oscillating fit, and the fit shown here is for a half Jupiter mass planet in a 4.2 day orbit.
1253360	1264360	Now, these plots versus time like this, I've never find them fully convincing. I mean, it seems like if you put in enough oscillations, you can sort of fit any scatter to the data.
1264360	1285360	So if you fold the data into what we call a periodogram, you can then plot the velocity versus the phase of the oscillation, and here you get a much more convincing fit. This is more satisfying to say, I, yes, I can really see the planet moving around the star.
1285360	1299360	So the period of the fit is the period of the planet's orbit. And if we remember Kepler's third law, the period also tells you the semi-major axis, because the period is proportional to the semi-major axis.
1300360	1316360	The amplitude of the curve, the amount it goes up and down, is a combination of both the planet mass and the semi-major axis, how massive it is and how close it is to the star. But since you already know the semi-major axis, you can get the mass of the star.
1316360	1328360	The shape of the curve indicates the orbit eccentricity. Here the result is a nice sine curve, and it indicates a nearly circular orbit.
1328360	1343360	However, that's not always true. This star, 16-signy B, also shows a planet, but one in a rather elliptical orbit. This is definitely not a sine curve, but it is definitely periodic.
1343360	1362360	Now if you remember Kepler's second law, a planet moves fast when it's near the star and much slower farther away. That speed change produces this asymmetric curve, that you have a very long period and then a very quick change to the other side and then a very long and very quick.
1363360	1380360	And note that the mass that we predict for these planets is only a minimum value. The reason is that we only see the Doppler motion that's toward or away from us. We cannot see any motion that's up or down in the plane of the sky.
1380360	1391360	So if the orbit is face-on, if the planet is orbiting around it face-on to our point of view, all the star wobble would be up and down and we would see nothing.
1391360	1403360	If instead the orbit is edge-on like this, then all of the wobble of the star would be in the plane that we're looking at, would be toward and away, and the mass that we would get would be correct.
1403360	1411360	But as the orbit inclined, we're going to see less and less of the wobble of the star reflected in its motion, and so we'll deduce less and less mass.
1411360	1419360	So the mass is really the mass times the sine of the inclination angle, and that is a lower limit for the true mass.
1419360	1427360	If you want to estimate the mass, you can take the m-sine I value and multiply it by about 1.3, and that gets you a good estimate.
1428360	1435360	Another complication when looking at extrasolar planets is the possibility of multiple planets.
1435360	1445360	The signal for this star, HD 12661, shows oscillations, but the oscillations also oscillate.
1445360	1456360	You can decompose the signal, and one planet is the dominant component, and the remainder shows another planet.
1456360	1470360	So given the variations of the masses of the planets, the orbit sizes, the orbit shapes, and the numbers of planets, it is a significant work to fit a very complex system.
1470360	1475360	Now Doppler spectroscopy has found more planets than any other method.
1475360	1484360	The initial results were revolutionary, not just in finding planets, but also in the types of planets that were found.
1485360	1492360	So let's take a look at some of those planets, and we're going to establish a frame of reference based upon our solar system.
1492360	1504360	This is Mercury's orbit around our Sun, and I'm going to draw a gray circle on it and use that as a scale, because we have found a number of planets with Mercury-sized orbits.
1504360	1510360	Remember, the smaller the planet orbit, the stronger the signal is for Doppler spectroscopy.
1511360	1513360	So here are some examples.
1513360	1530360	This is the planet around the star Gliese 86A, and its orbit, as you can see, is about one-third the semi-major axis of Mercury, whereas its mass is about four times that of Jupiter.
1531360	1546360	Here is 51 Peg, the one I showed you with Doppler plot before, and the planet here is half the mass of Jupiter, but it's at one-one-hundredth the distance from its star, as Jupiter is from our Sun.
1546360	1549360	And they can be really, really close in.
1549360	1561360	This is Ogil TR-56, and it has a bit more than the mass of Jupiter, but it's at a distance of less than four million kilometers from its star.
1561360	1573360	The category of objects that I'm showing you here has been called hot Jupiters, because these are giant planets in really close to the star, and we see lots of them.
1573360	1591360	Now, how many depends upon your definition of how massive they need to be and how close they need to be to the star, but I would estimate about 25% of the extrasolar planets found so far are hot Jupiters, and we certainly didn't expect to see those.
1591360	1600360	Their orbits, as because they're in close, have generally become circularized by the tides of the star, but not always.
1601360	1613360	Here's a star HD-3651, and the planet around it has 20% of the mass of Jupiter, though its orbit is much more elongated than Pluto's orbit.
1613360	1621360	Now, as a reminder, the eccentricity of an ellipse. If it's zero, it's a circle. If it's one, it's a line.
1622360	1632360	Pluto's eccentricity is at 0.25. The eccentricity for this planet is at 0.63, over twice as large.
1632360	1644360	Now, you can get really eccentric extrasolar planet orbits. This is one for the Parko star 45982, and its eccentricity is 0.93.
1645360	1651360	In our solar system, the only things with eccentricities that large are comets and asteroids.
1651360	1662360	Here, we've got a planet with three over about three and a half Jupiter masses, and these eccentricities are not just found for hot Jupiters.
1662360	1672360	Here is a system HD-39091, and the planet in this system covers a wide swath of the planetary system.
1672360	1682360	Now, the gray circle here in close to the star still represents Mercury, but I've added a red circle for the orbit of Mars and an orange circle for the orbit of Jupiter.
1682360	1691360	The perihelion of this planet is around Earth's orbit, and the aphelion, the most distant point, is around Jupiter's orbit.
1691360	1702360	Furthermore, this planet weighs 10 Jupiter masses. Its gravity would dominate the entire inner region of its planetary system.
1704360	1716360	These elliptical orbits for giant planets run counter to what our solar system shows, and they are not the exception, but they are rather common.
1716360	1728360	And matter of fact, both of these initial results, the hot Jupiters and the elliptical orbits, are rather peculiar when you compare them to our own solar system.
1728360	1735360	Now, we tend to focus on the weirdos that we find, but not every extra solar planet is strange.
1736360	1750360	This is the star Pollux, which is the second brightest star in the constellation Gemini, and the planet around it has a mass of three Jupiter masses, and it has an almost circular orbit.
1750360	1756360	Matter of fact, the eccentricity of this planet is smaller than the eccentricity of Jupiter's orbit.
1756360	1760360	This is a reasonable fit to what we expected.
1760360	1768360	However, for extra solar planets, what we find strange may really be normal.
1768360	1778360	And to see what's normal and what's strange, we need to look at the whole population of extra solar planets, not just these individual examples I've presented here.
1779360	1793360	We'll explore that in the next lecture, when we discuss the characteristics of all the extra solar planets and the implications for how our solar system fits into the galactic view of planetary systems.
1793360	1796360	Join me next time. So long.
