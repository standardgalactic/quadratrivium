0	21440	What's the difference between a hypothesis and a theory?
21440	24600	In the public vernacular, not much.
24600	29880	We say, here's my theory of what happened, or oh, that's just a theory.
29880	33320	But in science, the difference is huge.
33320	37520	A hypothesis is an unproven assertion.
37520	43320	It needs to make predictions, and those predictions need to be tested by observations.
43320	50400	And if those observations match over repeated testing, then, and only then, does it get
50400	52480	to become a theory.
52480	59080	So the phrase, oh, it's only a theory, would never be heard in science, because to become
59080	64000	a theory, you must be elevated up to become a theory.
64000	70960	The heliocentric model was not generally accepted until its predictions became better than the
70960	73180	geocentric model.
73180	78200	It was a hypothesis until it proved itself.
78200	84360	Newton's law of gravity, similarly, took time for people to embrace that idea.
84360	91440	We will show you one major example of testing of Newton's law of gravity in this lecture.
91440	98400	In science, we're always looking for new phenomena as a way of testing our old ideas and discovering
98400	100280	new ideas.
100280	105880	We will find that even established theories can be modified.
105880	109880	We're going to discuss this in the context of predicting planets.
109880	112440	There have been many predictions of planets throughout history.
112440	119680	We're going to discuss three examples, each that have a different resolution.
119680	124440	For our first example, we're going to discuss the Titus Bode rule.
124440	132080	In 1766, Johann Titus noted a formula in a footnote in one of his books.
132080	137160	It was a mathematical rule about the spacing of planet orbits, and it approximated the
137160	141000	distances to the known planets pretty well.
141000	148240	In 1772, Johann Bode, a much more influential astronomer, included the rule in his book and
148240	151080	it became widely known.
151080	154120	Titus Bode rule goes like this.
154120	160080	We start with Mercury, and the Titus Bode rule says that the distance to Mercury is 0.4
160080	167320	AU, remembering that an AU stands for an astronomical unit, it's the distance from the Sun to Earth.
167320	171680	The distances to the other planets were found by adding a second term.
171680	179680	For Venus we add 0.3, for Earth we add 0.6, for Mars we add 1.2, and as you can see, the
179680	183080	second term doubles each time.
183080	189880	And so if you take each of the planets as being labeled by the letter N, and you turn
189880	198240	Titus Bode rule into a mathematical formula, the distance would be 0.4 plus 0.3 times 2
198240	201960	to the N minus 2 power.
201960	203400	How well did it work?
203400	209800	Well, the accuracy of the rule for the known planets at the time was 5% or better.
209800	215240	And in this table, I give you the distance as given by the Titus Bode rule in the first
215240	220320	column, and the semi-major axis in the second column.
220320	223200	And you can see that they roughly match.
223200	226880	In the third column, I give you the present error.
226880	232280	And so for Mercury the difference between prediction and what was observed was 3.4%.
232280	239440	For Venus 3.2%, Mars was the largest at around 5.3%, and then Saturn at 4.8%.
239440	243920	Both Earth and Jupiter were predicted almost exactly.
243920	250200	You'll notice, however, that the N equals 5 planet is missing.
250200	252680	Is that an error in the hypothesis?
252680	256720	Is that a prediction of the Titus Bode rule that's wrong?
256720	263560	Johann Bode interpreted this as a challenge, and he began to argue for the existence of
263560	266280	a missing planet.
266280	272320	Fortunately for him, a planet was found, but it was not where Bode expected.
272320	277680	Bode expected the N equal 5 planet to be found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
277680	282880	Instead, in 1781, William Herschel discovers Uranus.
282880	286420	This is outside the orbit of Saturn.
286420	291480	This is not the N equals 5 planet, instead it's the N equal 8 planet.
291480	296720	The distance for Uranus that was found when its orbit was calculated agreed with the Titus
296720	300560	Bode rule to better than 2%.
300560	306760	This was an unexpected level of support for the rule, and convinced people that the N
306760	309760	equals 5 planet must exist.
309760	314040	So several astronomers, several groups of astronomers, went out and started searching
314040	315920	for the N equals 5 planets.
315920	318960	They actually formed a group called the Celestial Police.
318960	321600	They had to find the missing planet.
321600	328600	In 1801, a planet was found, not by the Celestial Police, but by someone doing a survey, and
328640	331240	this planet was named Ceres.
331240	336120	We know Ceres today as being the largest of the members of the asteroid belt.
336120	340720	But when it was discovered in 1801, it was the missing planet.
340720	346160	And it agreed again with the Titus Bode rule at a 1% level.
346160	347160	Amazing!
347160	353040	Now we have not only the N equals 5 planet, which matches, we have a new N equals 8 planet.
353040	355560	This is really wonderful.
355560	361800	Things got a little bit more complicated when three more N equals 5 planets were soon found.
361800	368640	Pallas was discovered the next year, two years later Juno, and a few years later Vesta.
368640	377640	Pallas agreed with the N equals 5 position to 1%, Juno 5%, and Vesta, well, it was off
377640	380720	by 19%.
380720	385520	But you could argue that they are all part of the same N equals 5 planet, but they had
385520	386600	broken into fragments.
386600	391320	Since they were so small anyway, you could justify that the Titus Bode rule still worked.
391320	396000	You just had the one planet that was broken into four pieces.
396000	403160	Nevertheless, the Titus Bode rule, as it was previously known, now became law.
403160	406240	And this was the level of agreement at that time.
406240	413240	You see Uranus, Ceres, Pallas, and Juno with their Titus Bode rule distances, and the semi-major
413280	417040	axis distances, and here are their percent errors.
417040	422240	And yes, Vesta is big, but as we said, it was allowed because we had four planets in
422240	424680	that area.
424680	430160	This was an empirical law, just like Kepler's laws were empirical.
430160	435520	No one had any good reason why it worked, because if you look at Newton's law of gravity,
435520	438820	it says nothing about the spacing of orbits.
438820	445820	Many explanations were offered, but none of them were lasting, because the rule was
445820	448680	not a physical law.
448680	456180	It turns out that in 1846, Neptune was discovered, and its distance was off from the Titus Bode
456180	459220	rule by 29%.
459220	464500	In 1930, Pluto was discovered, and its distance was off by 95%.
464580	470660	So I can add them to this table, and you can see that although we fit nicely for the
470660	476740	first six discoveries, the next two discoveries have very strong errors.
476740	483940	And in retrospect, you can see that Pluto's distance of 39.5 AU sort of fits with the expected
483940	491620	distance for Neptune of 38 AU, and so Pluto might sort of fit into the n equals nine slot.
492140	497300	To do that, you'd have to ignore Neptune, and Neptune's much too big a planet to ignore.
497300	502100	So the law went back to be a rule.
502100	508100	We think of it today as a very curious mathematical coincidence, and I consider it more like Kepler's
508100	513020	numerology, the stuff that he put into his book, Harmony of the Worlds.
513020	517940	There was no physical justification needed when you're just doing numerology, because
517940	520260	these are wonderful coincidences.
520260	525740	And so we stopped searching for a physical reason as to why the Titus Bode rule works,
525740	529940	or shall we say, almost works.
529940	535140	Our second example of planetary prediction is the prediction of Neptune.
535140	539420	And this derives from a problem with the orbit of Uranus.
539420	545020	After Uranus was discovered in 1781, very soon thereafter we found historical observations
545020	547780	that dated back about a hundred years.
547780	554220	When you've got that long a baseline of observations, you can calculate a relatively accurate orbit.
554220	562620	The problem was that those who tried to fit the orbit had a really hard time fitting both
562620	569260	the old observations and the new observations at the same time with one orbit.
569260	574620	No matter what orbit they tried, Uranus strayed from the predictions.
574620	578420	And they came up with a new orbit and predicted where Uranus would be.
578420	585060	After a few years or a decade, Uranus would no longer be in that position on the sky.
585060	587060	What are we going to do about this?
587060	591900	Does this indicate that there's a problem with Newton's gravity?
591900	597300	This was over a hundred years later after Newton had come up with his theory of gravity,
597300	600780	but people were still willing to question it.
600780	605540	However, computing orbits by hand was really difficult.
605540	608380	So you couldn't actually be totally sure.
608380	611380	When you're doing an orbit by hand, you have to not just take into account the gravity
611380	617060	of the Sun, but you also have to take into account the gravity of Jupiter and Saturn
617060	624380	and sometimes other planets as they might slow or speed a planet in its orbit.
624380	632340	The problem with Uranus became a very high profile challenge and in 1835 came a very
632340	634700	important clue.
634700	642620	Halley's Comet came back in 1835 and reached perihelion one day late.
642620	648540	Now you may think to yourself, wait a minute, one day late Halley's Comet has 76 year orbit.
648540	651180	What is one day in that?
651180	659540	That's one part out of 27,000, but the idea was that since Halley's Comet had such elongated
659540	667020	orbit, it would sample the gravity of the outer solar system and if it sampled the gravity
667020	674060	of an unknown planet, that could perturb its orbit and cause it to come back to perihelion
674060	677380	one day late.
677380	683060	The prediction and the discovery of Neptune is one of the greatest scientific soap operas
683060	684060	I've ever heard.
684060	688620	That's a wonderful story, so please join me in it.
688620	697280	It starts in England where this man, John Couch Adams, made his predictions.
697280	701980	He was a brilliant mathematics student at Cambridge and he took up the challenge of Uranus after
701980	702980	he graduated.
703340	708100	Now this is an extremely difficult challenge because you're not just computing one orbit,
708100	711540	you're actually computing two orbits simultaneously.
711540	716460	So you're getting the perturbations of the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn on one orbit and on
716460	720300	another orbit and then you have to compute the perturbations of each of those orbits
720300	722300	on each other.
722300	728620	Incredibly difficult problem, but Adams tackled it and in 1843 he came up with his first solution.
728620	731660	That just fit the observations of the modern era.
731660	736180	He continued to work on it and try to include the observations from a hundred years ago
736180	740420	and in 1845 he came up with his revised solution.
740420	744900	Now it's very important here that he decided not to publish it.
744900	749900	He didn't want to put it in some rinky-dink little journal or papers according to some
749900	751020	small society.
751020	756380	He wanted to go for the big time and to do that he had to go through the astronomer royal,
756380	758180	George Arie.
758180	763100	In September of that year he tries to meet with Arie, but there were some really bad
763100	768420	timing and a little bit of miscommunication and some strong personalities and it turns
768420	770460	out that they never meet.
770460	776420	He leaves his solution with Arie, but he feels rebuffed and he feels a lot of bad feelings
776420	777420	toward Arie.
777420	782500	So now we turn to George Arie and he picks up his term in the story.
782500	789420	As astronomer royal he is basically one of the head honchos of English astronomy.
789420	795300	He however has a bias against theoretical calculations and he also has a bias against
795300	796660	young researchers.
796660	800060	John Adams was 26 when he produced this solution.
800060	804780	Kind of young man of that age really produced anything valuable?
804780	809900	He didn't give it much credit and he sent off a reply to Adams that you know asked some
809900	812060	trivial questions about it.
812060	817060	But in October he did show the solution to a man named William Dawes.
817060	821780	Dawes thought it was incredible and he sends it to the observer William Lassel.
821780	827660	However Lassel has a sprained ankle and by the time he's recuperated the maid destroys
827660	830220	the letter.
830220	838620	Lassel most insuredly could have seen Neptune at that time based upon Adams' prediction,
838620	843900	but he was unable to because he lost the coordinates to look at before he had recovered from his
843900	845700	sprained ankle.
845700	853780	So England was stymied due to some strong personalities and to a string of bad luck.
853780	862660	Now the story moves across the channel to France and this man, Hover Jean-Joseph Leverrier
862660	864980	takes up the challenge of Uranus.
865100	871100	Originally Leverrier wanted to study chemistry but he moved to astronomy when a job opened
871100	879420	up and in 1845 François Aragault the dean of French astronomers asked Leverrier to work
879420	884420	on the problem of Uranus and when the dean of astronomy in your country asked you to
884420	885420	you do it.
885420	890700	He dropped everything and immediately began work on the problem of Uranus.
890700	895460	In November of that year he had his first paper ready and what that paper did is it
895460	901220	corrected the errors in Uranus's orbit and by June of the next year he had a second paper
901220	907780	ready that had gone through the full calculation and was able to predict the position of the
907780	908780	planet.
908780	914340	For the French astronomers he presented his paper to them and they called it an analytical
914340	915340	triumph.
915340	916340	They thought it was fantastic.
916340	924020	It was wonderful but none of them would go to the telescope and search for the planet.
924020	927300	Leverrier was totally frustrated.
927300	929820	So now we go back to Ari in England.
929820	933280	He receives a copy of Leverrier's paper.
933280	940220	He now knows that Adams and Leverrier's predictions agree to within one degree on the sky.
940220	946100	Finally George Ari asked the Cambridge Observatory to search for the new planet.
946100	951580	The observatory is run by James Chalice and James Chalice has a strong personality and
951580	956940	he's had an antagonistic history with George Ari and so there's a little bit of give and
956940	958860	take between them.
958860	962700	Furthermore Ari asked for a very specific search method.
962700	966640	He wants Chalice to sweep across the sky and he's very long arcs.
966640	969260	He doesn't ask him to go look where Adam's predicted.
969260	973060	He just says do a survey.
973060	980420	There was a cumbersome method but still Chalice observes Neptune four times.
980420	986100	However, again more bad luck, he doesn't analyze the data.
986100	991880	He analyzes data up to the observation but doesn't actually go to the observations that
991880	994340	contain Neptune.
994340	995860	Back to France.
995860	1000380	In August Leverrier produced a third paper with an even more refined prediction of the
1000380	1001380	planet.
1001380	1006300	Again, no French astronomer would go out and look for the planet.
1006300	1008580	He gave up on them.
1008580	1015060	Finally, he had some correspondence with somebody at the Berlin Observatory and he said hey,
1015060	1017100	maybe they will look for it.
1017100	1024020	He left his countrymen behind and he sent a letter to Johann Gaul at the Berlin Observatory
1024020	1027140	and asked him to search for it.
1027260	1031900	Gaul got permission to use the observatory and on the very first night they looked for
1031900	1034180	it, he found it.
1034180	1038220	The second night they confirmed it and they had the discovery.
1038220	1041740	Neptune was found.
1041740	1048100	This discovery led to an international controversy because Gaul and Leverrier announced their
1048100	1049600	result.
1049600	1051900	Airy in England has to say face.
1051900	1056500	He has to start dancing around and saying wait, wait, wait, wait, I knew of Adam's result
1056540	1060540	before Leverrier published his even his first paper.
1060540	1064740	The French Academy of Science went ballistic.
1064740	1069480	Why were they only hearing of Adam's claim of prediction after the discovery had already
1069480	1070980	been made?
1070980	1078220	Francois Aragault has an especially strong quote.
1078220	1083100	Mr. Adams has no right to figure in the history of the discovery of the planet Leverrier,
1083260	1087460	neither by a detailed citation nor by the slightest illusion.
1087460	1092780	In the eyes of every impartial man, this discovery will remain one of the most magnificent triumphs
1092780	1098060	of astronomical theory, one of the glories of the academy and one of our country's noblest
1098060	1104140	titles to the gratitude and admiration of posterity.
1104140	1107020	Some fighting words from France.
1107020	1111020	You also had some serious attacks in England.
1111020	1115460	The Royal Astronomical Society met the next month and they did their best to give Adam
1115460	1120980	his due, but they could not avoid doing savage attacks on Airy and Chalice.
1120980	1126620	Why had they let the discovery go to the French?
1126620	1131060	Then the press got hold of the story and they inflated the story all out of proportion.
1131060	1136300	As a matter of fact, here is a cartoon in one of the French papers and you can see the
1136300	1142100	great big giant dunce cap on Adam's head as he is discovering Neptune by looking in
1142100	1146620	the calculations of Leverrier.
1146620	1152740	The press overreaction helped the scientists to actually calm down because the scientific
1152740	1155900	result was absolutely amazing.
1155900	1158540	This was an analytical triumph.
1158540	1164220	One astronomer called it the most outstanding conceivable proof of the validity of the law
1164220	1167580	of universal gravitation.
1167580	1172580	Mathematics could not only explain the known solar system, it could predict entirely new
1172580	1183740	features and mathematical calculations became a respectable guide for basing your observations.
1183740	1191420	As a small footnote to the story, in June of 1847, Adams and Leverrier met for the first
1191420	1197860	time and rather than being antagonistic, as you might expect from the story, they quickly
1197860	1202780	became friends and remain so for the rest of their lives.
1202780	1211860	The third example of planet prediction now deals with a problem in Mercury's orbit.
1211860	1217620	The perihelion of an orbit, as shown in this diagram, is the point in the orbit that is
1217620	1219860	closest to the sun.
1219860	1224460	The opposite point is called the apphelion, as the point where you're the furthest from
1224460	1226340	the sun.
1226340	1232620	The perihelion of the orbit can process due to the gravity of other planets.
1232620	1235980	It can actually rotate around, as shown here.
1235980	1241540	So the orientation of the orbit slowly shifts over time.
1241540	1245460	This was known due to Newton's law of gravity.
1245460	1250700	The problem with Mercury was that the procession was too large.
1250700	1257900	Newton's gravity predicted a shift of about 532 arc seconds per century, whereas the observed
1257900	1263220	rate was around 574 arc seconds per century.
1263220	1268100	The discrepancy was 43 arc seconds per century.
1268100	1270060	Now that's a tiny amount.
1270060	1271460	Let's put this in perspective.
1271460	1275900	A circle contains 360 degrees.
1275900	1280180	Each degree contains 60 minutes of arc.
1280180	1284300	Each minute of arc contains 60 seconds of arc.
1284300	1291980	So we're talking less than one arc minute per century is the discrepancy here.
1291980	1297180	And after the success in predicting Neptune, it was very hard to doubt Newton's law of
1297180	1298580	gravity.
1298580	1300060	So what are you going to do?
1300060	1305340	After seeing a change in the solar system, you're going to predict that there's a planet
1305340	1307140	causing it.
1307140	1314220	None other than Urban Leveret himself predicted a planet interior to Mercury that could cause
1314220	1317180	this shift in Mercury's orbit.
1317180	1322900	Actually Leveret found that a swarm of planets, a swarm of about 20 planets interior to Mercury
1322900	1329300	would be the best fit to causing the shift in Mercury's orbit without causing a shift
1329300	1331860	in Venus's orbit.
1331860	1337060	One observer actually claimed to have seen such a planet transit across the face of the
1337060	1340860	sun and he called it the planet Vulcan.
1340860	1346220	So yes, the planet Vulcan not only exists in Star Trek, it also exists in your history
1346220	1347820	book.
1347820	1353620	Unfortunately, this observation was never confirmed.
1353620	1356940	Vulcan was never again seen in transit.
1356940	1361460	And when there were solar eclipses, there are expeditions launched to find it and it
1361460	1364540	was never observed during solar eclipses.
1364540	1369220	The only thing that was keeping the planet Vulcan alive was the fact that it had Leveret's
1369220	1372260	name on the prediction.
1372260	1377660	So after Leveret died in 1877, the idea faded away.
1377660	1383700	However, the problem with Mercury's orbit did not.
1383700	1389900	Next forward to 1916, Einstein's general theory of relativity is published in this year.
1389900	1396220	And to give you a three word summary of general relativity, mass warps space.
1396220	1402820	This is the idea that the presence of mass changes the fabric of space time.
1402820	1409140	In this illustration, the blue grid is supposed to represent the fabric of space time and
1409140	1413180	the yellow ball is supposed to represent the mass of the sun.
1413180	1420620	And the mass of the sun warps space so it's no longer flat.
1420620	1429700	Gravity is no longer a force, but it's reinterpreted as geometry as the curvature of space.
1429700	1435040	So if you have a flat space, the normal motion through it is a straight line.
1435040	1441200	But if you have a curved space, the normal motion through it would be an orbit.
1441200	1445120	The analogy I like to give is sort of think of a water bed.
1445120	1449200	What if you take a bowling ball and place it in the center of a water bed?
1449200	1452840	You're going to warp the surface of the water bed.
1452840	1456560	Without the bowling ball in the water bed, you could roll a BB straight across it and
1456560	1458840	it would travel in a straight line.
1458840	1463620	But with the bowling ball in the center of the water bed, as you roll the BB across it,
1463620	1469700	it will go down into the depression made by the bowling ball and it will have a curved
1469700	1472300	path through a curved space.
1472300	1477860	For this diagram, you can see the depression made in the fabric of space time by the mass
1477860	1484580	of the sun and the planets would be rolling around the interior of that depression in
1484580	1486220	an orbit.
1486220	1494300	So as one physicist put it, mass tells space how to curve and curved space tells mass
1494300	1497020	how to move.
1497020	1503520	General relativity was able to explain the extra procession of Mercury's orbit because
1503520	1510180	general relativity extends Newton gravity to handle realms with their very large masses.
1510180	1516500	Mercury is the only planet close enough to the sun to show these effects.
1516500	1524100	So the planet Vulcan finally disappeared in 1916 and it disappeared into the equations
1524100	1527620	of general relativity.
1527620	1532620	In this lecture, we have gone through three different examples of planet predictions with
1532620	1534780	three different outcomes.
1534780	1541300	When we looked at the Tysiaspode rule, it started to look like a law but ended up looking
1541300	1543900	like a numerical coincidence.
1543900	1550420	The Neptune prediction started out by a challenge to Newton's law of gravity and ended up with
1550420	1555340	a triumphant verification of Newton's law of gravity.
1555340	1561940	The discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury, while possibly indicating new planets, actually
1561940	1565260	indicated new physics.
1565260	1571900	This is a challenge in science that we don't know which hypotheses will pan out.
1571900	1573500	Where do we put our efforts?
1573500	1578020	There's always a number of really interesting ideas to pursue.
1578020	1584420	Which ones will turn out to be coincidences and which one will lead you to new discoveries?
1584420	1587100	We don't know those things.
1587100	1590740	So if we answer the question that we posed at the beginning.
1590740	1595660	What is the difference between hypothesis and theory?
1595660	1605220	The answer is simply years and years of confirming our observations, a lot of hard work.
1605220	1607340	That's it for today and we'll see you next time.
