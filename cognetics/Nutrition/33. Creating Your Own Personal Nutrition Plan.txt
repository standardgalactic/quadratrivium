I'm going to tell you a story about a woman that I was working with who had gastric bypass
and she decided as part of her wellness plan that she was going to start running marathons.
And she came to see me because she was really having some significant gastrointestinal upset
so using the nutrition assessment process I was able to help her to narrow down the fact
that given the fact she'd had gastric bypass we were going to have to change the type and amount
of carbohydrate. So in this lecture what we're going to do is develop a step-by-step road map
to a better eating plan. We are going to use the nutrition assessment process just like I did with
my client to help you to be able to review your health history, evaluate your weight,
your body mass index, your health status, medications, and to design a basic plan. Now
keep in mind this step-by-step guide does not replace advice from your physician or dietitian.
In your guidebook you can create your own personal nutrition plan and set your goals.
Keep in mind here our aim is to help you to personalize the nutrition information you have
learned and focus in on progress not perfection. So what is the nutrition assessment process?
It is a process to help you to determine your own nutritional needs and your goals. There are four
basic components to the nutrition assessment process and it's ABCD. Anthropometrics, what
does that mean? Anthropometrics means measuring the body. So any measurement that you would have
would be considered an anthropometric measure. Biochemical or blood or urine work. So if you
have that handy, if you've had a recent physical and you have those numbers handy, that would be
the biochemical portion of the nutrition assessment process. Clinical, what kind of chronic illnesses
do you have and what kind of medications do you take on a daily basis? Now keep in mind when
we're talking about medications it could be things like aspirin. It could be things like an herbal
medication that you've tried. What about your multivitamin? Are you taking some vitamin D? So
that's an important consideration of this nutrition assessment process. We're also looking at a
dietary analysis. What do you eat on a regular basis? And again keep in mind the nutrition
assessment process is designed to help you to set some goals and measure the progress of those
goals as change over time. So now let's explore what is an anthropometric measurement. Again it's a
body measurement and what are the common ones? Well first and foremost it's your height but you
have to measure it. Don't guess and don't rely on your memory. Men tend to overestimate height. For
the longest time I was telling people that I was 5'5 and when I actually measured myself I'm 5'4
and a half so I had to take that away. Your weight measure it and measure it in a consistent
fashion. So if you routinely get up and weigh yourself without any clothes on do that as you weigh
yourself because again you want to be doing it a consistent way. Women tend to underestimate their
weight so again make sure that you're measuring these two very important variables. From these two
numbers you calculate your body mass index. Body mass index is a way of taking a look at height
and relationship to weight and so here's how you calculate it. You take your weight in pounds times
703 and divide it by height in inches squared and what does body mass index tell us? Well if you
have a BMI of greater than 25 you are considered overweight and greater than 30 is obese and on
the other end of the weight scale less than 19.8 is underweight. Now keep in mind BMI cannot tell
you what kind of weight you have. So say for example you are in the gym on a regular basis and
your strength training you may have more lean mass that is going to raise your BMI but you're
really not over fat. You may be overweight but you're not over fat. Keep in mind we want to see
where that weight is coming from and does that excess weight confer any disease risk and so we
measure waist circumference. Remember what you're trying to do is measure your waist at about the
level of your belly button and if you have a waist circumference of greater than 35 inches as a woman
greater than 40 inches as a man you are more likely to develop pre-diabetes or metabolic
syndrome. So it's where you have your weight. Another way of looking at it is if you're looking in
the mirror is your body type an apple meaning that you've got more of your body fat in your upper
body or are you a pair and have more of your weight in your lower body. Now what about body
composition? Because body composition really rules the day. Check in your community to see if you
have access to what is known as a bod pod. What a bod pod does is it actually measures how much of
your weight it assesses how much of your weight is lean mass and how much of your weight is actually
body fat and truly I really prefer this as a means of assessing that BMI in a little bit more depth.
Again remember if I'm lifting weights I may have an elevated BMI but I could have a low body fat
and we're trying to lower body fat and raise lean mass. So as a woman your body fat percentage in a
bod pod should be less than 30% and less than 20% for men. Another way of getting this done if
you're comfortable in the water is underwater weighing and both of these measures the bod pod
and underwater weighing can give us an assessment, a peek on the inside to say how much of my weight
is fat and how much of my weight is lean. Body composition is much better than body weight. Now
some people will ask me what about body fat scales? Well body fat scales can be reasonably
unreliable because think about this for a second. If I stand on the scale that scale is going to
capture my lower body fat better than my upper body fat because what it's doing is running a weak
electrical current. So it almost always makes men look leaner because men carry more of their fat
in their upper body and it always makes women appear fatter. You can get calipers done and many
personal trainers were used calipers in a gym. The problem with the calipers is it can get the fat
right underneath the skin but it can't capture the fat that's internal deep inside that visceral
fat that confers disease risk. Now what about biochemical assessment? Keep in mind you have to
have a physician who's going to draw blood work for you. This again is mostly your blood work and
what kinds of things would we be looking for as we craft this nutrition assessment plan? Well keep
in mind we're going to look at cholesterol and you might remember that from previous lectures.
You want to take a look at your iron status. So in typical blood work you might see a hematocrit
and hemoglobin and that can give you kind of a peek as to whether or not you're anemic. Another
thing that may be on your blood work is something called ferritin and ferritin is the iron that you
store that's available in times of need. Another very valuable piece of data on that blood work
is something called mean corpuscular volume. Oftentimes abbreviated on your blood work
as MCV and I would encourage you when you go to your doctor to ask for an actual copy of the lab
slip so you have this again as you're crafting your own plan. If the red blood cell is low,
if the mean corpuscular volume which means the size of the red blood cell, if you have small
red blood cells chances are you have an iron deficiency. If your red blood cells are large
it means that you might have a deficiency of B12 or folic acid. This next piece of data,
the vitamin D status, you might really have to ask for. Physicians are getting better and better at
assessing vitamin D status but when you go in and have a physical ask to have this done.
Now other than blood what else can we look at? Well your urinalysis results can take a look
at do you have any sugar in your urine? That might be and I stress the word might be an indication
that diabetes is on your horizon. Does your urine reveal that you have ketones and ketones are the
breakdown metabolites of fat? It also can give us the urine concentration and this is known as
urine specific gravity. The higher your urine specific gravity the more likely you are to
be dehydrated. So again the more concentrated or darker your urine is the more dehydrated you are
and urine specific gravity is a urine test that physicians perform to see how dry or dehydrated
you are. As we go on to clinical assessment again this is what makes you really you. It includes
any chronic illnesses that you might have and think that if you have a chronic illness say for
example you have diabetes or you're taking any medications this is a real key part of the clinical
assessment portion of the nutrition assessment process. Chronic illnesses oftentimes require
some kind of dietary modification so it's also going to alter the analysis of your diet. It may
cause nutrient holes that might need to be filled or avoided so say for example you cannot drink
milk you don't like it you don't tolerate it well now I've created a possible nutrient hole
calcium vitamin D that I might have to fill with a supplement or with a different food.
So another example might be diabetes heart disease or cancer what about any kind of
gastrointestinal disease that you might have that might include celiac disease or Crohn's disease
these diseases require significant modification and oftentimes pharmaceuticals to help to control
the disease process. Medications can cause significant interactions and alter nutritional
status and must be taken into account when crafting a nutritional plan. So these are medications again
that you would use on a chronic basis not the fact that you would take something like Motrin for a
headache. The most common nutrient drug interaction or one that probably causes Americans the most
grief in the long run is grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice interacts indirectly with over 50% of the
commonly used medications so you would know grapefruit juice is a very nutritious food if it's pink
grapefruit juice it's got a little red pigment a little lycopene in it you think this is a great
thing to have with my breakfast in the morning. The problem is the juice inhibits an enzyme
that degrades some of the drug that you might be taking in your intestinal tract without the enzyme
and the enzyme is CYP3A4 more medication reaches the blood than is desired and about 14% of the
population drinks grapefruit juice weekly so keep in mind there are food and drug interactions out
there and again the ones that we're most concerned about are going to be the ones that you take
chronically so for looking at grapefruit juice what drugs are affected well if you have epilepsy
medication for epilepsy can be affected antidepressants calcium channel blockers that are oftentimes
used in heart disease statin resins drugs that lower your cholesterol and the effect can last up to 72
hours after you had your four ounces of grapefruit juice in the morning. There are also medications
that can cause an increase in blood sugar and this is so important that you when you if say for
example on your regular physical that your urine in your sugar in your urine was a little high
you might want to make sure that you inform your physician oh by the way there may be some medications
that I'm taking that raise my blood sugar and again increase the amount of sugar in my urine
so what medications can cause an increase in blood sugar a classification of drugs called
atypical antipsychotics can cause an elevation in blood sugar niacin which is a b vitamin
but when used in high enough doses for cholesterol can raise your blood sugar medications can also
alter your own individual nutritional status metformin which is a very very common drug for
the treatment of diabetes can actually decrease vitamin b12 so again if you are on metformin
this would cue you in when you go to your physician ask and just say have you checked
my vitamin b12 status I'm a little bit concerned about this interaction and keep in mind your
pharmacist can be a great partner with this if you're taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis
that can alter folic acid status and certainly over the counter medications and herbal medications
can also affect nutritional status very very popular herbs something called Chinese red yeast
extract can lower cholesterol in a similar fashion as the statin resins fish oil can lower
triglycerides and so medications and chronic illnesses really pay play a big part in the
nutrition assessment process so what about the D in nutrition assessment well the D stands for
dietary assessment now this is where you have to be very realistic how does your diet stack up
again remember our goal here is always progress not perfection so I will I will declare openly my
favorite food in the world is chocolate so I have no problem saying that might be the thing in my
diet that might be a weakness for me but you can write your own plate 50 percent of your plate
should be fruits and vegetables one fourth should be some source of lean protein and remember a lean
protein could be beans it doesn't have to be meat and one fourth should be a whole grain well
there are some great websites out there and one of my favorite is a website called rate your plate
by the University of Connecticut team nutrition it's interactive it has pull down menus it has
interactive ways of designing your own plate it's a very wonderful tool there are also interactive
nutrition and physical activity monitoring systems again one of my favorite is something
called fitday.com and it's a website where you log in you log in your food intake and your exercise
to see how you're progressing so what you're actually doing is evaluating your nutritional
status and your progress as you try and make dietary changes keep in mind dietary changes are
difficult for most of us to make because we have habits we have preferences and so again keep in
mind we're looking at progress not perfection however the key to understanding any online program
is you have to under understand portion sizes because any online program is going to ask you
what was your serving size or what was your portion size so if your portion size is incorrect
your assessment of calories and protein is also incorrect so can you eyeball portions well a half
a cup is about the size of the palm of your hand now I realize not all of us are the same size and
a very large man versus a petite woman the palm of the hand is going to be different but as a crude
estimate a half a cup is about the size of the palm of your hand so if you had pasta last night
and it covered your plate that is not a half a cup portion that's probably a two cup portion
three ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards and I like that as an analogy
because it also gives us depth an ounce of cheese is about the size of a domino
what you think about that for a second cheese is a very high fat protein about 100 calories per ounce
so if you have six ounces of cheese and crackers you had 600 calories of cheese a half a cup of rice
or potatoes ice cream kind of a sticky or a creamy food is about the size of a tennis ball
so if you get out a big cereal bowl and have ice cream at night that is not a half a cup portion
now what about websites to help you to count calories well there is calorieking.com
and others that can help you to determine the calories in the foods you eat and I think that's
a really great thing to do because calorie king and a lot of the calorie counting websites
can actually help you to look at fast foods or favorite restaurants that you might frequent as
well now what about alcohol intake alcohol and other liquids can oftentimes be overlooked as a
source of energy we tend to remember what we eat not so much what we drink so as little as two
regular beers per day would add up to 2100 calories per week and if you're trying to lose weight
there's 3500 calories in a pound so those liquid beverages can make a big deal in your overall
nutrition assessment plan well can you do a more in-depth analysis of your your needs
well let's take a look at calorie needs first and foremost we have to calculate ideal body weight
and i'm going to remind you there's an equation out there that we've talked about before called
the ham we equation but let's review it it allows 100 pounds for the first five feet of height for
women and five pounds for each inch after men get a little bit more weight for the first five
feet of height and it's 106 pounds for the first five feet and six pounds for each inch after
the value of this is once you take your ideal body weight so again if i'm five foot four i'm
going to round down here if i'm five foot four my ideal body weight is 120 and 120 times 10
gives me the calories that are needed for my basal metabolic rate so that gives me my bmr
calories to that i can add up to 30 additional calories if i'm sedentary 50 percent if i'm
moderate and 100 percent if i'm active the problem is most people confuse being busy
with activity so to be moderately active for example i would have to have some activity in my
my daily life like do i am i a nurse in a hospital and then i would have to get regular exercise
outside of that so unfortunately in our lifestyle today a hot pretty high percentage of us actually
are sedentary so again let's use that example of a woman who's five foot four and moderately active
her ideal body weight would be 120 120 times 10 is 1200 if she's moderately active she can add up
to 50 percent of those bmr calories which is 600 and her total energy needs would be 1800 calories
now keep in mind she could be consuming more energy than that and that slight increase in energy
can cause weight gain maybe not instantly but over a period of time so i'll give you an example
if she requires 1800 calories a day and just eats 1900 calories a day she'll gain 10 pounds in a year
and quite honestly that's the way most americans gain weight it's what i call the insidious weight
creep all of a sudden your clothes are a little bit tight we blame the manufacturer when the
manufacturer we have these increasing calories that are creeping up now what about a man a man who
is five foot 10 and sedentary ideal body weights 166 166 times 10 is 1660 if he's sedentary he only
gets to add 30 percent so 30 percent would give him a total energy need of 21 58 again remember if
you're trying to lose weight you got to cut between 500 and a thousand calories per day now what about
if you're underweight you need to gain well it's the reverse you would add 500 to a thousand calories
per day now what about protein intake protein intake little bit more difficult so you might want to
get out a calculator and a piece of paper and a pen it's 0.8 0.8 grams per kilogram of ideal body
weight it's not based on what you weigh it's based on what you should weigh because again remember
protein is needed to build and repair lean body mass so this 120 pound woman ideal body weights
120 and to go from pounds to kilos you divide by 2.2 and that'll give you 54.5 kilos 54.5
times 0.8 gives her a total protein need of 43 now rounded up to 44 grams of protein per day
honestly that's very easy to get in a traditional american diet so let's use our male example as
well he's five foot 10 ideal body weights 166 i got to get that to kilos i divide by 2.2 and he's
75 kilos 75 times 0.8 is 60 grams and again very easily met by most dietary plans an exception to
that might be if you're a vegan so if we're using our deck of cards three ounces of meat
size of a deck of cards is equal to 21 grams of protein so a serving of meat for our our female
example is almost half of the protein that she needs per day and that's again very easy to get in
an american diet so most of us as typical americans if you're a carnivore chances are you over consumed
rather than under consumed protein now what if you have an older person in your life are there any
tools out there or if you're a senior yourself and you're concerned about your dietary requirements
i would encourage you to consult what is called the determined questionnaire on the website of the
american academy of family physicians it's an easy to use validated screening tool designed to
determine nutritional risk in older individuals so what it would do it was would ask some questions
about diet and self-administered it would ask some questions about diet and that would be the d
portion so for example it might ask the question how many meals do you eat per day and if you eat
two or two or less meals per day you're going to increase your nutritional risk it would ask
about weight loss have you lost weight in the last six months not and not as part of a purposeful
weight loss plan so again it's a great validated tool and again you can find it on that particular
website the goals of nutrition assessment are to provide you a baseline requirement of nutritional
needs tolerances limitations and the ability to calculate basic nutrition needs so let's try
and pull all this together with an example we have a woman she's five foot four and she currently
weighs 180 okay so you're thinking in the back of your mind hmm 180 is probably not her ideal
body weight so let me figure this out she should weigh 120 so that would tell you from the beginning
she's got about 60 pounds to lose she's sedentary with high blood pressure she doesn't drink any
alcohol but she drinks black tea calorie needs to maintain her weight would be ideal body weight
times 10 1200 she's sedentary so we add a third somewhere in the range of 15 to 1600 calories per
day to lose weight and to do an effective nutrition assessment she would need to do the following
we would want her to measure her waist circumference to check her risk of prediabetes
with the approval of her physician we might want her to walk three miles a day to burn about 300
calories and why is that the case her calories are already reasonably low to maintain her weight
and so one of the strategies would be if i can get her to move i don't have to restrict her food
quite as much so she could walk three miles per day to burn 300 calories and i would want her to
reduce her energy intake by about 200 calories per day to reach the 500 calorie per day goal that
we're looking for because she's hypertensive we would want her to include the principles of the
dash diet to help to control her blood pressure more fruits and vegetables low fat dairy she also
is going to need to review her medications with her pharmacist to make sure her high blood pressure
medication does not cause her to lose potassium or to cause her blood sugar to be elevated so again
that's a quick example of what she could do to say i'm going to pull all of this together i'm going
to tie it up in a nice bow and i'm going to have again a little bit more of a nutrition action plan
i think the challenge is for most americans who are sedentary they're not going to be satisfied
with just reducing calories alone because bottom liners are going to be hungry the other challenge
here and it's a real challenge is that most americans are relatively impatient with weight loss
so if we restrict her by 500 calories a day she's not going to have a 10 pound per week
weight loss and again most americans will say gee i was on a diet for a week and i only lost a pound
and rather than feel depressed i would say you need to cheer because the chances are you created
a plan that you can live with because what we're looking again for is progress not perfection
so let's come up with an example for a man he's five foot eight weighs 200 pounds but he is moderately
active maybe has a job as a lineman for a utility company and he goes out and exercises plays hand
ball with his buddies a couple times a week but that was circumference he's gotten out his tape
measure he's got a 44 inch waist and he's been diagnosed as prediabetic he drinks one beer every
single evening and when he actually critically evaluates his diet he's taking in two teaspoons
of sugar in his coffee and he has three cups a day the calorie needs to maintain his weight
would be about 1540 he's moderately active so he can add half of that to his total to figure out his
total daily calorie intake at about 2,300 calories per day but to lose weight he would need to do
the following walk or work out at a gym one hour five days a week so maybe i want him to ramp up his
activity and then he would have an additional 400 calorie loss each day which would total about
2,000 calories for the week and i want him to reduce his energy intake by about 250 calories
per day to total a loss of 1750 per week so 250 calories cut out of a diet really isn't that
difficult to do he could reduce his alcohol intake to maybe one beer per week and save 900 calories
per week but again all of us are going to have our own individual preferences maybe that's not
where he wants to save calories maybe there's something else he could do in his diet for example
maybe he would change from eating red meat to chicken and save some calories that way well
another strategy that he could try is to use a sugar substitute in his coffee which would save 36
calories per cup three cups per day every day he could save 750 calories per week by doing that
again because of his weights waist circumference we might be looking for a low fat low calorie
diet for him and a meta Mediterranean diet plan would be a good fit so when we add up all the
numbers 2,000 calories lost here 1750 here 900 750 he would lose about 5400 calories per week
and lose weight at about a rate of one and a half pounds per week now again he might want to consult
a registered dietitian to make sure he's on the right path or dealing with his prediabetic condition
he's going to need to review his medications with his pharmacist to avoid food and drug interactions
and ideally this is the kind of patient I really love to work with because he's on the verge of a
disease and if we can prevent that disease from actually manifesting itself now he's in a wonderful
position to prevent diabetes and prevent some of the consequences associated with diabetes
okay what about our frequently asked questions I try to eat right and prepare good meals at home
but it's my children and my husband that eat out lunch and how can I know if they make poor
nutrition choices do we have any advice for that well become a fruit and vegetable detective if
you're worried about your children eating well at school you may want to involve them for example
in preparing their lunch or if they eat a school lunch what you may want to do is actually print
off or take a look at the nutrition information online from your school district and help them
to pre-choose before they go you can also become a fruit and vegetable detective almost every type
of restaurant and fast food outlet has fruits and vegetables if you look problem is when we go into
a fast food restaurant we don't look at the menu we oftentimes choose by number and then we supersize
it so what we're actually going to do is just encourage people if they eat out at a fast food
restaurant not to supersize and avoid sweet liquid calories in my experience the average
supersize meal is going to be about 2,000 calories keep that in mind we just went through all those
calculations you go and have one fast food meal that you've supersized and that would be more
calories than I could eat for the entire day another frequently asked question I work very
long hours sometimes 10-12 hours a day how can I incorporate a good nutrition plan into such a
lifestyle and actually when you're doing your dietary analysis as part of this nutrition
assessment process when you get to diet critically look at your barriers we all have them and so a
barrier for someone who works very long hours is they're going to probably need to plan their food
take a little bit of time on a Sunday evening pack up some food stock a refrigerator at work
with yogurt fruits and vegetables and what I usually will say is you know what good nutrition
just doesn't happen for very busy and active lifestyles you actually have to put some forethought
into it so again plan your food and it's as easy as just packing some extra fruits and vegetables
another frequently asked question wow portion sizes are so much smaller than I thought this is one
of the reasons and in my experience one of the driving factors on how individuals don't assess
their diet in a reasonable fashion keep in mind that 50 years ago people ate dessert they ate fried
foods but the portions were smaller so the challenge always is aren't I going to be hungry all the time
if I follow any kind of nutrition plan well no not really because your calorie needs might be
high enough that you would need multiple servings for example of a bread at a meal so you might need
more breads and cereals in the half a cup portion more calorie need the greater your portion sizes
but again a single portion for a starch for example like rice is about the size of the palm of your
hand another frequently asked question is can a nutrition plan be used for children don't they
have special needs like that adults don't and yes children need more calories than adults per pound
of body weight the challenges children have a smaller body weight so calories per pound are
higher but total energy needs are not children need a variety of food and what is unique here
is that children usually have increased appetite during growth spurts parents and grandparents
should not attempt to control children's calories or to count them but what you can do is stress lean
meats low fat dairy and fruits and vegetables and again remember children have this wonderful gift
we're all born with the ability to eat when we're hungry and stop when we're full so please don't
try and aggressively control your children or grandchildren's diet thank you very much
