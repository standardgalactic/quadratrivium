Now, the original design of the cyclotron in which particles spiraled out and the diameter
of the path increased as they went faster and faster, eventually reaches a limit which
is imposed among other things by relativistic considerations, and so the design had to be
modified and it was modified into a kind of machine that was called a synchro cyclotron
by synchronizing, it was possible to overcome some of the problems with continuing to increase
the velocity of particles in the accelerator by having pulses instead of a continuous beam
to have pulse beams and that allowed building a machine that got up to the 184 inch machine
when it was redesigned as a synchrotron, which is easier to say than synchro cyclotron, so
everybody called them synchrotrons, that got up to 195 million electron volts, 195
million electron volts in the late 1940s and this was enough to actually make mesons in the
laboratory, you didn't need cosmic rays to reveal the presence of mesons and so that's when we
found out that Yukawa's meson was not the meson that Yukawa thought it was, when it was
discovered that mesons come in different types, that there are different types of mesons because
we actually had a meson factory, we could actually make mesons and you would think that okay this
is good enough, now we can just settle down and build and do research with these machines and
stop building newer and newer machines, wrong, the reason why it's wrong is because people
were still doing cosmic ray experiments and in after World War II they were getting higher up
there and they were discovering more energetic cosmic rays and more energetic byproducts,
the first generation of byproducts when the cosmic rays first smash into the first type of
atoms that they encounter in the atmosphere, instead of balloons that were going up 30,
40, 50,000 feet, now we're sitting up 80,000 to 100,000 feet and then in the 1950s of course,
in sounding rockets and eventually in satellites, so in the cosmic rays we are discovering heavier
particles that we never saw before, heavy particle means higher energy, as the mass goes up in order
to make that particle in the laboratory, you've got to have a more powerful machine, so if you
want to have an elementary particle factory, you need a more powerful machine, mesons,
that was great, so a lot of good meson physics was done at the end of the 1940s, early 1950s,
but the demand for more powerful machines became greater and there we're now starting to talk
about having to factor the special theory of relativity into your design. In 1952,
at Brookhaven National Laboratory out on Long Island, a machine was built called the Cosmotron
that reached the apparently astonishing figure of 3 billion electron volts, we're not into the
millions anymore, we're now up to 3 billion electron volts and this had a new design in which by
using extremely powerful magnets, we got rid of the spiral part, we now have charged particles
that are in a permanent circle, that is to say a beam of particles traveling in a circular path,
they are electrically charged particles, so they are amenable to being controlled by a magnetic
field, so by using extremely powerful magnets, we can keep this beam of charged particles moving
in a circle and every time they go around that circle, we give it another boost, actually two
times around each circle, every half circle they get another pulse of energy that accelerates them
up to the limit of the design and the available power, so as I said in 1952, we're talking at
the Cosmotron, we're talking about 3 billion electron volts, at Berkeley in just within a year
or two, they put into operation a 6 billion electron volt machine that they called a bevetron,
I don't know who's paid to make up these names, the bevetron and the bevetron achieved historic
status because it discovered the antiproton.
