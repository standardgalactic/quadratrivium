And this represents another stage, so to speak, in the evolution of history, deliberately using the writing of history as an attack dog.
Negative image, but I particularly apply it to two very influential French intellectuals of the period, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.
Foucault wrote a series of studies, histories of social institutions, cultural institutions in the West, the penal system, sexual values,
and in fact two books that look at the conceptual, the underlying conceptual structure of reasoning in the West,
from the Renaissance to the 20th century, and his motive for doing this was trying to identify what he considered the power relationships in society that get mapped onto institutions,
including the institution we call knowledge, and including the institution that we call scientific knowledge, that it too is vulnerable to cultural influences.
They just think that they are being objective, but in fact they cannot escape these broader cultural influences.
Derrida was the leading figure in what was called deconstructionism, which was to the 1970s and 80s what structuralism was to the 1960s and 70s,
and Derrida argued that all our response to experience was analogous to reading a text, and reading a text is an open-ended experience, Derrida argued,
very powerfully argued that there is no such thing as the meaning of the text, that every reader and in fact every writer creates a text that is open-ended in terms of its meaning.
It does not mean that any meaning goes, but that there is no way to limit in advance what is a viable interpretation of a particular text.
We use the word text metaphorically and we say now let's look at buildings as text and try to read the building and try to understand why was this building built here and why was it built in this shape,
what was the design, what is this design of this building reflect, and that opens us out into a world of politics and social values and economics,
and there is no single correct story to tell about this, so Derrida's deconstruction, which is a form of analysis which essentially opens up previous boundaries of meaning and values,
so that now we start looking for meanings and values much more broadly, tremendously influential in the 70s and 80s, and in particular it's what sparked the science wars,
because applied to science it means that scientific theories are interpretations not different from novels, interpretations of experience except of course that scientific theories are anchored in prediction and control,
but prediction and control does not guarantee truth, and therefore science is not converging on the truth, science is not a privileged form of knowledge and scientists have no right to be treated as if they were the only people in society who are moving towards the truth.
This is what gave rise to the science wars that I've mentioned in early lectures of the 80s and 90s when scientists, so to speak, counterattacked and tried to argue that these social science critics of society were arguing out of ignorance.
In the 1990s there was a flip back to objectivity because it was recognized, it was again being argued that deconstruction is socially destructive, and it encourages fascism in the sense that it encourages believing that social institutions have a priority to the individual,
because if individuals are a product of their society then they have no privilege basis to say you may not manipulate me, and so especially in France in the 1990s and increasingly throughout Western Europe and the United States in the 1990s and early 21st century
deconstruction has passed out of favor and objectivity of some sort is what everyone is once again looking for.
Thank you.
