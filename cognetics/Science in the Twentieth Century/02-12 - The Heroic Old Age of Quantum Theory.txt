And that makes sense.
The other one may require a little more thinking,
but this pair makes sense.
If you know exactly where something is,
that means it's essentially stopped.
You have to stop it to know exactly where it is,
in which case it's not moving, it has no velocity.
It's lost its velocity.
If you want to know its velocity,
you have to let it move,
in which case it doesn't have an exact position,
it's covered a certain amount of distance
in order to have a velocity.
So the uncertainty relations
is that you cannot know
with unlimited precision.
There's a limit to the accuracy
with which we can know these two.
So, big deal.
Ah, but it turns out,
and this is one of the ironies, perhaps,
of nature, that those are exactly
the pairs of information that you need
in order to have a deterministic theory.
So if the uncertainty relations
are facts about nature,
then that means that nature, ultimately,
is not deterministic.
If, on the other hand,
they are merely the expression
that with our big, clumsy fingers,
when we do experiments, we jolt electrons
and so we can't get perfect,
then that's a different story.
In the first few years,
many interpreted the uncertainty relations
as a fact about our ability
to gain information from nature.
So as a fact about
our interaction with nature,
that all of our experiments
inevitably disturb nature.
But eventually, it came to be understood
that the uncertainty relations
are a fact about nature.
That it is not
there is no perfection in nature.
Nothing can be perfectly
still.
Nothing can be perfectly still.
Nothing can have
exactly a certain energy level.
It must always tremble.
In the 1980s,
this will become a critical feature
of what's called inflation theory
and cosmology, and we'll be talking about that.
Bohr responded to this
with two principles
that became
associated with quantum theory
in its heroic phase.
The first of these was called
the complementarity principle,
the principle of complementarity.
And here, again,
we're on deeply philosophical grounds
that not all physicists were comfortable with.
Then or now,
Bohr argued that
the ability to explain natural phenomenon
was constrained
by our ability to form concepts.
Our concepts come from
experience, but we cannot
experience photons.
We cannot experience electrons
and neutrons and protons.
We cannot experience atoms.
And so, inevitably,
we have to use complementary
concepts like wave and particle
in order to explain
the full spectrum of behaviors
that nature reveals
at a level that we cannot directly experience.
Bohr's argument was
that our thinking
is not unlimitedly creative,
that our thinking reflects
our experience.
When we try to describe
things we cannot experience,
we have to use concepts derived
from what we do experience, and that's why
wave-particle duality emerged
because we were trying to describe something
so far beyond our experience
and we were forced to use
concepts that were logically
exclusive of one another, but which complemented
one another and gave us an overall
comprehensive picture.
This
complementarity principle carries
with it
a fuzzy yin, so to speak,
of the relationship
between subjective and objective,
of mind and world,
of subjective and
objective.
Subjective and objective, mind and world.
Where do you draw the line?
The complementarity principle
says that it's not possible
to draw that line except arbitrarily.
We don't know where the world
ends and our thinking about it begins.
We may want to believe that we are
thinking about the world as it is
in itself, but in fact, we're thinking
of where science is describing the world
as we experience it.
And the final piece in the puzzle, 1929,
Bohr and Heisenberg collaborated on
the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Very simple at this point.
That nature at the most
fundamental level is probabilistic.
It is not
deterministic.
And this was what Einstein to the end of his life could not
accept, that nature
ultimately was not deterministic.
The probabilistic interpretation of quantum
mechanics, that physical description
at the subatomic level is
necessarily probabilistic only
and not deterministic is what we
mean by the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Many physicists just ignore
the interpretation and use the theory.
But the theory itself
no one has ever
formulated
an alternative interpretation that's better.
So we will
in the next lecture turn to
the working stage of quantum theory
and see how all of this plays out
when we start to apply
quantum theory scientifically.
Thank you.
