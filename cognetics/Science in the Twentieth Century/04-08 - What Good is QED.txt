second philosophical aspect of quantum electrodynamics was that it provoked a
decades-long debate whose front men were Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein that
between 1929 and and roughly speaking 1953 two years before Einstein died
Einstein and Bohr engaged in an extended dialogue almost never face-to-face but
at conferences and and through papers and through correspondence but
primarily through articles that and correspondence Bohr and Einstein and
lots of other physicists participated in this on the margin the Bohr and
Einstein argued about fundamental issues with regard to the relationship
between science and reality. What is the object of scientific theories? What are
scientific theories telling us about? According to Bohr it's telling us about
our experience. According to Einstein is telling us about an independently
existing external reality and that the goal of science is a theory that cap
that somehow gives us an insight. Einstein like to use the phrase lifting a
corner of the veil. Scientific theory should lift a corner of the veil that
separates us from seeing reality and Bohr you remember the principle of
complementarity was deeply committed to the idea that we can never lift the
veil that we can only interpret our experience using the concepts that come
to our minds based on our experience and so that is one limit. The second issue
between the two was how deep does causality run? Bohr was quite committed
to the view that quantum theory is as deep as you can go and there's no
causality in quantum theory in the classical sense therefore there cannot
there is no need to look for a causal theory of nature that is below the
quantum level. Einstein believed that quantum theory works no one can argue
with the fact that experimentally it works it is an empirically validated
theory exquisitely accurately validated theory and its predictions about how
subatomic particles behave but he believed that there was another level of
reality so to speak beneath the quantum level that was fully causal and
deterministic of which the quantum level was a statistical projection so to
speak and and there were a small number of physicists that sided with
Einstein and tried to find what they call hidden variables that is to say
non below the quantum level so that quantum mechanics would be statistical
merely because we didn't know the underlying causal mechanisms. Bohr
rejected that as a kind of hopeless classicism or romanticism as if the
commitment to causality and determinism was some kind of religious commitment on
the part of Einstein and de Broglie and Schr√∂dinger and a number of other
physicists of that generation but the overwhelming majority of physicists
embraced the Copenhagen interpretation which says that our theories quantum
theory is probabilistic not because it's the best we can do at this time
because as far as we can tell that's the way reality is and finally the third
issue between them was how deep does the special theory of relativity go you
remember in the preceding lecture I mentioned that the special theory of
relativity conflicts with quantum electrodynamics in the sense that quantum
electrodynamics quantum theory generally seems to allow some kind of physical
influence to propagate instantaneously whereas the special theory of
relativity says that no signal can travel faster than the speed of light
in a vacuum that that's an absolute limit to the speed with which
physical influences can manifest themselves so causality can't work
any faster than that information cannot be transmitted any faster than that no
signal can be transmitted faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. Light moves
slower in a medium like air or water or glass than it does in a vacuum that's
not a problem to go faster than the speed of light in glass but it is a
problem no it would be traumatic if physicists discovered that you could go
faster than the speed of light in a vacuum but in quantum electric in quantum
theory these probability functions which so let me give you a concrete
illustration to make sure we we're on the same page here I measure the position
of electron in my laboratory we'll call it at time zero and I notice that it
at time zero this electron is right here subsequently I want to know where the
elect where that electron is now a minute later a second later a nanosecond
later I write out the equations and quantum mechanics that say well given
where the electron was given its mass given whatever forces were acting on it
and its motion at the time that I mentioned it with whatever precision I
have I get a probability distribution well one possibility is there's a
non-zero probability that that electron is near Jupiter at the moment
