So, the functionalist perspective, and we're going to see in sociology that this is very
important, a very important school, the functionalist perspective was the center of proglinguistics
and in the early, late 1940s, early 1950s, American descriptivism which had morphed into
structuralism and one of the most eminent practitioners of structuralist linguistics
was Zellig Harris at the University of Pennsylvania who founded in fact the first department of
linguistics in an American university at the University of Pennsylvania. Zellig Harris
was an eminent structural linguist. One of his students was the brilliant young Noam Chomsky
who from 1951 having graduated from Penn and moved to Harvard as a research fellow for
four years where he heard and interacted with Roman Jacobson who was one of the leaders
of the Prague School of Linguistics and Chomsky synthesized in his own innovative way the work
of Jacobson and American descriptivist structuralist linguistics so that he in some sense stands
in the descriptivist structuralist tradition influenced by Jacobson and in 1957 published
a portion of his doctoral dissertation as a book called Syntactic Structures which almost
immediately made him the center of linguistic activity in the United States and subsequently
internationally. Chomsky is, Chomsky's influence redirected linguistics in the same way that
disorsors did but in a different direction. Chomsky curiously, Chomsky holds that language
has nothing to do with, nothing intrinsic to do with communication. Chomsky is not interested
at all in semantics, he's only interested in syntactics, in the rules that guide language.
Chomsky is wildly anti-behavioral, his 1959 review of Skinner's book Verbal Behavior was
one of the things that undermined behaviorism at the peak of its influence showing that Skinner's
theory of language was nonsensical and using a very simple illustration namely that a child
does not simply learn to mimic sounds that at a certain age a child can form an indefinitely
large number of sentences that they never heard, that at a certain age somewhere around
two to three years old a child gets it and can formulate sentences that they have never
heard. So behaviorism is incapable of explaining language acquisition and Skinner who was no
linguist, Skinner had the arrogance to publish a book on language acquisition which Chomsky
demolished through his anti-behaviorist, he was anti-semantics, he was anti-boisian
because he said no, no, no it is not the case that each language is an encapsulated way
of experience in the world, there is not a plurality of languages in the world, that
is an illusion created by what he called performance, the way people actually make noises with
their mouths, what he was interested in was competence, linguistic competence and that
he claimed was universal, that underlying our speech was a hardwired competency, a biological
capability, a neurological capability that is linguistic and that therefore all languages
at the surface are really one language deep down, that if we understood the neurological
logic of language, the neurologic of language, of the language competence then we would be
able to inter-translate one language into another without any loss of meaning, notice
he is not really interested in the meaning anyway, he is interested in syntactic structures,
in the rules, so that is the sense in which his structuralism comes in here, but Chomsky
is a startling figure in that he goes against the tide of 20th century thinking in many
different ways, not least of which this leveling phenomenon, maybe leveling all languages to
say that they are all really the same deep down and in many of the social sciences the
emphasis has been towards pluralism and he is a universalist, he really is a Cartesian
rationalist in his linguistic theorizing, deductive, mathematical modeling, there is one right
answer, there is one underlying universal language and that our task as linguists is to identify
the deep structure of language, to find the transformation rules among the grammars of
real languages, of actual languages, to get down to the underlying absolute linguistic
structure, this has turned out to be an extraordinary, extraordinarily prolific and fertile research
program which dominated linguistics in the 1960's and 70's and even into the 80's.
