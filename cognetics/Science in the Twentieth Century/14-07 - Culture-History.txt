Butcher 28, Humanity, Culture, History
Now we have a greater sense of an odyssey, I think, as we move from one intellectual adventure to another.
In the last lecture, we had a brief but hopefully suggestive overview of anthropology and archaeology in the 20th century.
In this lecture, we're going to be looking at history as a science and its evolution in the course of the 20th century,
and in the next lecture, linguistics. But history seems particularly puzzling to us.
We say, can history really be a science? You can't do any experiments, and it would seem not to have repetition,
which is a typical characteristic of science. It has to be replicable. You don't have replication.
In fact, history never repeats itself, and George Santiana's famous comment that those who are ignorant of the past are condemned to repeat it
has to be a lot more sophisticated than it sounds, because of course the past never repeats itself, circumstances change all the time.
And what lessons we learn from history, how we can apply lessons learned from history to the future is quite a complicated question.
So history seems, on the one hand, clearly not to be a science, an Aristotle in antiquity,
and for thousands of years later because of its influence on western culture, had dismissed history as a science because it is not universal.
It is particular. History describes particular events, and they do not have a universal and necessary character.
For Aristotle to be a science, you must have universal and necessary character.
You must, because the function of a science is to identify universal and necessary principles that are causally responsible for phenomena.
And that is the basis of scientific explanation.
In the Renaissance, the Renaissance humanists, who are in fact the creators of modern scientific historiography, writing of history,
the Renaissance humanists demerred and said, on the contrary, history is a science precisely because it is contingent and particular,
because that's what reality is like.
Contrary to the rationalistic, deterministic interpretation of reality, the humanists said,
history is not only a science, it is the fundamental science, it is synonymous with true philosophy,
because by getting history right, we have the only platform on which to stand in order to understand human being in the world.
Well, the humanists were crushed by the modernists in the 17th, 18th and 19th century,
who reintroduced rationalist philosophy in the guise of science, materialistic deterministic science,
which looks for universal principles that are responsible, causally responsible for phenomena.
And in the 19th century, history writing reflects this materialistic determinism of the sciences generally.
On the one hand, there are two models for what you might call absolute history,
or scientific history in the 20th century.
One is a Hegelian model, one that goes back to the German philosopher Hegel,
one of the greatest intellectual influences on 19th century thought.
Hegel believed that there was in fact a necessary deterministic universal law of historical development,
and that this worked itself out through the entire history of humanity.
So Hegel himself wrote at great length on universal history, and in the Hegelian mode, Arnold Toinby, for example.
Herbert Spencer in the early 20th century, Oswald Spengler, wrote universalist histories of humanity,
which looked for a universal law that flowed, so to speak,
that was manifested by different cultures, replacing one after another in the way that they did.
That was one model, which in the 20th century has pretty much fallen into discredit,
as far too speculative and unscientific, although Hegel thought that it was.
The other model was that of a German historian named Ranke, Leopold Ranke, later Leopold von Ranke.
Ranke had his conception of history, of what made history scientific, was just getting it right.
Scientific history was history that was accurate, and Ranke was responsible, at least significantly responsible,
for changing the meaning of a word that we use all the time, the word objectivity.
Until the middle of the 19th century in Germany, objectivity meant more like what we mean by subjectivity.
That is, they meant the object of human consciousness, so it was what we were conscious about.
