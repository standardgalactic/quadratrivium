Through Ranka, objectivity meant the impersonal.
History writing was scientific if it was objective.
In his own phrase, it was,
showing how things actually happened.
That is the goal of scientific history.
Now, I focus on Ranka because he was a tremendous influence,
because, so to speak, scientific history writing goes back to Ranka
techniques that he insisted his students master in order to get it right.
How do you study documents? How do you interview people?
How do you collect data so that the historian can uncover what really happened?
He also was tremendously influential on American historians
in the second half of the 19th and the first third of the 20th century,
many of whom studied with him or with his students.
Interestingly, primarily the Americans really misunderstood Ranka,
because it was closer to Hegel.
When he said studying how things actually happened,
he meant getting down to the underlying essence that caused them to happen in that way.
But the American historians didn't take it that way.
They talked about, oh, we've got to get the truth.
History historians have to tell it truly.
They should not be biased.
The goal of the scientific historian is not to be a propagandist.
It's not to have an interpretation of the past.
It's to just tell it like it was.
That is what constitutes scientific history.
And at the end of the 19th, the beginning of the 20th century,
this is what history writing was about as the ideal.
This is what the profession of historian was about.
There were some demurrers, in particular in America,
Charles Beard and Carl Becker in around 1910,
argued what the kind of line that Franz Boas took at the same time.
Namely, there's no such thing as an objective perspective on the past.
Every historical account reveals interpretive prejudices,
that all history writing reflects value judgments on the part of the historian.
Because after all, in order to tell the past as it happened,
you would have to say everything and not leave everything out,
and you can't do that.
You cannot have a map that is one inch to the inch.
Then it would be the terrain.
So, since every map is less than the terrain it describes,
there is some value judgment being made saying,
well, given the purpose of this map,
I can leave all of that information out,
but I've got to get the information that matters right.
Beard, in particular, in 1913,
published a book that is not very well known today except to history students,
but at the time was epical and had tremendous influence.
He published a book called The Economic History of the U.S. Constitution,
which argued that the Constitution was the product of economic rivalries
among the parties that created the Constitution.
It was not an expression of political idealism.
So, it was a history that was out of tune with the idea
that there is a single correct story to be told about the past.
Now, World War I blew up the entire prospect of a scientific history.
In the following way, in 1914,
the German government issued a manifesto called To the Civilized World
that justified Germany's starting the war
and Germany's conduct in the first year of the war.
And this manifesto was signed by virtually every leading intellectual figure in Germany,
in spite of the fact that it was blatantly propagandistic and factually incorrect.
Einstein was notorious for not having signed it,
and this caused him great grief in Germany subsequently.
So, this was very upsetting to Western intellectuals
that so many intellectuals in Germany were clearly willing to sacrifice their objectivity
to nationalistic ends.
But the British and the French revealed that the British and French intellectuals
also signed on to their government's agendas,
demonizing Germany, demonizing the Germans for a decade after the war
and not allowing German scientists to participate in international conferences.
In America, as soon as we approached entry into the war,
the U.S. government created a national historical service.
And American historians, almost without exception,
Beard was one, Beard and Becker were two, for obvious reasons,
whose job it was to create disguised propaganda,
justifying America's entry into the war and justifying the Allied cause in the war,
including high school materials to put the war in perspective for high school students
and for the general public.
So, attempts were made to get it factually correct,
and the theme was, this was very distressing to put it mildly.
