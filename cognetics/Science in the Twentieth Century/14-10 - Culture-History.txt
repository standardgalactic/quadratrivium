Not just relativism in the sense of history writing, but using history to debunk the whole idea of objective knowledge, including objective knowledge in the physical sciences.
So the 1960s through the 1980s, that 30 year period becomes one in which history was used subversively.
That is, the history was used to undermine the entire modernist project, the modernist project, the 17th and 18th century scientific revolution based on the idea that reason, that rationality is the means by which progress can be created.
And histories, the objective histories, objective histories had embraced this project and had continued the idea, had depicted, so to speak, the march of reason, the scientific revolution, a 20th century term.
The scientific revolution as the beginning of when human beings began to empower themselves to determine that they were going to live better and make better people by creating better environments for people and giving people more power.
The 18th century called the Enlightenment at the age of Thomas Paine's book, The Age of Reason.
And so here in the 1960s, the fact that we have a consensus growing among many intellectuals that the entire modernist project is flawed because it is based on a mistaken conception of objective knowledge, including science, the most powerful form of knowledge in the western world, is very subversive.
And history becomes the wedge that was used to open this door. Let's just remember that when I was talking about the 1960s, and very different from America in the 1990s and early 21st century, the 1960s were a decade of anti-establishmentarianism,
of anti-establishment protests, the civil rights movement, obviously, the Vietnam War protest movement, obviously, the consumer movement, the environmental movement, the anti-multinational corporation movement.
There were any number of causes that could get 100,000 people into the streets in various cities in the United States in the 1960s, including, of course, attacking not just the Defense Department because of its role in the Vietnam War, but also science and engineering for being collaborators with the Defense Department.
And, in fact, one-third of all the engineers in the United States were, in the 1960s, employed by prime defense contractors, and perhaps another 10% or 15% by secondary contractors, and even more in government laboratories, so that there was a good point that, from the perspective of the activists, claiming that science and technology, science and engineering, were collaborators with the establishment at a time when
the establishment was in bad odor in the minds of many people, especially young people, but this rapidly spread because what happened in the 1960s is that an intellectual consensus grew outside the sciences, that there was a lot of merit to this attack on the modernist program.
And what's interesting, particularly interesting to us, is that the history of science and the history of technology, the writing of the history of science and the writing of the history of technology played fundamental roles in this subversive development.
I don't mean subversive and negative. I mean, it's literally subversive in the sense that it undermines existing commitments and prejudices. Well, because objectivity is an interpretation. It's not a fact.
And how did that happen? Well, in 1962, a historian of physics named Thomas Kuhn published another one of these books that has an epical intellectual influence. This is called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.
It's a short book that does not require any special training whatsoever to read it. It was deliberately written that way. And what's interesting is that Kuhn was asked to write this book by the people who were anti-relativists and who were, in fact, the editors of something called the Encyclopedia of the Unified Sciences, which was supposed to show that there is a common logic that runs through all of the sciences and the
logic that this logic gives us, in fact, objective knowledge. And Kuhn had a track record as an excellent historian of physics, and so he was asked to write this book in effect to advance the cause of the Encyclopedia of the Unified Sciences.
The very first paragraph Kuhn announces that when he, as a mature historian of science, actually was encouraged to step back and look at the history of science, he discovered that the history of science clearly reveals that scientific theory change is not a logical process.
