contemporaneously in the United States the figure of Franz Boas emerges as an
important intellectual influence and we've seen Boas as an influence in
anthropology and he'll be back as an influence in sociology. Boas in the
first third of the 20th century was extremely influential in linguistics
because of his relativist cultural perspective and he was among the first
to start studying languages other than the classical and and romance languages
and he he focused on American Indian languages and and sent his students out
to study American Indian languages carrying with them the same set of
values that he promoted in anthropology namely respect for the integrity of each
cultural entity in its own right. Two of his students so to speak, two of his
intellectual students Benjamin Worf and Edward Sapir formulated a hypothesis
consistent with Boas' work influenced by Boas that each language represents a
certain way of experiencing the world. It's not just by the way that the French
make these noises and the Germans make these noises and then Navajo make those
noises but that each language reflects a certain way of experiencing the world
which by the way causes a heck of a lot of grief for translators because you
can't then translate one language into another directly because you're really
translating one way of experiencing the world into another and so in one
language verbs may be more important than nouns in another language time
endings may be more important than than in another language and so it's very
difficult you can't just translate one language to another if the Sapir Worf
hypothesis is correct. So one line of Boas' influence was the Sapir Worf line
which in the 1920s and 30s was quite influential that languages are
encapsulated in a sense that they represent encapsulated ways of
experiencing the world. To really understand Navajo you have to
experience you have to learn it so that you experience the world as the Navajo
do and the Eskimo do etc. The famous myth that the Eskimos have a huge
number of words for snow and and of course the Navajo would not have that
many words for snow but that turns out to be a bit of a bit of a myth. Another
intellectual student of Boas' was Leonard Bloomfield who was responsible
for shifting the focus of language in a typically American way to empirical
studies that were descriptive. So he looked upon language as a primarily
psychological phenomenon not a social phenomenon he looked at language from a
psychological perspective relating it to in the 1930s the growing influence of
behaviorism and behavioral psychology and adopting the methods of behavioral
psychology to simply describe the way languages are used and that turned out to
be an extremely influential line of thought because from this behavioral
perspective came what's called American descriptivist linguistics which is what
it sounds like. Descriptivism moved into structuralism that is to say trying
to understand the structural rules that guide users in speaking a language what
are the underlying structural rules for the language and that led to as we will
see in a few minutes that led to the work of Noam Chomsky the well perhaps in
linguistics what Chomsky is to linguistics in the second half of the
20th century what Einstein was to physics in the first half of the 20th
century but before we do that I need to bring in another line that turned out to
converge on Chomsky and that is between 1925 and 1950 an extremely influential
linguistic school emerged in Prague in what was then called Czechoslovakia and
the Prague School of Linguistics was a functionalist school of linguistics it
was based on the idea that what a linguist needed to study was the
relationships among the functional elements of a language identifying what
the functional elements of a language were nouns verbs adjectives adjectives
adverbs and then the relationships among of the relationships among those
elements so how does a language function don't worry about what a language is
don't worry about what from a distorsor perspective trying trying to
understand the individual elements of a language what what they are the sounds
forget that just look at how they function so it's like the difference
between knowing theoretically the thermodynamics of a car engine and being
able to fix one
