What happened to objectivity? What happened to the truth?
And in fact, put this together with the collapse of faith in progress precipitated by the slaughter of World War I,
where the incredible death rate for soldiers in the war, because of the terrible,
the poison gas and the machine guns and the trench warfare, there was a loss of faith in progress.
If this is what happens after 100 years of science, after 100 years, 150 years of the Enlightenment, the age of reason,
this is what we do to one another? This is, it's Europeans against Europeans here.
So in 1924, the historian James Harvey Robinson expressed that he disbared that there was any possibility of objectivity in history writing.
History writing was necessarily interpretative, value-based, perspectival.
It reflected a position and interpretation. Yes, you had to get the facts right,
but unless you absolutely repeated the past, which you could not do, you had to be giving an interpretation.
Now, this was very congenial in the 1920s and early 1930s.
This was very congenial. Remember Boas with his culture and personality school and the relativism,
Ruth Benedict, patterns of culture, all of that was very congenial, but in the 1930s, the picture changed.
All of a sudden, relativist historiography, that is to say historiography that looked at,
that gave a particular interpretation of events in the past and tried to justify it with evidence and arguments,
was stigmatized by world events with the depression, with the rise to power of Hitler,
and then the unveiling of Stalin's tyrannies in the second half of the 1930s in Russia,
with Mussolini in power in Italy from the 1920s and Franco from the late 1930s in Spain.
Americans and British and French intellectuals were saying, you've got to take a position on affairs.
You can't say, well, on the one hand, on the other hand, relativism is anti-patriotic.
It is defeatist. It doesn't give people hope. You can't just describe the way things are and try to put them in perspective.
You have to take a position. And while Beard and Becker, but especially Beard, held on to his position right through World War II.
In fact, publishing books that revealed, so to speak, how FDR manipulated the political process to get America into the war,
he was effectively ostracized by the intellectual community that was overwhelmingly pro-war,
once World War II broke out, and pro-American involvement in the war,
and the historian community, which became overwhelmingly centered on, you know, there really is such a thing as universal values.
There really is such a thing as objective history writing, and we've got to commit ourselves to discovering that.
That's what the job of the historian has to be, the German emigre Leo Strauss at the University of Chicago,
especially after World War II, tremendous intellectual influence on objective political science, political analysis,
philosophy, political philosophy, and history writing. He was a towering figure, very, very influential,
on a generation and more, one of his, so to speak, intellectual disciples.
Alan Bloom died relatively recently and is the hero of Saul Bellow's most recent novel called Ravellstein.
That's really the story of the friendship between Saul Bellow and Alan Bloom.
In 1988, Bloom published a book called The Closing of the American Mind, which was an appeal against the relativism of the 1980s,
back to standards, universal standards and objective value judgments.
So this is the climate that in the late 1930s and through the 1940s into the 1950s,
displaced the beard, becker, let's call it, relativist position in historiography.
Objective history writing was back to such a degree that in the 1960 edition of the International Encyclopedia for the Social Sciences,
the entry under relativism suggested that relativism was dead.
Relativist historiography was dead. Objectivist historiography was back.
Now, this is why it's often difficult to make predictions and keep a straight face,
because this announcement came almost exactly when relativism came back with a vengeance in the 1960s.
