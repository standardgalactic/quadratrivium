Did they just die out of depression, seeing how beautiful Homo sapiens were, or they couldn't
compete with them, they couldn't make as pretty baskets, or they could, I mean, I'm
being a little facetious, but this is part of the Neanderthal controversy today.
We do not know at the moment.
There is no, there is a consensus, I think it is fair to say, there is a consensus that
Homo sapiens displaced Neanderthal.
They did not interbreed with them, Neanderthal vanished in Europe, much later Homo erectus
vanished from, the descendants of Homo erectus vanished from Asia, and left not just Homo
sapiens on the planet, but the descendants of one of three East African lineages of humanity
on the planet.
Now this sounds like we're getting to have some reasonable understanding of our evolutionary
history, but in fact the biggest mystery has not been touched on, and we'll get back
to it when we talk about anthropology and archaeology, but we need to confront it immediately,
and that is what the heck happened over the last, between 10,000 years ago and 20,000
years ago, that accelerated the cultural development of Homo sapiens.
The record is quite clear that for millions of years Australopithecus did whatever they
did and did not evolve into hominids.
Hominids evolved two million years ago, hominid tool use and culture and the sites where we
have discovered where they lived and so on, it may seem unkind, but they didn't do much
until 175,000 years ago when Homo sapiens emerged.
Now Homo sapiens didn't seem to have done all that much for the first 150,000 years
that they were around, they were very patient creatures, I mean yes they were more sophisticated
tools, we start seeing more elaborate ritual burials, we start seeing something like art,
but the fact is, and this is only in the last few years, just at the beginning of the 21st
century, recognizing that Neanderthal remains also reflect the use of art and more elaborate
rituals.
Learning from Homo sapiens, maybe Homo sapiens were learning from them, nobody knows where
the transfer was, Neanderthal culture in fact evolved also, they didn't stay the same for
the 400,000 years that they were living in Europe, but the pace of cultural change was
extremely slow until, well it's hard to know exactly when to put, all we can say is 10,000
years ago, astonishingly, 10,000 years ago there is civilization.
The myth that I was taught in high school, that civilization began in the fertile crescent
approximately 4,000 BCE, is just that a myth, in 9,000 BCE there were already organized settlements
with walled towns and trade and mass production, let us say they have found large scale baking
for example, bakeries, so that there were organized life which strongly suggests that
over the last 10,000 years approximately, that all of human culture has evolved over
the last 10,000 years, what triggered that? There is some speculation that speech of our
sort became available to us as a biological capability as a result of the mutation about
30,000 to 50,000 years ago, and that until then Homo sapiens did not have a significant
advantage over Neanderthal, they were different but they were built differently, Neanderthal
was actually much stronger than we were physically stronger than Homo sapiens, but I think that
is the most exciting mystery to reflect on, that everything that we understand by civilization
including very rapidly literature, philosophy, poetry, religion, political systems, dictators,
science, torture, everything was worked out between 10,000 years ago and about 2,000 years
ago, and how that happened and what triggered that in the wake of the, as the last Ice Age
receded, what is the connection, why should there be Ice Ages before, why didn't that
do it, well that is a mystery that I leave with you, for now we are going to move on
to looking at genetic theory in the 20th century and then molecular biology in the 20th century
and the way that those two were intertwined with the evolution of evolution in the 20th
century.
