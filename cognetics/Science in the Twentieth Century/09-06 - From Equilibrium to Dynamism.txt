And that those regions are laced with rift valleys and with volcanoes and continually
subject to earthquakes and this welling up of the magma from the mantle up through the
crust coming out in the mid-ocean ridges, cooling, creating new ocean floor which pushes
the old ocean floor out, that old ocean floor moving very slowly, period of tens of millions
of years between the mid-Atlantic ridge and the time that the crust crashes into a continent
at which point it goes down under the continent, it pushes against the continent but can't
do more than push it a little bit, the continents as I said move about an inch a year and go
down under the continent in a process called subduction.
The continents are about 60 to 80 miles thick, the continental crust is about 60 to 80 miles
thick, the continents and the oceans both sit on, both are about 60 to 80 miles thick
and they both sit on a region that is not quite solid, not quite viscous that on top
of the mantle which is this viscous fluid, extremely hot viscous fluid and this process
of subduction pulls the continental crust, I'm sorry the ocean crust down under the
continents, it goes down through this asthenosphere, this semi-rigid 70, 80 mile region beneath
the continents into the mantle and we'll talk a little bit more about this later.
In the mantle the material is melted, becomes mantle material and comes back up in a circulatory
loop that's a couple of hundred million years long, so in a couple of hundred million year
cycle approximately maybe 200 million year cycle, something like that, the ocean floor
is pulled down under the continents into the crust, into the mantle, melts and comes back
up at the mid ocean ridges where it forms ocean floor again and this pattern is vindicated
by, this hypothesis is vindicated by the magnetometer evidence but now much more direct observational
evidence of this process, of this welling up process and today using lasers and the good
old interferometer, we can actually measure the motion of the continents as they spread
apart and as I said it comes to approximately an inch.
In 1968 Hess's qualitative plate tectonic theory was given a mathematical formulation
by a pair of young geologists at Princeton University and in the 1970s plate tectonics
became the orthodox opinion, orthodox meaning the right thing to believe, that's what the
Greek root means, it was where in 1900 in America the orthodox opinion was that the earth is
stable approaching equilibrium in a constant cooling down situation does not have the energy
to do much dynamically speaking and anything you said against that was heresy.
In the 1970s it quickly became the case that plate tectonics was the orthodoxy and that
geologist who did not agree and there was one prominent one in England for example and
a couple here in the United States that they were considered outsiders.
I remember hearing a geologist in the late 1970s saying you know 15 years ago if you
tried to publish a paper on plate tectonics no American geology journal would publish
it now if you try to publish a paper against plate disagreeing with plate tectonics no
geologists those same journals won't publish those same journals won't publish it.
That's the way orthodox opinion forms.
This is I would suggest a legitimate Copernican revolution in our conception of the earth but
it only begins to capture the difference in our thinking about the earth between 1900
and the year 2000.
In the next lecture I want to focus on the emerging concept of the earth as a system,
a terrestrial system and as a node or an element in an extra terrestrial system and we'll begin
with a survey with an overview of plate tectonic theory to give you some idea of the current
thinking of what the earth is really like.
