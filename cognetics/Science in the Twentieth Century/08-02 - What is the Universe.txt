In 1958, Jeffrey Burbridge, who apparently had some spare time from his work on nucleosynthesis
theory, had noticed that radio telescope observations had revealed that there was startling sources
of energy pouring out of very distant galaxies, that they were equivalent to the amount of
energy of a million or more stars, was pouring out of the most distant galaxies that the
radio telescopes were collecting signals from.
Between 1958 and 1960-1961, these phenomena were studied in some detail, including by
a Dutch physicist named Martin Schmidt, who gave the name Quasar to these objects, standing
for quasi-stellar radiators.
That is to say, these objects are relatively compact by galactic standards, only a couple
of thousand light-years across, and yet they have the energy of millions of stars.
They seem to be associated with the centers of very distant galaxies, and they're all
way out there.
This is bad for the steady state.
The steady state says the universe is pretty much the same in all directions and at all
distances except for local variations, and yet here was a phenomenon which only existed
long ago and not more recently.
So if Quasars, in fact, are way out there, and every galaxy that had a Quasar in it had
a very high red shift, which means it's way out there, it's very far away, very far away
means very far back in time.
So this is an asymmetry between the early universe and the more recent universe which
suggests that the steady state theory is wrong.
Now to jump ahead, it turns out that Quasars are black holes, and that every galaxy has
a black hole at its core, including our very own Milky Way.
It has a massive black hole, which has the massive million or more suns at its core,
but at the time, in the 1960s, it seemed as though the only Quasars that were detected
were very far away, and that was one blow against the steady state theory.
The second was, so you could say, well, that was a misunderstanding, and if that were the
only blow, we could resurrect the steady state theory.
But the second blow was the telling one, and that was the microwave background radiation,
a lovely story.
In 1949, Gamow and his pals predicted that if the Big Bang theory is correct, the theories
in a sense stalled because they can't explain how to build up the elements yet, nevertheless
Gamow and his team predicted that if the Big Bang is correct, then as the universe cooled,
the initial extraordinarily high frequency energy should have dropped off to microwave
frequencies, and that the entire universe should be bathed in the glow of that explosion
at a microwave frequency corresponding to a temperature of about five degrees above
absolute zero, that all of space should be warmed, it should not be at absolute zero,
it hasn't reached absolute zero, may never reach absolute zero, but in fact it cannot
reach absolute zero, according to quantum theory, but the average temperature, so to
speak, of space in all directions, completely uniform, because if the universe started in
a single spot, although there was no space at the time, then everything, the space should
be uniformly filled by this radiation, which nowadays should be detectable in the microwave
range, and it should be convertible into a, those microwaves, the energy of those microwaves
should be convertible into a temperature of about five degrees, well with the sort of
comatose state of the Big Bang theory during the 1950s, nobody paid attention to this prediction,
it's difficult to say that somebody in South Dakota was not paying attention to it, but
effectively nobody paid attention to it, but with the success of the nucleosynthesis theory
by Fowler and the Burbridge's, which they received the Nobel Prize, Hoyle was not included
in that, sometimes interesting why the Nobel Prize committee includes some people and leaves
some people off, they don't like to give the prize to more than three people, and in fact
I don't know that they've ever done that, that would be one thing, but they would have
been easy to leave off Margaret Burbridge because they had prejudice against giving
the prizes to women in any event, but the Hoyle had become involved in a public controversy
over his commitment to the view that the, that the origin of life on earth was extraterrestrial.
