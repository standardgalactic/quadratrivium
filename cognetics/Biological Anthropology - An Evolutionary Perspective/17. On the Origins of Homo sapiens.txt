Having just considered the origins of anatomy and behavior in modern homo sapiens, we are
now going to shift to a different but related question, from which hominid populations did
homo sapiens evolve. Our starting point is one central fact, and that is the extreme
overlap in time between homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis. Remember that our starting
point for neanderthals is 130,000 years ago, and equally significantly our starting point
for homo sapiens is 125,000 years ago, and therefore the two species had a great deal
of time in which they lived near each other in the same geographic regions at the same
time. Now biological anthropologists are not always certain about the kind or type or even
fact of interaction between these two species, but this key fact of the overlapping time
tells us right away that it is unlikely that modern homo sapiens evolved from neanderthals.
If we have these parallel lines or parallel species, it's unlikely that neanderthals
would have given rise to modern humans. Let's look at this time period of overlap and talk
about two different geographic locations, and we'll start in the Middle East. We know that
neanderthals and modern humans occupied the same general regions of the Middle East between
about 90,000 and 60,000 years ago. This was a very busy place during that time period.
One archaeologist refers to this area as a type of central bus station with hominids
and modern humans moving in and moving out. You will recall that we know of good dates,
kaffsa and school in Israel for modern humans at around 100,000 years ago. Well let's stick
with the same country of Israel and ask what type of occupation we have evidence for for
the neanderthals. There are two sites again that we can point to. One is called Tabun
and one is called Kabara. Tabun is dated to about 110,000 years ago. Kabara is dated to
about 60,000 years ago. So right there you have a 50,000 year at least time span for
neanderthals during the time that we have modern humans living in the area. So parallel
lengthy occupations, but there is not good evidence to suggest whether these two species
actually met. There's nothing in the fossil record that tells us either yes or no. There
was direct interaction, so we can only speculate about that. The situation is a little bit
different if we leap ahead in time to around 40, 35,000 years ago and we shift geographic
location to Western Europe. Here biological anthropologists are quite sure that the two
species did interact. Their locations were quite close and there's some evidence of
the same area being occupied very tightly, very close in with different sites, some for
neanderthals, some for humans. You'll recall from a previous lecture that we talked about
Chvette Cave in France with very good evidence of spectacular art by homo sapiens dated to
right around 30,000 years ago. Well in France also we have neanderthal sites dated to the
very same time period. We have bones of neanderthals in homo sapiens, artifacts of both in a tightly
enclosed area and the key fact is that by around 30,000 years ago, just at the time
period of ascendancy if you will of homo sapiens, we have disappearance of neanderthals, extinction
of neanderthals from the fossil record. It may be closer to 28,000 than 30, this is debated
now, but right around that time period and it seems quite clear that this extinction
of the neanderthals was due to competition with modern humans. Now we don't mean to
imply that there was lethal violence or outright hand to hand combat here, competition as we
know in evolutionary terms refers to reproductive success and different types of competition
can account for that. So we may simply be talking about resource out competition by
modern humans against the neanderthals. Now the neanderthals and the modern humans
may have both arisen from the same hominid population and then adapted in different directions
due to different selection pressures early on in their parallel lineages. A plausible
hypothesis takes as its starting point homo erectus which would then have evolved into
transitional hominids with the erectus sapiens mix and then different populations moving
in different directions and we know that we have all of these varied populations between
400,000 and 130,000 years ago and then the neanderthal lineage and the modern human lineage.
So some populations evolved in the direction of modern homo sapiens and some did not. This
is about as specific as we can get in this fuzzy area of ancestry as we talked about last
time. What we want to talk about however are some very sharply drawn models of the origins
of homo sapiens. We are at the stage where we have very clear models to test and we're
working on getting enough evidence to test them. So what I want to talk about for a while
is what the models predict and how the evidence we do have fits into the testing of the models
and we'll see that we are awaiting more evidence as well. So the question before us again where
did homo sapiens come from? The first model we want to consider takes the term the out-of-Africa
replacement model and here there's a claim that all of the evolutionary action at this
point in time for the origins of modern humans occurred in Africa. That African sites are
the oldest and that modern forms spread out from this one particular place and then moved
through the rest of the world and clearly when modern humans moved through other parts of the
world they would have encountered other earlier hominid populations and this particular model
says that replacement occurred that is modern homo sapiens out competed everybody else without
interbreeding with them. That is a key component. There was no hybridization but rather just total
out competition total domination by modern homo sapiens. So what evidence is there? The claim
being focused on Africa we need to return to those sites that we have already talked about
particularly in southern Africa Clausius Rivermouth and Border Cave also the site in East Africa and
Ethiopia of homo. The early dates that have been provisionally assigned to these sites are of course
key because they back up the idea of origins in Africa and we also want to look at this claim
of no interbreeding and we'll see later that we can talk about some genetic data in this regard.
There are people who are quite convinced that this model is correct and stake their reputations
and careers on it but there is an extremely heated response to this. In fact this is a type
of question if you go to anthropology conferences, paleo anthropology meetings that guarantees
a session, a conference session being essentially sold out, standing room only. If you get the
out of Africa people debating with the other side it's really very exciting and very heated.
Now the other side is called the multi regional model. The multi regionalists reject the idea
that the center of evolutionary action is in Africa. They suggest that origins can be found
of modern humans on three continents and you'll know which ones Africa, Europe and Asia. The idea
is that there was gradual evolution in all of these places that can account for modern humans.
We might want to call this in situ evolution. In other words wherever earlier hominid populations
exist they slowly and gradually develop towards modernity in response to local
selection pressures. Now if you think back to earlier lectures you might have a question
and that is if you're dealing with three different locations you know that if there
had been reproductive isolation each population broadly speaking on a continent evolving sort
of on its own there would have been speciation. We would have ended up with three different types
of humans or species and that didn't happen. So a key fact in the multi regional model
is that gene flow had to occur between and among these populations across the continents simply
to prevent speciation from occurring. Now replacement of one hominid population by
another did not occur on this account. Homo erectus wherever it was found developed slowly
through the transitional hominids into modern humans. There is even a claim which follows sort
of naturally that Neanderthals where they were found or at least the earlier part of the Neanderthal
lineage would also have evolved in situ to modern humans. This does tend to be a sticking point
as you can see given what I started the lecture with by saying that there's so much overlap
in time. So we have again as I've said a choice two models different predictions can we test them
that's what the the real prize would be to take the evidence and test the models.
To a certain extent yes we can bring three major sources of data to bear on testing these models.
You can look at the sites and the fossils found at them the skeletons and skulls and what they
tell us. You can use evolutionary theory to assess the logic of the models and of course
you can use genetics we have talked on and off about the fact that a complementary source of
data to the bones are the molecules the genes. Let's start with the sites and the fossils.
Of course precise dating of sites is crucial here. If the African sites Classes River Border
Cave Omo are not actually the oldest ones the out of Africa replacement model is significantly
weakened. If it turns out that Kaffsa and school in Israel do tend to be older show older tens in
the in the dates in terms of the plus and minus problem that we talked about before the range of
dates well then you've got a problem so dating again is going to be the key underpinning of this
part of the out of Africa model. What about the fossils themselves what do the fossil
anatomies have to say? Well the multi-regional modelers depend very heavily on one key fact
that is derived from comparative anatomy and we can call this local continuity in anatomical
features. The idea here is that if you look in any given continental region you should see continuity
of the features in the face and the skeleton in that region through time but not find that
continuity in another region so within region continuity not across region continuity and in
some places we do see this a good example comes from Asia. Let's start at Homo erectus we know
already that there's a long occupation very long of Asia by Homo erectus in the early skulls and
throughout the time period there's a certain type of incisor that is characteristic of Homo erectus
and I'm referring here to the front teeth the certain shape a shovel shaped incisor it's called
and that trait continues in Asia from Homo erectus through the transitional hominids and into the
modern day but it is not found in Africa in Europe and the multi-regional modelists say bingo
exactly this is what we would expect to find they say in fact if the out of Africa modelers were
correct you'd expect to find at the time of migration north from Africa at the time of this
supposed replacement you'd get a break in the sequence of shovel shaped incisors because remember
the out of Africa modelers say that there's no interbreeding so you would have replacement
of the Asian characteristics by the African characteristics doesn't happen however the news
is not all good for the multi-regional model because a corollary of this model is that in Europe
Neanderthals should have evolved into modern humans and we see that that just doesn't work it doesn't
work with the time period it doesn't work with the anatomy there's sharp differences there
so once again the Neanderthal in modern humans parallel lineage problem comes back to haunt
the multi-regional people let's move to our second source of data that is understanding
evolutionary theory and bringing it to bear on the problem at least one reading of evolutionary
theory supports the out of Africa model and it's a very good reading because it's by Stephen Jay
Gould a theorist we have relied upon before in this course Stephen Jay Gould says that the
multi-regional model is very unlikely after all what it's asking us to believe is that disparate
separate populations would have evolved in the same direction despite being subject to different
local selection pressures and he asks that's not really the way evolution works is it after all
he says are there any models that start out with a kind of proto rat he's talking about a rodent
a mammal here a proto rat in some parts of the world and these separate populations all march
in lockstep from proto-ratitude to being true rats he says no there are no such models and why
because nobody according to Gould is interested in positing inevitability of evolution of rats
what he's really saying here is that our human vanity is wrapped up in the multi-regional model
that we want to see this inevitable progression wherever hominids lived towards humanity we
don't want to think of contingency actually being part of our evolution by contingency he means well
things happen to certain way but they might well have happened a different way they happen to certain
way in Africa Gould says supporting the out of Africa model what he believes believed because
he's died is that in fact the the factors that we can bring to bear show that whatever pressures
happened in Africa started off the modern human line got it's going essentially and then we did
replace hominids elsewhere what's useful about this is that it does take us out of looking only at
hominids and humans and it brings other animals and the evolutionary record of other animals and
evolutionary theory into the perspective so i think that it's worth considering lastly the genetic
evidence for a long time the out of Africa theorists relied very heavily on a specific type of DNA
analysis to support their claims a variety of methods had been attempted but one became
quite well known and it it's one that you've probably heard of in some form it involves the so
called mitochondrial Eve now in order to understand who mitochondrial Eve was supposed to be we need
to understand what mitochondrial DNA is mitochondrial DNA which is abbreviated m t DNA conventionally
is a subtype of DNA that's inherited only through the maternal line so immediately you'll know this
is different normally if you reflect upon it you can think that your own DNA is a mix of what you get
from your mother what you get from your father not so with m t DNA it's strictly maternally inherited
and what that means then is that changes in m t DNA through a particular family or lineage
come about through only one source and that source is mutation so those are the two things that you
need to know about m t DNA maternal inheritance and changes through mutation only the combination
of these factors means that we can use m t DNA to trace ancestry back in time at least theoretically
a study was done in the early 1990s that collected m t DNA samples from modern living women around
the globe so these women donated these samples from all different continents and the m t DNA
samples were compared in the laboratory the key finding is that the greatest variation in m t
DNA was found among the women living in Africa now this implied to the researchers that African
people had evolved first why because the diversity is a code for saying that there were more mutations
and it takes time to accumulate mutations so we can think of an equation here more mutations equals
more evolutionary time this was a pretty robust finding so this is another way to say that it
seems like modern humans might have originated in Africa of course the researchers wanted also
to come up with a specific time of origin for all of this m t DNA diversity and they did that
and deduce that the first African woman who was responsible for all this m t DNA diversity in the
modern world would have lived about 200 000 years ago and she was nicknamed mitochondrial eve
now the process by which the date is derived is very similar to the one that we talked about
quite a few lectures ago when we talked about deriving a time at which the common ancestor
might have lived the common ancestor of the african ape and hominid lineage the idea is that
you count up the number of mutations that you have seen in the lab data and then you impose a
clock-like rate of mutation of change over time to get to the modern point of diversity
so this involves all of that technical sort of process and then drawing trees of ancestry
and imposing a time upon them to account for the modern diversity that we have today
and that's how the 200 000 years was come up with however subsequent genetic testing using
m t DNA also cast doubt on the precise method that came up with the 200 000 year old conclusion
about mitochondrial eve of course when the headlines were made about mitochondrial eve
the first thing that happens is you get competing teams of scientists that rush into their laboratories
to try to replicate the process and the outcome and the replication didn't actually happen the
mitochondrial eve theory was very popular until about 1992 when three other labs came out with tests
that showed something very interesting specifically that other trees of ancestry drawn in slightly
different ways could account for the same m t DNA diversity in the world today in other words the
200 000 year old time period was not a firm one and there was even some question about
whether we needed to be pointing to africa or not there's a great deal of technical expertise
needed to work with these molecules in the lab far more than i or most biological anthropologists
have it takes a team working with geneticists suffice to say that there was a lot of dissent
and the whole field of the mitochondrial eve field has been thrown into some doubt
so the question that emerges is is mitochondrial eve a valid concept or is it not well as is usual
in the world there's not a black and white answer there's some yes and some no in part of the answer
first of all it is misleading in my view to imply that there was one specific modern human female
who was the mother of us all and think of what this term this nickname that the headlines have
used has implied that there was one woman progenitor and she was given a very biblical sounding name
to make it even worse i say worse because that's very confusing it gives a misleading picture
much like the term missing link has been misleading in ways that i've described for you before i think
mitochondrial eve gives us the wrong idea after all mitochondrial eve whenever she was
supposed to have lived would have had her own ancestors and remember that there were lots of
women living at the same time as she did some of them would have gone mitochondrally extinct
to see why i'll ask you a question that i often ask my students when i'm teaching this topic do
any of you come from families where there are just sons where the mom and the dad have produced
sons but not daughters in that case the mother of the family though enjoying reproductive success
has no mitochondrial dna inheritance going the mitochondria from that woman will be extinct
because there are no daughters to pass it along to so we really need to envision again a kind of
theme of biological anthropology an original population rather than an original person
however it's interesting to note that even though the other genetic tests have come up with some
variable results they do tend to converge most of them not all of them most of them do tend to
converge on africa between the years of about 400 000 and 100 000 years ago for origins of modern
humans this is true whether you use mt dna or whether you use the y chromosome which as you'll
remember is a marker of maleness and is passed along only in the paternal line so it's a kind
of complement on the other side of the equation if you will so the robust finding does in a broad
sense seem to support the out of africa replacement model when we look overall at the genetics
although there are still questions in the although there are disputes internally
about the results so what we have is a rather chaotic picture when we take the evidence and we
look at the two models so what do we do first of all of course we keep looking for more evidence
from the fossils the dating of the sites and the genetics another possible solution however
is to embrace a type of intermediate model i emphasize that the out of africa model is quite
sharply drawn in contrast to the multi regional model might there be something in the middle
yes there's something called the partial replacement model and in this third model
homo sapiens did originate in africa and did migrate north after having been the initial
modern population but along the way although there was replacement it's a very different
type of replacement it's replacement with interbreeding replacement with hybridization
so that replacement occurred gradually and basically subsumed the genetic material of the
other hominids integrated or absorbed the other populations rather than simply being a flat out
out competition or domination this is a less extreme model it does bring in elements of both
models and it is probably worth a lot of consideration rather than staking out a claim
on one strong side or the other it will be very interesting to continue the type of DNA analysis
that i talked about before when i talked about neanderthals to find out which species which
different species in this whole time period might have interbred with each other that will be very
very important because a lot of these models turn not only on the dating but also on the question
of whether modern humans would have in the early stages interbred with other hominid forms
returning then to a familiar refrain for this course we can sum up our discussion of the two
models by saying that we've produced we biological anthropologists have produced some good testable
predictions this is over and over again been seen to be important that the modeling itself is an
important part of biological anthropology what we can do now is go out and work against these
specific predictions we know what to look for the model set up a framework for us in knowing what to
look for now i want to spend a little bit of time at the end of this lecture summing up not the
lecture per se but this whole last chunk of the course that has talked in some detail about hominids
and hominid evolution because we're leaving the hominids at the end of this lecture so recall that
we started out at seven million years ago with a new find that's in the country of Chad the
sehalanthropus find that is so new that it's not in any textbook as far as we can see this is our
best bet for the starting point of the hominid lineage after the split with the common ancestor
and we have gone through all of the intermediate hominids if you'll call them that uh all the
different populations we know that there are coexisting parallel lineages we've talked many
times about how there's not linear succession but a great deal of evolutionary action going on all
over the place and then we got to 125 000 years ago and that's the origins of modern homo sapiens
well we're leaving our chronology or our timeline right about 30 000 years ago 28 000 30 000 this is
the time when we no longer see neanderthals in the fossil record as i mentioned another way to put
that then is that this is the time period from which homo sapiens become the only human or human
like creature on the earth and of course to us this is a perfectly natural circumstance it's
a somewhat of a change in perspective for us to think any other way for 30 000 years we've been
used to being the humans or the hominid or however you want to put it on the earth but this is
extremely recent in evolutionary time it's an extremely new condition for the human line to have
only one species on the earth and it's really very interesting i have spent a lot of time
thinking about what the world would be like and what life would be like if this weren't the case
if there was some other form let's just say for the sake of argument like a neanderthal
somewhat like us but in other ways not coexisting on the earth with us so we leave the hominid
chronology at about 30 000 years ago and what we're going to do now is to talk about a subject
in the next lecture that's very dear to my heart the evolution of language it is a lecture in which
we will bring back reference to some hominids but we are going to not be talking about the
sort of chronological sequence so much what remains to be seen is to kind of bring together
some of the anatomical and behavioral evidence in one lecture to ask about how speech and language
might have evolved in the hominid lineage
