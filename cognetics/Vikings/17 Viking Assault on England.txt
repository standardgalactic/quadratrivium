In this lecture, I plan to start a discussion on the Viking impact on Ireland, and this
is the first of two lectures that will cover the Viking raids on Ireland and the associated
areas that would include Wittestay, modern Scotland, parts of Wales, the various islands
of northern Britain, the Isle of Man, and so it's essentially the Celtic West as the
medieval chroniclers would think of it.
And it's a little difficult to know when the Viking age ends in Ireland.
The best way to look at it is that it really goes on in one way or another as late as 1170,
which is usually taken to mark a new departure in Irish history with the so-called arrival
of the English.
Really that's 200 Norman knights and a bunch of Welsh bowmen who show up and eventually
carve out what is known as the pale, that is the English section around Dublin, which
corresponds to the old Viking kingdom of Dublin.
And that starts a new division in Ireland eventually between English speakers, the Anglo-Irish
and the Celtic speakers.
So really the Viking age in one fashion or another can be seen as extending from about
790 to 1170.
As a political force in Ireland, the Vikings, who are largely Norwegians, were pretty much
finished by the end of the 10th century.
They were no longer the dominant military force after the so-called Battle of Tara in
980.
So in these two lectures, what I plan to do is look at about the first century or so
of Viking attacks, the establishment of Viking settlements in Ireland, especially around
Dublin, but the other major port towns of Ireland, which all traced their origins back
to Viking merchant towns and originally before that military bases.
That would be Cork, Wixford, Waterford, Limerick and Dublin.
And then in the upcoming lecture, we'll look at that kingdom of Dublin in the 10th century
and its importance and what happened to it and why the Viking impact in Ireland did not
produce results comparable either to England or to the Carolingian Empire, but we get a
very, very different Viking legacy in Ireland than we get in other parts of Western Europe
or in the East and Russia.
So let's start first with a working knowledge of what Ireland looked like on the eve of
the Viking Age, and then we shall switch over and look at that Viking impact in the
9th century and what the situation was by around the year 900, and that's where we'll
close with this lecture.
Well Ireland was essentially just a geographic expression and Western Europeans in the two
centuries before the Viking Age had really two very mixed opinions of what Ireland was.
One opinion was it was a remote island at the edge of the civilized world, inhabited
by a rather barbarous race, noted for exporting Irish wolfhounds, slaves and timber and cattle
and beef and the like because stock raising was the primary activity of most of the Irish
tribes.
On the other hand, there was another image which was that Ireland was a remarkable island
dotted with monasteries and home to many monks and particularly scholars who staffed
the schools of the Carolingian Empire, scholars who knew both Latin and Greek, who are regarded
as among some of the finest writers in the early Middle Ages on not only Christian themes
but adapting classical letters to express the Christian faith and local traditions in
Ireland.
And so you get these two very very mixed images and both of them have a certain amount of basis
in reality because the monastic impact on Ireland was so important.
Well let's first look at that first image a bit and that is what was the political and
economic situation in Ireland on the eve of the Viking Age.
It is difficult to speak of an Ireland, in fact no Ireland actually emerges from the
Viking Age.
In many ways Ireland remains a land divided into kingships, chieftains who differ very
little from their ancestors in the Iron Age, from the time before the Romans when the first
Celts arrived in there and set up these rival tribes.
And most Irish society was really based on family and clan ties, the so-called septwit
that is to what extended family did you belong.
The Irish legends and traditions are extremely conscious in reciting the genealogy of individuals,
knowing from where they were descended, sometimes these were fictitious or at least embroidered,
nonetheless they represent how important dissent was to these people and where they fit into
the political and social order.
For convenience there are five regions of Ireland and we can use the Anglicized names
to describe them.
In the north is now what is known as Ulster, the core of what is northern Ireland.
The west is Conak, more or less the north central area is Meath, that is an extremely
important region that's just to the west and a bit north of Dublin and the kings in Meath,
the kings who emerge out of Meath will be some of the prime opponents to the north.
Meister is in the south and Munster is in the essentially southwest and Munster is pretty
much a peripheral area until the end of the Viking Age when all of a sudden King Brian
Baruma emerges from this, essentially what was just sort of a peripheral marcher state.
Within these regions, which were not really kingdoms, were various dynasts who struggled
for supremacy.
Most of them very conscious of their dissent and their clan associations and those who
could claiming some sort of dissent from the legendary High Neal family that originated
in what is now eastern Ulster and had claimed a right to being the kings of Tara in eastern
Ireland which is an ancient religious seat which is later Christianized by St. Patrick
and his successors and was where a coronation took place that whatever king could claim
that position of the kingdom of Tara which is a legendary kingdom that might have existed
in the fourth and fifth century, he would be acknowledged as High King of Ireland that
is the Andrei of Ireland. That was largely an honorific position and kingship in Ireland
usually took the form of imposing your overlordship on your lesser rivals who paid various types
of token tribute, Baruma, this could be in the form of hostages that were taken in from
competing royal families who were sometimes reared as members of your family, matrimonial
alliances, token tribute, promise of aid and battles against rivals but it is largely a
ever changing political landscape of different competing dynast with a select group who could
claim that dissent from that old legendary Neal clan who were aspiring for High King
of Ireland and this usually went to kings ruling in Ulster or Meath and then the lesser
dynast who would align among these competing High Kings. So there was nothing like a unitary
state, Ireland had never been conquered by the Romans and that is a significant point
I wish to stress at the start. There are no cities, there are no roads, there are no institutions
as you have in England and the Carolingian Empire upon which you can build an urban based
civilization and collect taxes and maintain royal armies and do the sort of things that
the Roman government would do. It never existed in Ireland, Ireland was a peripheral area
to the Roman world, it's known as hibernia in Latin which essentially I always say means
from the Roman viewpoint winter wonderland, it's a remote area, it was tied to the Roman
empire by trade, there's still a lot of work to be done on that, the archaeology is in
its infancy but it was not part of the general Roman world. Instead Ireland received its
contact with Roman civilization through Christianity and that only really began in the 5th century
AD and it is associated particularly with the activities of St. Patrick. St. Patrick
himself was descended from a, he was the son of a Roman de Curie and that would be a member
of the urban elites that ran the towns of the Roman world. He was born in 389 AD and
as a misfortune he got captured in an Irish raid on Britain and was taken back to Ireland
where he was a slave for a number of years and escaped, made his way back to Britain
and eventually ended up in an ecclesiastical career and he was ordained by Bishop Germanus
that is a Saint Germain, the great missionary bishop of Roman Gaul to act as the apostle
to the Irish and so somewhere around the 430s he arrives in what is now Ulster in Uliada
as it's called Eastern Ulster the King there is impressed and he's allowed to preach and
begin the conversion of the Irish and it is a long process. Patrick really initiates
a process rather than converts Ireland. Nonetheless in 444 he establishes an important church
and eventual monastery at Armock which turns out eventually to be the primate of Ireland
and that is a decisive step because within the next century in the 500s the 6th century
AD St. Colombo in particular organizes Irish Christianity along monastic lines. The Irish
not only embraced Christianity they adapted in many ways to their social structure and
monasteries are where leading figures of clans the SEP take over the organization of monasteries
and so the monasteries are really extended clan groups. The monasteries and the monastic
tradition also have a notion of extended travel that was always a long tradition in Irish
society so the idea of going out on travel as a missionary came instinctively to these
Irish monks and monasteries are the sole way of really organizing Christianity in Ireland
because there's no towns. There are bishops in Ireland but they're essentially bishops
without portfolio they don't have towns they don't have incomes and revenues many of them
are rather poor they depend on the court or the favor of the king whereas monasteries
are established as family concerns generally by the head of a clan who retires later in
life after he's had his family and becomes the abbot and then staffs that monastery
with various relatives and kinsmen who automatically owe a loyalty to them based on these family
ties and the result is monasteries take off in Ireland and become the main agents of not
only Christianity but of cultural change and progress and it is extremely difficult to
exaggerate the importance of Irish monasteries. They are the centers of learning the Irish
take very quickly to the literary tradition writing in both Latin and eventually adapting
the Latin alphabet to writing in the native Gaelic that is Irish Celtic language. Furthermore
as I mentioned there's this tradition of travel that was associated at least with the elite
classes in Ireland monks who are coming from prominent families in Ireland have a translate
this tradition of travel as missionary work. Many Irish who are organized along the monastic
rule of St. Colombo go to Gaul. It's really Irish monks who turn those Frankish kings
into responsible Christian kings in the 7th and 8th centuries. It is Irish missionaries
who move into central Germany and preach to various German tribes scarcely converted.
The Irish monks are responsible for conversions in Scotland and Northern England establishing
important monasteries at Iona which is actually an island off the shore of Scotland at Lindisfarney
and Yarrow in Northumbria and one has to think of the Irish cultural orbit is more than just
Ireland today but including a whole set of monasteries and a wide arc along the shores
of Scotland and stretching down the shores of Northern England. All of these monasteries
were in close connection and association. They actually had to renegotiate their entrance
in the Roman church because there were certain differences in discipline but by the 7th century
that Irish church is now integrated back into the Roman Western church. They acknowledge
the papacy and it is from these monasteries that issue forth all of these scholars who
are extremely important in the Carolingian age. There are a lot of popular books one
in particular that says how the Irish save civilization and it's a silly book if I can
give a professional opinion on it. Nonetheless it is rooted in a reality that the Irish played
a disproportionately important role in the cultural revival in the early Middle Ages certainly
of Christian letters and arts on the eve of the Viking age and so when the Vikings attacked
Ireland the only institutions that broke political boundaries the only island wide institutions
really were the monasteries. They were important economic centers because they were endowed
with lands, they were important cultural centers and so when the Vikings attacked and destroyed
the monasteries they are really undermining the cultural and economic basis of the island
far more than they are in say Western Europe or England because there are no real kingships,
political structures and towns as you have in Western Europe. So in many ways Ireland
was one of the most remarkable success stories of the early Middle Ages. In effect they acquired
Roman civilization through Christianity in the monastic organization without the Roman
towns the benefits of a Roman rule or administration. Well with that in mind then what was the attraction
of going to Ireland and how did the Viking raids have a major impact on Ireland in the
9th century? Well Norwegians had undoubtedly been trading with Ireland already in the 8th century.
The trade routes that led them to attack Northern England are the same trade routes that would
lead them into the Irish Sea and certainly to the northern and eastern shores of Ireland
where there are some important trade centers one of them is going to end up being Dublin
but also critical islands such as the Isle of Man in the middle of the Irish Sea
where the Scandinavians settle in force and turn into a major base. So by say 750 A.D. Norwegians
had the ships in the incentive to cross the North Atlantic and learn those trade routes.
They also in the process discovered important islands such as the Shetlands, the Orkney,
the Hebrides. These are islands now associated with Scotland but at the time settled by Irish
speakers or at least Celtic speakers at least since the 7th century and some in the memories
of these voyages survives in the famous legendary voyage of Saint Brendan and the Norwegians
eventually moved into these areas and colonized these areas in the late 8th and 9th century.
So these northern islands were in effect bases from Norway into the Irish Sea and eventually
the Yarls of Orkney, the Earl's of Orkney established a very powerful kingdom in Northern
Scotland. The attacks were overwhelmingly Norwegian as a result. They are coming in
generally from Trondelag that is the northern regions or Trondheim as it sometimes anglicized
and also from the various western sections of Norway famed for their Viking raids.
The first attacks occur in the 790s and there are several references to them. There's an important
attack on 799 on a monastery on the island of Lambie which is just north of Dublin.
The Norwegians land just as they do at Lindisfarney. They take the monks by surprise who are
apparently expecting merchants. The monastery is sacked and when a monastery is sacked that
means usually the peasants are carried off into slavery. Various relics and books are taken away.
Abbotts may be ransomed. Anything of value is removed and this starts a period of 50 years of
raiding along largely the eastern southern shores of Ireland and also on the far west
up the Shannon River. The Vikings hit in Ireland with no political organization beyond these Iron
Age kingships. Furthermore the Irish in terms of their military organization are just absolutely
outclassed. They do not have the kinds of heavy weapons the Scandinavians do nor do they have
anything remotely resembling ships. The Norwegians have complete strategic mobility and their ships
are able to penetrate the crucial river systems such as the Boine, the river leading into Meath
and especially the Shannon River which essentially bisects Ireland and the Scandinavians and Norwegians
the Vikings are able to establish a very important base at Limerick deep in Ireland from which they
raid throughout most of the early 9th century and so with the mobility of moving up those rivers
and moving along the coast they have complete control over the the seas and this is not to say
that the Irish don't know how to sail but far from it they build very very successful fishing boats
and skin boats but they just don't have any warships or cargo vessels to compete with the Norse
and this is a fact of life that will continue really down to the arrival the so-called English
conquest of 1170. The Vikings have therefore complete mobility to strike wherever they wish in Ireland
and they repeatedly raid the monasteries of Ireland. Between 790 and 840 almost every major
monastery in Ireland is sacked at least several times. Armok is sacked at least three times in
the first generation perhaps as many as 10 times in the course of the whole Viking Age
and the destruction is difficult to estimate in any kind of statistical sense but the Irish
chroniclers who are only real source because the monks are the the literate class the Irish
monastic chroniclers give you some sort of flavor of what they saw about these raids and it's almost
apocalyptic literature and it really displays the marvelous Irish genius with words whether in
Latin as the chronicles are or later in Celtic and English and according to the annals of Ulster
this is written about 820 AD this is how one monk sees of the the nature of the Norwegian attacks.
If a hundred heads of hardened iron could grow on one neck and if each head possessed a hundred
sharp indestructible tongues of tempered metal and if each tongue cried out incessantly with 100
ineradicable loud voices they would not be able to enumerate the griefs which the people of Ireland
men and women laymen and priests young and old have suffered at the hands of these warlike
ruthless pagans and what was shocking to the Irish is not just the deprivations of the of the Norwegian
Vikings but the Irish deployed even more the number of apostate Irish that is Irish who had
gone over to the Vikings who are often known as the of the gale god deal that is the foreign gales
that is the turncoats as opposed to the the fin gale that is the the white foreigners the
norwegians who came because within a generation or so of the Irish attacks the Vikings were settling
down into military encampments at the mouths of all the the critical rivers they were establishing
bases that would grow into the cities of limerick into the waterford wexford cork
Dublin and in these towns many of the Vikings took native wives and mixed offspring as well as
Viking capture and fostering of slaves from the Irish population resulted in a large mixed
population these are the sold so-called foreign Irish the gale god deal who are even more ruthless
and destructive than the Vikings themselves these seem to be moving companies of armies of
brigands who also infest the countryside and complicate the political situation uh sometime
around 838 839 uh there is a change in the nature of the Norse attacks and this corresponds very
much with what's going on in the carolingian empire at the same time a man by the name of
turgase as it's usually rendered in the irish uh latin accounts probably representing the
north's name thorghals arrives from norway the irish chronicles call mcking he's probably a
yarrow or a sea king we suspect from one of the western districts maybe horde lond or roga land
traditional areas of viking attacks in any case he's a regal figure who shows up with a large
fleet and he begins to organize these Viking companies into an effective military force
and imposes some sort of authority over all of the north's in ireland he makes his principal
base at dublin and he's active for not even quite a decade but nonetheless his impact is significant
because he probably is best to be credited as the founder of what becomes the high hiberno
north or the irish north's kingdom of dublin uh he imposes order and discipline the raids begin
to change character uh there are political uh arrangements made with some of the irish rulers
that is marriage alliances are conducted uh there's also deals cut with some of the lesser irish
figures who are always fighting not only vikings but their neighbors and what happens in these uh
wars among irish chieftains is the uh defeated are sold off as captives and so in effect uh the
irish warlords are supplying a slave market to the north's towns on the shore and this slave
market becomes a major economic feature of irish life down to the english conquest many of the
slaves are being exported into spain um turkish is also apparently responsible for organizing
attacks into the carolingian empire and uh apparently an attack uh that ended up he somehow
participated in the attack on spain in 844 because we believe that a mission sent to a north
chief or king in a green island in the middle of the sea um this is a mission from the umayid
amir of kordova the muslim ruler in spain who sent one of his top envoys a fellow by the name of
al-gazal who's a polish court here who went to talk to this north king he's the king of the
magis that means heathens and it seems to be this north court at dublin and at the time um
turkish without you know attacking irish kings or busy in slave trade and his wife who is also
known in the sources her north's name is probably un she's usually called um otah in irish accounts
she's there and so she receives the arab ambassador the arab ambassador is a little taken aback by how
forward she is he you know she's oh don't worry you know my husband's out beating up the irish but
he'll be back in the meantime tell me what you're here for uh and um it's one of our earliest uh
insights into the position of at least high class women in scandinavian society which is
is really quite open compared to uh certainly the uh the uh metharanian world well turkish
eventually captured and drowned by some irish opponents uh nonetheless he gave organization
to the north several years after his death a second large scandinavian fleet shows up and these are
danes largely operating out of the english channel they've heard great reports about the slave trading
in ireland which is being developed and they come to ireland and what happens is a remarkable battle
is fought between the danes and norwegians as to who should have the rights to plunder ireland
uh the irish are pretty much out of it in this at this point uh it climaxes in a major battle in
851 at carling ford law and that's uh that's a river system north of dublin and it's a two-day
naval battle between danish and vikings who are called black foreigners for reason we don't know
and norwegians who are known as white foreigners and in the second day the danes on the advice of
some of their irish allies invoke st patrick and win the day and at that point the danes are
joyful and they're going to worship the god patrick uh the irish chroniclers uh make these
sanguine conclusions oh well they've converted to christianity uh no they haven't the danes are more
than happy to sack irish monasteries of course dedicating 10 percent to the god patrick uh
doesn't change their opinion at all about their ancestral gods the danish position in ireland
lasts only a very short time in 852 the second great norwegian fleet we know of in irish chronicles
arrive uh it's commanded by a man named olof sometimes identified with a figure known as
olof the white in icelandic saga and olof brings the danes and norse to heal uh he he seals matrimonial
alliances with several leading irish kings especially the kings of meath and he begins to
organize and systematize the system of uh the exploitation of ireland the norse developed their
military camps into fortified ports and markets and an extremely brisk slave trade springs up
in which the irish slave trade becomes one of the major ways of feeding the markets of muslim spain
olof is followed by his brother uh olof has a very long reign he dies in 871 his brother ivar
takes over and with this family is the consolidation of an effective scandinavian kingdom at dublin
that kingdom lasted down to 902 when the norse were temporarily expelled from dublin by uh
some irish forces but the kingdom is based on control of the sea especially of the economic
uh roots uh and trade routes in the irish sea and the north atlantic furthermore this norse kingdom
very very quickly comes to look outward to the sea the the norse are content to holding the ports
they really have very little interest in penetrating inland and while the irish do not have effective
kingdoms it is extremely dangerous for norse armies to move too far inland and away from the
river systems because ireland is still largely a land of forest and bogs and while the irish
don't have the superior weapons of the vikings they are expert in stealth and in ambush and there
are seven several viking columns who get very badly cut up if they venture too far inland
and so what happens is is the strange symbiosis emerges between the norse towns that appear
on the coast and limerick which is in a sense on the middle uh shannon river is therefore uh linked
to uh the coast which become increasingly the conduits for the export of irish goods slaves
animals hides salted meat and the conduit for the import of goods including better weapons
uh into ireland and the norwegians in effect are controlling that trade uh access furthermore the
norse in dublin extend the range of their control not into the interior of ireland but across the
irish sea and through much of that wider Celtic world it is the norse who uh uh the norwegians a
herberno norse who for instance settle the island of man which becomes essentially a norse colony
they settle the islands of northern scotland the northern shores of scotland uh particularly the
region of cathanus today is overwhelmingly norse settlement and the norse in ireland who have
communication with the danes in england actually are responsible to some extent for dictating the
future of scotland because the danes in york and the norse in dublin which have frequent contact
sometimes hostile sometimes trade routes they don't sail around scotland they take their ships up
to that very very short neck of land between the furth of Clyde and uh the furth of fourth
that 44 mile stretch which is largely uh it's actually the area where the antonine the roman
wall was built the second wall and they'd simply drag their ships across that isthmus of land
and in the process of doing this they have a lot of fun sacking towns along the way like
dumbarton and scotland in this point was about as politically and ethnically divided as ireland
and in the course of this norse uh communication between york and dublin they managed to uh
trash the so-called strathclyde britains uh the the english and northumbria the picks and the only
people left standing in scotland were the irish immigrants the scots who spoke gallic and the
scots essentially ended up getting scotland as the door prize after the vikings had got done
ransacking uh the better organized states and so the um the north's kingdom in dublin then becomes
the lynchpin of a much wider trade orbit and an economic order centered on the irish sea
with trade connections in winter now scotland northern wales and england rather than a kingdom
that is looking inward uh with any kind of aspirations to control the irish and that is an
important fact that is going to dictate the relationships in the 10th century and the
ultimate viking legacy in ireland
