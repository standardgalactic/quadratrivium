In this lecture, I plan to follow up on the issue of the creation of a Rus' state which
eventually gives rise to orthodox Russia. I had discussed the development of trade
routes along the Volga and the Nieper and the shift of the axis of trade from the Volga
to the Nieper somewhere around the middle of the 9th century, somewhere between the
840s and 860s. That shift is of major historical consequence because increasingly the Scandinavians
in Russia will direct their interest towards Constantinople and away from that Volga route.
That leads to two important consequences. First, the Rus' or Varyngians, both terms
are used for the Scandinavians in the east, had come into contact along the Volga route,
particularly in the market towns of the Volga-Arcanate, but also in the Khazar-Kaganate where many
of the merchants and subjects of the Khagan were Muslims. There is some suggestion that
the Rus' were interested in Muslim objects, in jewelry styles and the like. That could
have led the Scandinavian world into closer alignment with the Islamic world and perhaps
lead to some kind of conversion to Islam. Many of the Turkmen peoples along the Volga
route would eventually embrace Islam in the 10th and 11th centuries. Instead, by 975,
that Volga route had declined to really secondary importance and some scholars even argue that
it essentially fell off. There's a number of reasons deduced for this. Part of it is
that the market demand was not as great in the Islamic world. There is what is known
as a silver shortage in the Islamic world, that is there's not sufficient silver specie
to maintain coinages in the Abbasid Empire and its associated states, and therefore there's
less hard currency for export trade, that there's a general decline in Baghdad starting in the
10th century. There's a number of reasons deduced within the Islamic world, but the
other important reason is that the Rus' themselves had relocated their interests along the Nyepur,
and by 975, that is where the action is, on the Nyepur and in contact with Constantinople.
That leads us to the second significant point, and that is the Varyngians or the Rus' are
not going to come in contact with Islamic civilization in any profound way, it's going
to be Orthodox Christianity, Christianity as articulated in the great city of Constantinople,
and that will be a decisive factor in the development of Russia and really in the whole
course of European history thereafter. Well, how does this happen and what are the sources
on this, and in this lecture what we wish to trace is that first century or so that
led to the contact and the very close contact between Varyngians and Rus' in Russia with
the Byzantine world, and then in the upcoming lecture we'll look at the transformation of
these Rus' or these Varyngians into Slavic Orthodox Christians, which is one of the important
ethnic and religious changes of the Middle Ages. Well, according to our archaeological
evidence and our Byzantine accounts, this shift in trade routes occurred somewhere
in the 9th, mid 9th century, and this is borne out by this other source I mentioned, which
is a very peculiar source and difficult to deal with. This is known as the Russian primary
chronicle, it survives in different versions, it's a 12th century account written by a monk
outside of Kiev, who is writing this document in the literary Slavic language. It's usually
known as Old Church Slavonic. This was the language that was created by Cyril and Methodius,
the apostles to the Slavs back in the 9th century, when the first efforts were made
by the Byzantine imperial government to convert the Slavic peoples to provide them with their
own Orthodox liturgy and translations of the Bible so they could set up autonomous Orthodox
churches linked to the Greek church, the Greek speaking church in Constantinople by emotional
and theological ties by common liturgy and by staff or personnel, and the creation of
that Orthodox Slavic language. It is a literary language, it's a language that was in some
ways an artificial creation. Nonetheless, that grammatical reform made that language
into a language almost on par with Greek and Latin. Slavs to this day worshipers in the Orthodox
church consider that Old Slavic church language as virtually a sacred language on par with Greek
and Latin, and you have to attribute this to the success of the Byzantine missionaries in the
9th century. In that Russian primary chronicle survives all sorts of information about these
Rus' princes from a Slavic viewpoint. We have to turn the names from Slavic into Norse, there
are some strange exaggerations, but the account also preserves the treaties that were negotiated
by the Rus' princes with the government of Constantinople. So there's a wealth of information
in this chronicle that we don't really have in other accounts about the Vikings overseas.
Well, what the Russian primary chronicle tells us is that the Rus' had been among the Slavs
fairly early on at some date in the 9th century. There's references to exacting tribute in the
form of furs and slaves. These Slavs rose up in rebellion, they drove out these interlopers,
especially around the region of Novgorod, the north settlement of Holmgaard, and then around 860,
the Slavic tribes who fell into warring among themselves appealed to a Rus' leader, his name
is Rurik, probably a Slavic rendition of the Norse name Eric, a name that also is rendered as
Horik in the Western Chronicles, probably a very common Norse name, they try to associate with
Vikings in Western Europe and it's not very successful, but at any event they appealed to
this fellow Rurik and his followers to come in and rule over them according to customary law.
And in the tradition of the Russian primary chronicle, the Vikings are in effect
invited in as a military warrior caste to rule over the warring Slavic tribes.
They establish a site, a capital at Novgorod, Holmgaard, that is now confirmed by archaeology,
that had been in Norse fortified market town, and furthermore we are told that Rurik sent
two of his boyers as the term in Slavic by which they mean nobles, probably the equivalent term
in Norse would be Yarls, a man named Dier and Oskold, south to establish a position at Kiev
on the Nieper River system. These names in the Slavic are easily rendered by the Norse names
Hulskold, very common name in Iceland, and Diery. And so the Russian primary chronicle
thinks of the arrival of the Norse as merchant princes who've been invited to rule over the
Slavic tribes, bring order to confusion. And there's a bit of truth to that. It's also a way
of assuaging later views about this conquest, the hard feelings that the Norse came in and
actually took slaves and built these fortified post and imposed tribute, and so there's been a
fair amount of retelling in this story, but the account in the Russian primary chronicle
is well borne out by another set of traditions, and that is what Byzantine historians tell us
about these Russovaryngians at the same time. It seems that these two figures who were sent to Kiev
as agents of Rurik took it upon themselves not only to build a fortified post at Kiev,
which is about 500 miles north of the Black Sea. They also equipped a fleet of some 200 ships
sailed down the Nyepr along the shores of the Black Sea and attacked the city of Constantinople,
and we know this from Byzantine accounts. We have historical records as well as a sermon
written by the then patriarch Photeus that on June 18th, 860, a huge Scythian fleet, and this is
old style term to refer to any northern barbarian, appeared in the Bosporus and that the imperial
fleet went out and intercepted them. At the time it was extremely frightening for the Byzantines,
the emperor, his name is Michael III or more affectionately known as Michael the drunkard,
who was off battling the Arabs somewhere, he had his own problems, was not around to organize
the defense. The patriarch took the initiative, gave the stirring ceremony, and the imperial
fleet sailed out and encountered these Viking ships, there are probably some type of version of
the Goxtod ship, and in the ensuing battle the Vikings were driven back in disorder. This is the
first time the Scandinavians had run into any kind of power that could launch ships, and actually
what is more impressive to the Scandinavians, they were forced to retreat. Now there's reasons for
this, the waters of the Bosporus are extremely treacherous, but the imperial fleet at this point
was equipped with a secret weapon which they shot from siphons called in Greek fire prepared with
thunder and lightning, this is a liquid Greek fire, some type of petroleum product which they spray
on their opposing ships and ignite, and since it's petroleum it's lighter than water and it will
float on water and you can incinerate the opposing fleet, and this is sort of discouraging when
the Vikings run into this, and a number of Viking ships apparently were burnt up this way.
The, nonetheless, the attack impressed the imperial government, this was completely unexpected,
it had come from a northern quarter, and Michael III apparently very quickly gets in touch with the
Rus at Kiev and arranges some sort of agreement, there probably was an understanding in trade
relations, we do know that certainly in the early 10th century that a number of Rus, and they're
usually called Varyngians and the Greek sources, pass into imperial services sailors and marines,
they're recruited into the imperial army, we know that they're actually used on three separate
imperial expeditions against Crete, the last one in 957, the Arabs controlled Crete for much of
the 9th and 10th century, in the 960, 957 operation when the future emperor Nisephrus Focus sees
opposition on the shores from the Arabs, what you do is you send in the marines, that is you send
in the Varyngians, they land these guys with their axes and swords and they make mincemeat out of them,
it's essentially using a Scandinavian shield wall against these unsuspecting Muslims,
so some type of treaty arrangement had been established, we also know that very quickly
there's terms for conducting trade in the city of Constantinople, and there are two treaties
recorded in the Russian primary chronicle we'll get to, and there's a surprising amount of information
about the Rus in an important work written by the emperor Constantine Porfigenitus, Constantine the
7th, perhaps the most likable of Byzantine emperors, he's really a scholar who was really
reluctantly emperor, and he wrote a work called Day Administrondo Imperio in its Latin terminology
on the governing of the empire, and what it is is a handbook to his son Romanus II, how to deal
with barbarian peoples, whether in the west, the north, the east, and he has significant information
about the Rus, one of the points he records is those dangerous rapids on the lower Nieper
are named in Greek by their Norse names, which is an indication that the Norse were really
probably the first people to negotiate those rapids, they're not by Slavic names but by Norse names,
and it bears out the fact that it's the Norse who developed the Nieper trade routes, not the Turkmen
or the Slavic peoples. Well, the Constantinople was impressive and it is a great walled city,
anyone who travels to Istanbul today can still see the imperial walls, especially the sea walls
built by Theophilus, most barbarian peoples found the walls of Constantinople dawning,
discouraging, one would argue that the whole 5th century AD is essentially a case of barbarians
coming over the Danube, seeing the walls of Constantinople deciding it's too difficult
and migrating west to attack places like Golan Italy, but you're dealing with Vikings,
not with other barbarian peoples from the Byzantine viewpoint, the Scandinavians,
the Rus saw Constantinople not as a deterrent but as a challenge. The new prince who followed
Rurik, his name is Oleg in the Slavic account and most of these princes have both Slavic and
Scandinavian names, his Scandinavian name is probably Helgi, he comes to power in North
Corode and decides to relocate his capital down to Kiev and that is a decisive move.
Henceforth, the leading prince among the Rus and the Faris zones are going to be
resident at Kiev, which means they are looking directly at the Black Sea, they're directly
looking at Constantinople and their intentions are to somehow exploit the trade routes or gain
advantages in the Byzantine world. He is reported to have launched his own attack,
this is the first attack launched by a prince himself in 907, the Russian primary chronicle
tells us he has 2000 ships and 80,000 warriors, we believe that's a bit exaggerated to say the least,
even if part of his forces are Slavic allies. The Byzantine sources don't tell us much about
this attack, it was actually rather embarrassing, there are some evidence in the sources.
Apparently Oleg or Helgi very cleverly avoided the imperial fleet, landed north of the Golden Horn
and tried to move his forces around to the vulnerable north eastern sections of the city,
the so-called Blakarni district, the same area the crusaders and later met with the second entered
the city when the city was captured later in the Middle Ages and this was countered and eventually
the Rus pulled back and this resulted in a formal treaty being arranged between Oleg or Helgi
and the imperial government and this treaty is preserved in the Russian primary chronicle
and it's an impressive piece of writing. The treaty was probably composed in Slavic and Greek,
there is no written form of Norse at the time and so Oleg is using his Slavic subjects to do the
translating form but what it does do is sets up very very specific terms in how marketing can
occur in Constantinople, the Rus are allowed to come, they are given privileged quarters,
they are given a special position in the city and in later treaties in the 10th century that
position has expanded so that they become in effect favored residents in the city of Constantinople.
Also it is hoped that these people convert to Christianity, it's not required, some of the
Rus take a preliminary step that's sometimes known as you know the first baptism, the first
war to the first christening, that is their their catacombs, they can attend services but they're
not yet really Christians and so some of these Rus very quickly realize well actually we get
advantages by being Christians under these terms. There's also terms for taking the Rus
into military service of the emperor and the Rus very quickly found out that in the Byzantine
emperor they got an employer who played paid really well both in gold and silver and so garments
and so the treaty is an important step between these Scandinavians and Russia and the Byzantine
Empire and no other you know you even even the Treaty of Wedmore between Alfred and the Vikings
and Dane doesn't have nearly the kind of terms and regulations that this Byzantine treaty has.
This is a bureaucratic state with an imperial government served by all sorts of officials
in a great city that wants to keep track on people and that type of organization clearly
impressed the Rus. They understood quickly what what the power of this organization meant,
you could mobilize fleets, this is the first opponent that we ever came into contact with
and so the contact with Constantine and Opal is is very very important to the Rus and Varyngians
who are living in a world far outside of Roman civilization in some ways that's why I always
say Ireland and Russia are similar that is Russia never was part of the Roman world it doesn't have
the urban institutions that Western Europe had but the Rus because of the nature of their trade
act roots end up in Constantine and Opal and learn those Byzantine institutions and will bring it
back to Russia that was not done in Ireland with the Rus where the Norwegians they're never brought
in those type of Roman institutions to organize a kingdom in Ireland in Russia all those Roman
style urban institutions written documents laws bureaucrats institutional Christianity
with bishops will all be brought in from Constantine and Opal and it's a result of these trade
agreements going back to the 10th century well Oleg after concluding that treaty goes about and
starts imposing his authority across the forest zones of Russia and he's remembered in the Russian
primary car chronicle as building many fortified posts as founding many later Russian cities like
Psykov and Novgorod is rebuilt he's at Kiev he's at Chernoff almost every major Russian principality
encountered in the 14th century claims some sort of origin back to a Rus market town at this time
and the Scandinavian sources start speaking of Russia as Garda reiki that is the kingdom of fortified
posts fortified markets which reflects very much what's going on in the late 9th and 10th century
that is a vast expansion of the power of the prince to expand the rating activities to get
slaves and timber in order to trade directly with Constantine and Opal the successor of Oleg is a man
named Igor or Ingvar in his Norse name his affiliation is a little uncertain he claims to be a son or
sometimes it's or maybe a grandson of Rurik and all of these figures try to always link themselves
back to Rurik as their eponymous ancestor he launches two attacks on Constantine and Opal and
this is different from the previous two it seems that Igor or Ingvar's no objective is to pressure
the imperial government to give him a more favorable treaty and that's exactly what happens
in 945 the second treaty we that is preserved in the Russian primary chronicle is concluded
and it expands a great deal the provisions and advantages for the ruse operating in Constantine
and Opal there's also another significant point in that treaty and that is the names recorded as
witnesses to the treaty and this is true in both the 911 treaty as well as the 945 treaty in the
earlier earlier treaty the witnesses from the ruse side are all Scandinavian for the 945 treaty a
number of those names seem to be Slavic and at this point it's about the third or fourth generation
of Scandinavians settled in Eastern Europe and what has happened is they are acquiring local
wives some of them are bilinguals some Slavic people have been brought into the families by marriage
or by fostering and in effect in kind of forms of adoption and so over the course of the later
10th century increasingly these Scandinavians become a colonial population similar to what you
have of the Herberno Norse in Ireland it's not as rapid as the assimilation of the Danes in Normandy
but slowly the Scandinavian component in those market towns are being assimilated to the much
larger Slavic population this is borne out by the treaty it's also borne out by a remarkable
description of the prince who follows in Gavar or Igor his son a Sviatoslav or perhaps in
Norse's name is Svienheld and that is a description a very rare description we have of that prince
penned by a Byzantine historian when Prince Sviatoslav negotiated a um treaty with the Byzantine
emperor John Semiscos uh a Semiscase on the Danube in 971 and the translation runs something like
this this is from the account of Leo the Deacon Sviatoslav crossed the river in a kind of Scythian
boat that means any kind of Norse boat he handled the ore in the same way as his men which as you
would expect of any Viking sea king you got to be good as rowing just as your men here's the
interesting part his appearance was as follows he was of medium height neither too tall nor too
short he had bushy brows blue eyes and was some snub nose he shaved his beard but wore a long and
bushy mustache his head was shaven except for a lock of hair on one side as a sign of nobility
of his clan his neck was thick shoulders broad and his whole stature pretty fine he seemed gloomy
and savage well that's true of all barbarians as described by Byzantine authors on one of his
ears hung a golden earring adored with two pearls and a ruby set between them his white garment
was not distinguishable from those of his men except for his clinic cleanness well the description
is not that of a Viking sea king but more of a acosic hetman of the 18th century clearly in
dress and manners the pharyngeans or the roost and in Kiev are acquiring the dress the aesthetics
the customs of their Slavic subjects and their Turkmen neighbors and this description that we
get from Leo the deacon confirms other evidence that slowly the population is being assimilated
into the wider Slavic population the process is accelerated by the power of Constantinople
and of the great churches of Constantinople and all of these trade connections the 945 treaty
resulted in more pharyngeans and roosts coming from Russia into Constantinople many more
Scandinavians coming directly from the homeland into Constantinople one of the most important
visits and it's difficult to date because again it's the Russian primary chronicles a little vague
on details is that the mom of Svietov Svietoslav the prince who's of whom I just spoke her name
was Olga or Helga she carried out a great state visit to Constantinople while her son Svietoslav
was still a minor and she arrived there with a large number of attendants she went into the
church of Hagia Sophia the great church built by the emperor Justinian in the 6th century saw a
full mass and saw that dome floating on a flood of light 17 stories above her and immediately
concluded God lives here I'm becoming a Christian and she's regarded as the first Christian ruler
in Russia she went back to Kiev and her son was very uninterested in this Christianity he was
devoted to the ancestral gods probably both Norse and Slavic but the story even though it is
you know highly exaggerate and a very colorful story is gives you some sort of impression of the
power of institutional Christianity the power and richness of the Orthodox Christianity and
how that is associated with the great monarchy and why these Scandinavians would consider this
as a faith to embrace and once they do that that will have major consequences Svietoslav
just like his father and grandfather saw Constantinople as a challenge and he carried out the last
of the serious attacks on the Byzantine Empire and this in some ways was the most impressive
organization to date the previous four for assaults had been naval attacks in launching
those attacks that involved a considerable amount of logistics I think of the 860 attack
sending 200 ships into the Black Sea against Constantinople 1500 miles away from from from
Novgorod where the prince was is it is a feat on order with any of the operations we saw in
western Europe but due to some very complicated politics in the Byzantine Empire in the 960s
and 970s the kingdom of Bulgaria which was a orthodox Slavic state allied to the Byzantine
Emperor there were hostilities with Bulgaria that erupted largely due to the the ill-tempered
manner of the emperor Nisferus focus and in 967 with a war looming on the eastern frontier
against the Arabs Nisferus convinced Svietoslav of Kiev to attack the Bulgarians in the Balkans
as a Byzantine ally Svietoslav was more than happy to oblige he had just smashed the power
of the Khazar cognate that is the great Turkmen power on the lower Volga which had been a rival
in trade relations they sacked the Rus went in their sack up till Svietoslav had the army and
men ready to go and so he obliged the emperor by invading Bulgaria wiping out the Bulgarians
and proceeding to attack imperial territory with the goal of taking Constantinople this
precipitated a crisis in the imperial government the emperor Nisferus focus was eventually murdered
by his nephew John Samise case it was in total scandal the Varyngians rolled over imperial
provinces massacring towns and populations and it was only in 971 when the new emperor John took
the field drove back the Rus and defeated Svietoslav on the Danube in a great siege around an old
Roman military fortress at Doros Stolodrum and forced Svietoslav to surrender and negotiated
terms with him this invasion by Svietoslav marked important departure in Rus Byzantine relations
for one I think the imperial government was stunned by the size and organization of these
campaigns second the only way these campaigns could have been conducted is that Svietoslav is now
being is now tapping into the great reservoir of manpower among his Slavic subjects the very
people that he's often been selling into slavery but clearly the armies that are described in the
imperial annals are of a size that they cannot be just Scandinavian the description we we have of
Leo the deacon of Svietoslav also indicates that at least the prince and members of the court
are now dressing themselves in the regalia of Khazar Cogons they're adapting some of the dress
and manners of their Slavic subjects so you're now dealing with a much more composite society
than you did three generations earlier when the first Rus showed up attacking Constantinople
Svietoslav agrees to pull out a Bulgaria a treaty is signed and on his return on those
treacherous rapids of the Nieper his army is set upon by the Pechen X and destroyed Svietoslav
is killed and as happens with all Turkmen armies when you're defeated you kill the prince you cut
the head off of the prince and you turn it into a drinking skull this is a common Turkmen technique
and and and it's really useful for the Pechen X because when future envoys come from Kiev you
know you can just trot out the drinking cup oh yeah this was uh yeah we picked this up with like
Prince Svietoslav and you can you know drink a toast to a treaty and sort of reinforces on the
Rus that we're tough guys you don't mess with us that's how poor Svietoslav ends up so also
since he was a pagan and hated Christianity I mean some of the Rus men say well maybe that
wasn't a good idea either too but his death in 972 in the spring of 972 puts the Rus state in Kiev
into a period of civil war and succession crisis the network of fortified towns are in danger of
breaking up uh many of the princes who are related to the royal family want to assert their own
authority there are at least two or three candidates to be prince of Kiev and therefore of the whole
of this loosely organized Rus state and for the next seven or eight years there's a complicated
civil war and the eventual victor in this war will be man named Vladimir or Valdemar as he's known
in Norse who will reunite the realm of Rurik and of Svietoslav and impose control well the lessons
that Svietoslav that this new Kievan prince Valdemir draws is that it is far more useful
in playing the role of an orthodox prince and a lie of Byzantium rather than a Viking sea king
he he will take the momentous step of embracing orthodox christianity uh he does this uh sometime
around 9889 and in so doing he lays the foundations for the creation of Russia and also takes an
important step of transforming the Scandinavians into Slavic orthodox christians and that will
be the subject of the next lecture
