Lecture 28, Formation of the Kingdom of Denmark
Applause
In this lecture I plan to deal with the formation of the Kingdom of Denmark
that is the first of the three Scandinavian kingdoms that come out of the Viking Age
and it's a bit arbitrary in selecting Denmark over Norway
Norway actually was unified earlier by King Harold Finehair
operating at the end of the 9th century
Denmark is about a half a generation later and that's due to the activities of Gorm the Old
who in part was following Harold Finehair
Nonetheless, the reason why I select Denmark first is that Denmark
being the most populous of the Scandinavian kingdoms
the area with the greatest arable
and the area that is in closest contact with Germany and England
gives us the best documentation
we're not depending just on Scandinavian sources
we have West European sources
we have later chronicles from Denmark
and also Denmark shows some important features that the other Scandinavian kingdoms do not
especially the interplay with the Holy Roman Empire
and Denmark becomes the basis for a Scandinavian conquest of England
and a unification of Scandinavia briefly in the reign of King Canute
his great so-called North Sea Empire
so while not the first
it in some ways is the most impressive of the kingdoms to emerge
and as we shall see in this lecture
the history of Denmark is closely intertwined with that of Norway
and so when we finish with Denmark in the next several lectures
we will shift to Norway and then look at Sweden last
the situation in Sweden is different and distinct in certain ways
so first let's look at what were the unusual pressures working on Denmark
and what do we know about this, the sources
then I want to examine the actual emergence of the Danish kingdom
which in some ways was a surprise
based on previous Danish history as far as we can tell from archaeology and legend
where the royal dynasty came from
that is Denmark would be unified from kings operating in the peninsula of Jutland
not from the island of Zeeland, not from the traditional area
where the great legendary heroes were associated
and finally I need to stress the importance of the activities of three kings
Gorm the Old, his son Harold Bluetooth
and the grandson of Gorm, Sven Fjorgbeard
all three of these kings were essentially Viking sea kings
each of them made significant contributions to the emergence of the Danish kingdom
and the Danish kingdom evolves far more directly and successfully
than its counterpart in Norway
where the move from independent communities, Yarls and petty dynasts to a kingdom
is much more erratic and far less clear in its development
so let's start first with the situation in Denmark
what were the forces leading to the formation of this kingdom first in Jutland
and then to the entire Danish kingdom
and I stress this is Denmark in its medieval expression
that is it includes those sections of southern Sweden
and of the entire Jutland peninsula
well first of course there were sea kings
there were professional Vikings
the importance of Hedibi and the finances are all there
but the Danish kings especially in the 10th century
were under a pressure that the other Scandinavian kings did not face
or would be Scandinavian kings
and that was the threat from Germany
the Holy Roman Empire
the eastern half of the Frankish kingdom
which in the early 10th century was constituted
as the successor of the empire of Charlemagne
and that started with a change of dynasty
the election of the Duke of Saxony
Henry the Fowler who established a new line of kings in Germany
who also were usually elected as Holy Roman Emperor
that is successor to the position that Charlemagne had created
those are very often known as Saxon or Atonian kings
the most important in this lecture will be King Otto I
or the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I
and their successors the Salian kings which is a related dynasty
they saw themselves as the heir to the Carolingian tradition
of expanding the Christian world that is conquest and conversion
now they directed many of their efforts in Eastern Europe
against Bohemia, against the Slavs in areas like Poland
but Denmark was also on the menu
and Denmark could have ended up being conquered
and incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire
the way Bohemia was and the way Hungary almost was
second the German kings were also the patrons
to the Archbishop of Hamburg Bremen
that is the Episcopal institutions
of missionary work that had been set up by St. Ongster
and they very much saw themselves as Christian kings
so it wasn't just a matter of political control
of the northern and eastern areas
or the frontier zones of their core Christian kingdom
it was also a matter of promoting the faith
and that pressure forced the Danes to organize
in a way that the Norwegian and Swedish kings did not have to do
and that is a point that is a very significant difference
and probably accounts for the rapidity in which the Danish kings
not only adopted Christianity but developed Episcopal institutions
they had to forge an effective monarchy earlier
than their counterparts in Norway and Sweden
because there was a matter of independence at stake
we do have excellent sources on the Danes
compared to the other two kingdoms
our information on Sweden is by far the least informative
and Norway we have pretty good information
particularly depending on the works of Snorri Sturlson
but we have a number of Latin chronicles
especially the account of Saxo Grammaticus
who talks about this period
the marvelous saga of the Joms Vikings
and the Joms Vikings are a professional group of warriors
Vikings operating in the Baltic Sea
legendary figures associated with Harold Bluetooth
and Sven Fiorkbeard
and this is a saga written in Iceland in the 13th century
and we believe that Jomsborg
that is the fortified Viking camp or base
would have resembled very much those military camps
I discussed earlier such as Trelleborg
and is probably to be found near the city of Wallen
that is that site excavated at the mouth of the odor
which would have been the homeland of the Wens
the Slavic people living on the southern shore of the Baltic
and these were professional Vikings
who were loosely in alliance with the Danish kings
and represented the type of companies that could be hired
or you could persuade by alliance and the promise of plunder
to serve the interests of the monarchy
and while the saga itself is very very romantic
and really the king Sven Fiorkbeard
comes off as an all-time jerk in the saga
and really owes his throne to various heroes of the Joms Vikings
nonetheless these companies did exist
and even if the saga is largely legendary
it gives a sense, some sense of the type of military companies
that were raised to impose royal authority in Denmark
there is also a very peculiar saga on King Canute
which is a late work and actually is more than King Canute
and then we have German accounts
that is accounts from the Holy Roman Empire
so we're in a particularly good position in Denmark
we have Norwegian, we have Danish
Danish Christian accounts of course
but we also have German accounts
they're very curious about the Danes
and these are chronicles written by Christian monks in Germany
in Latin
well, at the onset of the Viking Age
I mentioned that there were many kings in Denmark
but no king of Denmark
if we go back and recollect the earlier lecture
discussing the legendary kingdoms of Scandinavia
and the age of migrations
and I made the point that maybe in embryo
you saw the future kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark and Norway
in these poems
if you took those legends
if you took the archaeological evidence
of the 5th and 6th and 7th centuries
you would assume that some kind of political power
would emerge on the island of Zeeland
or Zeeland as we say in English
that is the Belts and southern Sweden
Skane, traditionally part of the Danish kingdom
this is where the action was
through most of Danish history
this is where the great Hall of Lidar was located
the legendary King Rolf Krocki
who lived sometime in the later 6th century
with archaeological evidence pointing to
clearly royal centers and great sanctuaries
furthermore this is where most of the arable land was
and traditionally the heart of the Danish kingdom
is on Zeeland and up until 1658
also on those Swedish provinces
Jutland on the other hand was very loosely attached
it was divided into many competing kings
at the opening of the Viking Age
we hear of a number of kings
it's very difficult to assign any realm
to any particular king
and the Franks don't help the matter
because they're usually very vague about who's ruling Denmark
or Normania or Northland
they're very very vague on their geography
well it seems there were two important changes
that resulted in the unexpected emergence
of the Danish monarchy on Jutland rather than in the islands
one is that the legends preserved the great battle
the final battle at the Hall of Lidar
that is the herorot in the Anglo-Saxon tradition
where King Rolf Krocky deserted by Odin
and his champions were overcome by a rival king
this is a cousin usually associated with the island of Olan
the Swedish island
his name is Jovard and his wife is Skol
she's named after one of the Norms
she's one of these witch queens
and they conjure up all sorts of beasts and demons
and anti-heroes
and Rolf Krocky and his heroes go down in a great battle
they're all destined to reach Vahala
that great epic battle was remembered
in a poem known as the Bjarkamal
and that poem was recited actually by St. Olaf's soldiers
his St. Olaf, the Christian King of Norway
going into his final battle at Stickelstad on July 29th, 1030
I mean he's psyching up mostly his Swedish warriors
many of them I suspect Pagans
by reciting this ancient poem of Rolf Krocky
there is very little information and memory
about any kind of continuous kings
after the death of Rolf Krocky
that Skoldinger dynasty
the Skolding dynasty apparently dies out
and in the Viking age
the development of the market town at Heddeby
and the trade routes with the Carolingian Empire
shifts the axis of wealth and population
over to Jutland from the islands
and that occurred in the 9th and 10th century
and that is why we begin to hear of the sea kings
is how I would prefer to call them
kings without Port Fault Hill in a sense
they were without territory
they had the power to build a hall
and in the 9th and early 10th century
there were a series of competing kings in Jutland
and the reason they were there
is because the trade went through there
and because many of the Viking companies were being recruited
and were raiding into England in the Carolingian Empire
and so Jutland probably profited the most
in what is to become the Danish kingdom
during the early Viking age
and that seems to be borne out by the archaeology
as well as by the Frankish sources
we have the construction of the Danverker
that defensive system to cut Jutland off
clearly conducted by a king ruling in Heddeby
who wanted to protect his southern frontier
against the Carolingian kings
and the later kings who come to rule all of Denmark
the so-called Yelling dynasty
after their first capital at Yelling in Jutland
and that would be Gorm the Old and Harold Bluetooth
extend those fortifications in a major building program
probably dating from the 950s and 960s
so Jutland becomes the center of the political power in Denmark
that political power coalesces into a kingdom
in the early 10th century for two reasons
first King Harold Finehair was pulling off
the first unification of Norway through sea power
and that was an example
and something that must be kept in mind
throughout the 10th and 11th century
the Danish kings always seemed to have this jealousy
in Norwegian counterparts
and always had a sense that at least
the southern sections of Norway
should be part of that kingdom of Denmark
and so the success of Harold Finehair
spurred on Danish sea kings
to recreate in Denmark what Harold was doing in Norway
the second was that outside pressure I mentioned earlier
the Holy Roman Emperor at the time
was Henry I, Henry the Fowler
and in 934 I believe
he invades Denmark
and marches into Denmark
and receives submissions from different kings
particularly a king named Gnupa in Hedibi
and attempts to impose Christianity
and to impose German authority in the peninsula
and the ultimate idea is to convert this area
and somehow attach it to the Holy Roman Empire
well that invasion
in tandem with the example of Harold Finehair
galvanizes a very successful sea king
known as Gorm the Old
the son of Harthe Knut
or Harthe Knut as we usually anglicize it
who's essentially the first Knut in the dynastic charts
although he really wasn't a king
Gorm the Old to move into Jutland
and eliminate the German influence
and that includes deposing Gnupa
taking over Hedibi
and opposing his authority throughout Jutland
and ruling as king
he was ardently pagan
he makes an effort to root out
any sort of German missionary influence
going on in the kingdom
which had followed with that invasion by Henry I
he probably starts the fortification of the Danverker
and furthermore starts raiding along the frontiers
it is he who establishes a royal capital at Yelling
which is on the eastern central Jutland today
and creates the first effective kingdom in Denmark
he is remembered in legend
particularly in the Ohm's Viking saga
unlike his son and grandson
who are not very favorably remembered
and it was this move to create a kingdom
with the Eider River as it's southern border
that prompted later German emperors
to keep coming into Denmark
such as Henry the Fowler returned in a brief expedition
his son out of the first
and his grandson out of the second
Gorm the Old ruled Jutland
but he looked to the legendary kings of Zeeland
as his model
and he would like to think of himself
as the successor of the Skjoldenar
and that becomes an important point
in the Danish political mythology
and that eventually culminates in the Latin
mythical history in effect
the Gestodonorum of Saxo Grammaticus
where the Yelling kings
try to align themselves
with all those legends and traditions
going back to the 6th century and say
we really are somehow descendant from Harald Krocki
who really knows
and can invent any kind of genealogy
back there if you wish
now Gorm's son Harald Bluetooth
the second of the Yelling dynasty
he makes several important decisions
and this really secures the future
of the Danish kingdom
I mentioned in a previous lecture
that he was convinced
to convert to Christianity
by a miracle, by Saint Papa
or Papa as he's sometimes known
in the Latin Chronicles
that he heated iron and had passed
the ordeal of fire
and I don't have any doubt
that that miracle had been carried out
sometime in the early 960s
and that was the final act of converting
Harald Bluetooth
but Harald Bluetooth
just as say Rolf
the Count of Normandy
or Vladimir the Prince of Kiev
Harald Bluetooth was a savvy ruler
and understood the power of institutional Christianity
there were missionaries that kept coming into Denmark
and sent in by the bishops of Hamburg Bremen
and he saw two possible advantages
to converting to Christianity
first it would give him
the kind of staff necessary
to build monarchical institutions
that is he could start collecting taxes
they have this writing all of those advantages
the second point
by converting to Christianity
and becoming a legitimate Christian king
that meant hands off for the German Emperor
that is the German Emperor in the south
would have to attack Denmark with a really good cost
it was just not a matter of going to war with the heathen
and carrying out the kind of conquest
that Charlemagne did of the Saxons
and I think both of those motives
as well as his conviction
that the Christian god was powerful
were behind that conversion
and transformation of Jutland
from a regional kingdom
into a kingdom of Denmark
because shortly after his conversion
Harald Bluetooth goes on
to impose his authority in the Danish islands
and in southern Sweden
that is he collects the various lands
that become
medieval Denmark
the kingdom of Denmark
and by the time he
well he's actually driven out of his kingdom in 986
by his son Sven Forkbeard
but by the time he is
and he dies in exile in 987
by the time of his death
there is a kingdom of Denmark
there is a more or less territorial notion
of what Denmark should be
now Harald made several important decisions
he
inherited the ancestral capital
at Yelling where his father
was buried and his father
had raised a great runestone
on that runestone
reports King Gorm
set up this memorial to his wife
Thierry and Thierry is the queen
remembered in legend
she may have actually been a
Wendish that is a Slavic princess
for all we know there are several accounts
on this ladies origin
it's difficult to translate
sometimes the phrase
is taken as restore of Denmark with
Gorm sometimes it means ornament of
Denmark it could be with the queen
I think probably the second translation is closer to it
and Yelling had these two great
tumuli mounds
one for the king one for the queen with the runestones
and what it was was a reproduction
of the great sanctuaries
and royal centers of
Lidar described in the sagas
that is Yelling was going to be the successor
of Rolf Krocke
well Harold Bluetooth
who is now a Christian king quite concerned
about his
predecessors actually builds a church
which is still there between the two royal mounds
and erects his own
runestone and in this runestone
Harold notes that
King Harold ordered this monument
to be made in memory of his father
Gorm and his mother Thierry
the Harold who won
all of Denmark and Norway for himself
and made the Danes Christians
a very very great boast
indeed but it's actually
born out in the literature in the archeology
quite well Yelling is turned
into a Christian center
the runestone
of King Harold Bluetooth
shows a scene of crucifixion and actually
is taken as the
epitome of a certain type of ornamental
style that begins to become popular in Scandinavia
he also
builds a new capital at
Roskilde on the island of Zeiland
that is he transfers his power
to the Danish island
and that has a significance in two ways
one that's where most of your
arable is
the important sea lanes going through the Sund
that is the channel between Zeiland
and southern Sweden but also
he is staking out a claim
to that legacy going back to Rolf Krocke
Roskilde is the Christian version
of the ancient legendary hall
of Lydor or Herod
he also is the man responsible
for the fortifications of
the Danvrika and building those great camps
that we have at Trelleborg
Fiercotte
Augersborg
and Nonnabacken
which are four excavated camps
two in Jutland
one on the island of Finn or Funen
and the other on the island of Zeiland
these are professional camps very similar
to the society
described in the Saga of the Joms vikings
and this
these camps together may have housed as many as
12,000 warriors certainly the camps
can accommodate 2 to 3,000 warriors
and they were built
as part of his effort
to put Denmark under his control
he
was accepted by the
at least the Danes of Jutland
his kingship was ratified
at the Fing in Vborg which is in northern
Jutland which was probably an early center
he won over the Yarls and sub-kings
of Denmark by proving
that he was a charismatic sea king
and it's under Harold's direction
that probably a number of viking
companies operate as vikings
overseas and share the spoils with the king
he also
saw the Norwegian kings as threats
particularly the second son
of Harold Finehair that is
King Hacken
known as King Hacken the Good
who ruled approximately from 936
to 960 or 961
and Hacken was personally a Christian
but
he was accepted by Odin in Valhalla
and there's actually a poem written that
he had been reared in England
and had kind of converted to Christianity
but he always paid homage to the old gods
and a warrior that great
there's always a seat in Valhalla
for a good warrior and the later story was
well Hacken in the end actually joined Odin
but Hacken had been a very successful
king in Norway and that had
aroused the envy of King
Harold Bluetooth and then
Harold's sister and her name
was Gunhild and
she had been married to Hacken's
brother Eric the Blood Axe
the short live king of
York who was one of the nastiest
of the sons of Harold Finehair
and had been run out by his subjects
and Eric Blood Axe had a number
of sons by this
Danish wife Gunhild and
Gunhild and her sons
went to the Danish court
and were doing everything in their power
to undermine Hacken and his descendants
and so
eventually this climax
in a Danish attack
on Norway
in 960 the battle
actually went against the Danes
it's a great naval battle that's celebrated
in verse
but Hacken was mortally wounded
and so
that meant either 960 or 961
that a new king
was imposed in Norway
and that was a man named Harold Greycloak
and Harold Greycloak was
the oldest son of Eric
Blood Axe and therefore related
to the Danish family and so what happened
is the new Danish king
at this point
was able to rule
southern Norway through this sort of client
arrangement with the Norwegian king
and this is a very common policy
Harold Bluetooth and his son
Sven Forkbeard both tried
to make an arrangement in Norway
where the Norwegians somehow
would rule as their subjects
Harold Greycloak
did not take well to being a client king
and eventually
he was overthrown in 970
by a combination
of Norwegian exiles and a Danish fleet
and the arrangement
made from 970 on
was that southern Norway
the areas around Vestfold and the Oslo
Fjord were actually incorporated
into the Danish kingdom
whereas the northern and western districts
were ruled by a great family
Haken
the family of Jarl Haken
that is Earl Haken who ruled in Trondheim
as a vassal
to Harold Bluetooth
and that is reported in the great
Runestone and so
at the time of his death
or actually his deposition
in 986
Harold Bluetooth had created a kingdom
not only Denmark
but the southern areas of Norway
those two crucial zones
the area of the vikon
plus probably the uplands
which are now the Danish kingdom
and then the rest of Norway was ruled
by a very ardent pagan Jarl
by the name of Haken
who was independent in many ways
but owed his authority
to the Danish king
and this kingdom
could have potentially evolved into the Danish kingdom
but the southern areas of Norway were long
tied by blood and kinship
and trade with Denmark
well
Harold Bluetooth had no sons
except for one surviving son
by a serving girl
his name was Sven Forkbeard
and Harold had more or less ignored
his son and we have
accounts that Harold
finally recognized Sven
when Sven grew of age
appeared at the court
and at some sort of royal heritage
he was technically illegitimate
it was not even a marriage
even by the pagan legal traditions
in the 10th century
and there was this marvelous exchange
where
Harold looks at Sven
at this point around 15 or 16
maybe 18 years old
and says you've got to be my son
because I recognize your mother in you
which means you're either a fool
or a simpleton
because Sven responds
I guess you do recognize
my mother in me
and I would that you had given me a noble or mother
but since you gave me the mother you did
she was more than sufficient
and by the way give me some ships
or I'm going to harry your kingdom out of existence
and this is not ideal father son relations
Harold faced
not only his son Sven
but also Sven was apparently backed
by the Joms vikings and various sea kings
and in a very brief civil war
in 986-987
Harold Bluetooth
was driven from his throne
he took refuge among the Wens
that is the Slavic peoples
which is now the Baltic shores
of Germany and Poland
and died in exile
and Sven stayed on his throne
Sven Forkbeard is
a colorful figure
the traditions are rather hostile to him
not only the Scandinavian traditions
but as we shall see
also the English traditions
he came to the throne at a very critical point
as much as
Gorm the Old
and Harold Bluetooth had laid the foundations
of a Danish kingdom
it still depended very much on the personality of the king
and here Sven was not nearly the warrior
of either his dad
or his granddad
he is the king and I mentioned this
in connection with an earlier lecture
that convinced the Joms vikings
in his great toast
at Roskilde
to combine their fleets with the Danish fleets
to attack Norway
at his accession
Sven Forkbeard discovered that Jarl Hacken
was not particularly impressed
by the Danish king
and ceased to pay any attention
to Danish directors
and sometime shortly after his accession
probably around 988
a Danish Joms vikings fleet
attacked Norway
and it really blundered into
the Norwegian fleet
in the great battle of
Jörunga Vag
or Jörunga Bay
in western Norway
and it's again
as all Norwegians seeking
not only did Hacken have the better ships
and the better archers
he also had the better poets
he had all sorts of Icelanders
and so the victory was hailed as a great victory
and a real humiliation for Sven
and that defeat early in his reign
and he had to battle
the then king of Sweden
a fellow by the name of Eric the Victorious
the pagan king of
Uppsala and Siktuna
who had the favor of Odin by the way
and there's some great stories about
how Eric could invoke
Odin on the battlefield and massacre his enemies
he also faced
eventually the first really effective
Christian king in Norway
that's Olaf Triggvissen
who comes to the throne in 95
rules to 1000
and really up to the year 1000
Sven's position and the whole position
of the kingdom of Denmark was in jeopardy
we know for instance that those fortresses
built by his father were abandoned
just given up probably Sven didn't have
the money to support them
second there's reports
that Sven had to go overseas
and act as a Viking in England for several years
that is a point that is still disputed
but in 1000
with the death of Olaf
Triggvissen in Norway
Sven is able to return to Denmark
and begin to consolidate his position in the kingdom
and then
a wonderful opportunity opens up for him
in England
where there had been renewed Viking
raids starting in the late 10th century
probably starting in the 970s and 980s
and these were largely Danish
Vikings and some
Norwegians from southwestern Norway
the Vikings who had been raiding
England since
at least the 90s
and had been exacting enormous number of
Dengald payments
finally annoyed the then ruling king of England
his name was Ethelred II
or as often known as Ethelred the Unredi
that means he could not hold his council
he was a minor when he came to the throne
on St. Bryce's
day in the year 1002
and that would be
the equivalent of November 13, 1002
Ethelred II had had it
with the Danes and their raids
and he ordered the arrest and execution
of all Danes in England
these would be the reason Vikings
including it happened a sister
of King Sven Forkbeard
well that action resulted in Sven declaring
war on the English king
mobilizing the Viking fleets
and this act of
avenging this honor couldn't have been
a more ideal point
Sven had just consolidated his control in Denmark
his leading rivals in Norway and Sweden
had been knocked out of the running
by the Viking longships
and warriors to spare
and in 1003
Sven and his son and future successor
Canute
carry out raids in England
and these raids will result
not only in the conquest of England
all of England by the Danes
but also give Canute
the son and successor of Sven
the institutions and money
to turn Denmark into a Christian kingdom
Thank you
