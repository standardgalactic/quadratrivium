Lecture 22, Western Voyages to Greenland and Vinland.
In this lecture I plan to deal with the voyages and colonizations of Greenland and Vinland,
referring to that small fragment of North America which the North discovered and Vinland
is essentially Newfoundland today. The discovery of Greenland and the attempted settlement in
North America from about 1001 to really 10014 is at the far end of the knowledge, the geographic
knowledge and extent of the vikings and really had very little long-term historical consequences
that virtually no historical consequences. These voyages of Western discovery really didn't
excite the European imagination, lead to the voyages of discovery starting with Columbus.
Instead it was the legendary travels or the semi-legendary travels out to China that inspired
Europeans to sail west in order to bump into Cathay or China. The knowledge of these North
voyages in the North Atlantic was pretty much restricted to Scandinavia and there's no reason
to doubt that these voyages took place but their long-term impact in European civilization is
minimal or nil. On the other hand these voyages are clearly what most certainly North Americans
remember about the vikings. Oh they were the first people to get to America meaning the first
Europeans and they have been subject to all sorts of popular literature, films, you name it,
frauds and part of the purpose of this lecture is to look at the record of what we actually know
of the colonizations in Greenland and in North America and why they failed and then to look at
the popular perception and how this whole culture of just you know cottage industry of manufacturing
false maps and reports of vikings in North America and what that tells us about perceptions of the
vikings and really a great deal about certainly Americans as well as Canadians today. So let's
look at the actual historical record first. We know most about Greenland and Vinland from two
sagas, family sagas composed in the 13th century and this is the saga of Eric the Red and the
saga of the Greenlanders. Both of these sagas are really more concerned with the events around
Eric the Red and his family, especially his elder son, Leaf the Lucky, Leaf Erickson, who's
credited it with problem you know really inaccurately with the discovery of North America
and Leaf Erickson was probably remembered as more important for bringing Christianity
to the Greenland settlement rather than anything he found in North America.
Nonetheless, we have these two family sagas and they are verified by other reports.
We do know in 1070 that Adam of Bremen in his history of the Archbishop's of Hamburg Bremen
makes reference to the fact that Danes and Norwegians and Icelanders know of this island
called Vinland out in the western ocean, he means the Atlantic and that that is at the extreme end
of the known world and so we do have a verification and a medieval source that these
voyages actually took place and now we have archaeology that demonstrates not only the
settlement in Greenland but also that brief settlement in North America. But nonetheless,
as I said this information was really not very well known, it was only popularized to western
Europeans in the 18th century at a time where you know America had long been known and you know
no one was particularly interested in these these Norse ventures. Well sailing to North America
required first the sailing to Greenland and Greenland's discovery and settlement in some ways
was a replay of Iceland. In the trips that took place between Norway and Iceland, there were
several instances of skippers being driven off course, getting sightings of islands, they seem
to be the essentially the eastern shores of Greenland, so there was some knowledge that there
was a land mass to the northwest of Iceland by the you know, 950s and 960s. But no one really took
much attention to this and really cared to explore it. It really took a restless adventure and a
very very colorful figure, Eric the Red referring to his hair color, who was actually under two
suits of outlaw. He was outlawed from Norway for manslaughter and then got himself outlawed for
three years in Iceland. There's there's various degrees of being outlawed. You can be forced to
leave the country for three years, you can get a permanent banishment. It depended out how offensive
the crime had been and how important the family you had transgressed. So Eric the Red is essentially
running two outlaw terms and decides well this is a great idea to turn Explorer and he apparently
bought the vessel, the canare, used by one of these skippers who had sighted Greenland and we
suspect he might have actually had some of the crew and he sets off on a voyage of adventure in
983 or 984 and sails west and he hits the eastern shores of Greenland and then follows it down to
Cape Farewell and comes up the west coast and there he finds several fjords which could provide
conditions for settlement the same way you have in Iceland. The most important of these is known as
Eric's fjord. It becomes the basis for the main settlement very often known as the eastern settlement
and what's confusing about the settlement in Greenland is the settlements are all on the west
coast of Greenland but the southernmost one was called the eastern because it was farther east
and the northern one is often called the western settlement so the names are a bit deceptive but
they're all on the western shore of Greenland. Well the other aspect about Greenland that was very
attractive was that there apparently were no natives. At the time there were no eskimos or very few
eskimos in Greenland because of the changing Arctic conditions many of them had migrated back
into Canada and they would only reappear in Greenland in the 14th century when you have this period
known as the minor ice age. So again free land no natural predators human or otherwise and Eric
returned to Greenland to Iceland and played up this new discovery and named the area Greenland.
Now I always like to think of Eric the Red is in a very very good and long tradition that
certainly is characterized in American development and that is luring settlers under false pretenses
and the name sounded great I mean Greenland as opposed to Iceland although when those settlers
got to Greenland they were probably quite disappointed in the amount of free land there was for the
taking. Even so in 985 Eric was able to assemble 500 settlers which is indicative of the fact that
Iceland had filled up about a generation or so earlier and there were a number of people willing
to take a risk to go out and get that free land just as their ancestors had done back in the late
9th century when Iceland was first settled. They take off in 25 ships and only 18 of them make it
it's a long journey it's over a thousand statute miles it's difficult to navigate and from the
start the Greenland settlement was really at the edge of the technology and the assailing abilities
of the Norse. It didn't mean that it was doomed to failure but it was going if Iceland was tough
Greenland was daunting as a settlement and these settlers must have known that they were short on
timber and iron that they had a far more restricted area to raise their animals they really couldn't
grow any kind of grains and it was essential that they develop trade goods to ensure the contact
with Iceland and Norway and what they found in Greenland were the types of arctic animals
that their ancestors in Norway could get usually by trade with the laps and this would be the
walrus ivory the skins the seal skins the furs the types of animals that would produce
products in high demand in the luxury markets in Europe and so long as Norwegian kings essentially
ruled the north Atlantic that is before the unification of Norway under Denmark in 1397
and before the Germans took over the shipping trade in the north Atlantic there was trade to
Greenland and European products and wood and supplies could be imported once those conditions
changed and once climactic conditions changed in Greenland that is they deteriorated the colonies
were very quickly doomed in the 14th century but at the start it it didn't look like a bleak prospect
Eric was able to set himself up in Eric's fjord in the eastern settlement as a as essentially
a gothie as the leader of the settlement and that that eastern settlement where he was
essentially grew to about 4,000 residents and by 1300 the more northern western settlement was
about half that size there was a smaller collection of farms known as the middle settlement and we
think these Greenlanders went pretty far north along the island to various hunting grounds well
over a thousand miles north of of that northern settlement the so-called western settlement
now the success of this settlement in Greenland dependent on maintaining that long distance
trade with Iceland and Norway it could have also been assured if the Norse had been able to
capitalize and and settle north america to their west which they happened to stumble upon
shortly after Eric the red set up his settlement in Greenland because in north america you had the
kind of timber and resources that could have easily fed these settlements and actually
could have led to a transfer of the population from Greenland to more hospitable shores which
could lead to a more successful settlement and that gets us to the second great western voyage
the one that has captured popular imagination and that is the Norse discovery and colonization
or failed colonization of north america well once again north america was cited by accident
a fellow named Bjarni Herlovson who was the son of one of the same as his father's name is
her herulf who's who's one of the original settlers in Greenland is a pal of Eric the red
uh Bjarni was sailing back from Norway hoping to meet up with his dad in the the eastern settlement
and he was a skipper involved in long distance trade he's just a sort of guy you want in order
to develop that trade in Greenland and somehow he overshot his voyage and ended up landing
on a coast which he was astonished by the amount of trees and he knew enough that Greenland didn't
have trees uh and named this area Markland meaning woodland uh he sailed north to a um a large island
described as uh collect uh with large numbers of round stones and only uh minor uh of trees or
woods around uh and he called it stone land Halua land and in Norse uh probably Baffin Island
and eventually made his way back to Greenland essentially uh sailing clockwise back to that
eastern settlement and reported his findings well no one really wanted to act upon this uh
it was just one of a number of findings that you get but in 1000 or 1001 and the date is
disputed based on what we're told in the two different sagas Eric the red's son Leaf Ericsson
often known as Leaf the Lucky in popular literature who had returned from Norway bringing Christianity
much to the distress of his father who remained devoted to the old gods Leaf Ericsson bought the
same ship that Bjarne had used and enrolled part of the same crew and decided to set off and find
out what this place was like and what Leaf essentially did was um uh sail in reverse uh in the direction
that Bjarne went that is he landed first in Baffin Island and then came along the Labrador coast
which we think is Markland and made a landfall in Newfoundland uh which was then dubbed Vinland
because once Leaf's people um set up a booth there it's called Leaf's Booth or Leaf's Boot Air
which is a a minor camp it's a building a hall and setting up uh uh some shops in order to repair
ships uh and this becomes the basis where uh the Norse later try to set up settlements
by landing in Newfoundland there um uh Leaf and his followers uh discovered that there was uh lots
of game particularly salmon which uh was a favorite dish for the Norse plenty of timber
and above all uh Thirker who was the foster father of of Leaf wandered off into the forest one day
and came back deliriously happy that he had found uh Vinbeer that is berries or or or vines or
often translated grapes it probably weren't grapes they're probably some sort of cranberry
or gooseberry or something uh which uh Leaf's guys immediately brewed uh into a pretty heady
brew uh uh wine there and got very very happy and toasting each other that they had made it
to this new land uh so it had game it had lots of timber it certainly looked like a much better
prospect than Greenland and furthermore it also looked empty well Leaf returned uh to Greenland
and on the way back he actually rescued some uh shipwrecked companions and and and and and merchants
who had had run across uh run ground on the shores and rescued all the passengers that's how we got
the term Leaf the Lucky that's how we got his his uh little extra name there and he reported the
discoveries to his father and was going to act on it but that winner Eric the red died
and Leaf essentially took over the running of the colony uh in Greenland and was not in a position
to mount a new expedition instead it fell to one of his younger brothers a fellow named Thorvald
Thorvald um recruited a crew he had very good information now where this Leaf's um a booths
or Leaf's buddhar is located which we believe is in Newfoundland at uh Lonzo Modo a site that
has been excavated which shows a Norse settlement of the 11th century with two major halls with
smith shops all sorts of uh soap stones other if uh other archaeological information consistent with
Norse material life of the 11th century which verifies what the sagas tell us that there was
some kind of landfall in Newfoundland and a base was set up there it could only accommodate 75 to
100 people it's a rather small settlement but nonetheless it is a vital base for any of the
Norse who wish to explore and colonize in these areas so uh brother Thorvald set off he too
sailed along the shores he used the same bases as brother did and um and taking note of where
possible settlement could could could take place and then all of a sudden they ran into
local people that weren't supposed to be there in their mind uh they call them the Screilinger which
is a a Norse way of calling the locals something like screechers or screamers that is they don't
they don't speak Norse uh and unfortunately uh they're probably Algonquans and they uh
apparently ran into a group of nine of them and killed most of them and um two of them escaped
and they reappeared in their canoes and started shooting arrows and and Thorvald got wounded
and died of his mortal wound and his crew buried him and then set sail to Greenland and reported
to leaf yeah there's lots of land there but there are these people which we didn't quite count on
who are living in the area well the need for timber the need for land the need to get better
resources to support the colony of Greenland uh is what prompted a second effort at settlement
leaf is essentially a voyage of discovery um brother Thorvald was an attempt at settlement
apparently they were going to try to stay there and the first really big colonial expedition
sets out in the summer of 1009 it is headed up by a fellow named Thorfinn Thorfinn Carl Sef uh
Sefney who is um married uh to the wife of Thorvald who just got killed a couple of years earlier
he also took along a half sister of of leaf Eric's and she was actually illegitimate
daughter of Eric the red uh afraid us and her rather colorless husband also named Thorvald
uh and uh they were um uh in on the expedition it's obviously a family affair and they were
able to assemble several hundred settlers there's two different accounts on how many were there
may have been as many as 250 people uh they had several ships they set sail made landfall at the
same place in Newfoundland and set up a settlement a settlement there they moved into leaf booths
and proceeded to exploit the surrounding area the the fish uh the various uh foul the hunting
and trapping uh they had wood the first winner was difficult uh even so Thorfinn and his wife um
and that would be um uh Gudrid uh had the first european child in north america they gave birth
to a daughter there that winner the next spring uh the settlement was in danger of breaking up some
of them left uh that group tried to sail back to greenland they actually miss greenland and ended
up in ireland and the Irish families guys really where were you coming from uh the the rest of the
settlement um settlers relocated to a new site uh it's still a debate where that might be located
and they built a stockade and sure enough uh the locals showed up the scraylinger that had been
reported a couple of years earlier now Thorfinn was a clever clever guy and he immediately told the
told the colonists uh look you can you can trade cheese and dairy products and all the cloth you
want but no weapons and so they carry out a trade it's very very amiocole and who knows exactly
what the locals made of these strange people but it went off fine three weeks later the scraylinger
appeared en masse and attacked the settlement shooting arrows and you you you wonder what poor
Thorfinn is thinking at this point like what did we do wrong well i have no proof for this but my
suspicion is that these poor native american indians were lactose intolerant went back with
all this milk and cheese and consumed it and nearly died and some of them may have died and
the immediate reaction was all these strange people are trying to poison us and came back
really mad armed to the teeth and attacked the settlement uh Thorfinn of course is is completely
bewildered i mean what's wrong we did everything right we didn't give any weapons we were nice to
him we didn't kill anyone uh and the size of the attack was really pretty daunting daunting to the
to the north they the the scraylinger actually break into the settlement one point and it really
takes up freedom the uh that illegitimate daughter of eric the red to go out there bellowing uh like
a valkyrie right out of valhalla to rally the men and get them back into the battle and also uh
the scraylinger are really kind of afraid of these cattle they're not sure what they are and
some of the cattle get loose and make noises and you know they eventually they they pull off they
back off they withdraw well this is alarming to have locals around you know they expected to have
an empty land uh the settlement relocates yet again uh they endure never another very very
difficult winter in the year one thousand eleven one thousand twelve and then decide to call it
quits and they sail back uh to greenland where lee ferrickson is waiting for them
and the reports are this this this is not what what anyone expected it certainly didn't dissuade
freedom to attempt another settlement and she hooked up with two norwegian brothers
and put together another team of settlers in the next year in one thousand thirteen
and uh these were the brothers helgi and finbogie uh fresh from norway and she and this uh these
norwegian brothers and her colorless husband thorval sailed off again to leaf spoof and
attempted a a resettlement in this case it wasn't the scraylinger that did in the settlers it was
a classic Icelandic blood feud over who should get the bigger hall uh that immediately got involved
that immediately got involved in all sorts of insults which comes right out of a family saga
and frida's ended egged on her colorless husband to kill the other settlers uh she actually took
charge of killing the women in the other party and she she really is something right out of
Valhalla whatever christianity may or may not have been and uh and at this point uh there were
just two few settlers to make it go the conditions were too difficult and she and her husband returned
to greenland and the apparently the efforts at any kind of settlement in north america
were ended that doesn't mean that uh greenlanders and even icelanders didn't show up at vinland and
harvest uh timber and there are reports as late as 1347 that some of them did that that there was
just too much timber over there so they'd sail over and cut down timber there has also been found
on a indian site in main a norwegian coin of of um of uh the 11th century i believe it's of harold
the the um the quiet and uh that uh that's the son of harold haughtery uh who ruled from 1067 to um
1093 and if that coin is in an illegitimate site and is not a plant it may have been obtained in
either trade or it might have been a salvage from some ship that been wrecked so there were
probably efforts to to get the timber but the failure of the settlements in green in vinland
essentially condemned greenland to extinction once the climactic changes in political uh
climactic conditions and political conditions change in the 14th century and you have to remember
that these viking settlements were small jamestown found it in 1607 which was the second english colony
the first one had failed uh jamestown by 1610 out of the original 900 settlers only 150 were left
they died from malnutrition the harsh winter disease and there was just not the type of
population or organized government to sustain the type of settlement that would be necessary
to make a go of these north settlements in north america especially against a native population
in which the nor's did have a superiority in iron weapons but they were too few to make any real
difference and so from the start this vinland settlement was was was pretty much doomed to failure
that meant that the greenlanders left in uh the eastern and western settlements very very quickly
became isolated there were deteriorating conditions in the 14th century plus the black death brought
in by the merchants and the colony is really greatly reduced in its numbers in the 14th century
perhaps the western colony is abandoned that is the more northern one sometime in the 1340s
or 1360s the archaeological evidence shows that the last greenlanders probably died off
somewhere around 1500 there are reports of very few ships going there after 1400 a couple of
instances of bishops being commissioned to greenland but uh no one could find a ship to take
them there so they're usually hanging out in bergen looking for some german ship and it just
wasn't worth it uh the greenlanders never could develop the kind of market uh that uh developed
in norway for arctic goods and starting in the 14th and 15th century that is the russians
essentially provided all the furs that the european market demanded so there's just really no reason
to go there uh and somewhere between 1500 and 1540 the population essentially died out the escoboes
moved in they were much better adapted to these uh harsher conditions in fact for them the minor
ice age as it's usually called uh was windfall because that brought in all sorts of arctic
animals into greenland which they could hunt and live off and essentially they were just better
adapted to the conditions to give you a give you a sense how everyone forgot this in 1712 the
dangerous crown decided to send a protestant missionary off to greenland to convert these
north settlers that they're vaguely aware of their people out there they're christians and
by the way i guess they never had the reformation and this fellow by the name of of hank hauntz
aga aga day shows up uh expecting to convert norse and what he finds is just ask him all
is that goes to show you how little that even the scandinavian themselves remembered of this
remote colony well overall the um the whole venture both in north america and greenland
proved ephemeral and really without any major historical significance other than a testimony
to viking skill and shipbuilding and interment and determination to colonize these extremely
difficult landscapes on the other hand the interest in this is what it has spawned in the
way of frauds and hoaxes attesting to the viking presence in the new world uh there is a whole
literature especially from the early 20th century somehow trying to connect the vikings with any
number of civilizations attested in north america uh or in mexico uh for instance um there's a whole
literature claiming that the legend of quetzalcoatl the white god which really was created in the 16th
century uh that this white god is really a viking who came in a ship and they established maya or
aztec civilization and you know i guess there's a chance that a viking ship could be blown off
course and end up in the caribbean i don't know how it would get to mexico uh and uh but i don't
even also don't know how it would even get back to to um uh to europe it was just a goner uh so
there's always that danger um what i'd like to do is close with two of the most uh outrageous
and entertaining frauds that have been created and they really are very very telling of popular
notions about the vikings the first one was just was quote-unquote discovered in 1898 uh it's known
as the kensington stone it was uncovered in minnesota in douglas county kensington uh by a
swedish immigrant immigrant named olf omen who had a reputation in the swedish community of being a
great jokester a joker he always was playing tricks and practical jokes he claimed that he dug
up this 200 pound stone underneath a huge tree uh he cleaned it off and and lo and behold there was
a runic inscription which was uh transcribed and translated as follows eight goths and 22 norwegians
exploring west of vinland one day's journey north of this stone we made our camp near two skirries
one day we went out fishing and found on our return the dead bodies of 10 of our men
red with blood avi maria preserve us from evil 14 days journey from this island 10 men are looking
after our ships year 1362 now considering the fact that the whole thing is chronologically
preposterous and no one ever used a runestone to greek or anything like this uh the runes
were also silly it's it's really modern swedish written in a very bad rendition of uh the short
foothark uh nonetheless this thing was accepted uh and it was picked up by a cherry farmer by the
name of uh yalmar holand who took it as his he's kind of a crack bot as his mission to prove
scandinavian settlement in north america uh and he actually took this 200 pound stone to ruon
in 1911 where everyone was celebrating the 1000th anniversary the duchy of normandy and the german
and scandinavian philologists looked at the stone just laughed their heads off charles homer haskins
probably the greatest scholar of the middle ages in the 19 or first half of the 20th century
thought it was a this is a great joke it's not real nonetheless uh this uh this cherry picker
uh magnate managed to push this stone and in 1948 it was actually on display in this
smithsonian rather briefly as a national monument of the united states and eventually they realized
this is pretty tacky even you know they removed it very quietly um the other uh and even more
remarkable fraud that's been perpetuated is the so-called vinland map uh which is supposed
to date before 1440 and it shows greenland and vinland as islands in the western ocean with
the latin caption identifying them the map was purchased by of all places yale university
for well over 250 000 dollars by an anonymous donor uh and it's been obtained from a legitimate
book dealer in new haven who had purchased it from a fellow in barcelona around 1957 he claims
uh the map uh was uh studied it was matched up by the wormholes with the codex that is an early
book uh which preserves a latin account of the mission of giovanni caprini uh envoy of the
papacy uh to the mongol court uh which is actually a legitimate document and is more important
uh than this this map and from the start there were a number of scholars who wondered you know
this thing doesn't look right for one greenland is shown as an island in all maps up until 1650
they thought greenland was a peninsula uh nonetheless yale went ahead and purchased the uh
the map and then had the misfortune of announcing this purchase just days before uh columbus day
was due it got out into the new york times uh there was an enormous furor uh between italian
american clubs and norwegian american clubs in brooklyn they almost came to blows with each other
i having to sit on both sides it doesn't really matter to me and my mother once
suggested at that very time why don't they have a columbus day parade with eric the red
walking and then the three ships of columbus following perfectly perfectly logical solution
no one paid attention uh people got very very heated over this and then in 1974 there was a
symposium held and it turned out to be a fraud uh the ink was modern there were all sorts of problems
with it yale had to announce that the purchase that was done nine years later or earlier uh was a
complete fraud uh withdraw the map and uh and the issue has been quietly pushed aside well these
types of hoaxes and frauds and they're not as they're not as common now as they used to be
and i think we can we can thank uh the fascination in ufo's is taking that sort of fringe group off
to worrying about that rather than vikings in north america uh nonetheless what do these actually
prove i think in a way icelanders of the settlement period would actually appreciate this north american
desire to have some sort of link with this viking age it's very very typical of a relatively new
society a frontier society as we still like to think of ourselves to hope that we have some sort of
tie to a past any past a remote past that antiquity somehow gives us legitimacy so all of these frauds
and hoaxes and the like are not too different in a way in the way the icelanders wanted to attain that
sense of um of continuity with their norwegian homeland it's just in north america it's turned
out into some rather silly frauds and hoaxes uh speculations on on fraudulent objects whereas
in iceland it produced uh the great literature of the sagas and the scaldic poetry
