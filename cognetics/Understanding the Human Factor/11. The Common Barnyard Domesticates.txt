Welcome back. In the last lecture, we looked at some of the first animal domesticates.
If you recall, at the beginning of the course, I made the claim that civilization couldn't
have occurred without the domestication of plants and animals. I hope that you now have
a better understanding of how, among other things, dogs enabled us to live safely in
groups, cats enabled us to store grain and stop foraging, and chickens gave us both eggs
and meat so we could reduce our need to hunt. In other words, early man was beginning to
identify the characteristics of domesticates which would be usable in their efforts to
settle, expand, and grow. In this lecture, we'll again step back into the prehistoric to discuss
the domestication of some important barnyard animals that played particularly important roles
in the establishment of the food production life way. We will look at sheep, goats, pigs,
equines, horses and horse-like animals, and bovines, the cattle. We will also look at some aspects
of the management and use of the modern descendants of these early domesticates. There will be a
brief discussion of the milking of some of these animals and a few of the secondary products derived
from the milk so obtained. We'll conclude by asking the question, could civilization as we know
it survive without the presence of the animals and plants covered in this and the three preceding
lectures? Sheep domestication was probably limited to regions where wild sheep were plentiful and
played some role as a prey species. That is a prey species for us, meaning we hunted them. Sheep
are grazing animals and do well in a step or in grasslands. There's evidence based on archeological
remains that domestic sheep arose from the wild Armenian muphalan between about 8,700 years and
8,200 years ago in the fertile crescent, making one of the first of these barnyard animals brought
under domestication. The muphalan, that wild progenitor of the domestic sheep, once roamed much
of the eastern Mediterranean basin. Today is found in the wild only on isolated mountain tops in the
eastern Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia. Several years ago I traveled to the
mountains of those two islands and spent considerable time hiking and looking for examples of that
reclusive animal. They do exist in zoos but they're pretty hard to see in the wild. I was fortunate
enough to finally see a male with a small harem, a small group of females and a few young.
What I discovered of course was that the muphalan are dark brown animals. The male has very large
curving horns. Now knowing what I do about the changes that often attend domestication was not
particularly surprised to find that these animals were larger than domestic sheep. They were more
fleet of foot. They could really fly through the scrub and they were extremely agile. Also it was
clear that they were much more fearful of the presence of man exhibiting a strong flight response.
Given that the muphalan is all but extinct in the wild today and there are billions and billions
of sheep in the world we have another example of domestication appearing to be a good choice
or strategy for the domesticates as well as the domesticator. Goats unlike sheep are browsing
animals and they naturally occupy habitats that are rockier and more shrub covered. Examination
of goat bones found in a number of archaeological sites suggests that modern domestic goats arose
from wild Persian Bezor goats between about 8,700 and 8,000 years ago again in the eastern third
of the fertile crescent. Because sheep and goats are reasonably easy to herd these creatures spread
across and ultimately outside the fertile crescent fairly soon after their initial domestications.
Sheep and goat goats are quite compatible with each other and can be grazed and herded together.
However their different feeding habits have resulted in rather different behavior patterns
if one cares to actually observe closely. Sheep are grazers and they spend a great deal of time
with their heads down looking at forage, they're looking for what to eat, they're looking at the
ground. They do have a sense of curiosity and can show interest in their surroundings but those
tendencies to be curious and to look around are not really strongly developed in these animals.
They do however have a strong flocking tendency and quickly clump together at the first sign of
any trouble or danger. They're not very adventurous and are thus rather easy to confine so long as
they have the company of other sheep. A single sheep is a very unhappy animal. Goats on the other hand
as browsers generally have their heads up looking for new twigs or branches to browse.
They're willing to eat tough weeds and shrubs as well as pasture so they can be very useful to
farmers in clearing new land for farming. Now unlike sheep they're very curious and show
considerable interest in all aspects of their surroundings. They'll stay together when being
herded but they don't have the same strong flocking drive that sheep display. They can be
quite difficult to define or to confine unlike sheep and are known as real escape artists as
they try to seek out new browsing areas. Recently on a trip to the Pyrenees I had the privilege
of following a flock of several thousand sheep use that were being moved from the
wintering areas to summer pastures. There were a number of goats tagging along with this flock.
When I tried to get the shepherds to tell me why they alluded to the fact that it was good to have
the goats because they were smarter than the sheep and helped move the flock along and they also
as an aside pointed out that they tasted pretty good as well. Both of these species are ruminants
possessing a multi-chambered stomach including a rumin which is in essence a large fermentation chamber
containing numerous cellulose digesting microorganisms. The presence of this rumin
permits both sheep and goats to prosper on fairly low quality browse or forage. We'll return to the
importance of this to our theme in a few moments. Now pigs have been a great source of meat for humans
for millennia. They're generalized monogastric omnivores that can thrive on food scraps found
near human settlements. What do we mean by generalized monogastric omnivore? It means that
they can eat a wide range of food types. They have a dentition that will allow them to eat meat,
it'll allow them to eat grain, it'll allow them to be scavengers but what they eat goes to a single
stomach as is the case with us okay. They can forage, they can root and they can scavenge food
from a variety of sources so they're really relatively easy to nourish. They're also highly
fecund producing fairly large litters on at least an annual basis and if managed intently
you might get them to breed a little bit more often than that giving these early animal breeders
ample opportunity for selective breeding opportunities and to practice artificial selection
to go for the types and forms that they like the best that perform the best. Wild pigs have a very
broad range and thus may have been domesticated at a number of different sites. There is evidence for
domestication in the north central region of the fertile crescent from the Eurasian wild boar,
an animal that lives wild in that area and they they can show that that happened somewhere between
8,500 and 7,000 years ago but there are also claims made for an earlier domestication in China.
Domestic pigs are generally smaller than their wild progenitors and they reach sexual maturity
earlier causing juvenile traits to persevere into adulthood. This characteristic called
neotony is not again unusual in domesticated animals. It's even true for example in dogs if you look
at the traits of an adult wolf and you look at the traits of a wolf pup you'll notice that
adult dogs if they haven't been modified too much to for example become brachiosophallic
or have one of those pushed-in faces that bulldogs have if they haven't been modified too much you
can see that there's a little bit of the immature wolf preserved in the mature dog. This is neotony.
The size of the tusks in the male pigs are also generally smaller another neotonous trait than
in wild pigs. That's a trait that makes domestic pigs much easier to be around than wild boars
though care still has to be taken in dealing with pigs because both sexes the males and the females
can and do bite and every year we hear about some person who's engaged in raising pigs being
attacked by one of these animals and and they are sometimes killed and and and pretty badly mangled
so pigs have to be dealt with carefully. Since pigs are not easily herded they tended to become
isolated in little islands or pockets in a number of defined locations around specific human
settlements giving rise eventually to a very rich variety of forms and types that are the
foundation for the many modern breeds that we have. And of note for this course they also
provided a ready supply of meat that could be kept penned didn't need to be taken out to herd
and required less land to maintain. So here again this helps make civilization possible
in multiple environments and circumstances through the various traits of given domesticates.
Horse evolution still remains a complex story with a number of dead-end species in a complex
series of moves across the face of the globe and several great extinction events. The story may
have begun in what is now North America but at just about the time of the arrival of the first
modern humans on that continent evidence for the existence of horses disappeared from the Americas.
It's thought that the modern domestic horse arose on the steps of Eurasia probably descended
from a recently extinct animal known as the tarpan and I've only seen pictures of tarpans
they're extinct they look horse like but they they they have distinct differences from modern
horses. Though the story of the provenance of the domestic horse is hardly settled with
a number of different theories still under consideration this is an active area of research
and people are I think zeroing in on the question very effectively I think in a few years we're
going to know pretty much how the domestic horse came into being. The presence of multiple
mitochondrial DNA types in domestic horses suggests one of two things there were either
multiple domestication events okay happening probably in close proximity but in different
places and at different times or there is another possibility and this is the one that I favor
and that is that what you have is three different matrilineal lines arising from the breeding
of three different mares probably to one confined wild stallion why do I favor that one if you've
ever been around wild stallions you realize how difficult these animals would be to capture
and to handle and then how difficult they would be to get into a breeding situation that wouldn't
damage either them or the mare so this may be a situation where some early domesticators
found possibly a smaller slightly more docile less flight oriented stallion captured him and once
they had him they then put him with probably more than three mares but ultimately got three
successful maternal lines going no proof of that but my tendencies are to favor
that hypothesis based on what I know about wild horses and horses in general the wild
progenitors of horses were probably a declining group okay not like we see with sheep or goats
where they're flourishing in a particular area but they were probably a declining group limited
in distribution to the Eurasian step it's likely that this was not a place where these
animals then were doing terribly well but rather may have been a sort of last refuge remember
equines were going extinct in various ways and at various times around the globe but because
they were in that sort of refuge place they and became domesticated that may have very much
contributed to their survival so what we have here is yet another example of the benefits of
the partnership between animals and humans a benefit to the humans but very possibly also
a significant benefit to the animal the first use that people made of horses after their
domestication was probably for meat for milk for hides for bone and even for dung which was used
as a fuel in fact horse droppings when dried make a very nice fuel because horses don't process their
manure quite the same way that the ruminants do it was only later that horses began to be prized
for their motive power both to do work and to carry people either on their backs
or by pulling wagons or chariots or some other conveyance the anatomy the physiology and the
temperament of horses all factor into their domestication and their special place in human
transportation and mobility in both peace and war horses are monogastric herbivores it's one of
the reasons that they're dung when dried makes a pretty good fuel they do best on high quality
forage and they like some grain in their diet some have described the modern horse as an actual
running machine i realize that's kind of a homely term but it may be an app description
even the heavy boned draft horses are relatively fleet of foot when compared to other quotes
barnyard animals horses have a very large nasal airway they have to bring a lot of air into their
lungs in order to support their activity as a running animal but they can't breathe through
their mouths they're plumbing up around their head is different than our own when we get out of
breath we open our mouths and breathe through our mouth a horse doesn't get any benefit from having
its mouth open all its air comes in through its nose so this is permitted horsemen over the years
to successfully fit an implement called a bit into the mouth of horses permitting them to be
controlled because you can pull their head around one way or another without impeding their ability
to draw in large amounts of air to support their muscular activity while they're running
so horses often when they're harnessed up to be used have a bit in their mouth if you'll notice
some other animals don't have that when they're harnessed up they have a yoke or something else
and they don't have anything inserted into their mouth we know that all existing equines have some
limited ability to interbreed with each other and produce offspring in many cases these offspring
are sterile and incapable of reproducing but these sterile offspring are often larger stronger
and more intelligent than either of their parents mules are the result of crossing a horse with an
ass or a donkey these animals have great utility as beasts of burden the art and the science of
mule making may have reached its absolute zenith with again napoleon bonaparte that master of
logistics he developed a gigantic mule by using the big french draft horse the percheron and crossing
it with the world's largest asinine species the world's largest donkey which is still today
found in france and a few of those animals are now in the united states and i've had the
pleasure of looking at them they're quite interesting to observe there's some disagreement
concerning the early domestication of cattle and other bovine species some suggest that there's
evidence for domestication of these creatures as long as 10 000 years ago while others set the
time only about 5000 years before the present now we're pretty relaxed about time in this
prehistoric era but 5000 years there's got to be a reason so part of the uncertainty comes from
the fact that before cattle were confined their herds were followed by pastoralist people who
later than herded these cattle but still did not routinely confine the cattle confinement and more
intense artificial selection probably did not begin until some of these semi-domesticated cattle
became small enough and comfortable enough with humans to permit confinement and genetic
manipulation and i think that situation accounts for that sort of 5000 year uncertainty a few things
do seem certain about the process of the domestication of bovine so ever it's certainly agreed that
whatever the actual date of domestication cattle were domesticated after dogs sheep
goats and swine it also seems clear that cattle were used first for meat hides bone
and horn later these beasts were used to provide labor and they could produce significant power
when hitched to a plow or something of that sort and finally milking became an intense activity
with bovine milk providing substantial portions of the nutrition of a number of cultures all the
bovines are ruminants like sheep and goats so they have the capacity to gain a significant portion
of their nutrition from cellulose what difference is this made in developing civilization well the
answer is that sheep goats and cattle can live on on very low quality forage or browse and that
civilization based on those domesticates was sustainable even in harsh environments these
animals are very good at converting low quality forages into meat or milk or other products so
as noted earlier multiple varieties of domesticates enabled civilization to rise around the world
in a range of circumstances we can see now the utility of these various animals and plants
as early civilizations began to take root though there are several species in the bovine subfamily
we'll limit our discussion to the water buffalo and cattle members of the genus boss water buffalo
have been domesticated for at least 4 000 years domestic water buffalo are of two general types
the swamp buffalo of southeast asia which is generally used as a draft animal aiding in the
cultivation of patty rice the river buffalo can also be a draft animal but is probably best known to
europeans and americans for its contribution of milk and the cheeses derived from that milk
true mozzarella and ricotta cheeses should be made from buffalo milk not the more easily
obtained cow's milk despite this iconic role for the water buffalo in modern italian culture
in cucina it should be noted that the dictator bonito musolini actually made an effort to eliminate
the water buffalo from italy because he felt it linked italyans to more primitive cultures
amazing okay domestic cattle boss torus evolved from the wild orrox boss primogenius the now
extinct orrox were grouped into three populations that evolved separately over time european type
or torine cattle do not have those big humps on their necks or backs and are thought to have been
derived from one of those strains of orrox while zebu or humped cattle were likely derived in a
separate domestication from one of the other orrox strains that had evolved separately over the years
in addition to being without a hump torine cattle also do not have a set of muscles under the skin
that allow them to twitch their skin as zebu do this means that torines can be bothered more by
flies because they lack one of the mechanisms for repelling flies that zebu have dna studies
suggest that the sanga cattle of africa are the result of yet another domestication but one which
involves input from both torine and zebu strains now the practice of removing the young
from a lactating cow after she's had a calf or a you after she's had a lamb or a nanny after she's
had a kid for the purpose of milking that animal and extending the lactation period came after
cattle sheep and goats were domesticated for other purposes this does a couple of things
it creates small immature animals that can go as meat sources for things like baby lamb
kid or veal it also means that you can extend the lactation period of the mother by milking or on
a daily or multiple times daily period and you keep the milk coming and you can use it for a
number of sources the milk then of these animals and that of other domesticates can be consumed
directly by humans providing a nutritious addition to the diet but secondary products with different
properties and longer shelf life or longer useful life have been in use in various cultures for
millennia yogurt is a naturally occurring product of raw whole milk which generally contains enough
lactic acid bacteria that is members of the genus lactobacillus to initiate the process of yogurt
making now it should be noted that if you go to the grocery store and pick up a bottle of milk and
want to make yogurt for it from it you've got to go through some other steps because your milk's
been pasteurized many of those lactic acid bacteria have been killed and if you just set that milk
out it won't turn to yogurt it'll spoil because there are some spoilage bacteria left in there
and spoiled or sour milk is not yogurt yogurt is a very different product made by the the
activities of these lactobacilli it was probably first developed in the middle east or asia minor
but it was known to be serving as a portable nutritious food source for the viking raiders
by the time they were pillaging and sacking coastal europe in the eighth through the 12th
century so yogurt gets all the way up into scandinavia and we know that scandinavians today
still like their yogurt but it also was probably centered originally in in the middle east and the
fact that the lactobacillus that makes yogurt is called lactobacillus bulguricus suggests that
there may be a fair amount of yogurt eaten in bulgaria as well like so many other food products
cheese was probably first developed in the middle east the practice of cheese making though is
thought to only be about 4 000 years old we talked in an earlier lecture about how secondary
products from plants expand their uses and we see the same case here with cheese and yogurt
not to mention the many other secondary products that can be derived from animals cheese can be
made from virtually any kind of milk and there are a number of ways to form and process the curds
once they're formed remember cheese is essentially a collection of the solid materials from milk
the curd the liquid or huay is usually discarded in the cheese making process so there are over
400 distinct types of cheese known and within each of those types there are a number of variants
so cheese is a wonderfully rich cultural expression of what we can do in the making of a secondary
product from something like milk butter of course is generally made from cow's milk when whole milk
or cream is churned and an emulsion of milk fats and water form this sort of semi-solid uh that's
prized in in many cultures for cooking or for using directly and of course a bright byproduct
of butter making is butter milk which can also be used we've talked about some of the most
successful domesticates but there were many failed efforts as well okay we know that many
domesticates and many attempts were made to domesticate creatures and they just did not work
out so we've now focused on a relatively small number of domesticated animals and i would like
to leave you with the question now where would the civilized world be had we not been able to
successfully domesticate these organisms i've tried to make the case all along that civilization
could not have come about had it not been for the domestication of some of these key animals
i hope by now that point has been amply made but another way to examine the same question would be
where would civilization be if we simply pulled away all of our domesticated plants and animals
let's say just the ones we've talked about so far the cereal grains the few plants we've talked
about that make up much of the bulk of what we eat and the products provided to us by these animals
we've talked about and the services we've received from dogs and cats i think the case is made
that civilization is dependent upon these domesticates in the next lecture we'll go into greater
depth and discussion of the methods plant and animal breeders employ to improve the breeds
and varieties that they have and then conserve the fruits of their labors in true breeding
predictable genetic packages we'll see you next time
