In our last lecture we talked about the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and at the
very end of the lecture I talked about the Geluk school and the founder of that school
whose name was Tsongkhapa. Now I didn't get a chance to talk very extensively about Tsongkhapa
and his tradition last time and the reason for that is that we want to dig in this lecture more
deeply into the significance of that school in Tibetan history. The Geluk school was represented
by the lineage of the Dalai Lama and for many people Tibetan Buddhism today is really personified
and represented by the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. So this lecture is a chance for us to focus on
probably the most visible single symbol of Tibetan Buddhism in the world and perhaps the most visible
and influential spokesman for Buddhism in any Buddhist tradition. The present Dalai Lama who
is the 14th in the line of Dalai Lamas received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his peaceful
resistance to Chinese rule in Tibet. From his exile in India the Dalai Lama has traveled around
the world to champion the Tibetan cause and present Buddhist solutions to many of the problems that
people feel we suffer from in one way or another in the modern world. So for us in this course he
really functions as a bridge between the ancient cultural traditions of Tibet the traditions that
we've been talking about in the last two lectures and all of the complex challenges that face people
in any modern society in the 20th century. So let's start with a simple question basic question
who is the Dalai Lama who is this person who personifies for us for so many of us the Tibetan
tradition. Tibetans believe that the present Dalai Lama is the 14th in a line of incarnations
that goes back into the 14th century and when the 13th Dalai Lama his predecessor died back in the
mid 1930s a bunch of Tibetan monks authorities in Lhasa and key figures in the government
searched for his reincarnation found a little boy up in northern Tibet and designated him as the
reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama brought him to Lhasa and had him educated so that he could
serve this function and play this role in the Tibetan tradition. Now when I tell the story to
you this way the story of reincarnation and discovering a new representative of an ancient
lineage raises a question for us about Tibetan Buddhism about an aspect of Tibetan Buddhism
that is quite different from anything that you like to likely to see in other religious traditions
it's the system called the Tolku system or the system of reincarnation of passing the authority
in a lineage like this down not from father to son or from a teacher to student but from
one incarnation to another each one of which has to be discovered by some process in the next
generation what is the Tolku system what is a Tolku what do we mean when we use this word
the word Tolku was used traditionally to refer to the so-called manifestation body of a Buddha
this is the body that a celestial Buddha manifests in this world celestial Buddha as you know
lives in some celestial realm a pure land or a heaven and then manifests a form a physical form
in this world here in the Tibetan context it's used to refer to the form that a particular saint
or a religious leader adopts when he or she is reborn in this world the Tolku system is quite
widespread in Tibetan Buddhism I first went into my study of Tibetan Buddhism thinking that it was
very rare and unusual to discover one of these reincarnations but I was taught very soon that
there actually are lots of incarnations and lots of different communities in Tibet the way I learned
this first was to go and visit a Geluk monastery down in South India where there is a major Tibetan
refugee camp and I had a camera it was back in the 70s and there weren't a lot of cameras around and
they asked me if I'd take a picture of all of the Tolku's in the monastery it wasn't a very big
monastery it turned out to be a pretty big group photo there were at least half a dozen
significant Tolku's just in that small monastery so there are lots of Tolku's in the Tibetan
tradition and it's widespread practice to deal in one way or another with the transmission of
authority from one generation to the next it also isn't associated just with the school of
the Dalai Lama's it's found in other schools such as the Kagu school that I mentioned in the last
lecture if you follow Tibetan Buddhism in the news you'll know that there has been a hot controversy
in the last few years about the reincarnation of a Kagu Lama who is known as the Karmapa the Karmapa
Lama the previous Karmapa was quite influential and charismatic he lived in Bhutan he traveled
widely in the west and he exercised a lot of influence among Tibetan Buddhists not just in
the refugee community in India but also through the Tibetan Buddhist communities in North America
and I can say just in passing that he was indeed a rather interesting person I had one of my most
wonderful encounters with a Tibetan teacher with the Karmapa just before his death he was dying of
stomach cancer and he came to the Harvard Divinity School to make a visit and I
thinking that it was rare to see a Tibetan Lama of this significance and magnitude I invited all of
my class on Buddhism to go up and listen to him and it was a truth be told a rather sleepy talk
but he mentioned compassion and he mentioned wisdom and a lot of the themes that you'd expect him to
to mention in a talk about the basic ideas of his tradition and afterwards he was to hold an
audience so he sat down in one of the lounges and we all were ushered in one by one to speak to him
and I it's hard to make small talk with a Lama who is as influential as this but I said to him
well you know oh wise Karmapa I brought my class to visit you today I was talking about
compassion with him this morning as we were talking about the ideal of the bodhisattva
and I was delighted that they had a chance to hear about compassion from such an influential
and wise figure as you and he looked me straight in the eye looked me straight in the eye and he
said professor echo I want you to know that whenever you speak about compassion I will be
standing behind you now this is a man who is supposed to have very powerful influence over
the course of karmic events in the world and I have always just peeked around behind me whenever
I mentioned the word compassion just to see if the karmapa is present you should keep an eye out
for him too just in case he happens to manifest himself in these lectures shortly after that
meeting he died shortly after I had a chance to meet him he died and of course the search started
for his reincarnation and it turned out as often happens in the Tibetan tradition they were competing
reincarnations one was found in Bhutan and another was found in Tibet representing different parties
in the followers and associates of the of the karmapa just a couple of years ago
the Tibetan reincarnation of the karmapa in a hair-raising and adventurous escape
managed to get over the Himalayas and into India and presented himself to the Dalai Lama
in India as the authoritative representative of this tradition he's just a young man a teenager
and it turned out actually that he has become a rather influential and respected figure even
at a young age he has a certain kind of authority that I can imagine I can certainly imagine having
known his predecessor in this lineage and some people think that he may very well be a very
important leader in the Tibetan community in the next generation so there are lots of tulkus in
the Tibetan tradition and they occupy a very special position of authority throughout the
different schools of Tibetan Buddhism now returning to the Dalai Lama himself the first person to be
recognized retrospectively as a Dalai Lama was a disciple of Tsongkapa whose name was Gendun
Drupa who was born in the year 1391 so he lived in the 14th and 15th centuries the title Dalai
Lama was not given until later in the development of the lineage it was given to the third Dalai Lama
whose name was Sonam Gyatso by the Mongol leader Altan Khan the title Dalai Lama means ocean Lama
and it seems to suggest to most people that the Dalai Lama possesses an ocean of wisdom
with the title came Mongol support in the power struggles that eventually made the Dalai Lamas
not only the leaders of the Gelukpa school but also the spiritual and temporal rulers of Tibet
now obviously this is an unusual combination we haven't seen this before in our study of
Buddhism usually Buddhist monks avoid getting themselves involved directly in politics in
fact there are lots of very marvelous examples of Buddhist monks who were drawn into politics
inadvertently by the actions of various kings or political leaders and quite dramatically withdrew
in order to keep a distance between their own monastic practice and the political life that
was going on around them but Buddhism has always had a strong political side of course
talked about that a lot over the course of these lectures this political involvement
in the Buddhist tradition has been associated particularly with the figure of the Dharma Raja
or the righteous king first of these or the first definitive most influential of these was Ashoka the
king who lived back only a couple of centuries or so after the death of the Buddha now you could
think of the Dalai Lama this is not inaccurate to think of him in this way as one of the few
figures in Buddhist history who has brought the ideal of the righteous king of the political
leader the king who protects the community and promulgates the Dharma he's brought this ideal
together with the ideal of the charismatic monk in one person so the Dalai Lama in some ways is
the unique figure that he is and the powerful figure that he is because he is able to unite the
political side of Buddhism with the monastic side makes him complex but it also makes him
influential in a way that would not be found in other aspects of the Buddhist tradition
the transition from purely monastic power to what we are calling temporal power political power in
the secular affairs of Tibet was accomplished by one of the great figures in this lineage the so
called great fifth Dalai Lama fifth in the lineage who lived from 1617 to 1683 so he lived in the
17th century when the pilgrims were making their way over here to America the fifth Dalai Lama
outmaneuvered his rivals with the help of a Mongol prince and he established
ke luke political dominance over Tibet so it had not been done before and the fifth Dalai Lama was
the figure who really made this possible and as a symbol of his authority he built that great palace
in Lhasa it's known as the Potala Palace that is I think in so many ways a symbol of the lineage
of the Dalai Lamas and for many people I think a symbol of Tibet I suspect that most of you have
some kind of a visual image of it in your heads it's really an important focus of pilgrimage
in the Tibetan tradition and a place that a lot of Buddhist travelers would want would very much
like to have a chance to see when you go to Lhasa when I was there a couple of years ago what you
do very often normal way to approach the the old part of the city is to go down a long boulevard
called it's now called Beijing boulevard built by the Chinese authorities and then you go past a
small stupa in between two hills and up on the left hand side rises the potala the potala palace
dominating a big square it's a very traditional structure in a lot of ways it's made out of stone
and it's it's massive in the old days during great festival events in Lhasa people would or monks
would hang great hangings off the front of the potala it's an enormous long stone ramp in the
front of it that would be very suitable for that kind of thing when I'm struck by when I see it
when I see pictures of it and also when I was standing there in person fairly lightheaded
my first encounter with the altitude in Tibet I'm struck by how massive it is of course how much it
sits down so firmly on the ground but also how it sits almost as if it's an architectural version
of an old Buddhist statue it also has a little bit of that buoyancy of the Buddha so it sits
firmly on the ground and it also seems to float sometimes the Tibetans even describe it as a bird
with two wings on the side and then one massive palatial structure in the center so it's a remarkable
and I think very effective architectural symbol of not just the Dalai Lama's of course and the
power and imagination of the great fifth but also of the Tibetan tradition itself this palace has
been the traditional seat of the Dalai Lama's until the Chinese occupation of Tibet in the early
1950s and it still is a major goal of pilgrimage in the Tibetan tradition and truly an impressive
monument the first Dalai Lama to become enmeshed in international politics was the 13th Dalai Lama
who lived from 1876 to 1935 he tried to isolate Tibet from what was then known as the great game
the political struggle that took place between Russia and Britain for influence in Central Asia
the British even though we often imagine them as being enormously powerful in India felt often that
their control of India was tenuous and might easily easily slip away and they were very much
concerned about being undermined by the expansion of Russian influence in Central Asia so they sent
messages in the early part of the ninth of the 20th century up to Tibet trying to find some way to
enlist Tibetan support or at least to ensure Tibetan neutrality in this tug of war between the
Russians and the British Tibetans as you might imagine weren't particularly interested in answering
their mail because they didn't want to get drawn into this political struggle between the Russians
and the British so the British to try to get a response sent a military expedition up to Lhasa
through Sikkim and up through the great fortress in Gyansi and eventually into Lhasa
it was led by a Colonel Young husband and it's referred to often as the Young husband expedition
it was a subject of an awful lot of romantic speculation as you can imagine in the British
press at the time because they felt that they were really opening up a very mysterious part of
the world in some ways as those early travelers and early explorers said the last undiscovered
and unexplored area of the world at least from the European point of view that they
represented the Dalai Lama fled when the Young husband expedition came in but they the British
forced a settlement with the representatives of the Dalai Lama who were still present and
from that time through the 20th century until the coming of the Chinese in the 50s the British
kept a diplomatic mission in Tibet that served at least in part as one of the as a means of
communication between the Tibetans and the outside world and provided for us as scholars of Tibet
and early and important glimpse what was going on in Tibetan society in that time.
Now the weight of international responsibility and the real difficulty of trying to work through
conflict with great powers fell most heavily not on the 13th Dalai Lama but on the 14th Dalai
Lama the one who is alive today and is the symbol of Tibetan Buddhism for many.
His name the name of the 14th Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso and he was born in 1935 in Amdo
in northern Tibet a region that was under the control of the Chinese. The story of the discovery
of the Dalai Lama is one that's reasonably well known it's told in the Dalai Lama's autobiography
and it's one that's well worth retelling it tells something about his personality and something
about the function of traditional Tibetan society. When the previous Dalai Lama died the reins of
power were handed over in Tibet to a region and the region became responsible for setting in
motion a process that would find a successor to the previous Dalai Lama and he being a practitioner
and a monk went down to a lake in southern Tibet and meditated until he had a vision
of a place that might be likely as a possible site for the rebirth of this great figure turned
out it was a small village with a farmhouse in a barren site in northern Tibet with particular
characteristics and he sent a group of monks up into this region to look for a likely child.
They visited the farmhouse of the young boy who became the 14th Dalai Lama disguised not as the
grand figures that they were but as simple monks and they presented to this child a test.
They had brought things that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama small objects that
only the Dalai Lama himself would know and mix them together with other objects that had belonged
to other people lined them up on the table and asked the boy to select the things that were his
the story that's told the course is that with some kind of uncanny accuracy he managed to
select out exactly the things that had belonged to him in a previous life with one exception there
was one object that he hesitated over and they discovered later that it was an object that sure
it had been in his possession in a previous life but it was unclear that it really belonged to him.
So they interpreted this as meaning that that memory of some questionable ownership was carried
on into the next life. In any case they identified this child of course as the reincarnation of the
13th Dalai Lama and brought him back to Lhasa to be trained as a monk along with his family.
In 1950 when this Dalai Lama was only 15 years old and really hadn't come into
shall we say full authority in Lhasa that after the Second World War the Chinese armies attacked
and occupied Tibet so I mentioned earlier China has felt for many centuries that the Chinese
regime as the heir of the Mongols has inherited political authority over Tibet and this has been
as true in the 20th century as it was in earlier centuries so that when the communist government
solidified its power in China and began to expand its influence into other areas of China
Tibet was a natural place for them to expand their influence so Chinese armies attacked
and occupied Tibet. It wasn't terribly difficult to do that Tibetan army wasn't terribly strong or
very well trained or really even very numerous so the Chinese were able quite easily to come in
and take over central Tibet. The Dalai Lama stayed there for a while and negotiated with the Chinese
but then in 1959 there was a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese and the Dalai Lama fled to
India and established his home in exile in the town of Dharamsala in northern India and he lives
there today that's the base for his travels around the rest of the world. Now the Dalai Lama is
interesting to us I think of course not just because he represents this traditional lineage of
Tibetan Buddhism but also because he has articulated for us a particularly powerful and
eloquent vision of Buddhism in the modern world and that's the last thing that I'd like to discuss
in the time we have in this lecture on the Dalai Lama. How does Buddhism look to him? When he has
a chance to present Buddhism to us what does it look like? What issues does he focus on? What
problems does he particularly think are important to try to solve and what can we take away from
his teaching that will help us understand Buddhism in a simpler and more intuitive way perhaps than
some of the complexities of the tradition that we've encountered in our historical survey of India
and Tibet? I often find when I listen to the Dalai Lama speaking about Buddhism especially to an
audience that isn't one that he's worked with in great detail before but just one that he's
encountering for the first time I find that he starts with that first point. It's important
in the Four Noble Truths. He's concerned about the removal of suffering especially in his recent
speeches the ones that have been coming in the last couple of years. He says really you know
everybody wants to be happy. Everybody wants to find a way to remove suffering. He also is very
skillful in the way he uses phrases often from political documents that are important in other
cultures. He says really everyone has the right to pursue happiness, the right for the pursuit of
happiness and what we as Buddhists are trying to do is to facilitate that process simply to let
people be happy and to remove their suffering. It seems very simple in a lot of ways and almost
the kind of thing that would be so simple you wouldn't expect it from as sophisticated a person
as the Dalai Lama and yet it starts you right out at that key point where Buddhists always begin.
All is suffering. What can we do to try to remove it? So I suspect if you look at the Dalai Lama
speeches or if you have a chance to encounter him in person as he travels through North America or
the rest of the world this is where you will hear him start. We suffer and we want to be happy.
And then he often stresses the increasing interdependence of the human community. Not just
the interdependence of phenomena that make up the human personality but the interdependence
of all human beings in the world. This is an important theme for him. This reflects the image
of interdependent co-arising that lies behind the second of the noble truths but it often has a
political spin and a spin that ties him and his own aspirations together with the aspirations of
other people in the rest of the world. When he offers positive solutions to the problem of
suffering he often builds his moral arguments on the foundation of the Bodhisattva's compassion.
In fact if you want to know what compassion sounds like and what kind of arguments you can use to
promote compassion in the world the Dalai Lama is not a bad place to go. He speaks simply,
he speaks eloquently but his arguments come right straight out of the ancient tradition
of India. There are two particular arguments that he often uses as what you might call tool
submeditation for the development of compassion. One is an old Indian ideal of visualizing everybody
in the universe as being your mother in a previous life. How could you not express compassion to your
mother and express feel some sense of connectedness to her? If everyone has been your mother in a
previous life there is a deep bond of sympathy and compassion that you can build on in your
relationships. This old form of meditation is something that connects well with him and he
preaches it eloquently to his audiences. He also uses a funny more technical meditation on
compassion that's well worth thinking about. It comes from an eighth century Buddhist text in
India. It's called the exchange of self and other. He says if you feel anger, if you feel envy,
there's almost something tantric about this in the way it's presented often in traditional texts.
If you feel anger, if you feel envy, if you feel even a certain kind of destructive rage against
other people, don't feel it on your own behalf toward others. But let them feel it toward you.
Put yourself in their shoes and feel that anger towards yourself. It's a funny way of taking
anger and not denying it but transmuting it. Recognizing that it's there but using it as a
tool to try to develop some compassionate bond between people. Very interesting idea and it's
one that he often uses especially in his relations with the Chinese. He is very fond of saying that
he's grateful to the Chinese for having taught him patience and given him an opportunity to
meditate on the virtues of compassion. Another thing that the Dalai Lama often
does that you may encounter if you try to seek him out in a more technical Tibetan setting is to
give initiations into a tantric teaching known as the Kalachakra Tantra. This is a particular
Tantra that comes from a late period in India and it has to do with establishing the sovereignty of
the Dharma over a particular space. The Dalai Lama is a political leader and I think often
he in subtle ways attempts to convey his sense of political authority through the teaching of the
Kalachakra Tantra. It gets people thinking about him not just as a religious teacher but as somebody
who embodies in many respects the solid power and strength of the Dharma, Raja. The Dalai Lama
also makes important statements about significant public issues and it's intriguing to see which
ones he selects as being particularly noteworthy. Human rights are important for him. Of course,
why? Because one of the things that he wants very much to do is establish the human rights
of the Tibetan people. Their right to some form of autonomy or self-determination.
He also is concerned about the exploitation of the environment. This is a theme we haven't talked
about very much in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism previously but it's a theme that's significant
for the Dalai Lama and then of course he's very much concerned about the oppression of minority
peoples as you would expect from his Tibetan experience. Now from the Chinese point of view,
he's not necessarily a benign figure because he represents in the modern world this nascent
Tibetan aspiration for self-determination but I feel that for us as students of Buddhism,
he is a remarkable embodiment of this tradition and one well worth listening to,
well worth getting to know better in order to understand how this tradition can be
brought to the issues of contemporary life.
Thank you.
