Lecture 19, The Origins of Chinese Buddhism
For the last three lectures, we've been talking about the Buddhism of Tibet.
It's been the focus of our discussion and the point really of our first expansion of
discussion of Buddhism beyond India.
But the truth is we've gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves because Buddhism had been
in China for over 500 years by the time Buddhism actually entered Tibet.
So the focus of our attention in this lecture and the lecture that follows will be the process
of transformation that took place in the first few generations amongst the first few generations
of Chinese Buddhists as they attempted to adapt the Buddhist tradition to all of the complex
ancient and venerable traditions of China and in the process to meet the very distinctive
needs of the Chinese people and the needs of Chinese culture.
Now when Buddhist monks first began to appear in the Chinese capital in the middle of the
second century of the common era, quite a bit before Buddhism entered Tibet, China was
coming to the end of one of the most expansive periods in its history.
During the Han dynasty that lasted from 206 before the common era to 220 of the common
era, China was stable and it was prosperous.
It was a good place to live actually.
It was one of the most wonderful times really in the history of Chinese civilization.
New lands were constantly being opened up for development.
There were advances in technology and the arts and for the upper classes at least it
was a time of tremendous optimism and luxury.
Probably wasn't too bad actually for the peasantry as well because China was stable
in that time and they could confidently expect that the crops they planted in the spring
time they might actually benefit from in the fall.
So China was a prosperous place and a stable place in a very classic Chinese style.
And with the prosperity of Han China came the ideological synthesis that we know as Han
Confucianism.
Starting from the teaching of the ancient sage Confucius, Chinese scholars had created
a vision of heaven, earth and human society as a single harmonious whole.
At the center of this cosmic order stood the emperor, the ruler of China, observing all
of the prescribed rituals and civilizing his people through the cultivation of proper behavior
and moral virtue.
Key Confucian values in the Han period had to do with values that I suspect most of you
know and would associate with traditional Chinese civilization.
Philiopiety, respect for elders, basic Chinese value, deeply rooted in the Confucian tradition
and particularly important in the stable structure of Chinese society during the Han dynasty.
Another important Chinese value had to do with a sense of harmonious, sensitive and
respectful relationships with other people.
This value we call in English these days goodness or humanity.
It's a particular Confucian value that's found in the ancient texts and it's important
really throughout the Confucian tradition right through to the present day.
Another important Confucian value had to do with the respect for proper ritual and the
civilizing effect that rituals had on ordinary human interactions and human behavior.
Now this vision of society is probably familiar to a lot of you and I may not have as much
trouble expressing it to you as I would have expressing it to my freshman at Boston University
but you can imagine when I talk to a class at nine in the morning as they slouch down
in their chairs and sip a little on their coffee cups that this great Confucian model
of a harmonious society tied together by bonds of respect and the proper performance of simple
social rituals just doesn't kind of connect.
There's something about this that seems a little bit strange and a little bit foreign
especially to the adolescent imagination so there's a challenge in the classroom often
to try to come up with an image an example a model that we can use to try to understand
why this actually might be important to do an important value to learn.
I often try to get people to imagine what it would be like to go to their first job interview.
This is an example that was actually taught to me by some of my Confucian teachers so I'm not
straying too far from the tradition itself.
When you go to your first job interview you're trying to imagine what it would be like to fit
in a harmonious but somewhat respectful and strong way into a human organization that you
want to play a productive part in.
First thing you have to do is you open the door walk into the room and meet an interviewer
is simply shake hands you got to shake hands and imagine what that simple ritual actually
involves conveys a lot from one person to another in our culture you want to have a firm handshake
it wants to let you want it to last just the right amount of time it has to convey a sense of
respect to the other person but also a sense of self-respect and stability in yourself a lot can
be conveyed by just simply that basic gesture of human relationship in this Confucian vision
of the world society is made up out of millions of little interactions like that where there is a
certain understood prescribed way of doing things a good way to express respect for the other person
and also at the same time respect to express a certain sense of self-confidence and groundedness
and wisdom about your own position in the world it's not too far fetched to imagine that this is
something that a freshman might want to cultivate a little bit in college not just have all the fun
that you want to do as you go out leave the classroom and well I won't even speculate about
what people do when they leave the classroom there of course is a lot of that in college
but there also is an opportunity to develop a sensitivity to some of these basic rituals that
tie human society together it was really out of this simple insight that Confucianism flourished
during the Han dynasty it obviously is based on an assumption that society is rather stable
and their roles that are prescribed for us that we can play with a certain degree of gracefulness
and effectiveness when society begins to fall apart then a lot of this stuff is up for grabs
and that's what happened at the end of the Han dynasty and created an opportunity for the coming
of Buddhism in the middle of the second century the Han synthesis began to fall apart in ways that
are pretty easy to understand the emperor became weak and came under the influence of a lot of
rival factions in the court and also in the countryside you no longer had the power or the
moral force this is as important as the physical power to guarantee the legitimacy of the state
and as factions struggled for power the peasantry the common people who in some ways are really the
backbone of Chinese society became increasingly alienated and oppressed eventually a great
rebellion broke out that caused tremendous turmoil in the rural regions of China and was suppressed
with great bloodshed and seriously weakened the empire and as far as the intellectuals go they
looked for new ways to diagnose and to respond to what they perceive to be the moral malaise of
the times they no longer could really give the same kind of respect and credibility to old ways of
thinking about Chinese society as the structure of Chinese civilization simply disintegrated
around them so China was really ripe for the introduction of new ideas even ideas as foreign
as Buddhism and it's hard to imagine a system of ideas that could be as strange in tradition to
in relation to traditional Chinese ways of thinking as the tradition of the Buddha from India
so as Buddhist monks and travelers and merchants made their way up into China as they moved over
the mountains in Afghanistan and into Central Asia and as they came across the great trade routes
through the Silk Road and began to to communicate Buddhist ideas in a Chinese setting they faced
several obvious but difficult barriers first of all Sanskrit and Chinese were radically different
as languages and as systems of thought we've talked about Sanskrit really is a complex
language capable of expressing quite sophisticated philosophical distinctions
Chinese is much more down to earth it's monosyllabic doesn't have all of these long words like the
Sanskrit word Pratitya Samutpada or the name of Avalokiteshwara or any of those
long Sanskrit terms that we've thrown around in our discussion of Indian Buddhism so it was
difficult initially to try to find a way in Chinese to express some of these Sanskrit ideas
Chinese also had nothing that corresponded to the complex psychological analysis in traditional
Buddhism all the different ways of dividing up the personality or dividing up the process of
enlightenment into so many stages that level of complexity simply didn't exist in Chinese
civilization and was foreign to Chinese ways of thought and more importantly Chinese social values
emphasize the family and the local community they weren't as concerned as the Buddhists were
with universal systems of values and they weren't as focused as the Buddhists were
on the rejection of the family in order to achieve an individual ideal of salvation
now the earliest Buddhist translators and missionaries in China tried to deal with these
problems in different ways Sanskrit and Chinese terms often were matched with one another so
people would try to pick out of the language of Chinese philosophy or Chinese culture a term that
might roughly correspond to some Sanskrit term so the key Buddhist ideas could be matched with
ideas that already were familiar to Chinese audiences often in the process as you can imagine
offensive ideas sort of get dropped you know there's some funny little wrinkle in traditional
Indian Buddhism just isn't going to fit with a Chinese audience out it goes just drop it now on
the other hand aspects of the Indian tradition that were congenial to Chinese tastes tended to
rise in prominence this is a process actually it's very interesting to observe when we were
talking about the Bodhisattva back in our initial discussion of Indian Mahayana Buddhism I mentioned
the Bodhisattva by the name of Vimalakirti a layman lived a life of a layman and also managed to
bring into his ordinary lay life a profound understanding of emptiness and the teaching
of the Buddha now the truth is there are lots of Bodhisattvas in Indian literature there are
tons of them I could have selected out of that vast literature all sorts of people to focus on
but I plucked out Vimalakirti in part because that's one of these characters that the Chinese
focused on he's one of the people that they plucked out because he embodied for them precisely that
combination of familial virtue a respect for community embeddedness within the social order
and also at the same time a sense of wisdom and freedom and understanding of the of the truths
that are expressed in the awakening of the Buddha so Vimalakirti loomed large in the development
of Chinese Buddhism now as we look at the adaptation of Buddhism in China more generally
one of the key factors that made it possible for Buddhism to move as effectively and sympathetically
into the Chinese cultural world as it did was a close relationship between Buddhism
and the indigenous Chinese religious tradition of Taoism as the Han dynasty disintegrated
Chinese intellectuals often turned for their inspiration to the Taoist tradition Taoism was
comparable in its antiquity to the tradition of Confucius and it often represented an opposite
pole in Chinese thinking to the Confucian tradition with its active emphasis on public virtue and
family values in contrast to the active public character of Confucianism Taoism advocated a
strategy of inactivity of withdrawal from the world and contemplation you can imagine that the
Buddhists would have found this very congenial and very familiar the Taoist way or the Tao
was down to earth it was natural it was harmonious and it was inexpressible in words
was something that had to be discerned as it were experientially in particular situations
rather than being expressed by broad conceptual distinctions you can get a taste of Taoist teaching
and I think you can begin to sense the kinship between Taoism and Buddhism if I simply read
a few passages from the Tao to Qing one of the fundamental texts of the Taoist tradition I'll
read a couple of these passages and comment on them we can think about them together chapter one
the very first statement in the Tao to Qing is one it's perhaps familiar to you the Tao that can
be told of is not the eternal Tao the name that can be named is not the eternal name the nameless
is the origin of heaven and earth and the named is the mother of all things here you can see
that the Taoists were skeptical of any attempt to express ultimate reality in names
and this skepticism fits really well with Buddhist attitudes toward ultimate reality
whether it's in the form of no self or in the form of emptiness what the Buddhists are saying
is that there is no permanent identity in anything that you can pin a name on and expect to pin down
so the Taoist emphasis on the nameless the inexpressibility of ultimate reality fit beautifully
with this aspect of Buddhism but you can also see that the Taoists like to think of the Tao
as the ultimate source of things out of which everything comes this is odd from a Buddhist
perspective you remember the story of Malunkya Putta and the arrow when Malunkya Putta asked the
Buddha to explain where the world came from and the Buddha refused to get into any kind of a
discussion about the origin of things he was much more concerned as Buddhism is with analyzing the
suffering we experience right now and finding some way to get rid of it so the Taoist emphasis on
seeing the Tao as the source had a subtle effect on Buddhism changed a bit the way it was understood
and expressed in a Chinese environment now pushing further into the text when Taoists talk about the
Tao they also share a Buddhist reverence for simplicity and especially for images of negation
and images of non-being let me read a couple of passages that express this idea as well
chapter four the Tao is empty like a bowl it is empty like a bowl it may be used but its capacity
is never exhausted it's bottomless perhaps the ancestor of things it blunts its sharpness it
on ties tangles it softens its light it becomes one with the dusty world now these first two lines
just to sense the subtlety of this interaction that's going on here let me read them again
the Tao is empty like a bowl it may be used but its capacity is never exhausted classic
statement about the Tao Nagarjuna once said everything is possible for someone for whom
emptiness is possible nothing is possible for someone for whom emptiness is not possible
emptiness possibility emptiness inexhaustible possibility it's present in both passages
you can see the buzz that these passages set up as you put them side by side but you can also sense
that the idiom is a little different the worldview that produces these two statements
they have different implications different suggestions so Taoism and Buddhism have a natural
kinship but it also will be deeply transformative of Buddhism to translate it into this Taoist form
another chapter in the Tao De Ching that works in a creative way with the image of non-being
is chapter 11 30 spokes are united around the hub to make it a wheel but it is on its non-being
that the utility of the carriage depends clay is molded to form a utensil but it is on its
non-being that the utility of the utensil depends doors and windows are cut out to make a room
but it is on its non-being that the utility of the room depends therefore turn being to advantage
and turn non-being into utility classic Taoist statement about the importance of the empty space
the empty space in a room the empty space in a spoon or the still empty space at the center
of a revolving wheel again you can see very suggestive ways for Buddhism to translate itself
into Chinese vocabulary you can imagine I suspect that Buddhist eyes simply lit up
when they heard this passage and this positive reference to the idea of non-being
now the Taoist tradition also had a very strong tradition of sagehood like the tradition of
sainthood or monastic practice in the Buddhist tradition in India I'll read you a couple examples
of that the best person is like water water is good it benefits all things and does not compete
with them it dwells in lowly places that all disdain that it is is why it is so near the Tao
the sage is also natural this is something we haven't heard about in India but it's an important
idea in the Taoist tradition let me read you a distinctive expression of this aspect of Taoist
practice there's a kind of sage who emulates the wisdom of nature his method of teaching and
transforming are like the relationship between a form and its shadow a sound and its echo
where there's a question there's an answer where there's an action there's a reaction
body and spirit are in harmony when he is at rest there is no sound when he moves he leaves no
trace therefore he is able to bring those who are muddled and confused back to the natural Tao
those people who believe that one's body is the temple of one's soul may well enough be good people
but the person who is able to go beyond his corporeal form is the true companion of nature
only the selfless person can live up to the standards of nature because your body is just
one temporary form in nature's constantly changing process here you have selflessness
the idea of moving through the world and leaving no trace it's very similar to the Buddhist idea
of leaving no karma of course of nirvana and yet this idea of naturalness of flowing with
the natural movement of the world we haven't seen that before that's not an important way of talking
about nirvana or the life of a monk or nun in the indian tradition so again very close kinship but
also a subtle possibility of a shift in values as buddhism enters this chinese world now another
important idea in this tradition the daoist tradition is the idea of wu wei or no action
the text the dao de jing says dao invariably takes no action and yet there is nothing left undone
and it says the softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world
non-being penetrates that in which there is no space through this i know the advantage
of taking no action few in the world can understand the teaching without words and the advantage
and the advantage of taking no action now as i say these words i suspect that you have been
listening to my discussion of daoism with a certain degree of sympathy and probably with
a certain degree of understanding but also wondering at the same time how some of these
great abstractions actually come down to earth especially with the idea of no action it's a
concept that is perhaps appealing in its abstraction but difficult to see how it comes down to earth
so i find when i'm working with students on a concept like this it's important to start talking
about some serious examples it's like get real echo tell me a little bit about how this idea
might actually come down to earth one of the best stories that i think reflects this idea of
daoist no action and also the idea of no conceptual distinctions that really lies behind it is a
story of a daoist farmer who loses his horse this is a poor farmer out there in the countryside
somewhere wherever it is i suppose we could make up a setting to locate him somewhere in the world
he has one horse and one son and the horse runs away and it's gone and his neighbors come up and
say oh my god this is the worst thing that i could possibly imagine your horse is gone how are you
going to plow the field and plant the harvest and the daoist farmer says we'll see we'll see
the next day the horse comes back and it's followed by 10 wild horses and he rounds them all up and
he puts them in the corral and the neighbors come and say whoa that's the most incredible thing we've
ever seen yesterday you didn't have any horse today you've got 11 of them what are you going to do now
he says we'll see and the next day his son goes out to break some of the wild horses and gets thrown
off the horse breaks his hip the neighbors come and say oh this is the most terrible thing we've
ever seen you need your son he's your only son you need him to to plant the fields and to work for
you as you become old what are you going to do now he says we'll see and the next day you begin to
get the drift of the story here i suspect and the next day the emperor's draft board comes through
town and drafts every able-bodied young man in the village and leaves the young man who has just
broken his limbs and the neighbors come in and say well this is the most fantastic thing that's
ever happened what are you going to do now this is fabulous let's all go celebrate and he says
we'll see and at this point i suppose you could say that the story goes dot dot dot dot dot you
can continue it i suppose indefinitely because the point is that anytime a situation seems to
present itself as having a particular meaning you always have to be aware that there will be
another side of it viewed from some other perspective this is really Taoist wisdom not to leap to too
many conclusions but to just allow yourself to harmonize with the flow of events so that you
take advantage of them in a natural way and don't try to turn them into something artificial that
distorts them into something that they're really not this is partly what the Taoists are talking
about when they talk about no action it's a certain sense of detachment and a certain sense of suppleness
in the face of the flow of events you can also see this i think in the practice of the martial arts
that would be another good example here in the west when we fight with somebody one of the things
we like to do is attack them aggressively but you know that in the asian tradition of the martial
arts what you try to do as much as possible is to allow allow an opponent's strength to simply
defeat the opponent so you withdraw and allow the opponent's strength simply to exhaust itself
that's a kind of no action it's no action in with a very particular goal in mind but it's choosing
to withdraw from action rather than to aggressively attack a situation in some positive sense now in
the hard times that followed the fall of the Han dynasty Taoism obviously offered a very attractive
option for the intelligentsia in china it allowed them to pull back from what was a dangerous and
difficult situation and flow to some degree with the flow of events and it also of course was a
great opportunity for Buddhists to begin to express themselves naturally in the vocabulary of this
indigenous chinese tradition how did they do that well initially anyway in the very first
translations of Buddhism into chinese the word dharma was translated simply as the Tao
how do we express the dharma by the indirection of buddhist teaching the word nirvana was translated
how what would be your guess by the idea of wu wei or no action a kind of supple movement
through the world that leaves no trace so you can see how Taoist vocabulary offers great opportunities
for Buddhism but it also involves a subtle change in flavor and a change in the orientation of
buddhist values so what are some of the changes that took place in buddhism when it was expressed
in chinese terms well i think on the positive side first of all we can see that Taoists shared
with the Buddhists an ideal of sagehood and an ideal of wisdom this is what the Taoists were
seeking and this is what the Buddhists sought the sage also was detached from ordinary concerns of
the world and could flow through them in a way that didn't cause suffering or hardship the sage
also harmonized with the Tao by avoiding extremes and seeking a balanced way of life very similar
to the buddhist middle path but Taoism also transformed buddhism in a couple of very concrete
and important ways it made it much more pragmatic and down to earth as chinese civilization itself
was buddhism often was very abstract and rarefied in its indian form here it came down to earth
Taoism made buddhism more concerned with natural ways of living so that nature became an important
concept in chinese buddhism in a way that had never been true in india and finally it made
buddhism much more amenable to a possibility of sudden enlightenment not an experience that came
in a rarefied way at the end of a long sequence of practice but simply came in a wise acceptance
of the situation in which we are presently located so Taoism provided a great opportunity
for early buddhism for the early buddhists in china and also involved a subtle transformation
that will work its way out through the rest of chinese and east asian civilization
