1. **Robotics Advances**: Over the past two decades, significant advances have been made in robotics by simplifying robots and their control systems, moving away from complex, human-like intelligence towards more efficient, behavior-based approaches.

2. **Behavior-Based vs. Model-Based Robotics**: Behavior-based robotics (like the Roomba vacuum cleaner) operates on simple rules and reacts in real-time without a detailed understanding of its environment. Model-based robotics (like shaky), on the other hand, relies on a detailed model or simulation of the world to make decisions.

3. **Behavioral Autonomy**: This refers to robots that can operate independently with their own intelligence, using sensors and feedback systems to respond to their environment without human intervention. It's a form of closed-loop operation where the robot makes decisions based on its current state.

4. **Remote Control vs. Behavioral Autonomy**: In remote control, the intelligence is primarily in the human operator who directs the robot based on their own sensing and understanding of the environment. In contrast, behaviorally autonomous robots can make decisions on their own, reducing or eliminating the need for a human to be in the control loop.

5. **Combination Approaches**: Modern robots often use a combination of behavior-based and model-based approaches, leveraging the strengths of each to handle complex tasks.

6. **Examples**: The Roomba exemplifies behavior-based autonomy, while shaky demonstrates model-based autonomy. Sparky, in the demonstration, showcases mixed autonomy where the robot has some level of independence but can also be remotely controlled and has safeguards like a "safe driver" program to prevent self-harm.

7. **Implications for Society**: Robotics touches nearly every aspect of our lives and offers inspiration from everyday objects like remote controls or smartphones. It is an interdisciplinary field with vast potential for innovation and application across various domains.

8. **Potential for Inspiration**: The field of robotics can inspire solutions to complex problems by drawing on principles from other fields, including computer science, engineering, biology, and more.

9. **Autonomy in Robotics**: Autonomous robots have the potential to perform tasks without human oversight, which can lead to increased efficiency and new capabilities in industries ranging from manufacturing to healthcare.

1. **Kinematic Degrees of Freedom**: Robots have degrees of freedom that determine their range of motion. For humanoid robots like Baxter, this includes rotation around joints. For simpler robots like Tadro, it can include translation along a path (e.g., the tail's movement in and out).

2. **Trade-offs**: More degrees of freedom allow for greater mobility and versatility but come with increased complexity in design and control, as well as a higher demand for power and components. Designers must always consider these trade-offs when creating a robot.

3. **Components of Robots**: There are five main categories of parts that define how a robot functions:
   - **Actuators**: These are the mechanisms that provide motion, like motors or muscles.
   - **Sensors**: Sensors detect changes in the environment and feed information back to the controller.
   - **Energy Supply**: The power source for the robot, which can be batteries, solar panels, etc.
   - **Controller**: This is the brain of the robot that processes sensor data and decides on actions, often a microcontroller like an Arduino.
   - **Body**: The physical structure of the robot, including materials and design that facilitate movement and tasks.
   - **Support System**: This includes additional systems like communication modules and charging mechanisms.

4. **Synthesis through Building**: Understanding how robots work is greatly enhanced by actually building them. This hands-on experience highlights the trade-offs inherent in design choices and emphasizes the importance of considering all components when creating a robot.

5. **Tadro Example**: Tadro, a simple robot designed to navigate on land with a tail that responds to light, illustrates these principles. Building Tadro from scratch shows how each part interacts and influences the others, and how design decisions affect the robot's capabilities and limitations.

6. **Lessons Learned**: The process of designing and building robots teaches us that:
   - Robot bodies are a manifestation of the need for movement and dictate the robot's form and function.
   - There is no perfect solution; designers must weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each design decision.
   - The interplay between components (actuators, sensors, energy supply, controller, body, support system) drives the robot's functionality and capabilities.
   - Understanding how robots work requires a holistic view that considers all aspects of design and function.

1. **Intelligence and Movement**: A robot demonstrates intelligence by moving itself or objects in response to sensor readings. Sparky's reaction to a hand blocking its path is an example of intelligent behavior.

2. **Active vs. Passive Sensors**: Active sensors (like IR proximity sensors) send out signals and receive their echoes, allowing for two-way communication with the environment. Passive sensors (like cameras) only receive signals from the environment without sending anything out.

3. **Weather Buoy Example**: A weather buoy isn't considered intelligent as it doesn't actively interact with its surroundings; it merely records environmental data and transmits it.

4. **Remote Control Units**: Similar to how a ticometer works, a remote control device sends out a signal that is received by the target device (e.g., Roomba robots).

5. **Underwater Robot Communication**: Projects like Kokoro use blue lights for underwater communication where robotsw can signal each other's presence and form a communication chain or 'bucket brigade'. This allows them to learn about local situations by observing and communicating with each other using light patterns.

6. **Sensors in Robots**: Sensors are devices that register events in the world and convert them into signals for processing by the robot. These signals can be used to inform the robot's actions or decisions, indicating the robot's level of awareness and its ability to respond intelligently to its environment.

7. **Human-Sensor Interaction**: When humans are part of the sensor loop, it becomes a communication system between humans and robots, enhancing the robot's capabilities and the ways in which it can interact with its surroundings and respond to stimuli.

1. **Behavior-based Robotics**: In behavior-based robotics, the control system operates on simple programs that react to sensor inputs in real-time. This approach, pioneered by Rodney Brooks, uses a winner-take-all approach where only one behavior module controls the actuators at any given time. There is no sharing of actuators; the robot either performs the dominant behavior or remains idle.

2. **Roomba as an Example**: Roomba, a well-known robotic vacuum cleaner, demonstrates behavior-based control systems effectively. It uses sensors like bump detectors and cliff sensors to navigate its environment and has a behavior for returning to its charging station when necessary. The escape behavior (avoiding obstacles) takes precedence over the cleaning behavior unless the docking behavior is activated.

3. **Negative Feedback Control**: The concept of negative feedback control is crucial in self-regulating systems, including robots. It involves comparing the current state with a desired goal and making adjustments to minimize the difference between the two. This principle is fundamental in cybernetics and control theory.

4. **Baxter Robot**: Baxter is a research robot designed by Rethink Robotics that uses negative feedback control to handle tasks like picking up and placing cups. Even when faced with unexpected changes (like moving cups), Baxter can adjust its actions through search patterns and sensor feedback to achieve its goals.

5. **Controller in Robotics**: The controller in a robot is the hardware and software that allows the robot to have autonomy. It processes sensor data, executes commands to actuators, and can be programmed with various control architectures, ranging from purely behavior-based to highly sophisticated model-based systems that plan ahead.

6. **Hybrid Control Architecture**: Many robots benefit from a hybrid control architecture that combines immediate, reactive behaviors (behavior-based) with long-term planning and goal setting (model-based). This allows for robust autonomy in complex environments.

7. **Human Interaction**: The degree of autonomy a robot has can be adjusted based on the needs of a given situation or the preferences of the operator. Controllers can be designed to allow for remote human control or to increase a robot's independence.

8. **Design and Operation**: The controller is where a robot's autonomy is defined, linking up sensors and actuators. It can be the point where human intervention overrides or augments the robot's capabilities.

In summary, robotic autonomy is achieved through sophisticated controllers that manage behavior-based and model-based processes, allowing for real-time responses to environmental stimuli as well as long-term planning and goal setting. The balance between these two types of control depends on the specific requirements of the robot and its operational context.

2. **Historical Context**: Shaky's work came at a time when there was significant optimism about the progress of AI, with Marvin Minsky predictively suggesting that we might have machines with human-level intelligence within three to eight years. This period also saw other milestones in AI, such as IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov and Watson winning at Jeopardy.

3. **The Moravec Paradox**: The easy problems of AI, like complex calculations or beating humans at games, were solved relatively quickly, while the seemingly simple tasks for robots, like moving around autonomously in real-world environments, remain challenging. This paradox highlights the differences between what is intellectually easy for a human and what is technically difficult for machines.

4. **World Model Limitations**: Shaky operated in an environment with objects that were all specially shaped, painted, and had known properties. This limited the complexity of the world model required for its operations. However, this approach is less feasible in uncontrolled environments where objects are diverse and unexpected.

5. **Modern Developments**: Advances since Shaky's time include the use of real-time operating systems like VXWorks across various robotic systems, including industrial robots and Mars rovers. These systems have improved upon Shaky's capabilities in terms of autonomous operation and adaptability to new environments.

2. **If-Then-Else Structure**: The core logic used in behavior based robotics is the if-then-else construct. This structure enables the robot to make decisions based on sensor inputs and perform different actions accordingly.

3. **Example Behavior (BotBallBot)**:
   - **Escape**: If the front bumper sensors detect an obstacle, the robot will execute the escape behavior.
   - **Seek Light**: If the front bumper is not triggered, the robot will then look for light sources using photoresistors. This is a secondary behavior that takes effect if the primary behavior (escape) is not needed.

4. **Fixed Priority Architecture**: The behaviors are prioritized, and the highest priority behavior that is triggered will take control of the robot's actions at that moment.

5. **Positives of Behavior Based Robotics**:
   - **Reactivity**: The system can respond quickly to changes in its environment because it doesn't need to plan ahead.
   - **Simplicity**: The software is less complex, making the overall system more likely to work reliably.

When faced with these limitations, co-bots request assistance from humans.

2. **Symbiotic Autonomy**: Co-bots demonstrate 'symbiotic autonomy' by understanding their functional limitations and proactively asking for help when needed. They can ask for aid in three areas: actuation (what they cannot do physically), cognition (what they do not know or understand), and perception (what they cannot find or sense).

3. **Human-Robot Cooperation**: The effectiveness of human-robot cooperation is enhanced by robots' ability to engage socially and emotionally with humans, using multimodal communication channels that include vision, hearing, touch, facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations.

4. **Social Communication Enhancement**: The goal in social robotics is to improve the robots' engagement with humans by refining their ability to communicate socially and emotionally through continuous feedback loops.

5. **Concerns and Challenges**: As robots become more engaging, there is a concern that they might replace human interactions, leading to increased social isolation as people favor robot companionship over human connections. However, the development of social robots also offers an opportunity to understand human psychology better and potentially use robots to enhance human interactions rather than replace them.

6. **Emotional Sharing**: The future of robots in human society involves not just performing tasks but also sharing emotions and learning from each other, which could help bridge the gap between individuals who might otherwise feel isolated due to technological advancements.
