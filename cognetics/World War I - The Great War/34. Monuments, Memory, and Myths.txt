Lecture 34 Monuments, Memory, and Myths
In our previous lecture we had discussed the aftershocks of the war, the series of armed
conflicts that continued even after the Great War had ended. In this lecture we'll consider
another very difficult and wrenching issue, the echoes of the war that grew out of the debates
and the meditations of people after the Great War about how it should be remembered or memorialized.
We'll be examining monuments, memory, and myths created out of the experience of the war.
This lecture will follow the ways in which grieving contemporaries grappled with the
challenge of somehow giving adequate symbolic expression to a tragic event of the enormous
magnitude of the Great War, to express their suffering, their grief, their sense of what
it all had been for if the war had had any purpose at all. And indeed, vigorous and very painful
debates would take place in all of the societies that had experienced the Great War,
surrounding the question of adequate memorials or monuments to the millions of the fallen,
as well as to the efforts of the nation as a whole. But there were key questions here that needed to
be confronted. What was to be memorialized about the war? What, if anything, deserved to be
celebrated from that conflict? What precisely were the lessons of the ordeal that it had
represented? What role should veterans play in this post-war world as they returned from the
trenches to what now many hoped would be normalcy at last? In this lecture, we'll analyze the
monuments of Verdun and other battlefields, the ritual that was developed or invented at this
time of the unknown soldier, the formation of veterans organizations, and also the dangerous
growing power of resentful conclusions in nations that were unreconciled to how the war had ended.
We'll look at the stab in the back legend as it grew in force in defeated Germany. We'll examine
the notions of the mutilated victory in an Italy which had belonged to the side of the victors,
but felt itself to have lost the war in a sense. First, let's turn to examine the dilemmas of
remembrance of how to try to seek to enshrine the war in collective memory. Attempts to deal with the
many social and economic repercussions of the war once the war had ended were inevitably accompanied
by the problem of how to remember that war and how to conclude its meaning and its ultimate
significance for the society. Even the act of physical reconstruction, say the rebuilding of
shattered villages in East Prussia in Germany or in northern France or in Belgium, even that
rebuilding itself posed the question of what sort of future should now be growing out of the realities
that the war had helped create. In certain destroyed areas of the western front in particular,
for instance around the titanic battlefield of Verdun, some villages were actually never rebuilt.
The landscape itself had been poisoned and scarred. The landscape was pitted with shell craters
and farmers who returned to the earlier lands that they had cultivated, discovered that they were
full of dangerous unexploded shells, and it's really a testimony to the the determination
and the sense of rootedness of some of these farmers that in spite of these dangers,
they nonetheless carefully moved shells off their land and sought to cultivate even these blasted
and devastated areas. Another key question which very vividly encapsulated this problem of memorialization
was that of what monuments might be set up to this war. There was for many people a sense that human
traditions of of older monuments and the iconography was perhaps not even adequate to the
task of remembering the war, and some latched on to a particular it seemed natural symbol
that was present in the battlefields themselves as maybe capable of expressing something of the
the tragic scale of the conflict. And these are flowers that are still associated with the
First World War today and its memory of their poppies, the poppies of Flanders fields with their
blood red color. It's sometimes pointed out that Americans who are familiar with California poppies
that are often orange or yellow don't can't fully appreciate the the tremendous symbolic
significance of the blood red of European northern European poppies, but nonetheless even these red
poppies in in America today for instance are a symbol of Veterans Day celebrated on November 11th
when the armistice had been signed as well. But beyond the enshrining of a natural symbol like
the poppy growing over these bloodied grounds and representing the soldiers in some sense
returning to nature, at the same time vigorous debates were also continuing about what messages
to include in the monuments that were built, the memorials that were set up. And indeed
many smaller monuments were set up throughout all of those many localities, some close to the
fronts, some very distant from the fronts which the war had touched. Some of these smaller monuments
can still be seen today though they're often in forgotten or obscure locations of cities within
western civilization or towns. So from a city like Knoxville, Tennessee, all the way to small
French villages the statue of the soldier is a universal site was an attempt to keep present
in memory of these smaller localities the enormity of this worldwide conflict. In workplaces, in
factories or in schools and universities tablets were often set up in which the names of the fallen
who had some personal tie to the workplaces of the universities were drawn up in order to keep
their names alive as well. And it became a tradition especially in France in the smaller
towns that names of the fallen would be read off one after another often by the children of these
localities once again on November 11th on Armistice Day to memorialize their sacrifice
and after each name was read off it would be followed by an incantation dead for France.
In the United States a movement which set itself off from other European traditions of
memorialization and whose artifacts are still with us today urged the creation of useful monuments
as they were called at the time which wouldn't simply be a celebration of the martial valor
of the soldiers who had fought that was to be recognized as well but which would also serve
some larger social purpose the building of a better society. So auditoriums or stadiums or
community centers were sometimes soon as the most suitable form for memorializing the war and many
of them are still present in American cities. A fascinating ritual that grew out of the war
experience and in some sense was invented as a way of meeting this challenge of how to memorialize
the sacrifices of of so many millions was the ritual surrounding the tomb of the unknown soldier.
This invented ritual began with Armistice Day of 1920 so already at the remove of
two years from the conflict itself the notion of entombing an unknown body a soldier whose
body couldn't be recognized identified and returned to a particular family but nonetheless
somehow expressed all of the nameless sacrifices of the war was elaborated was invented and this
invented ritual carried obviously a very strong democratic message. The person to be memorialized
was perhaps of an officer's rank probably more likely of the rank of an ordinary soldier the
person who was to be memorialized was not of any particular family or region from the nation
but could be from anywhere and in that sense what was being celebrated was the triumph of a
certain democratic impulse and the spirit of sacrifice. In France in particular this ritual
was crafted with massively elaborate symbolic significance. In France an unidentified body
was selected from each of the nine major war zones that had represented the front lines on the
western front and these bodies were ceremonially brought to Verdun which stood in for the tremendous
clashes of the war itself. The bodies then were set up in caskets within the crypts of the fortress
of Verdun that the Germans hadn't taken and there a wounded sergeant who had fought in the war
was brought forward at random through intuition through his own choice to designate one of those
bodies as the embodiment of the unknown French soldier. The body was then ceremonially in a
procession the one that had been chosen was taken from Verdun to Paris and there in Paris it lay in
state vigils and symbolic processions were organized around the casket of the unknown soldier and then
in a procession which was led by disabled soldiers of the first world war who also had sacrificed
in this cause as well as a symbolic family that's to say a group of people who had been
gathered at random to stand in for the family of this unknown soldier who themselves had lost
family members were part of this larger ritual and the body then was as a result of this long
ceremonially laden nationally significant procession brought to a key site of French nationalism the
Arc de Triomphe in Paris itself and the body was laid to rest where it remains today with an eternal
flame flickering nearby to mark the sacrifice. A different ritual was crafted in Britain around
the same concept of the unknown soldier. The unknown soldier that the British had chosen
was buried in Westminster Abbey which represented really a pantheon of British notables of great
creators of culture and of political leaders and this too was surrounded by ritual. The one detail
that really to me I think is very resonant was that included in the burial itself of this unknown
soldier was a crusader sword that was added to these remains and the very notion that there was
some linkage between the holy wars of the middle ages and this crusade for civilization or crusade
for the survival of the Allied side was very vividly represented here. One year later borrowing
this set of images in 1921 the United States also followed suit with a burial of an unknown
American soldier in Arlington National Cemetery and this remains a very important touchstone I think
of the American memory of war. At the same time the battlefields themselves took on the quality of
sacred ground and precisely because of its epic stature the battlefields of Verdun, this disastrous
battle of attrition in 1916 took on enormous significance for the French in particular
and a certain myth came to surround the entire experience of the battlefield itself.
In 1919 a trench was discovered near Fort Duomo in Verdun and what made this trench special was that
as those who were surveying the ground looked more closely at the trench they saw an entire row
of bayonets sticking straight up out of the ground. When they dug underneath these bayonets they
discovered the bodies of French soldiers and soon an entire legend grew up around this experience
around this discovery. The legend suggested that here French soldiers under the storm of steel and
the enormous shelling and perhaps even the gas attacks that the Germans were mounting against
Verdun French troops had stood to the last even as they were perhaps buried alive in their defense
of Verdun. A monument that can still be visited today was erected to the bayonet trench as it
came to be called and can still be seen today and even though doubts were raised at the time
and historians today are more prone to believe that in fact French troops that have been killed
there were buried and bayonets stuck in perhaps by German forces to mark where these soldiers
had been laid to rest nonetheless very clearly the story had captured the public imagination.
Also at Verdun an enormous monument was built with tremendous symbolic charge to commemorate
the battle and the slaughter that had taken place there. This monument was known as the
ossuary which means a collection of remains. The ossuary still to be seen today was built
with donations that flooded in from around the world to house the remains that were constantly
being gathered in from the battlefields of Verdun and still are being discovered today.
It's an uncanny site. The ossuary itself when you walk in has crypt-like interior and there are
noted the names of the fallen who are not recognized but are known to have fallen at the
battle of Verdun and underneath all of this are chambers in which bones upon bones and skulls upon
skulls have been gathered. It's estimated that the remains of some 130,000 soldiers have been
gathered German and French alike into this ossuary and are still being gathered from the
battlefields to this very day. In Germany representing the central powers German war graves by
contrast took on a very different emphasis and significance. Most of the war had been fought
beyond Germany's borders and that's where many German war cemeteries remained. The German answer to
memorializing some of this sacrifice was a particular institution called Totenburgen.
These were so-called castles of the dead where in the form of a medieval castle representing in
some extended sense the Burgfrieden or the domestic truce that allegedly had united all Germans back
in 1914 so to here these medieval castle-like forms were intended to memorialize the larger
cemeteries in which they were located and in particular one huge such monument was built
at Tannenberg in East Prussia to memorialize the fallen of that enormous battle the greatest
victory of the First World War against oncoming Russian forces in 1914. The Germans there too
buried 20 unknown soldiers and the castle-like structure of Tannenberg where the Nazis later
buried Hindenburg the hero of the First World War after he had died became a nationalist site of
pilgrimage and there rather than having celebrations that memorialize the sacrifices of the dead
and kept their memory alive there was another added message to the nationalist celebrations
that took place there a condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles and a condemnation of the present
German democratic government. This was to have ominous significance in the unstable German experiment
with democracy. Tours were also organized to the battlefields and indeed some of these tours
still exist today and can be taken by visitors to these sites in order to allow visitors and very
poignantly family members of those who had died there to see the reality as it still remained
of the conflict visitors who traveled to these areas could and can still observe the surreal
site of destroyed landscapes but at the same time there was a certain pathos as those destroyed
landscapes with time started to revert to nature and nature itself began to efface the war wounds
that had been carved on the land itself a process that's still going on. American mothers were
taken on tours that were called gold star mother tours if they had had a son lost in the conflict
their trips to see the battlefields in northern France and Belgium were organized as well
because the US government had urged that fallen soldiers bodies remain in France as a vivid symbol
of their memory there's an especially heart wrenching an ugly detail to to note about these
gold star mother tours from the United States tragically the tours of bereaved mothers were
racially segregated as the mothers of African American soldiers were shunted off into separate
tours as American society was racially divided so too was memory memory was an enormously
conflicted and tortured phenomenon the personal memory counted most of all countless survivors
of the war bore unspeakable memories afterwards which they might be able to talk about or perhaps
not and throughout society as a whole for those who had lived through it whether they had fought
on the battlefield or had been civilians affected by it the great war as it was called by contemporaries
was a generational reference point and a watershed a clear before and after in their existence and the
existence of their society and to my grandparents generation for instance one spoke simply of
the war and even people who later experienced the second world war the war still represented
a watershed in their personal experience and lives family lives were affected by the traumas
of war in a multitude of ways and divorce rates climbed immediately after the conflict itself
as probably a testimony to the tensions and the the personal ordeal of the conflict and
dealing with it afterwards it's simply impossible to even offer a quantification or an estimate
of how many participants in the war remain psychologically scarred afterwards estimates
do suggest simply statistically that probably every family in europe had lost a relative or a friend
and then too as vivid and visible reminders of the sacrifices the war were the disabled the war
left main soldiers with shattered lives and shattered bodies some quarter of a million
british soldiers for instance had limbs totally or partially amputated and in such cases there
would be no return to a normal normal existence a normality for years and decades afterwards war
invalids were readily visible in europe as part of the social landscape and as a reminder and these
generations of the first world war and the second world war passing from the scene and something
changes in that regard soldiers who had shattered faces or mutilated visages sometimes preferred
to live their lives out in secluded hospitals out of sight but there were tragic cases of soldiers
whose own children were horrified by their changed appearance despairing and committing suicide
such veterans whether were wounded or not set about organizing some sense of solidarity and
unity out of their shared experience in veterans organizations in most countries veterans organizations
formed to encourage recognition of soldiers sacrifices to recall their ordeal and also to
advance their interpretation as the men who had fought in the battles of the larger meaning of the
war itself a key example was the american legion which was formed in 1919 in paris in the immediate
aftermath of the war which promoted armistice day in the united states as a national holiday
november 11th in germany by contrast the picture also took on some worrying uh political polarization
in germany the stahlhelm organization that literally means the steel helmet uh the the
embodiment of the the participation of soldiers in this anonymous form of of material and total war
the stahlhelm organization sympathized with nationalist and right-wing politics
and often was unenthusiastic about the german democracy at the same time other veterans who
didn't share this political orientation organized themselves into other organizations there were
communist veterans organizations social democratic ones and german jewish veterans organizations
that were also active creatively in art and literature artists felt that they had to grapple
with the meaning of the war some came to feel that only the fragmented perspective the disjointed
nature of modernist art could convey the experience of the war most realistically and what it had
shown about human nature and the real human condition the german painters autodix and
georg gross for instance unflinchingly drew on their own experience as soldiers to depict the war
as it had existed and its post-war human toll they returned repeatedly to one figure that for them
was a central image of the war's aftermath the figure of the mutilated veteran begging in the
street this could be a soldier on crutches or on a little cart if his legs have been torn away
who often is not might very well be bearing the medals or the decorations of a grateful fatherland
that in this respect was no longer providing for him war poems that emerged during the war itself
as well as afterwards were various in their understandings of what the war meant they could
range from patriotic messages of involvement such as those of rupert brook who was killed at the
start of the war and the poems took on a special tragic significance all the way to absolute disillusionment
and fury at the senselessness of the bloodletting of the war the poems of secret sesson of robert
graves or of wilfred owen whose work also in his rejection of the war took on a special
significance and tragic magnitude when one keeps in mind that he was killed in the very last days
of the war just before the armistice itself though he had not been a soldier himself the great poet
t.s. elliot wrote in the wasteland essentially a manifesto of a civilization that he felt was
shattered and he tried to as it were gather together fragments from what earlier had been
a civilization and placed them next to one another in this disjointed and often mysterious poem
that tried to capture some chance of reconstructing european civilization fascinatingly enough war
literature itself came in waves it took about 10 years for the writers who were summing up their
experience of the war to fully ripen their vision and to write out their experience and so 10 years
roughly after the war in 1929 both eric maria remarks passionate work all quiet on the western front
as well as robert graves goodbye to all that as well as a wave of an entire flood of further
memoirs and novels were unleashed in almost a cathartic way by such works a fascinating debate
is still raging among historians about the true nature of the cultural impact of the war and this
debate essentially is about whether the war was a decisive break whether it represented a watershed
in the culture of western civilization or whether instead continuities are more important now we've
mentioned several times in earlier lectures the provocative thesis of the literary historian paul
fuzzle who argues that even the language itself was changed by the shattering experience of the
world of the trenches that words like honor or duty could never again be spoken in the way that they
were before 1914 that they would never lose an ironic tinge that they had acquired for a disillusioned
lost generation this thesis is in fact disputed by other historians and in particular the historian
j winter maintains by contrast in an equally provocative thesis that despite all of those
novelties of modernism in high culture and high art continuities and tradition remained important
to ordinary people contradicting the idea of a real gulf in culture and an experience he argues
that older forms older rituals older language was still used to describe and try to deal with
the experience of the first world war in fact the horrors of the second world war he argues would
be the real break when experience no longer could be matched in language the thought the
intellectual history of western civilization was clearly affected by the experience of the war
for psychologist sigmond Freud in what remained of the austral hungarian empire the war had revealed
a destructive death drive that was a part of human nature along with the erotic drive in politics
the revelation of what total war was like had to somehow be analyzed and understood once total
war had been practiced it couldn't be unthought or unknown for many the revelation of the full
horrors of total war meant that war had to be abolished forever and much of the enthusiasm for
the collective security ideas of the league of nations that the bersai treaty had tried to enshrine
drew its fervor from this rejection of war a common slogan of the time unfortunately not
realized was never again war as the principal lesson of the great war for others for aggressive
minorities the model of total mobilization on the contrary was attractive and they endorsed a
militarized politics for the future let's turn to examine a fascinating topic of the myths that grew
out of the war one of these myths was the occult myth of the return of the dead and this could be
enshrined in in in films or in literature as a a literal coming back from the dead the resurrected
of the dead of the conflict itself a theme that turns up often in literature and art of the post
war period but it could also have a sense not of a literal resurrection but the voices of those who
had died speaking to the present a wave of fascination arose for the occult for so-called
spirit photography which tried to to see another reality behind the grieving reality of the present
and seances and other aspects of the paranormal now much of this was motivated out of a sincere
and wrenching desire to establish communication with those whom one grieved for but there were
certainly many charlatans taking advantage of this societal grief to many the paranormal seem to
offer a way of coping with unbearable losses hoping for some connection to those who had fallen
another myth that grew out of the war experience which was to have enormous poisonous significance
was the stab in the back legend in germany called the dolstos legende in germany in germany a myth
that already had been circulating during the war itself uh took on vast new significance and that
was the notion that the german armies had never been defeated on the battlefield on the contrary
germany had lost the war because the army had been stabbed in the back from behind
by treacherous elements on the home front this notion of german troops not having lost the war
in fact contradicted the experience of german soldiers who had on the battlefield seen for
themselves the massive disproportion of the materiel the industrial might that the allies
could bring to bear and some historians have intuited that it may very well be shame over the
phenomenon of desertion in the last stages of the war itself that led some german veterans to as
it were shut out of their minds what they had known back in 1918 about really losing the war
in order to argue instead that well they were innocent precisely because someone else was guilty
public hearings on why germany had collapsed gave sort of a ratification to this myth of the
wars uh ending as a result of a stab in the back and general hindenburg himself who had much to do
with the uh fateful end of the war and defeat had himself underline and and subscribe to this myth
itself it would be taken up by the young nazi party and used to propaganda effect moreover
throughout europe disappointed territorial demands or the feeling that lost territories still belong
to an incomplete nation became the focus of nationalist agitation under the name of irredenta
it's an italian term for unredeemed territories there was a bitter significance to all of this
because the first world war to a some extent had started over irredenta of one or a nationalist group
one or another nationalist group in the balkans now the world war had ended with more territorial
demands a key example of this came in 1919 when the italian romantic poet denuncio
led a raid to capture the contested port of trieste in protest at the outcome of the war
and his gesture was much admired and provoked emulation in the future as dictators would
seek to engage in just such bold moves in politics finally there was the myth of the new man in many
countries the myth of the new man argued that out of the storms of steel of industrial war a new
model of heroism had been forged and an ethos of toughness and a model for social unity advocates
of militarized politics some of them former veterans propose what they called a trenchocracy
with a special leading role for veterans of the war this was a lesson that would be taken up by
growing dictatorships from this militarized politics and these myths we then turn to the
topic of the rise of mass dictatorships to be considered in our next lecture
