The lecture is Arthur T. Benjamin, Professor of Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College.
He received his BS in Applied Mathematics with honors from Carnegie Mellon University in 1983,
and his PhD in Mathematical Sciences from Johns Hopkins University in 1989.
Professor Benjamin's research interests include combinatorics, game theory, and number theory
with a special fondness for Fibonacci numbers.
Many of these ideas appear in his co-authored book, Proofs That Really Count, The Art of Combinatorial Proof,
which received the Beckenbach Book Prize in 2006 from the Mathematical Association of America.
He has served as co-editor of Math Horizons Magazine and is co-editor of the 2009 book, Biscuits of Number Theory.
Professor Benjamin is also a professional magician who has given more than 1,000 mathematics shows to audiences around the world.
His techniques are explained in his book, Secrets of Mental Math,
The Mathemagician's Guide to Lightning Calculation and Amazing Math Tricks.
He has appeared on The Today Show, CNN, The Colbert Report, and National Public Radio,
and has been featured in Scientific American, Omni, Discover, People, Esquire, The New York Times, and The Los Angeles Times.
In 1999, Professor Benjamin received the Southern California Section of the Mathematical Association of America Award
for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics,
and in 2000, he received the M.A.A. Deborah and Franklin Tepper-Hymoh National Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics.
He was also named the George Polia Lecture by the M.A.A. for 2006 to 2008.
The course guidebook that comes with these lectures includes a timeline, a glossary, a bibliography, and supplementary problems with solutions to accompany each lecture.
To get the most out of this course, you may find it useful to review these materials before or after each lecture.
