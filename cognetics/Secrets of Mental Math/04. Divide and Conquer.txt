Here, let's move on from multiplication to division.
Give us a three-digit number divided by a one-digit number, five.
That should be 73.8.
Let's try a four-digit number divided by a one-digit number here, 3,981 divided by
five. Oh, we just did five. That's 796.2. Here, let's do a give us a another four-digit number.
7,856 divided by a different one-digit number, not five this time. Seven. Okay, that is gonna be
1,122.285714. Good. All right.
In this lecture, we explore the last fundamental operation of arithmetic, namely division. Just like with mental addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we'll do mental division.
From left to right. Since you were probably taught to do division on paper from left to right, as far as I know, there's no other way to do division, you will find our basic
technique to be similar, but not quite the same as what you already know. But I promise to show
you some nice surprises for doing division problems, converting fractions to decimals,
and determining if one number is divisible by another. In most applications, we're dividing
by one-digit numbers, so we'll concentrate on those, although I will give you some shortcuts
for two-digit divisors. In a later lecture, I'll show you a very interesting way to do
two-digit division. Before we do actual division problems, let's ask a more fundamental question.
When does one number divide evenly into another? Once we've mastered this skill, we'll see
how it can be applied to simplifying many types of division problems. Here are some
of the tricks that I use. Sometimes you can tell just by looking at the last digit. For
example, a number is divisible by 2 if and only if it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. It's
divisible by 5 if and only if the number ends in 0 or 5, and a number is divisible by 10
if and only if it ends in 0. These are based on the fact that we work in base 10, and 10
is divisible by 2 and 5. Likewise, since 100 is divisible by 4, a number is divisible by
4 if and only if its last two digits create a multiple of 4. For example, 271828. Is that
a multiple of 4? Well, you only have to focus on the last two digits, 28. Is 28 a multiple
of 4? Yes, so, therefore, your original number was a multiple of 4 as well. How about 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6? Is that a multiple of 4? You just listened for the number 5, 6, and since
5, 6 is a multiple of 4, it's 4 times 14, so is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, you can tell
why does this work? Well, to take the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as an example, that's equal
to 123,400 plus 56. And since every multiple of 100 is divisible by 4, and 56 is divisible
by 4, then so is their sum. By the same logic, a number is divisible by 8 if and only if
its last three digits create a multiple of 8. Is 123456 a multiple of 8? Well, it depends
on whether or not 456 is a multiple of 8. And since 456 is a multiple of 8, it's 8 times
57, then so is the original number. How about 31415926? Is that a multiple of 8? Well,
it depends on whether or not 926 is a multiple of 8. But hang on a second. Notice that 926
is not a multiple of 4. I can tell that just by looking at the 26, right? That's not a
multiple of 4, so 926 isn't a multiple of 4, so it can't be a multiple of 8, and therefore
the original number is not a multiple of 8. Likewise, 12345 is not a multiple of 8 since
it's not even even. Okay, how about multiples of 3?
Magically, a number is divisible by 3 if and only if its digits sum to a multiple of
3. For example, 1234 sums to 10, which is not a multiple of 3, so 1234 is not a multiple
of 3. But the digits of 12345 add to 15, and that is a multiple of 3, so 12345 is a multiple
of 3. The number 9 has the same property. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if
the digits add up to a multiple of 9. So, 12345 adds up to 15, which is not a multiple
of 9, so therefore, 12345 is not a multiple of 9. But 2358, those digits sum to 18, and
that is a multiple of 9, and therefore, so is the number 2358.
Now, the reason these rules work is based on the fact that 9 is one less than 9, and
it's less than our base, base 10. You only need to know about base 10, but if we were
working, for example, in base 16, which some computer programmers use, then the same digits
sum properties that we saw for 9 would instead work for 15, and its divisors 3 and 5.
Funny things happen when we are one more than our base. In base 10, a number is divisible
by 11 if and only if. When you alternately subtract and add the digits, you get zero
or a multiple of 11. That's a little redundant because zero is a multiple of 11. So, for
example, 843689, is that a multiple of 11? We calculate 8 minus 4 plus 3 minus 6 plus
8 minus 9, which happens to be zero, and therefore, the number is a multiple of 11.
On the other hand, a number like 54321 is not a multiple of 11 because 5 minus 4 plus
3 minus 2 plus 1 is 3, and that's not a multiple of 11.
So far, we've discovered divisibility rules for 23458910 and 11. We're missing 6, 7,
12, and higher. Now, 6 and 12 are easy. A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible
by 2 and 3, and a number is divisible by 12 if and only if it's divisible by 3 and 4.
So the only small number left to look at is 7, which is more complicated. One way to
check divisibility by 7 is like this. Take off the last digit, double it, then subtract
from the rest of the number. That's a lot. Let's look at that slowly. If I have a number
like 112, we're going to take off the last digit, we're going to take off the 2, double
it to 4, and subtract it from the rest of the number. 11 minus 4 is 7. The original
number is a multiple of 7 if and only if the new number is a multiple of 7. Since 112
reduced us to the number 7, then 112 is a multiple of 7. Here, let's test a new number.
Let's try 2345. We remove the last digit, which is 5, double it, which is 10, 234 minus
10 is 224. So our new number is 224. Is that a multiple of 7? I don't know. Let's do it
again. We've got 224. We'll take off the 4, double it to become 8. 22 minus 8 is 14,
and that's a multiple of 7. So the original number, 2345, was also a multiple of 7.
Here's a question. Can your birthday ever be on the same day two years in a row? What
does this have to do with 7s? Well, the number of days between your birthday is 365 or 366,
so it can only be on the same day if either of those numbers is a multiple of 7. So is
365 a multiple of 7? Well, we'll take 36, subtract, double 5, 10. 36 minus 10 is 26. Nope, that's
not a multiple of 7. How about 366? We take 366, take off that 6, double it to get 12.
36 minus 12 is 24. Nope, that's not a multiple of 7 either. Therefore, your birthday changes
each year. Now, I won't go into the reason of why this special rule works here. It uses
the mathematics of modular arithmetic, but it's an easy rule to forget. So instead, I
like to use a rule that's almost as simple, easier to remember, and can be used for numbers
besides 7. The rule I call is create a zero, then kill the zero. Here, we add or subtract
a multiple of 7 so that you get a number that ends in zero, then you ignore the zero, and
the original number will be a multiple of 7 if and only if the new number is a multiple
of 7. I definitely need an example or two here. Let's test the number 1234. 1234. Now,
how do I create a zero? I need to add or subtract a multiple of 7. Well, 14 is a multiple of
7. If I subtract 14 from 1234, I get the number 1220, 1220. I've now created a zero at the
end. We kill the zero at the end, leaving us with 122. Now, is that a multiple of 7?
Well, you might not know, so let's create a zero. Let's add 28 to that, because 28's
a multiple of 7. 122 plus 28 is 150. You created a zero, now kill the zero to get 15. Is that
a multiple of 7? No. Therefore, the original number is not a multiple of 7. The nice thing
about the create a zero, kill a zero rule is that it can be used for any odd numbers
that are not multiples of 5. For example, let's see if the number 2001 is a multiple
of 23. So, I have to add or subtract a multiple of 23 to the number 2000. So, I have to add
2001 to create a zero. Let's see, if I want to add something that ends in 9, 23 times
3 is 69. 2001 plus 69 is 2070. We created a zero, we now killed a zero. By the way,
you can only kill zeroes at the end. I can't kill that zero in the middle of 207. I'm
looking now at 207. Let's create another zero by adding 23. 207 plus 23 is 207. So,
230 killed a zero to get 23. Yes, 2001 is a multiple of 23. In fact, it's 23 times 87.
But how would you actually do the division of 23 into 2001? I'll show you how to do
a problem like that soon. But let's first look at one-digit division. When I was a kid,
I remember doing lots of one-digit division problems on a bowling league. If I had a
score of 45 after three frames, I would divide 45 by 3 to get 15 and would think, at this
rate, I'm on pace to get a score of 150. Alright, let's consider the problem 79 divided
by 3. On paper, you might say 3 goes into 7 twice, subtracts 6, then bring down the
9, and so on. But I do it slightly differently. Instead of subtracting 6 from 7, I think
of subtracting 60 from 79. Mentally, it looks like this. It's a small change, but an important
one. I think, okay, 3 goes into 79 20 times. 3 times 20 is 60. And at this point, I can
say the 20. I can say part of my answer. Okay, so I've said the 20. Now, where were
we? 79. 3 times 20 is 60. 79 minus 60 is 19. I now have a simpler problem. How many times
does 3 go into 19? 3 goes into 19 six times with a remainder of 1. So there's my answer
26 with a remainder of 1, or if you prefer, 26 and 1 third. Let's apply this technique
to the problem of converting 76 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius temperature. To convert from Fahrenheit
to Celsius, you subtract 32, then multiply by 5 ninths. With 76 degrees, we subtract 32
to get 44, multiply it by 5 to get 220, and then divide by 9. So our problem is 220 divided
by 9. Now, 9 goes into 22 twice. So 9 goes into 220 20 times. So I can go ahead and say
the 20. Next, I do 9 times 20, which is 180. Subtract that from the 20. Now, I'm going
to get 220 to get 40. Okay, now I have a simpler division problem. I'm dividing 9 into 40.
9 goes into 40 four times with a remainder of 4. So I can say the rest of my answer, 24
and 4 ninths, about 24 and a half degrees Celsius. Now, let's try dividing a 3 or 4
digit number by a 1 digit number. Suppose you just want a jackpot of $777. That's the
good news. The bad news is, it has to be split 4 ways. Let's do that problem in our head.
4 into 777. Well, 4 times 100 is 400. 4 times 200 is 800. That's too big. So go ahead and
say the 100. 4 times 100 is 400. Subtract that from 777. So now you have a problem.
377 divided by 4. Now, let's see. 4 times 9 is 36. So 4 times 90 is 360. Okay, I can
go and say the 90. I've now said 90. 377 minus 360 is 17. You have an even simpler division
problem. Do 4 into 17. That goes into it 4 times with a remainder of 1. And there's your
answer, 194 with a remainder of 1 or $194.25 is your share of the jackpot.
Let's do the problem 1234 divided by 5. Now, there are two ways we can do this problem.
By the method we just learned, we can go through our process and get 246 and 4 fifths. But
I want to show you an even easier way to do this. If we double both numbers in a division
problem, the answer will stay the same. So here we have a problem 1234 divided by 5.
That's the same as 2468 divided by 10. And dividing by 10 is real easy. That's 246.8.
And that agrees with our previous answer. Alright, now let's do some two-digit division.
When doing this, we'll see how our rapid 2 by 1 multiplication skills will really pay
off. Let's determine your gas mileage if your car travels 353 miles on 14 gallons of gas.
In other words, we'll divide 353 by 14. Okay, now 14 goes into 35 twice. So 14 times 20
is 280. Go ahead and say the 20. Subtract 280 from 353 to get, let's see, 353 minus 280.
You might subtract 300 and add 20 to get 73. And now we have a simpler division problem.
14 into 73, how many times? Five times. 14 times 5 is 70. So we can say the rest of
our answer. You'd be 25 with a remainder of 3. You'd be getting a little more than 25
miles per gallon. Now let's consider the problem 500 divided by 73. Okay, so first
we have to ask, how many times does 73 go into 500? It's natural to guess 7, but 7 times
73, when we do that 2 by 1, we get 511, which is a little too big. At least we know that
our quotient is 6. Okay, so we do 6 times, we can say the 6. We can then do 6 times 73
to get 438. What's 500 minus 438? By compliments we know it's 62. So there's your answer, 6
with a remainder of 62. But we could have done this problem another way. Remember when
we tried 73 times 7 and we got 511, too big, right? Well we can actually take advantage
of that calculation. That didn't have to go to waste. You could actually think of your
answer. Don't say it, but you could think of your answer as 7 with a remainder of negative
11. Now that sounds a little ridiculous, right? But that's the same as an answer of 6 with
a remainder of 73 minus 11, 62, and that agrees with our previous answer. So why does that
work? Because 500 is 73 times 7 minus 11. And when we replace 7 with 6 plus 1, we actually
get 73 times 6 plus 62. I call this technique overshooting. So we're going to go ahead and
think about it. Sometimes in a division problem, I will deliberately overshoot. For example,
let's do the problem 770 divided by 79. Now we know that 79 times 10 is 790, but go ahead
and think it anyway. 79 times 10 is 790, and that's too big by 20. So the answer that
you think is 10 with a remainder of negative 20, and the answer you say is 9 with a remainder
of 79 minus 20, 59. Okay, let's try a 4-digit number divided by a 2-digit number. This is
about as large a division problem that most people can handle even with practice. Consider
the problem we saw earlier, 2001 divided by 23. Okay, now let's see. 23 times 8 is,
that's a 2 by 1, it's 184. 23 times 9 is 207, that's too big. So we start by saying 23
times 80 is 1840. Okay, so you can say the 80, get that out of your memory, get that
out of your memory, and now you have to subtract 2001 minus 1840. Now, how far is 1840 from
2001? Now if you use compliments, you know that 1840 is 160 away from 2000. So how far
is it away from 2001? Just add one to it, 161. Okay, finally, we have to divide 20 by
23 into 161, but 23 times 7 is 161 exactly, so there's the rest of your answer, 87.
If we change that problem by just a little, it becomes actually easier. Let's look at
the problem 2012 divided by 24. We see that both numbers here are divisible by 4, right?
Because 12 is divisible by 4, 24 is divisible by 4. Specifically, 2012 is 503 times 4, and
24 is 6 times 4. So you could do 2012 over 24, and that simplifies to the problem 503
divided by 6. Thus, we've reduced our two-digit division problem to a one-digit division problem
which is easier to do. When doing the division 503 divided by 6, we get an exact answer of
83 and 5, 6. But the answer to the original problem is not 83 with a remainder of 5, but
it is 83 and 5, 6. The reason for that is we divided both of our original numbers by
4, so the real answer would be 83 with a remainder of 20, or 83 and 20, 20 fourths, but that's
the same as 83 and 5, 6. As long as we express our answer in terms of a fraction, we'll be
okay. Here, let's try the problem 314 divided by 16. Since both numbers are even, we can
divide both numbers to give the new problem 157 divided by 8. And since 8 times 20 is
160 is a little too big by 3, we can get an answer of 20 with a remainder of negative
3. That's what we think. Then we think that's 19 with a remainder of 5, but we have to say
the answer 19 and 5 eighths. When the divisor ends in 5, doubling both numbers will usually
simplify your problem. For example, 695 divided by 25. If I double those numbers, I get 1390
divided by 50. Ooh, let's kill both zeros to get the problem 139 divided by 5. Hey, there's
a 5 again, so let's double both numbers to get 278 divided by 10, and that's our answer
27.8. When dividing with decimals, I try to turn it into an integer problem if I can.
For instance, 3.45 divided by 1.2, multiply both numbers by 10 to get 34.5 divided by
12. And then to get rid of that .5, let's double both numbers to get 69 divided by 24. But
hey, both of those are multiples of 3, so let's divide both numbers by 3 to get 23 divided
by 8, and that's equal to 2 and 7 eighths. For all of these division problems, I've been
expressing the answer using a fraction at the end, but sometimes we want to convert
the fraction into decimals. When the denominator is 11 or below, it's extremely easy to compute
the decimal expansion. You probably already know the decimal expansions when the denominator
is 2, 3, 4, or 5. I'll display them here. I didn't list two fourths since the same as
one half. Naturally, when the denominator is 10, the fractions are automatic. One tenth
is .1, two tenths is .2, and so on. The fractions with denominators 6 and 8 are worth memorizing
since they often arise in measurements. And once you know that one ninth is .1111, then
we instantly have the others. Two ninths is .2222, three ninths is .333, and so on. Likewise,
one elevenths is .090909, repeated. Once you know that, you know all the others. Two elevenths
is .1818, repeated. Three elevenths is .2727, repeated, and so on.
The fractions with denominators 7 are the trickiest, but they're also the most interesting.
The fraction for one seventh is worth memorizing. It's equal to .142857, repeated. That is,
it's .142857, 142857 going on forever. If you draw these numbers in a circle, it looks
like this. This decimal expansion is especially easy to remember because it starts with 14,
then doubles to 28, then nearly doubles again with .57 before repeating. What's cool is
that once you know this fraction, you know all the other sevenths fractions too. So looking
at our circle of 142857, check this out. Two sevenths is going to start with the two,
and then go around the circle forever. It's .285714, repeated. Three sevenths is .428571,
repeated. Four sevenths is .571428, repeated. Five sevenths is .714285, repeated. Six sevenths
is .857142, repeated. And it's easy to know where to start on the circle if you remember
that one seventh is about .14. So two sevenths is going to start .28, three sevenths is going
to start .42. Four sevenths, well let's see, four times 14 is 56. It doesn't start .56.
There aren't any sixes on the circle, but it starts .57. Five sevenths, well five times
.14 is .7, and we start with the seven. And six sevenths, six times .14 is 84, and we
start with the .85. Take a minute to study this circle. It'll be well worth it. Okay,
memorize this, and then I'll ask you a couple of questions. Okay, most importantly, what
is the decimal expansion for one seventh? It's .142857. Don't look at the circle either.
How about three sevenths? What's that going to be? Three sevenths is, well it's going
to start with .42, so it's going to be .428571, repeated. And six sevenths, let's see, six
times 14 is 84. It starts with the eight. It's .857142, repeated. When dealing with
fractions with larger denominators, we treat it as a normal division problem, but we can
occasionally take shortcuts, especially when the denominator is even. For example, consider
the fraction 3 over 16. Now, we begin in the usual way, except we start with a decimal
point, and then 16 goes into 30 once, it's .1, we can say that, 30 minus 16 is 14, and
now we have a new division problem, 14 divided by 16. But we know that 14 over 16 is the
same as 7 over 8, and 7 eighths is .875. So you can now say the rest of your answer, .1875.
Here let's do the fraction 5 over 14. So we start by saying decimal point, then 14 goes
into 50 three times, go ahead and say the three, 50 minus 42 is 8, and you're left with
doing the division problem of 8 divided by 14. But 8 fourteenths is four sevenths, and
you know four sevenths, right? That's .571428, repeated. So if you really want to impress
your friends, you'll say the answer, .3571428, 571428, and so on.
With odd denominators, you may be out of luck, unless the denominator is a multiple of 5,
in which case you, like we've done with fives before, you can double the numerator and denominator
to make the problem easier. Like 11 over 15, think of that instead as 22 over 30. And now
22 over three is seven and a third, 7.33, so 22 over 30 is going to be .733, repeated.
We've covered a lot of ground in this lecture. Here are some of the strategies that we've
learned. We looked at the visibility tests for all the numbers from 1 to 12, and even
beyond those, by using the create a zero, kill a zero method. These tests are valuable
for simplifying your division problem before it even starts. We divide numbers from left
to right, using a process similar to long division, but we say our answer as we go along and
we simplify the problem as we go. The process can sometimes be further simplified by overshooting
occasionally. It's easy to convert fractions to decimals, especially with one-digit denominators.
And as we saw, dividing by 7 is especially interesting. There were many new ideas, and
if you practice these techniques, you'll be dividing and conquering numbers in your head
in no time. We've now covered the fundamental techniques of mental addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. What comes next? Although developing an ability to find an
exact answer is the foundation of all mental math, sometimes all you really need is an
estimate, especially when the problems are large, but in many other situations too. So
in our next lecture, we'll explore the art of mental estimation. Here we don't need
the exact answer, so we can do these problems even more quickly and still be pretty close.
It should be pretty good.
