1. **Thomas Aquinas' Early Life**: Born in 1225 to a noble family in Roccasecca, Italy, Thomas showed an early inclination towards religious life and was sent by his family to study at the University of Naples. However, he encountered the Dominicans, a new and zealous order, which led to some tension with his family, who attempted to rehabilitate him back to a more traditional monastic life.

2. **Recruitment by the Dominicans**: Thomas was caught and brought back by Rinaldo da Pieve, a Dominican friar, against his family's wishes due to their perception of the order as fanatical Jesus freaks.

3. **Monastic Struggle**: The family, particularly his mother, Teodora, eventually accepted Thomas' vocation and allowed him to join the Dominicans. He was sent to study in Paris but was initially resistant to the order's ways of life.

4. **Academic Pursuits in Paris**: Thomas studied at the Dominican house on the Rue Saint-Jacques, completed his novitiate, and earned a master's degree in arts. He spent three periods in Paris, indicating his deep commitment to academic pursuits.

5. **Meeting Albert the Great**: In 1248, Thomas left Paris for Cologne to study under Albert the Great, a renowned philosopher and natural scientist who influenced Thomas's work significantly.

6. **Studium Generale in Cologne**: Thomas expected his time in Cologne to be a period of peaceful contemplation. Instead, he found himself immersed in an intensive academic environment at the new Studium Generale established by the Dominicans.

7. **Philosophical and Theological Work**: During his time in Cologne, Thomas began his extensive work on synthesizing Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology, laying the groundwork for his later comprehensive works.

8. **Final Years**: After completing his studies in Cologne, Thomas returned to Paris twice more, where he taught theology and continued his writing. His most famous work, "Summa Theologica," was completed just before his death in 1274. He was canonized as a saint in 1323 and is revered as a doctor of the Church, known for his intellectual rigor and contributions to both philosophy and theology.

1. **Thomas Aquinas' Final Journey and Illness**: In January of 1274, Pope Gregory X called Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventura to serve at the Second Council of Lyon, aiming for reconciliation between the Eastern and Western churches and possibly with Islam and Judaism as well. On his way to the council, Thomas fell ill after hitting his head on a low-hanging branch from a tree while traveling in a mule. He died on March 7th, 1274, at the Cistercian Abbey of Fosomose, near his birthplace.

2. **His Legacy**: Thomas was canonized by Pope John XXII in 1323. His feast day initially commemorated on March 7th was later moved to January 28th in the Roman Catholic Church. Albert the Great, his teacher, mourned deeply at his loss, calling him "the flower and the glory of the world."

3. **Thomas' Influence**: Bartholomew of Capua reported that James of the Terbo, a Dominican and Archbishop of Naples, believed that God sent doctors to illuminate the church at different times: first Paul, then Augustine, and finally Thomas Aquinas in these last days. He was considered by many to be the ultimate master of the perennial philosophy, whose work would not be surpassed until the end of the world.

4. **Medieval Confidence**: The high estimation of the impact of Thomas' work reflects the confidence of medieval intellectuals in their contributions to the church and the world, viewing them as Divinely inspired and timelessly significant.

1. **Raymond of Peñaforte and the Miracle**: Raymond was a significant figure who performed an extraordinary miracle in the 13th century. He is known for his mystical ability to fly across the Mediterranean Sea from the Balearic Islands to Barcelona, as recorded by contemporary accounts. This event illustrates the intersection of the miraculous with the rational and scholarly world, which was deeply influenced by Thomas Aquinas' works.

2. **Thomas Aquinas' Works**: Thomas Aquinas, a prominent theologian and philosopher, wrote several major works, each addressing different aspects or audiences:
   - **Summa Contra Gentiles** (1258-1259; 1261-1264): Composed during Thomas' stay at the Papal Court, this work argues for Christian truths in a format that presents reasons for and against various positions before addressing the objections.
   - **Commentary on the Four Books of Sentences**: This was Thomas' early work, completed while he was a graduate student in theology at the University of Paris. It is considered foundational for understanding Aquinas' major conclusions, which remained consistent throughout his life.
   - **Summa Theologiae**: Thomas' most famous work, written later in his life, aims to systematically cover all aspects of Christian theology. It was intended to be a practical manual that could be used by anyone interested in understanding the faith.
   - **Compendium Theologiae**: A shorter and more accessible version of his theological thought, this summa was written as a manual to make the essence of Christian belief accessible to a wider audience.

3. **Theological Significance**: Thomas Aquinas' works have had a profound impact on Catholic theology and philosophy. His approach to synthesizing faith and reason has been influential in both religious and secular contexts. His summas were written over a span of 20 years and address different audiences, from students and scholars to a general audience seeking a concise understanding of Christian doctrine.

 The passage you provided offers a detailed explanation of the Eucharistic doctrine within the Latin Christian Church, emphasizing the belief that during the Mass, the bread and wine become the flesh and blood of Christ, not symbolically but in substance (transubstantiation). This belief is affirmed by faith beyond empirical evidence. The text also outlines the concept that while Christ is fully present in both forms, bread and wine, he remains whole and undivided regardless of how much each individual receives. It reassures that the Eucharist is not diminished by consumption and that even if a priest breaks the host for distribution, there is still as much of Christ present in each fragment as there is in the whole.

The passage concludes with the poem "Adoro de Votis," which expresses personal devotion to Christ, who is hidden under the forms of bread and wine. The poet contemplates the inadequacy of human senses to fully grasp the divine presence and professes belief in both Godhead and humanity of Christ. The speaker seeks salvation and the beatific vision, the ultimate Christian hope for eternal happiness with God, which is described as a profound longing and desire to see the unveiled glory of Christ.

The poem captures the speaker's emotional journey through faith, contemplating the mystery of the Eucharist, and yearning for the direct experience of divine love and truth. It's a moving account that intertwines scholastic doctrine with personal devotion.

 Thomas Aquinas, a medieval philosopher and theologian, is known for integrating Aristotelian philosophical principles with traditional Christian speculative philosophy. His work stands out as an evolution from the Augustinian tradition that was dominant before him. According to historian David Knowles, Thomas' main achievements were:

1. Integrating Aristotelian philosophy into Christian thought in a more logical and systematic way than previous thinkers had done.
2. Rethinking old problems and materials to create a new and original Christian philosophy.

Two key features of Aquinas' philosophy are the sharp distinction between knowing (which he views as superior to believing) and believing, and the notion that the human soul is the form of the human body, an idea influenced by Aristotelian thought.

Recently, M.D. Jordan has challenged the view that Thomas Aquinas was strictly an Aristotelian in his book "The Alleged Aristotelianism of Thomas Aquinas." Jordan argues that Aquinas often argued positions that were against what Aristotle had stated and that he drew from a variety of sources, not just Aristotle.

Despite these challenges, many historians like Knowles maintain that Aquinas' thought remains deeply rooted in Aristotelian philosophy. This perspective values the historical context in which Aquinas worked and the extent to which his synthesis was an attempt to reconcile Christian doctrines with Aristotelian principles.

Thomas Aquinas' work also addressed the immortality of the individual person, siding with Aristotle that upon the body's death, the soul also perishes, contrary to the Christian belief in personal immortality. However, this view was later subject to debate and interpretation within the Christian tradition.

 The fifth way of St. Thomas Aquinas, which is based on the observed governance of the world, argues for the existence of a necessarily existent being—God—as the intelligent director of all natural things. This argument observes that non-rational beings act for an end and do so effectively, indicating that they are directed by a higher intelligence. Aquinas uses the analogy of an arrow being directed by an archer to illustrate this point. He concludes that there must be an intelligent being who guides natural things to their ends, which we call God.

This argument is rooted in the premises of medieval culture, which includes the acceptance of Aristotelian logic and epistemology. While Aquinas' arguments are products of his time, they reflect a philosophical approach that attempts to discern the nature of reality through reason and observation. Critics like Bertrand Russell have been known to criticize such arguments as "special pleading," but this overlooks the historical context and the philosophical depth of Aquinas' reasoning.

Aquinas' argument is part of a broader philosophical inquiry into the existence of God, which he elaborates upon in greater detail throughout the first part of his "Summa Theologiae." These arguments, while grounded in the philosophy of his time, have been subject to reinterpretation and defense by Thomists who aim to make Aquinas' thought more accessible and relevant to contemporary philosophical discussions. However, it is important to note that Aquinas does not transcend the limitations of his cultural and historical context but instead provides a synthesis of Christian faith with the philosophy and science available to him.

 Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotelian philosophy, argues that evil does not possess its own essence or existence. According to Aquinas, every substance has actual being in accord with its essence, and since the essence of anything is good because it is a reflection of the divine goodness that orders all creation, everything that exists is inherently good. Evil, on the other hand, is not a substance but can be seen as an accident or privation, a lack or absence of good, similar to the absence of color (blackness) being a type of darkness.

Aquinas supports this view with scriptural references, citing Genesis 1:31, Ecclesiastes, and 1 Timothy, which all affirm that everything created by God is good. He also refutes the Manichean notion that some things are inherently evil by stating that no thing exists for itself but rather for the purpose of achieving the ultimate good, which is God.

In his argument, Aquinas asserts that all actions, even sinful ones, are attempts to achieve a distorted form of the good or an imperfect image of God, who is the ultimate end and source of all things. This perspective is part of Aquinas's larger teleological view that everything in the universe is ordered towards God, who is the final cause and the highest good.

In essence, Aquinas's position is that evil does not exist as a thing in itself but arises from the privation or perversion of the inherent goodness that comes from being created by God. This optimistic view sees all creation as ultimately aligned with the divine will and purpose.

1. **Original Sin**: Augustine's concept of original sin involves disobedience, which manifests in human nature, particularly in sexuality for males, as evidenced by the disjunction between the will and the body. This is not to be confused with a belief that original sin was a specifically sexual sin.

2. **Thomas Aquinas' View**: Thomas Aquinas saw human sexuality as consistent with God's plan and capable of expressing love and unity within marriage, despite his own celibate state. He had a more optimistic view of the human capacity to act virtuously without divine grace.

3. **Virtues and Vices**: Thomas Aquinas held that virtue is an inherent power in humans that allows us to discern good and act upon it. Augustine, on the other hand, believed that original sin left humanity incapable of truly virtuous action without divine grace.

4. **Grace and Nature**: For Thomas, grace does not eliminate nature but perfects it. Virtue operates through the four powers of the human person: the intellect, the will, the concupisable appetite (desires), and the irascible appetite (emotions like anger).

5. **Common Sense (Cinderesis)**: Thomas Aquinas introduced the concept of cinderesis, an innate sense that allows all humans to have an understanding of right and wrong. This internal moral compass guides our actions, allowing for a consistent application of virtue and morality across individuals, which is essential for law and order in society.

6. **Thomistic Natural Man**: In Thomas's view, it is possible to imagine a human being who lives a virtuous life without divine grace, based on the natural capacity for virtue inherent in every person. This perspective was somewhat controversial and led to several condemnations by ecclesiastical authorities throughout history.

1. **Marriage and Equality**: Thomas Aquinas emphasizes that marriage should be between equal partners, taking into account each spouse's strengths and virtues. He also notes that polygamy can lead to the enslavement of women within marriage, as observed in societies with polygamous traditions.

2. **Contraception**: Aquinas, influenced by Aristotelian teleology, would likely have concluded that contraception is against natural law primarily because it frustrates procreation, which is seen as a natural and necessary end of sexual activity. However, Louis Dupré suggests that if the world were adequately or even overpopulated, Aquinas might have reconsidered this stance, given his teleological approach.

3. **Flexibility in Ethics**: Aquinas' discussion on human sexuality within a Christian framework shows a remarkable flexibility and openness to different cultural practices, as seen in his treatment of both monogamous and polygamous marriages. This suggests that Aquinas' ethics could serve as a point of departure for various interpretations, including those that are more modern.

4. **Influence of Tradition**: The influence of both Aristotelian teleology and the Christian doctrine of providence shapes Aquinas' views on marriage and sexuality. His work reflects a deep respect for the long Christian tradition, which includes a belief in divine providence.

5. **Neotomism vs. Aquinas**: It is important to distinguish between the rigid moralizing of some modern Neotomists and Aquinas' own nuanced and culturally aware approach to ethics. Aquinas' views, especially on marriage, are surprisingly open to various interpretations and adaptations in different cultural contexts.

In summary, Thomas Aquinas' writings on family and sexuality within the Christian tradition reveal a complex interplay of Aristotelian philosophy, teleological reasoning, and an awareness of diverse cultural practices. His work suggests that a modern Thomistic ethics could be more flexible than often supposed, allowing for different interpretations in light of contemporary realities and challenges.

1. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, there are two powers established by God: the lower power (the secular or civil authority) and the higher power (the spiritual or ecclesiastical authority). These powers are autonomous and do not inherently have to obey each other, except in specific matters where the supreme power has subordinated one to the other.

2. The higher power, which is the church, is obeyed by the lower power, the state, specifically in matters pertaining to salvation, such as eradicating heresy. This was particularly relevant during Thomas' time when dealing with heretical movements like the Cathars or the Waldensians.

3. In civil matters, however, the secular power takes precedence over the spiritual power. The secular power should not be subject to the dictates of the church in these areas. This distinction between spiritual and temporal authority is supported by Jesus' teaching in Matthew 22:21 ("Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's").

4. Thomas introduces a nuanced view by acknowledging that the papacy holds both spiritual and secular authority, especially in the case of territories directly ruled by the Pope, like the Papal States. This raises questions about whether Thomas' stance is influenced by his personal circumstances, including his dependence on the papacy as a member of the Dominican Order, or if it reflects a more universal principle regarding the relationship between church and state across Christendom.

5. The distinction between spiritual and temporal authority was a complex issue in medieval political thought, with historical examples like the conflict between Frederick II and Pope Innocent IV, which Thomas references. This complexity is indicative of the broader institutional dynamics at play during Aquinas' time.

 In this section of Saint Thomas Aquinas's "Summa Theologica," he addresses various objections and questions regarding the Jewish sacrificial law as outlined in the Old Testament. Thomas engages with a critique that sees animal sacrifice as an unnecessary and even improper way to worship God, due to its inherent association with death and corruption. The objector points out that sacrificing animals introduces defects by removing their lives, which is contrary to the principle of preserving life.

Thomas responds to these objections by explaining that the specific ways in which sacrificial animals were slain were intended to prevent cruelty and idolatrous practices. He references Rabbi Moses Maimonides' "The Guide for the Perplexed" to clarify that the Jewish law aimed to minimize suffering to the animal and exclude any form of mutilation or cruelty.

Furthermore, Thomas acknowledges that different species of animals were offered for different sins, with the understanding that more grievous sins required a lower species of animal for the sacrifice. This variation in the type of animal sacrificed reflects the seriousness of the sin and is consistent with Rabbi Moses' interpretations.

Thomas's approach here demonstrates his commitment to understanding different cultural and religious practices within the context of Christian theology and his broader philosophical framework, which seeks harmony between faith and reason. He shows that the sacrificial laws, although they may seem peculiar or even cruel from a modern perspective, had a purpose rooted in both the religious and moral tradition of the Jewish people and the divine will as understood within the Christian context. Thomas's synthesis of different sources and his careful consideration of various aspects of the sacrificial law illustrates his depth of knowledge and his ability to address complex theological issues with both authority and compassion.

 The discussion in this segment revolves around the use of Latin language and its phonetic elements, particularly focusing on the dental fricative 'th' sound as used by Thomas Aquinas in his poetry. The speaker highlights how this sound can contribute to a sense of clarity and purpose, and how it is used effectively in a poem by Thomas Aquinas. The poem's structure and use of language create a balance or 'debita proporzio,' which is a concept Thomas himself discusses in terms of beauty and harmony in art and poetry.

The speaker analyzes the poem's seven strophes, pointing out the recurring themes of truth ('veritas') and hiddenness ('latens'), as well as the use of key words like 'tutte,' 'creditor,' and 'dixit.' These elements contribute to both the consonance (pleasing arrangement of sounds) and the proportion in the poem.

The poem is seen as expressing a profound awareness of doubt, a theme that was of particular interest to Thomas Aquinas. The speaker suggests that this doubt is central to Thomas's thought and is reflected in his mystical experience on St. Nicholas Day of 1273. The poem concludes with a plea for a direct and unveiled vision of God's glory, which aligns with the contemporary understanding of Jerusalem as the vision of peace, an extension of God's nature.

The speaker emphasizes that Thomas Aquinas's rational prose is not just cold or distant but can also be seen as a thing of beauty. The lecture encourages listeners to appreciate the aesthetic qualities in Thomas's works and to recognize the balance and harmony he achieves, both in his prose and his poetry.
