Checking Soul and the City- Art, Literature and Urban Living/01. The City as Container, the Artist as Mapmaker.txt
1. Cities dominate us spatially and visually, reminding us of our small place within them. They are large spatial containers that we navigate with maps, which, however precise, are conventional and subject to change.

2. Maps tell us about physical geography but not about subjective experiences of neighborhoods, beauty, or civic unrest. In contrast, city art can evoke emotional and psychological investment, offering a vicarious experience that is both personal and privileged.

3. Art functions as an alternative map—a map of time. It allows us to enter into and experience places and times that may no longer exist or are inaccessible in reality. Through city art, we gain insight into the historical continuum of the city.

4. City artists act as both surveyors and chroniclers, mapping not only physical space but also the temporal dimensions of urban life. They help us to become more aware of our own place within the larger context of the city's history and our personal past.

5. The role of city art is crucial because it encourages us to look beyond the immediate and ephemeral surface of urban life, helping us to perceive the deeper layers and complexities of both our environment and ourselves. Artists provide a valuable service by making these deeper realms visible and understandable.

1. **The Myth of Theseus and the Minotaur**: The lecturer begins by discussing the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, which serves as an allegory for the human relationship with the built environment. The labyrinth represents the city, and Theseus's journey through it reflects our attempts to navigate and understand urban spaces.

2. **Planning and Hubris**: The lecturer emphasizes that planning has a hubristic element, suggesting that humans believe they can create perfect designs for cities that will stand the test of time. However, many such plans fail due to unforeseen circumstances or change over time.

3. **The St. Louis Experiment**: As an example of a planning disaster, the lecturer mentions the St. Louis experiment with Pouet Ego, which was so flawed that it had to be demolished.

4. **Women's Perspective in Urban Planning**: The lecturer notes a critical perspective that suggests women, due to their daily experiences and interactions within the city, may have a different understanding of urban planning than male planners, who often come from a more detached, theoretical standpoint.

5. **Kafka's Parable**: The lecturer closes with a parable by Franz Kafka, which illustrates the theme of alienation in the city. A man is unable to find his way and turns to a policeman for help. The policeman dismisses him with the advice "Give it up," highlighting the theme of disorientation and the struggle to find one's place within the urban landscape.

In summary, the lecturer uses myth, history, and literature to explore the complex relationship between humans and their cities, emphasizing the importance of understanding the lived experience within urban spaces and the limitations of overly theoretical approaches to city planning.

Checking Soul and the City- Art, Literature and Urban Living/03. The Marketplace.txt
 In the opening scene of Bertolt Brecht's play "The Jungle of Cities," set in a lending library in Chicago, Garga, the librarian, interacts with two characters, Slink and Skinny. Skinny and Slink enter the library seeking a book to rent; however, they are more interested in purchasing Garga's opinion on a crime story than the book itself. They offer Garga ten dollars for his view, which he refuses, emphasizing that his role is merely to wrap up books for those who borrow them.

The exchange between the characters reveals themes of commodification and the marketplace, where individuals are treated as commodities and their opinions can be bought and sold. Brecht uses this interaction to critique the capitalist system, where personal autonomy and genuine values are often overshadowed by economic transactions. The play's setting in Chicago, a city synonymous with rapid industrialization and modernity, serves as a backdrop for exploring these themes.

Brecht's "The Jungle of Cities" is an allegory for the complexities of urban life, where individuals are interchangeable and their worth is determined by the market. The play reflects Brecht's own critical perspective on society and his anticipation of the commodification of human interactions in the 20th century. Through this narrative, Brecht encourages the audience to question the value of human opinions and the nature of exchange within a capitalist system.

 In Walt Whitman's poem "Sparkles from the Wheel," we encounter a more subtle and less sensational aspect of his work. The poem depicts a scene in the city where a crowd is watching something on a sunny day. Whitman joins the children observing a knife grinder at work, turning the stone rapidly and pressing a large knife to it, which produces a shower of golden sparks.

Whitman describes the scene with great specificity, focusing on the details: the sad, sharp-chinned old man with worn clothes and a broad shoulder band of leather; the children, quiet and attentive; the sounds and sensations of the city; and the light, pressed blade that emits sparkles like golden jets.

The poem captures a moment of civic order, where people from different walks of life come together to witness this ordinary yet magical event—a kind of alchemy transforming the mundane into something almost ethereal. The children and the old man, strangers to each other, form an unplanned group in the vastness of the city, sharing a moment of beauty and connection without words or conscious interaction.

Whitman's narrative underscores the shared experiences that can briefly create a sense of community among urban dwellers, highlighting the potential for finding harmony and art in everyday life. It is a reflection on the nature of encounter and observation within the bustling environment of the city, as well as the poet's role in capturing these fleeting moments of connection and beauty.

1. **Oedipus Rex**: The play by Sophocles is a story that explores the theme of concealed or occulted connections, where Oedipus discovers he is connected to his past in ways he did not know. This revelation exposes his hubris and leads to the uncovering of his origins, which ultimately saves the city from the plague it was suffering. The act of recovering the full story of his life and graphing his coordinates is analogous to the narrative action that purges the city's affliction.

2. **Narrative as Recovery**: The process of uncovering one's past and understanding one's life's narrative can be seen as a form of healing, not just for the individual but also for the community. This is reflected in the way memory allows us to possess our own estate and in turn save the city.

3. **Parallels in Film**: Two films that echo the themes of Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" are "Hiroshima Mon Amour" and "Chinatown." In "Hiroshima Mon Amour," the protagonists must confront painful personal histories against the backdrop of a city devastated by war. In "Chinatown," the detective's quest to uncover a hidden crime in the face of a drought threatening Los Angeles mirrors Oedipus' journey, with narrative action serving as a means of recovery and potential salvation for the afflicted community.

4. **The Significance**: The recurring theme across these narratives is that the act of uncovering truths about one's past and understanding one's place in the world can lead to personal transformation and, by extension, healing for the larger community. This underscores the importance of narrative in the process of recovery and the potential for rebirth after destruction or affliction.

1. **Human Memory vs. Electronic Storage**: In Godard's film "Alphaville," the protagonist, Lenny Caution, contrasts the richness of human memory and language with the cold, efficient storage of information in a futuristic city controlled by a computer named Alpha 60. The film explores the loss of human connection and culture in an era dominated by technology.

2. **Cultural Echoes**: Lenny Caution, rather than being a conventional hero, represents the living culture of the past. He quotes from various authors like Shakespeare, Pascal, Elioir, Borges, and Baudelaire, symbolizing how individuals are composed of cultural data and influences from before their birth.

3. **The Role of Language**: The film shows that language is not just a tool for communication but also a vessel for carrying the essence of our culture and history, suggesting that original thought is difficult due to the influence of pre-existing ideas and texts.

4. **Human vs. Machine**: "Alphaville" presents a dichotomy between the emotional depth of human experience (including love, tenderness, and artistic expression) and the impersonal efficiency of machines and technology. The film argues for the preservation of human values over the mechanization of life.

5. **The Ending**: The story culminates in Lenny Caution helping Natasha, a woman who has been erased from history by the computer, to reclaim her past and escape the oppressive city, highlighting the importance of individual identity and human connection.

6. **Philosophical Implications**: The film reflects on the nature of memory, the role of language in shaping identity, and the potential loss of human essence due to technological advancement. It serves as a modern fable or allegory that encourages viewers to consider the value of preserving human culture and experiences in an increasingly digital world.

In essence, "Alphaville" is a meditation on the tension between human experience and technological control, advocating for the preservation of human memory, language, and emotional depth in the face of an ever-advancing digital age.

 In your lecture, you discuss the concept of homeostasis in the context of urban living, using literary examples to illustrate how the rhythm and tempo of city life can penetrate an individual's personal space, disrupting the balance between self and environment. You reference the work of the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, specifically his prose text "The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge."

In this text, the protagonist, a poor Danish artist living in Paris, experiences a breakdown of his personal defenses against the city's influences. The narrative describes encounters with derelicts who communicate in a mysterious language that suggests a deeper, almost primal kinship. These interactions reveal the protagonist's own sense of being an outsider, not fully at home in the urban environment he inhabits.

The protagonist senses that the old woman with the drawer of a nightstand, carrying buttons and needles, is trying to communicate something significant to him, not just through her actions but as a sign for the initiated—a sign that he understands belongs to a community of outcasts. This moment underscores the theme of losing one's sense of separation and isolation, as the protagonist realizes his connection to these marginalized figures.

The passage highlights the vulnerability of the individual in an impersonal urban landscape, where the barriers that protect personal identity can be eroded, leading to a profound recognition of shared human conditions. This theme resonates with the broader discussion on homeostasis and the challenges of maintaining psychological boundaries in the face of environmental pressures, as seen in both Rilke's work and the context you provide in your lecture.

 In the final lecture of this series, Professor James Simpson discusses the concept of cities and their significance in shaping human perception, culture, and art. He begins by highlighting the scene from Shakespeare's "Othello" where Othello pleads his case before the Duke and the Venetian senators, emphasizing the concentric circles of civilization and governance that are on display in this setting.

Simpson points out that cities are not ephemeral; they are enduring structures that influence our perceptions and become a part of us. He uses examples from Ernest Hemingway's parents who were shaped by their experiences in cities, as well as Marco Polo's descriptions in Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," where Venice is the unspoken reference point for all his tales of distant lands.

The professor argues that cities live within us and condition our way of seeing, naming, and telling stories. Art, too, plays a crucial role in this context by expanding and deepening our human experience, offering a broader perspective on life beyond our immediate surroundings.

Simpson concludes by encouraging listeners to appreciate the value of art as a means to connect with the larger world, challenging the narrow confines of the self and enriching the human estate. He invites listeners to explore more courses from The Teaching Company, which can be ordered by calling 1-800-TEACH-1-2 or visiting www.teachco.com.

The lecture emphasizes the profound impact that cities have on the human condition and the role of art as a medium for transcending the limitations of individual experience to engage with the wider world.
