Instead, the idea is to mask just enough
so that a data set can be used freely
without revealing sensitive data.
Should the government have more data available
to help fight crime, espionage, or terrorism?
How much data should businesses share
with each other or the government?
How much should business or government
share with the rest of us?
In 2014, President Obama announced a comprehensive review
of big data and privacy.
Announced changes in government policy were to include,
find an alternative to storing bulk data
about citizen phone calls and emails.
Look for terrorists using two degrees of separation
from a member of a terrorist network
instead of three degrees.
Extend to citizens in other countries,
some of the protections previously offered
only to US citizens.
Remember though, even if we make up our minds about this,
even if we know what we want,
we can be going along thinking the data is secure,
but it may not be.
We will continue to see disclosures in the news,
stories revealing data that was suddenly found
to be insecure.
This can be like my trip to the grocery store.
Be careful thinking you are doing things
that won't be noticed.
If you are sharing digital data, it might be visible.
In fact, somewhere your digital data almost certainly
is visible, at least potentially.
So we live in a digital world and it is hard
and maybe impossible at times to live
without any digital footprint.
In fact, most of this course focuses on the advantage
of having a digital footprint.
Still, there are limits on what should be seen
and who should see it.
So these are all not easy issues.
These days, who you are in a new and important sense
is partly defined by where you stand on privacy.
