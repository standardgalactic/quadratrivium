Jesse Owens ran in 10.3 in 1936, which is almost two blanks of an eye slower than Bolt.
This gives a bit more insight on the numbers, but still, what does this really mean?
How far ahead would one runner be than another?
To help with this, we'll compute average speed.
Bolt ran the 100 meter race in 9.63 seconds, which averages to a speed of 23.23 mph.
Carl Lewis averaged 22.39 mph.
So at the end of the race, Carl would have been 3.6 meters or just 12 feet behind Bolt.
Jesse Owens would have been 6.5 meters or about 21 feet behind.
Yes, it's only one or two blanks of an eye, but at those speeds, a lot is happening in
the blink of an eye.
So we have a sense of the speed that these numbers represent.
In particular, this really helps us see how a slight variation can change the time, but
very small changes are important in races at these speeds.
Now let's get a sense of the numbers as a whole.
Can we see any trend in the data?
We already mentioned the numbers are generally decreasing.
One quick way that we as data analysts can get a sense of data is to graph or visualize
it.
In fact, that's one of the first questions I'll ask my students working in data analysis.
Have you graphed it yet?
If the answer is no, we generally sit down and try that first before anything else.
So let's try that together here.
There is some variability.
We see a big drop from 1896 to 1900.
We also see very fast times in 1932 and 1936 when Eddie Toland and Jesse Owens both ran
10.3 races.
There is another drop in 1968 when Jim Hines ran the race in 9.95.
The first gold medal time under 10 seconds.
It wouldn't be until 1984 in Carl Lewis that a sub-10 second time would happen again.
But I look at this graph and I see one overriding thing.
It's why it's in this lecture.
The data can be approximated by a line.
While the line won't pass through every point, it can get close.
If I were wanting to predict future times in this race, that insight right there, simply
from graphing, would be huge.
I graph the data and now I can see how I might model it with a line.
And if the trend in the data continues in the future, we can make predictions as to
how fast we might be running in 2020 or 2040.
