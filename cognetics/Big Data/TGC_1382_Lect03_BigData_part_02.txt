We already mentioned that 10 megabytes is enough for the complete works of Shakespeare.
Seven minutes of HDTV video is one gigabyte or 1,000 megabytes.
A DVD can hold from 1 to 15 gigabytes.
Blu-ray discs can hold 50 to 100 gigabytes.
1,000 gigabytes equals 1 terabyte.
10 terabytes equals all the text information in books held by the U.S. Library of Congress.
400 terabytes might be sufficient to hold all the books ever written.
1,000 terabytes is equal to one petabyte or 10 million four drawer filing cabinets filled with text.
In April 2013, the Titan supercomputer was upgraded to hold 40,000 terabytes or 40 petabytes.
Google processes about 20 petabytes per day, as I mentioned in lecture one.
All the phone calls in the U.S. if stored for a year might equal 300 petabytes.
1,000 petabytes is an exabyte.
Numbers this big came into use more recently.
Using PETA for quadrillion and EXA for quintillion was proposed in 1975.
Now we get to streaming of video data.
Streaming one movie for one hour is about one gigabyte.
So when a billion hours of video are streamed, that's a billion gigabytes or one exabyte.
If you wanted to store that, one very large data center might hold one exabyte.
All the words ever spoken by humankind one decade into the 21st century may have equaled about five exabytes.
1,000 exabytes equals one zettabyte.
That is roughly the scale of the entire worldwide web, which may be doubling in size every 12 or 18 months.
With one zettabyte reached perhaps in the year 2011.
One zettabyte is also about 250 billion DVDs, roughly 35 DVDs for every person on Earth.
Then what?
1,000 zettabytes equals one yotabyte.
One yotabyte is one quadrillion gigabytes.
Using a standard broadband connection, it would take you 11 trillion years to download a yotabyte.
For storage, one million large data centers would be roughly one yotabyte, pretty close to where we are.
Since an estimate from Emerson Power said there were already half a million data centers worldwide by 2011.
But even after we look at how data comes in various sizes, it's easy to think, well, it's all just big and assume big is all equal.
And that's just not true.
