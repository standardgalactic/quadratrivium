Edward Snowden needed password access,
without which none of his NSA disclosures
would have been possible.
Conversely, Snowden himself reportedly
used, quote, a large red hood over his head in laptop
when entering his passwords to prevent any hidden cameras
from detecting them.
Passwords employ a much more general approach toward data.
At many levels, we want data available.
We've seen surprising results.
And in the end, learn something new thanks to a data analysis
that saw something that we otherwise could not.
We want a rich set of ingredients
available for our computational laboratory.
But again, that data is often about us, our society,
our companies, our families, even our most personal details.
So we want it to also be secure.
Let's look at how companies, and especially the government,
make their data more secure.
First, keep outsiders out.
For example, when I worked at the national labs,
I couldn't play streamed music.
At least at the time, this could open the lab up for an attack.
I could play music from my laptop,
but not over an internet radio station.
Also, smartphones are more vulnerable than commonly
believed.
As President Obama once said, quote,
there is a reason why blackberries and iPhones
are not allowed in the White House situation room.
Those devices are not secure, and the US government knows it.
Second, keep inside things inside.
All the codes I developed at the national labs
stayed on their computers.
What I wrote at the national labs stayed at the national labs.
But they did want me to continue to develop them remotely.
So I could log on.
But they need to be sure the login is secure.
So I used a virtual private network or VPN connection.
VPN extends a private network across a public network,
such as the internet.
Using VPN, you can send and receive data
across shared or public networks as if it
were directly connected to the private network.
If you log in to work from home or while traveling,
