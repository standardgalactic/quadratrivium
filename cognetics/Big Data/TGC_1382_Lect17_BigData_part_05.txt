You teleport either when you are at a web page,
possibly with outlinks,
or you teleport because you're at a web page
with no links from it.
How do we know when to do what?
You can again think of it as a game.
At each web page, you again roll a die.
If it comes up with one through five,
the surfer will click a link on the current web page
and follow that link to a new web page.
Each link, like before, is equally likely to be chosen.
But now, if the die comes up six,
the surfer will now go to any web page on the internet.
Again, each web page is equally likely to be chosen.
Finally, if you end up at a dangling node,
you teleport to any web page
with again all choices equally likely.
That's the model.
Yes, that's the model Brennan Page created
that started Google.
There is only one difference.
Their model assumed that you were 85% likely
to follow a link on a web page.
By rolling a die, we made that 83% likely.
Let's reflect on this model a moment.
Do you surf like this?
I don't.
I'm not equally likely to go to any web page.
It's estimated that there are more
than a trillion web pages.
The subset I would visit or want to visit
is very, very small relative to this size.
I'm not even sure that I follow links
on web pages 80% of the time.
Then how did Brennan Page know this model
would lead to good search results?
That's a very good question.
My guess is this was exactly the question
that other search engines asked about their algorithm.
Blue Chip venture capital firms like Yahoo,
Alta Vista, and many other major companies
were approached by Stanford with Brennan Page's algorithm.
They turned down the chance to buy Google search engine
system for $1 million.
David Filo, a Stanford alum and founder of Yahoo,
encouraged the pair to start their own company
and return when the product was fully developed.
So the two left their doctoral programs
and moved their computers into the garage of a friend.
