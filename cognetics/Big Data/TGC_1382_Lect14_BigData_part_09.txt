to complete. But it was a supercomputer so things are done in massive parallel.
So even though 6 million hours is over 380 years it can be done. 380 years ago was pretty close
to when Isaac Newton was born. But supercomputers run simulations in parallel across many processors
and can solve otherwise intractable large-scale problems in an acceptable amount of time.
Simulation is a powerful tool in our world. It can help us model, understand and predict
behavior that could otherwise be dangerous or impossible to model. The key here is to emulate
an essential feature using a computer. If that's possible you might be able to simulate it and
then study your simulation. That is how certain predictions we see and hear all the time are
made. The weather forecast is a vast simulation. When you watch the news and they show how you
know the weather should unfold for the day, remember that's a simulation. Many dynamics go into this
and that's why sometimes it isn't right. But five-day forecasts are now as good as two-day
forecasts were two decades ago. So remember there is a lot of science and mathematics enabling us to
understand what's happening every single day. Simulations are everywhere. MAT and NFL use
simulation to correctly predict 8 of 11 super bowls between 2004 and 2014. Computers predict the
aerodynamics of a car so it can be altered and honed before it is ever built. And simulations
can represent outbreaks of fires to help predict where they might spread. So we don't always have
to study numbers from the actual physical phenomenon. And even when we begin with actual data we don't
have to stop there. Sometimes we learn more with a simulation.
