you are probably using a VPN connection.
Businesses use VPNs to connect to remote data centers.
People who are very concerned about privacy
sometimes use a VPN to connect to a proxy server,
often in another country, so their presence on the web
can be anonymous.
Most laptops and smartphones have the ability
to run their own VPN.
And this is something far more people
could have taken advantage of.
A VPN might be especially good to set up, for example,
if you often log in at coffee shops
in other insecure hot spots.
Places like the national labs, in any case,
want and need connections even more secure
than an ordinary VPN.
So in addition to the normal VPN remote login,
there was also one more step when I worked there.
I had a little device called a token
that created a one-time password.
So when I logged on, I input my password
and then appended onto the end another six digits
that I saw on my token.
The security token changed every minute or so
with a new six digits.
The random numbers on my token were changing
at the same rate as the one at the lab.
So the lab knew at any moment what numbers
I was seeing on my token.
And that kept my password especially secure.
There is a lot of interest in how to increase
the privacy and security of specific databases.
One approach is more use of cryptography.
What works for passwords can be extended to databases
even to the creation of encrypted data.
The technology of HTTPS,
which is used to make commercial websites secure,
can be extended to many other kinds of websites.
Another approach is called differential privacy.
This can be thought of as aiming to solve
the Netflix prize problem
by adding increments of noise to a database.
Work on this has been supported partly by Microsoft.
The idea here is not so much to hide
the information entirely.
