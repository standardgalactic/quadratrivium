Statisticians have been conducting election polls for many decades.
But such polls aren't always accurate, especially for close elections.
But recent data analytics does much better than ordinary polling.
The secret is combining multiple polls.
It turns out that clever aggregation of multiple data sources produces much more accurate predictions.
And that also transforms political campaigns.
To see this, let's go back to the 1920s.
Political predictions at the time were notoriously unreliable and people were looking for new
ideas on how to forecast the upcoming presidential election between Herbert Hoover and Alfred Smith.
Now, a popular magazine of the time was Literary Digest.
And the Digest employed a powerful new tool called a poll to accurately predict Hoover's
landslide victory in 1928. Their poll was also accurately predicted Hoover's demise in 1932.
Then came the next presidential election.
The Republican nominee in 1936 was Kansas Governor Alf Landon.
He was running against first term president Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The Literary Digest predicted Landon would receive 57 percent of the popular vote to
Roosevelt's 43 percent. They came to this conclusion after sending out 10 million surveys
and getting 2.4 million back. FDR, our future four-term president,
won with 62 percent of the popular vote.
So what happened? Why was the Digest so wrong in predicting this election,
especially when it was so accurate in previous ones?
Well, this election occurred in 1936, which put it deep in the shadow of the depression.
As a result, many people were rapidly eliminating luxuries from their lives.
But the Literary Digest got their mailing list for their surveys from telephone directories,
automobile registration records, and their list of subscribers.
And here's the key. Each one of these activities, whether we're talking about using a telephone,
driving a car, or subscribing to magazines, each one of these was considered an unnecessary luxury
