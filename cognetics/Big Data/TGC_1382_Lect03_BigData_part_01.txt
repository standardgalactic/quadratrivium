Why?
Imagine a stadium full of people talking.
What topic are most of the people talking about in that instant?
Proper analysis can enable one to gain insight even within big data.
But how big is big?
When we ask how big is big, it's really a relative term.
A kid who was tall in my elementary school class would be really short relative to Michael
Jordan, and Michael isn't that tall when it comes to all players in the NBA.
The same is true with data.
We may call something big and only mean it in the context of data that in some other
arena might seem small.
Our sense of size changes with time, too.
The Apollo 11 computers were fast and stored a lot of data for the time.
Later during the time of floppy disks holding 1.44 megabytes, a gigabyte seemed about as
remote as the petabyte or exabyte are for many of us today.
When I worked at the national labs, they'd have a new fastest supercomputer every few
years.
I remember how they periodically work at a speed I hadn't heard before, and I'd have
to ask, what does that mean?
So size is relative, and let's just keep in mind as we talk about what's big.
To talk about size, which we began doing in lecture one, we need to talk about how we
measure and have a sense of what each measurement means.
So hold on to your numerical seat belt as we go from small to super large.
A bit is a single binary digit.
It equals zero or one on or off in the hardware.
A bit is a character.
Eight bits makes up a byte.
Ten bytes is a written word.
One kilobyte is equal to 1,000 bytes and equals a short paragraph.
Two kilobytes is equal to a written page.
A megabyte is equal to 1,000 kilobytes and equals a short novel.
