The graph makes such an insight clear.
Notice even more that this data enables one to unfold the story of the game with a graphic
from a rather surprising source.
Finally, let's step beyond the third dimension and graph data in more than 3D.
First let's see how we can graph three dimensions in 2D.
We see this all the time in weather maps.
Think about how weather maps start with 2D spatial data and temperature data on top,
where the temps are represented by color.
Even 4D is possible on a flat map, and again that fourth dimension doesn't have to be
spatial.
Think of those weather maps.
The third dimension was color.
A fourth dimension could be humidity or precipitation or storms.
Circular histograms or rose diagrams are another way to put several dimensions on a single
graph, with each wedge representing one dimension.
Star plots are a cruder version of the same idea, where the result looks like a star instead
of a flower.
One of the more interesting ideas of graphing more than three dimensions is a plot is to
plot data using faces, churnoff faces.
What is a churnoff face?
Really it's more of who is churnoff and what was the face he created.
Herman churnoff invented this graphical technique to display data in the shape of a human face.
A face has eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, of course.
That's four dimensions.
It's almost like a Mr. Potato Head for data visualization, except the data itself determines
what we see.
And it's not just the size of the features.
It can also be the shape, placement, and orientation of the facial features too.
Why bother doing this?
Humans easily recognize faces and notice even small changes without difficulty.
This lets us pack a lot of dimensions into a small graphic that's easy to compare.
Let's try this with some baseball data, looking at managers.
Managers set the line-ups, make calls for hit and runs, and decide which pitching changes
may occur.
Which managers are similar?
Can be hard to say.
