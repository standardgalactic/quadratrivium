That's 20 words.
For verse two, there are two animals.
We have 20 times two words for the animals, which for us was a chick and a pig.
Now how many total words for verse N?
It would be 21 plus 20 N.
Remember though, we are adding these up.
So verse three, reading from verse one through verse three would be 21 plus 20 plus 21 plus
20 times two plus 21 plus 20 times three.
Suppose I do this for 100 verses.
This would be 21 times 100 plus 20 times the quantity one plus two plus three plus four
all the way up to 100.
Now we can write the sum of one through 100 in a clean way.
How do we do that?
Well, we turn to a famous story that this problem was given to in primary school in the
late 1700s as actual punishment.
Think about doing this in elementary school, adding all the numbers between one and a hundred.
This definitely would give a teacher a break, except the young mathematician Carl Friedrich
Gauss was a child in that classroom.
He later became a prominent mathematician with work that is used today in many fields
of mathematics.
Gauss saw a pattern.
Take the numbers one through 100 and under them write the numbers 100 through one.
Now add each column of numbers.
So you are adding 101, which is 101.
When you add 99 and 2, which is 101, that's the key.
You will get 101 in every case, and there are 100 of them.
So the sum of one through 100 and 100 through one is 100 times 101.
That is twice what we need, so summing one through 100 is 50 times 101.
What if I add the integers 1 and 1 through 500?
This would equal 250 times 501.
The formula in general for adding the numbers between 1 and n is n times n plus 1 divided
by 2.
This gives us what we need for old McDonald.
If we read n versus, we will have 21 times n plus 20 times n times n plus 1 divided by
2.
This is a quadratic equation.
So the graph we generated earlier is a parabola.
This is much faster growth than linear.
You can call it parabolic growth, but it's not exponential.
If it isn't exponential, what is?
What does exponential growth look like?
Actually, exponential is difficult to demonstrate in songs, as the growth is so quick.
So let's make up a song, and we'll call it Make It Stop.
Here's the song.
