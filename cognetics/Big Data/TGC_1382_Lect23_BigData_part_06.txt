Things grow a lot if you keep adding to the length of that password.
So really, that's pretty secure.
At least until you come to the passwords a lot of people choose.
IT security consultant Mark Burnett collected and analyzed over 6 million passwords.
Listen to his hit list of top 5 passwords.
Number 1, password, number 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, number 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, number
4, 1, 2, 3, 4, number 5, QWERTY.
OK, but how frequent is frequent here?
Is the most found password really all that prevalent?
Burnett found almost 5% of users had password as their password.
8.5% had password or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
10% of the top had the top 3.
Password or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
14% had one of the top 10 passwords.
40% had one of the top 100 passwords.
79% had one of the top 500 passwords.
And 91% had a password from the top 1,000 passwords.
So think about this.
Out of 6 million collected passwords, over 91% of them
were from a list of just 1,000.
Now, does that sound very secure?
Animals, sports, personal names, and even expletives
are among the most common.
The phrase, let me in, was number 11 on the list.
Changing passwords frequently doesn't
help much, at least not if the password is short or common.
Better is to have a long password, the longer the better.
Experts like Burnett often advise
the use of non-standard spellings, including capital letters
in non-standard ways, also non-letters.
But even a long password does no good if given away.
That's why phishing for passwords is so common.
Spies from China and around the world
create increasingly elaborate deceptions
to try to gain access to passwords.
This more targeted form of phishing
is sometimes called spear phishing.
Similarly, malware goes hunting for passwords
once it gets installed.
So of course, it's a really bad idea
to use the same password across more than one account.
Not all organizations have equally good security.
If your one and only password gets compromised anywhere,
then you've just allowed it to be compromised everywhere.
Passwords are often like keys to the kingdom.
