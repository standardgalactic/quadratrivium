Remember, the goal is to use that data to predict ratings.
So I'm on a couch by the TV and suppose I mentioned enjoying Braveheart.
What can you recommend?
You have a slew of data on me and other users in movies.
One approach is to find the users whose opinion are closest to mine.
What did that person like?
Recommend that movie to me.
If you are trying to predict my rating, what rating did that person give?
That makes sense, but how do we figure out who in the data is most like me?
There are a few ways to do this.
One way is to simply treat the row as a data point in higher dimensional space.
So if you have two data entries per row, then you might have a point like one five and four five.
This puts it in two dimensional space because you have two points.
If you have five entries in a row, then you find the distance between those points in five dimensions.
For our earlier example with two points, you find the distance in two dimensional space.
So let's return to five dimensions.
Suppose you rate movies as four, five, four, two, one.
I rate them as four, three, two, four, one.
Our friend Eric rates them as four, one, four, two, four.
Then you find the distance between your data and mine.
We subtract for each movie, square the result, add up those squares,
and take a square root to get the square root of four minus four squared plus five minus three squared
plus four minus two squared plus two minus four squared plus one one minus one squared,
which is about 3.46.
If you find the distance between my data and Eric's, then you would find the distance to be five.
Another way to measure distance is known as jacquard similarity.
This equals the number of preferences in common divided by the total number of things.
Then the jacquard similarity between you and my moving ratings is two-fifths,
since you and I rated the first and last movies the same.
But the data for you and Eric has a jacquard similarity of three-fifths since you have three ratings the same.
