The team scored 800 runs and allowed 654 runs during the regular season.
So the Pythagorean expectation equals 800 squared divided by the quantity 800 squared plus 654 squared.
Put this into a calculator and you'll find that the A's were expected to win 59.9% of their games.
The team played 162 games in the regular season and 59.9% of 162 is 97.1.
There's some interesting aspects of data analysis here.
First, the Pythagorean expectation didn't quite reach that 99 win threshold.
So how many games did they win?
103.
And as we already mentioned, they made the playoffs.
This is important to remember.
I often note in class that the figure we calculate is a calculated guess.
It's not a crystal ball.
It can be easy as a data analyst to get attached to your computations.
But remember, they give insight, an opinion.
In the case of the A's, they won slightly more games than this Pythagorean expectation calculates.
So the formula wasn't perfect.
Maybe it could be refined.
The important point is that just by using the Pythagorean expectation, the A's got much closer to identifying their own winning formula.
Okay, so now we know that the Pythagorean expectation uncovers a distinctive relationship between wins and runs scored and allowed during a season.
This is something a coach and the players can concentrate on.
But how can we use more data on the players themselves to think about how to reach our target of 99 wins?
In the film, Brand indicates that the team can allow no more than 645 runs, which is nine less than they were allowed that were allowed in the 2002 season.
Taking this number as fixed, how many runs must be scored to reach an expected number of wins greater than or equal to 99?
So let's put these pieces into the Pythagorean expectation formula.
We find 99 over 162 equals x squared divided by the quantity x squared plus 645 squared.
So we get x squared plus 645 squared equals 162 times x squared divided by 99.
Moving the x squared to the same side, we get 63 over 99 times x squared equals 645 squared.
Remember, we're looking for x and we get x equals the square root of 99 over 63 times 645.
That equals 808.55.
This means the team must score more than 808 runs.
So if we know how many runs we need to score and we know the maximum number of runs we can allow, we have a lot of information.
But how do we know who to sign?
