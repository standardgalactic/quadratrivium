Let's return to the point that cluster analysis is a family of methods.
To get a sense of how there may be different ways to group items, consider a graph of pictures
for the New York Mechs.
The horizontal axis represents the number of walks the picture allowed.
The y-axis is the number of strikeouts.
This gives us a pair of points for each picture, which becomes a point on our graph.
So again, each point represents a picture.
So now let's group them.
We actually, even here, have a few choices.
Let's discuss a few of them.
First how many groups?
Two, three, four?
That's a common and very important question in clustering.
Let's go with three.
If we form three groups according to points that are close to each other, using a method
we'll learn later, we'd get this grouping.
So we've grouped.
The algorithm will form groups by math.
So we must first see if we can make sense of how the math grouped.
And second, see if there is something unexpected that the math found.
There's an inherent balance here.
Clustering at its best can discover something surprising.
However, if everything is surprising, it's entirely likely that the method isn't working
well with that set of data.
So you look for another clustering method.
According to our method, is this really how we want to group pictures?
Who's being grouped?
We tend to be grouping pictures who have a large number of strikes and walks together.
This is one way to group them.
If that is our targeted insight, then we have a valuable grouping.
But can we group in another way?
Consider drawing a line from the origin to a point on the graph, rather than asking how
far the points are from each other.
Let's measure the distance as angles between those lines.
If two lines have a small angle between them, then the corresponding points will be considered
close to each other.
We can again cluster.
Now what do we get?
What are we measuring?
We are now measuring which pictures have similar ratios of strikeouts to walks.
