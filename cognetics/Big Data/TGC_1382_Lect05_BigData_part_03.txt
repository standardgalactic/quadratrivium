Why?
There's a formula.
40 times the number of verses I'll read.
If the song had 20 verses, then I'd read 40 times 20 or 800 words.
In general, we can say the number of words in N verses is 40 times N.
If we plot the number of words for each verse, then we begin to see an important part of
its growth.
This is known as linear growth.
We can see it in our formula, 40N.
That's a line.
And that's exactly what we see in the graph.
Let's try another type of song.
What's sometimes called a cumulative song.
Again, I'll speak the words.
Here's verse one.
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
And on his farm, he had some chicks, E-I-E-I-O.
You can probably take it from there.
So if we count E-I-E-I-O as a single word and don't repeat the first line at the end,
then that's 41 words.
Now let's do the second verse to be sure we remember how the song works.
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
And on his farm, he had a pig, E-I-E-I-O.
With an oink, oink here and an oink, oink there.
Here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink, oink.
And with a cluck-cluck here and a cluck-cluck there, and so forth.
This is about 61 words.
So reading the first and second verses has 102 words.
Note, each successive verse is longer than the previous, of course.
Reading verses one through three would have 183 words.
One through four would have 284 words.
We can plot this, and it isn't a line.
But what is it?
Now sometimes people will hastily say this is exponential growth.
News stories often misuse the words, exponential growth.
They grow exponentially.
By that, they tend to mean something is growing quickly, but this is not exponential growth.
Then what is it?
Let's work it out.
Every verse starts with 21 words.
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O, and on his farm he had some chicks, E-I-E-I-O.
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
Then we have the portions related to the animal sounds, like with a cluck-cluck here and a
cluck-cluck there, here a cluck, there a cluck, everywhere a cluck-cluck.
