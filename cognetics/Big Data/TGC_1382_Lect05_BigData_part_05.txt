Verse 1, 0, 1, 2, and you read through the number 9.
So you read the numbers 0 through 9.
Verse 2, read the numbers 0 through 99.
Verse 3, read the numbers 0 through 999.
We will assume one single digit number takes one word to say.
Two digits takes two words to say, and so forth.
So verse 1 has 10 words, the numbers 0 through 9.
Verse 2 has 100 or 10 squared words.
Verse 3 has 1,000 numbers or 10 cubed words.
So if we read verses 1 through 3, then it would take 10 plus 10 squared words plus 10 cubed
words.
Between things general again, what would it take to read N verses?
Well, it would be 10 to the first power plus 10 to the second power plus 10 to the third
plus 10 to the fourth plus all the way up to 10 to the nth power.
Now we're going to call this sum S. You add it all up, and it equals S. So again, S equals
10 to the first plus 10 to the second plus 10 to the third plus 10 to the fourth keeps
summing up until you get 10 to the nth.
Now we're going to do this little trick.
We're going to take 10 times S. What would 10 times S be?
Well, that equals 10 to the second.
Why?
Because we had 10 to the first times 10.
That's 10 to the second.
So we get 10 to the second plus 10 to the third plus 10 to the fourth plus all the way
up until at the end, we would have 10 times 10 to the n, which is 10 times n plus 1.
Now why did we do that?
The reason for doing that is we subtract S from 10 S. So we have 10 S, which again is
10 to the second plus 10 to the third plus 10 to the fourth all the way up to 10 to the
n plus 1 minus S, which equals 10 to the first all the way up through 10 to the n.
10 S minus S is 9 S, simple enough.
And then look at that right hand side.
Look at all of that cancellation that happens.
We do not cancel the last term on 10 S, which is 10 to the n plus 1, and we don't cancel
the first term on S, which is 10 to the first.
Remember, we had 10 S minus S. So this all simplifies to 9 S equals 10 to the n plus 1
minus 10 to the first power.
What does this look like carried out to seven verses?
It's exponential growth.
Note how even plotted on an exponential axis, this looks like nothing's happening for the
first three verses.
There is much happening, but it gets lost in the growth between the sixth and the seventh
verses.
This is characteristic of exponential growth.
Nothing much seems to happen, and suddenly there's a spike.
