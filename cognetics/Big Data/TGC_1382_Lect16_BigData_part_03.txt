transitive.
So if transitivity doesn't always hold, what do we do and what do we do now?
We assume it holds approximately.
If a team wins one game by 61 points and another by 59, then we can approximate with 60.
This is an important point.
It's another lesson of data analytics that I often bring up to students and my researchers.
In data analytics, assumptions are often made.
You assume a property and as long as it is close to holding, insightful information emerges.
Let's see how this assumption leads to a linear system that produces rankings of teams.
Let's look at three teams.
We need a rating for each.
Call team 1x, call team 2y, and call team 3z.
Assume team 1 beats team 2 by 10 points.
The Massey method, as it has become known, writes this as x minus y equals 10.
This means x wins, y loses, and 10 was how much x won by.
So if team 1 has a rating of 13, then x equals 13.
If team 2 has a rating of 3, then y equals 3.
So team 1 would be predicted to beat team 2 by 13 minus 3 or 10 points, which we write
as x minus y, which equals 13 minus 3, equals 10.
Now we don't know the ratings of the teams.
That's what we're trying to find.
But we do know the difference in the points in the games.
So if we have a game where team 1 beat team 2 by 10, then we form the system x minus y
equals 10.
Additionally, team 2 beat team 3 by 5 points, which would give us y minus z equals 5.
Finally, suppose z minus x equals 1.
Who won that game?
Yes, team 3.
We can quickly see that transitivity didn't hold.
Team 1 beat team 2 by 10.
Team 2 beat team 3 by 5.
But team 1 didn't even beat team 3, but instead lost by 1.
So transitivity didn't hold.
That means we won't be able to find values for x, y, and z that exactly solve the linear
system.
In fact, we're going to have quite a few more games than the number of teams.
And for March Madness, we have around 5,000 games and about 350 teams.
This means we have more equations than variables.
If we look at the earlier example from women's basketball, we could say x equals 59 and x
equals 61.
We have two equations with only one variable.
What's x?
