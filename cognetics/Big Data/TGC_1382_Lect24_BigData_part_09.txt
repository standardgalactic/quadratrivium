As you dabble in data analytics, you become able to look at many aspects of life this way.
I find that the best part is to talk with others about what you're thinking.
You're modeling the world, so there are always simplifications.
You aren't looking for the answer and you usually won't perfectly solve it.
But many times, people will give you input and begin noodling over it themselves.
In a sense, it doesn't take much to build your own team of researchers.
You let others know what you're considering and often people start giving input.
And if today's idea is impossible, hang on to it.
New technology, new algorithms, and new data continue to arise.
So keep tabs on that idea you've had.
In my research group, we often circle back to look at ideas that were originally beyond us.
What would you like to understand?
Data analytics is not only for the big companies of the world.
Remember that Google itself began with just two graduate students who had a question
and used analytics, which you now understand, to create an answer.
My hope is that these lectures help you better understand your own interests
and that the tools of data analytics can help you explore paths you would not otherwise take.
Once we find something, like explorers, we plant our stake and we begin exploring even more.
And lastly, share what you find.
You can pursue data analytics on your own, but it is also best as a team sport, no matter what your age.
So I invite everyone to join in, and I hope you will too.
Data analytics is giving us the ability to explore, improve, and enjoy our world as never before.
