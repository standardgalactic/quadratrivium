it won't help on problems that need an answer in minutes or seconds.
Preferences may change over time.
Research on changing preferences help the winners earn the Netflix prize.
First, viewers tend to rate movies differently depending on the day of the week.
Some users are in good moods on Sundays, for example.
Second, some movies rate better immediately while others rate better in hindsight.
When the Netflix prize competition was announced,
initial work quickly led to improvement over existing recommendation systems.
It didn't reach the magic 10% at that point,
but the strides were impressive nonetheless.
The key was using linear algebra, specifically a technique called the singular value decomposition.
This is often called the SVD.
It helps to understand how this method works and particularly why it works.
It is helpful also to see the SVD in the context of data compression.
The idea in data compression is expressing a lot of data by less.
Let me just say up front that even many practicing researchers using the SVD
haven't studied the underlying mathematics.
It's often not covered even in advanced courses on advanced data analysis.
But here's the basic idea.
We take our matrix of data and split it into a product of three different matrices.
There are many different ways we could do that.
What is great about the SVD is that it's a method where all three of its component matrices
retain valuable information.
Even more specifically, the information is spread across three matrices
in a way that we need to pull a little information from each to get a good result.
The result is almost like magic.
The actual decomposition of the SVD is a bit like factory numbers.
You remember that, right? The prime factors of 315 are 3 squared times 5 times 7.
We can say that we decompose the number 315 into its prime factors.
When we decompose a matrix, the feel is similar, but the result is much more complicated.
