Most people are geographically close to many of their active friends.
So Facebook can look at your connections to people with known addresses.
Then they can weight the importance of the edges by how recently and
how much you and someone have been active.
Address is not all that can be predicted.
Students at MIT demonstrated that sexual orientation in religion
could also be identified by Facebook, even when such preferences weren't mentioned.
How?
Again, by looking at the links to people for whom such details are known.
One surprise from the study of networks is that on average,
your friends have more friends than you do.
Said a bit more technically, the average number of friends of friends
is always greater than the average number of friends of individuals.
This comes from a 1991 paper of Scott Feld of the State University of New York at
Stony Brook.
It offers an interesting insight on friendships.
Ever feel like your friends have more friends than you?
They do.
They should.
The same is generally true for them, too.
How can this be true?
It seems wrong.
Like a paradox.
In fact, it is called the friendship paradox.
While it may seem wrong, it is a case where our intuition can learn from analysis.
Let's take a look at a network of friends.
We'll put me in the middle and see this where my network of friends and
how this would be true.
I've chosen a small group of friends.
The same result would be true with a large number of friends.
But let's see this paradox shed its light here.
I know the most people since this is my group of friends.
I have three friends.
Ann is just friends with me.
Pam and Tom both have two friends.
This adds up to eight.
With four people, this means we have an average of eight divided by four or
two friends per person.
So this is the average number of friends mentioned in the friendship paradox.
This is supposed to be smaller than the average number of friends of friends.
Ann's friend, me, has three friends.
