We don't get only prime numbers.
Instead, the numbers in a matrix decomposition can be any numbers.
So when you see the result of a decomposition, it's not possible to see at a glance that you've made any progress at all.
But you've made a lot of progress.
The outputs can look a little strange, and the math underlying those outputs is too complicated to explain right now.
But the results are worth it.
Just trust me on this one.
The SVD is a powerful, powerful tool.
It even has interesting theoretical properties to it.
But what's important is to be able to see it and to use it, not necessarily to understand everything about how it's derived or computed.
So we'll assume we have a matrix calculator that has an SVD button.
Given a matrix, hit that SVD button, and it gives you the singular value decomposition.
So what is this decomposition?
The SVD is defined by three matrices and can be found for any matrix.
It does not have to be a square matrix, such as 3 by 3 or 4 by 4.
Suppose we have a matrix with four rows and three columns.
Let's call it B.
Then the program that computes the SVD would return three matrices.
The first is U, which has the same number of rows and columns as B.
Four rows, three columns.
The second matrix is called sigma.
This is the singular values, and that's where they're located.
Here, the sigma matrix would have three rows and columns and be zero everywhere except on the main diagonal.
Those diagonal elements are called the singular values.
They'll be directly important to us a bit later.
Finally, there is V.
It would also have three rows and three columns.
It's a decomposition, so the product of U times sigma times V equals B.
Okay, we have the singular value decomposition, but what do we do with it?
Remember, one application is data compression.
