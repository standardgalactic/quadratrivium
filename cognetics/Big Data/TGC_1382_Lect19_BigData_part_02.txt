So if you choose someone else to go to a movie with, it would be Eric.
Note that this captured that you and Eric rated two movies with fours and one with a two.
So you have things you like and dislike.
Note, these two distant measures are different.
So you'd want to think carefully about what they both mean in terms of the question you're asking.
For instance, jacquard only considers when ratings are exactly the same.
Any other ratings are ignored, whether they're close or not.
Measuring distance like this can have another problem.
Suppose we are looking at data that has age and political stance.
Imagine that as you get older, you become more conservative.
If that's true, then when we count agreement in two people by age and by politics, then we'd be double counting.
This leads to overfitting in bad performance.
To help with this, we need to reduce what is called the dimension of the problem.
We need to get rid of such redundancies.
Before we do though, let's see how hard this can be.
Remember, Netflix was willing to pay a million dollars to improve an existing system.
So it isn't all that surprising that this can get tricky.
So here are some potential hurdles.
Some features are more informative than others.
Maybe my age has little or nothing to do with whether I like a particular item.
Maybe being male correlates a lot.
Generally, there is a lot of missing data.
For example, the Netflix data set had nearly 18,000 movies,
but the average number of reviews per person was only 200 movies.
So most movies are going to have a lot of missing values.
People who are very similar might have very few overlapping items.
Measurement error.
People may lie.
Remember our earlier lecture on complexity in computation.
If we have a great method, but it takes a month,
