We'll look at American League baseball teams in 1920, and we'll focus on the number of
home runs.
We can look at the numbers and see that Boston had 22, Chicago 37, and so forth.
But let's graph it.
Now we see instantly that the New York Yankees had more than double any other team in the
American League.
The graph quickly enables us to see the difference in magnitude, but we don't see why this happened.
So let's change the data we're looking at.
Now we will graph the number of home runs hit by every player in the American League
in 1920.
That's over 250 baseball players.
You can page through them and look for anything.
Or you can graph it.
Take a look.
Notice that big spike?
Who was that?
That's Babe Ruth, the original home run king.
This graph helps us see the amazing feat of Babe Ruth's record-setting performance in
1920.
There truly was, Babe, and everyone else.
In 1920, Babe Ruth smacked 54 home runs.
That was more than any other team in the American League that season.
These two ways of graphing home runs point to an important general process in data visualization.
You have your data, then you often need to transform the data.
For baseball, we looked at the numbers of home runs for the team, but also the players.
Same data, two different ways of looking at it.
Then you visualize it.
With that, you can analyze and interpret what you see.
Keep in mind that sometimes this leads to wanting to look at the data in a new way.
We move to individual home run totals.
Then you visualize again and analyze your new results.
In this way, you create a cycle that allows you to gain more insight.
William S. Cleveland of Bell Labs in 1993 wrote a book, Visualizing Data, and he declared
that visualization provides a front line of attack, revealing intricate structure and
data that cannot be absorbed in any other way.
Again, data visualization can help explore data, but it only begins the process.
