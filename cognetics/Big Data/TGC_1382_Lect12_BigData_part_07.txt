How?
First, you press the clean button.
Roomba's first inputs are to calculate the size of the room through its sensors.
The bigger the room, the longer it is going to take to clean it.
Keep in mind, we're talking anyone's room, not just an empty room.
Second, the system adapts to new input up to 67 times per second.
Much faster than the quarter second, it takes us to blink.
That could be as many as 4,020 adaptations in one minute.
For instance, Roomba can avoid steps with four infrared sensors.
These cliff sensors constantly send out infrared signals.
If the robot is approaching a cliff, those signals get lost.
But then, don't keep going.
If it bumps into something, it backs up, rotates, and moves forward.
It keeps doing that until it finds a clear path.
There is another sensor.
It keeps track of walls so it could follow along them closely.
That sensor allows it to keep close to walls or furniture without touching them.
And finally, regardless of where you put the couch or move the couch for that matter,
the robot determines its own cleaning path that achieves complete floor coverage.
Roomba generally isn't as efficient as we would be.
It takes longer to vacuum.
But we aren't doing the vacuuming either.
Keep in mind, though, Roomba runs off its rechargeable battery.
What if you have a big room?
Our rechargeable robot will return and connect to the charger all by itself.
Roomba was introduced in 2002 and sold millions of units in its first decade.
Do you like vacuuming, but don't do windows?
There's now a robot for that, too.
There is another that will mop your floors.
What all these robots have in common is the ability to take continuous inputs from the
environment and develop an algorithm for cleaning that environment on the spot.
Does the Roomba learn from previous cleanings?
No, not so far.
In that way, a Roomba is like a handheld version of 20Q.
If Roombas did have internet connectivity,
then they could share information and learn from one another.
