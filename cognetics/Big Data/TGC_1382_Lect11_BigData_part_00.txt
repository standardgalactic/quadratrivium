A big, big part of data analysis is predicting future outcomes by studying the past.
And we predict where possible by describing a perceived trend with a formula.
The formula might be linear, exponential, parabolic, and so on, but whatever the formula,
it's rare to exactly match the data.
Even so, a formula can be close to the data and capture enough of its essence to give
insight on what might happen in the future.
In this lecture, we look at the power of predicting data just by using equations of lines.
In this sense, we are modeling life as if it were linear.
Let's start by jumping, or in this case running, straight into an application.
In 2012, Usain Bolt electrified the Olympic track and field stadium in London as he won
a second consecutive gold medal in the 100-meter dash.
That race is a premier track and field event of the Summer Olympics.
The winner is crowned the fastest human alive.
This was Bolt's second time to win this title.
In 2008, Bolt ran the fastest 100-meter dash in the Olympics ever.
No other Olympic gold medalist could have beaten him until he ran even faster in 2012.
Turning to data, there have been 28 gold medalists in the 100-meter dash between 1896
and 2012.
Some quick arithmetic shows that there haven't been summer games every four years in that
period.
World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 games.
So we have 28 times that led to gold medals in Olympic games.
One important part of data analysis is to begin by getting familiar with the data, even
before you try to answer specific questions.
So let's look at these times.
The slowest time was Tom Burke's 12-second sprint to gold in 1896.
The fastest was Usain Bolt in 2012.
In fact, in most of the Olympic games, the gold medal time is faster than the previous
Olympic winning time.
Keep in mind, all these times are fast.
Bolt ran 100 meters in 9.69 in 2008 and 9.63 in 2012.
It takes 400 milliseconds or 0.4 seconds to blink an eye.
So Bolt beats his own time by less than the blink of an eye in 2012 versus 2008.
The difference between Bolt's times in 2008 and 2012 was actually about a tenth of the
time needed to blink.
So what happens in the blink of an eye in such a race?
To help answer this, we can look to Carl Lewis's 1984 run, which only took 9.99 seconds.
This was about a blink of an eye slower than Bolt's 2012 race.
