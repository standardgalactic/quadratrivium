Do you find yourself looking for why these may be connected?
Maybe they are, but again, maybe they're not.
It's in our nature to find the connection, real or not.
And this ability is what lets us take surprising correlations from data analysis and find those
impressive connections.
Beware of just rushing in where angels fear to tread.
Some of those connections are real, and because of that, we will continue to see them.
Stop athletes and investors and researchers will continue to look for patterns to improve
their performance.
What connections do you see?
They may be a pattern, and they may just be your nature hardwired into you to look for
such a pattern.
In data analysis, we look for patterns in data.
As people, we are good at it, but sometimes we are good at finding something that isn't
there.
It's an ever-present balance.
As we look and find correlated data, be careful.
First, look in both directions, and see if you can think of why one might cause the other.
Maybe causality is there, but it goes in the opposite direction from what you expected.
Second, like warm weather explaining shark attacks and ice cream consumption, check to
see whether something else offers a better explanation.
And lastly, always keep in mind that it might just be our hardwired ability that's leading
you to expect something that isn't there.
We all love an interesting pattern, especially if it comes from a plausible story.
The difference in good data analysis is we don't stop there.
Finding a pattern is a great start, but remember, as data analysts, it's just the beginning.
