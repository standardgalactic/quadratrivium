Again, think back to endorsement.
And we can put it in the analogy that we had for high school.
Not feeling cool?
Get the super cool kid to say you're cool,
and your coolness shoots up.
If you can get web pages with high PageRank to link to yours,
then your PageRank rises.
So some companies go into business offering to help raise your PageRank.
One way is by developing pages with high PageRank.
Then, for a fee, they link to yours.
Link farms are created by what are called spammers
to essentially full search engines like Google
and raise the rank of a website.
Generally, a link farm has several interconnected websites
about a popular topic and with significant PageRanks.
The interconnected nodes then link to a client's page.
When Google figures out that a site sells links,
then their PageRank gets hit.
For instance, in 2007, Google decided
some web pages were selling links and lowered their rankings.
Keep in mind that PageRank was given a value from 0 to 10.
Now listen to the list.
WashingtonPost.com went from a PageRank of 7 to 5.
Forbes.com also went from 7 to 5.
StatCounter.com went from 10 to 6.
SunTimes.com went from 7 to 5.
Again, it isn't illegal to do this,
but if you're caught, Google can penalize you.
Is this fair?
It can have a major impact on your business.
That's exactly what created a legal stir in 2002 and 2003.
Searchking.com had high PageRank and was sharing it
with its clients.
Suddenly, in August 2002, it dropped from 8 to 4
and then from 2 to 0.
0.
Its clients' PageRanks dropped 2 and they moved on.
So on October 17, 2002, Searchking sued Google for $75,000
and for restoration of its and its clients' PageRank.
This case would set the precedent for such actions.
On May 27, 2003, the court ruled against Searchking.
The court ruled that PageRank is essentially
a matter of opinion.
If you think about it, we choose to listen to that opinion
or we don't.
Data is an opinion.
So yes, one can sell links or pay to improve a web page's
search engine ranking.
But you risk the wrath of Google.
