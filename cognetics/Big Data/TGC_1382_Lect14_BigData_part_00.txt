Sometimes we have too many possibilities to consider, and sometimes phenomena are simply
too difficult to capture in an equation.
For instance, before a nuclear bomb was created, scientists wanted to test their ideas without
exploding a bomb.
Today, someone might want to test the aerodynamics of a car, or a new surgical procedure.
How do you test a car without driving, or a surgical procedure without operating?
You can simulate it.
Simulation is a powerful idea.
It's one of my favorites, and I'm surprised it's not better known.
In many cases, rather than analyzing lots of data, you can produce a simulation and analyze
what that says about a physical phenomenon.
This tool of data analytics allows us to make better medicines, faster cars, and explore new
realms of scientific study, all with the speed and safety of a computer.
Simulation is used in many more areas, too.
To get a sense, let's visit the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.
It's a tournament that begins with thousands of competitors, and narrows down to the final
two sitting at a table with hundreds of thousands of viewers tuned in to see the outcome.
The winner is considered the world champion of poker, and receives a multi-million dollar cash prize.
When the game is broadcast on ESPN, a card is dealt, and quickly the probability of each
player winning, given the current hand, is updated.
Let's turn to our data analytics and think about how this is done.
So could there be a big database of all possible combinations?
In that case, a card is dealt, and someone looks up the probabilities for that given state of the
game. Consider how big such a database would need to be, and consider how fast we want our answer.
Let's look at the simplest states of a game. We'll have two players using a fresh deck of 52 cards.
The cards are dealt, from the 52 cards, five are chosen for the first hand, and from the
