But in other cases, people find connections that do not offer the level of insight touted.
And the increasingly powerful tools of data analysis and data visualization now make it
easier than ever to over-present the results of a study.
It is very important to keep in mind that our tendency to essentially over-explain and
over-predict what we find is ever present in us.
Indeed, scientists are finding this to be hardwired into the human brain.
Psychologists have long known that if rats and pigeons knew what their NASDAQ is, they
might be better investors than most humans are.
How?
In many ways, animals are better predictors than people when random events are involved.
People keep looking for higher-order patterns and thinking they see one.
Here's the sort of experiment that has been done.
Set up two lights and flash them in a random sequence.
People tend to try and predict which of the two lights will flash next.
It's random.
Randomness means you can't predict it.
But we keep trying.
In fact, you can even tell a person that the flashing lights are random.
But they still look for a pattern to predict the next flash.
Indeed, looking for patterns is something we keep doing and doing and doing, even if
they aren't there.
Even if somehow we know they aren't there.
Returning to our table of lights.
We want a random sequence.
So we roll a die.
Roll a one, flash the red light.
Any other number, flash the green light.
A series of flashes could be GGG-RGG or GGG-GGG or GGG-RRG.
Looking for a pattern?
There is one, 83% of the time green will flash.
But that doesn't mean, just as we saw, that every one out of six times it will flash red.
So what will flash next?
You don't know exactly.
You only know it's more likely to be green.
Rats and pigeons generally notice which color appears most.
The best strategy is to pick green.
And they do.
In 83% of the time, they get a reward of food.
What about humans?
