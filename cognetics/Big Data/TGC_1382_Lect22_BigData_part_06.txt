So five degrees of separation.
We get from Babe Ruth to Barry Vons with four intermediate players,
which took us from 1919 to 1986.
Note, as with movie actors, this isn't the only route.
But let's look at the big picture.
So if we go all the way back to include professional teams of the 19th century,
who is the historical center of the baseball universe?
Minnie Minoso, he was also known as the Cuban Comet.
He played left field and third base.
He signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1948 and played his first game on April 19, 1949.
He played for the Indians, White Sox, Senators, and Cardinals.
His final game at age 54 was on October 5, 1980.
His career spanned 32 years.
His average distance is 3.0072.
The least linkable, shortstop and third baseman, Ed Duffy.
His first game was on May 8, 1871 for the White Stockings.
His career spanned only 175 days.
His average distance is 6.8802.
So six degrees of separation holds pretty well inside the history of U.S. professional baseball.
Finally, let's see the most linkable of active players at least at the time of this recording.
Outfielder Manny Ramirez, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the 1991 amateur draft.
He debuted on September 2, 1993.
The average distance, 3.7970.
But it appears we have five degrees of separation between Manny Ramirez and Babe Ruth.
Babe Ruth with Lou Gehrig in the 1928 New York Yankees.
Lou Gehrig with Joe Gordon, 1939 New York Yankees.
Gordon with Minnie Minoso, 1949 Cleveland Indians.
Minoso with Harold Baines, 1980 Chicago White Sox.
Baines with Manny Ramirez, 1999 Cleveland Indians.
So we need only four other players to get from Babe Ruth to Manny Ramirez.
But there's an old saying that who your friends are says a lot about you.
That's especially true in data analysis.
Your Facebook friends can indicate where you are from.
That's important to Facebook as they can provide ads and services in your area.
But only about 6% of users enter their address.
So how does Facebook know your address by pictures?
Maybe they're working hard on facial recognition.
But what about your posts?
They probably do use that.
But what's interesting is that they can already connect you to locations,
but just by using those 6% of known addresses.
