Amazing and fun to consider.
But this isn't just a story.
In 2013, Amazon announced its research using drones or automated flying helicopters to deliver packages.
You may make an order.
Then about 30 minutes later, it lands on your doorstep.
Keep in mind, there is a lot of logistics here.
You need to think about the placement of the drones in the shipping centers.
Like air traffic control, we'd need to think how the paths of such drones might collide and to stay free of each other.
But Amazon has lots of experience with logistics.
Think of the impact.
Suddenly, you could remember a birthday and order something an hour before the party and have it in your hand as you arrive.
What do you see as a need around you?
Where does data seem unruly?
Where do you need better decisions?
Where could you get access to data that might contain insight?
What insights would be genuinely valuable?
Answers to these questions could predict the next area of innovation.
These could be the next advances, large or small.
My students have helped design the layout of a food pantry for the hungry.
They've helped design software that places students into preferred internship programs.
One student analyzed his own music collection and another began looking at her father's business.
What about you?
Have you been thinking of a challenge where data analytics might help?
Probably the biggest thing I love about data analytics is that when I'm first confronted with a problem,
I have no idea how to do it.
It doesn't mean I can't.
It just means I don't know yet.
This can be quite fun.
It's like the snowboarder problem.
You can find ways to bring in data analytics, maybe with help, no matter what the question is.
You just dig in and create an answer and then try something else.
