and then sat and sat waiting to see if you're needed or you're not?
In Norristown, Pennsylvania, a neural network was introduced early
to help dramatically reduce the number of jurors called for potential service by 25 to 40%.
Using over a year's worth of past information about the courthouse,
a neural network was trained.
For input, it took the data that included dates, judges, types of cases,
and the number of jurors needed at a particular courthouse.
Then, the neural network determines the number of jurors needed
for the next day at a specific courthouse.
The savings, $40,000 per year, even in the early 1990s.
In the last lecture, we discussed regression and learned that logistic regression
can be applied to handwriting.
Well, since 2009, a research group has won multiple international competitions
in connected handwriting recognition.
This is cursive handwriting.
In each case, they don't have any prior knowledge about the language.
They have to have a computer learn on the spot.
The languages have been French, Arab, and Farsi.
How has the team won?
You got it.
Neural networks throw a lot of Farsi characters at their program,
and it learns and does better than other programs and methods designed to read handwriting.
Remember, this is a competition specifically for handwriting,
so even a doctor's scribble wouldn't be overlooked.
Google is using neural networks in their X laboratory,
which is perhaps most known for inventing a self-driving car and augmented reality glasses.
But the X lab also created one of the largest neural networks.
It connects 16,000 computer processors.
What's its input?
The internet.
Their neural network was presented with 10 million digital images found in YouTube videos.
Remember, you need a clear goal.
What's its goal?
Find cats.
They never told it during the training what a cat is.
Amazingly, the neural network learns.
