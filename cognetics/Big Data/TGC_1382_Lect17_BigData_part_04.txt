Earlier, I found web page four was the highest quality
and then I found web page one if I surfed more.
I just said you most certainly would find web page one
had the highest quality if you surfed a million steps.
How did I know that?
Wait a minute.
How do I know that for any configuration of the web,
this idea is actually going to work
that eventually the numbers will settle down?
Could things simply end up being chaotic?
In different web pages are visited most
if you surf one million times versus two million times.
A nice feature of Brandon Page's algorithm
is that it will converge for any network,
anything at all, ever created.
We'll talk about this more in a bit.
We need to learn one more piece of the page rank puzzle.
For this, let's surf under this model on another network.
How about this one?
Now, what would you find?
Feel free to try it.
You may simply by looking be able to identify
that web page six causes a problem, a big problem.
There are no links from that web page.
Such web pages are called dangling nodes.
If you ended up at a web page with no links on it,
what would you do?
PDF files, movie files and music files
are often dangling nodes.
Well, if you're out that type of page,
you either input a new web address or hit the back button.
Currently, our model assumes you're stuck.
It's almost as if you give up
and simply close the browser as if there's nowhere to go.
We don't do that.
It's like we hit a PDF file and think,
oh my, I must close my browser
and start surfing all over again.
I hate it when this happens.
That's silly, it's ridiculous.
So Google, of course, assumes we go somewhere else.
Again, they need a model that represents what we do.
So where do we go?
Again, that is assumed to be a random choice.
You go anywhere on the internet with equal probability.
This relates to the final aspect of the algorithm.
We don't always follow links on web pages.
Sometimes we simply decide to go somewhere else.
Brennan Page called this teleporting.
