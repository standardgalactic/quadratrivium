How do we know?
I didn't.
The data told us.
OK, let's ask a different question.
How often does a player go out on that very next pitch?
Again, we looked at the data.
From here, we see that the average professional batter with no balls and two strikes gets
out on the very next pitch .75 times .844 plus .25 times .6, which equals .783 or about
78% of the time.
That's what a player trying to showboat like Casey would be up against.
Keep in mind more pitches will come if the batter does not swing and if the pitch was
a ball, which happens .4 times .25, which equals .1 or 10% of the time.
But that's not what Casey did.
He took a swing.
And while Casey might have been a great hitter, intentionally taking two strikes gave a really
high likelihood of there being no joy in Mudville that day.
He should have looked at the probabilities.
Decision trees can enable us to combine results to answer new questions or use probabilities
from a large data set to study particular cases.
They can also uncover information that potentially tells us a story.
Let's use the data to see the story behind this headline.
Yes, the Titanic.
It set sail on April 10, 1912.
There were 2,224 passengers and crew that set sail on April 10 from Southampton, England,
headed to New York City.
Of that, 711 survived.
The Titanic was the largest ship in the world at over 882 feet in length and 92 feet in
breadth.
Her gross tonnage was over 46,000 tons.
Four days into the journey, about 20 minutes before midnight, the Titanic was sailing about
400 miles south of Newfoundland.
The ship received six warnings of sea ice, but was traveling near her maximum speed when
she sighted the iceberg, unable to turn quickly enough.
The ship suffered a glancing blow just before midnight.
The impact buckled the ship's starboard side and opened five of her 16 compartments to
the sea.
Now, the Titanic had been designed to stay afloat with four flooded compartments, but
not more.
