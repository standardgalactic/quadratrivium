1. **Research Findings**: A study investigating the brain regions involved in relative pitch processing, which is the ability to understand the relationship between pitches in music, revealed unexpected activity in the parietal lobe's intraparietal sulcus (IPS), an area typically associated with visual spatial processing and visually-guided tasks like reaching and grasping.

2. **Unexpected Involvement**: The IPS's involvement in relative pitch processing was not predicted by the researchers but was supported by compelling evidence, including the correlation between the degree of activity in this region and individuals' performance on relative pitch tasks.

3. **Complementary Studies**: Earlier studies with patients had identified the right auditory cortex as important for perceiving the direction of pitch change between two tones, supporting the role of higher-order auditory processing in relative pitch perception.

4. **Network Engagement**: The study suggests that relative pitch perception is not a standalone process but part of a network involving both right auditory cortex and right parietal cortex, including the IPS. This highlights the complex nature of cognitive tasks in the brain, which often involve multiple regions working together.

5. **Brain Networks and Musicality**: The involvement of the IPS in musical tasks indicates that musicality extends beyond auditory areas to engage networks involved in various sensory and cognitive processes. This underscores the multimodal nature of music perception and its deep connections with other aspects of cognition.

6. **Multimodal Associations**: Recent research shows that listeners can associate pitch contours with imagined physical movements, suggesting a strong link between auditory processing and other brain functions like motor planning.

7. **Historical Context and Future Prospects**: The power of music to connect sound processing with diverse brain systems may be one reason for its enduring appeal throughout human history. This capacity could also explain the rich mental experiences that music evokes, from ancient times to future encounters with humanity's musical legacy, like the record on the Voyager spacecraft.

In summary, relative pitch perception in music is a complex cognitive process that recruits brain networks extending beyond traditional auditory regions, involving areas associated with spatial processing and motor planning. This interconnection of systems contributes to the richness and depth of musical experience across different contexts and over human history.

 The discussion revolves around the relationship between music and biological evolution, exploring how cultural practices can influence genetic changes over time. The classic view, known as adaptationism, posits that certain traits evolve because they confer a survival or reproductive advantage. However, the invention of musical behavior might not have been an adaptation per se but rather an innovative human activity that became widespread due to its benefits, much like the control of fire.

The essay by the author in 2010 suggests that music could have originated as a cognitive capability that was later universalized across cultures for reasons unrelated to biological evolution, such as emotional expression, ritualistic purposes, and memory retention. This perspective is known as the non-adaptationist view of music's origins.

Recently, the author has been inspired by Richard Rangham's ideas on how cooking (controlled fire) influenced human evolution by making food more digestible, leading to a reallocation of energy resources that could have facilitated an increase in brain size—an example of gene-culture co-evolution.

The author then considers whether the invention of music could also have led to biological changes due to regular musical behavior. This idea is supported by the unique feature of music that involves synchronized, simultaneous rhythmic actions among individuals, which might promote social bonding and thus could have resulted in brain specializations for such coordination.

The recent shift in research on music and evolution has moved from theoretical discussions to empirical studies. Scientists are now investigating these relationships through experimental methods, aiming to understand how music as a cultural practice might have influenced human biology. The theories range from music being an adaptation that evolved because of its benefits, to it being an invention that became widespread for reasons other than biological evolution, to the idea that musical behavior and genetic changes co-evolved over time.

In summary, the relationship between music and evolution is complex and multifaceted. It involves not only how musical behaviors might have influenced human biology but also how cultural inventions can lead to long-term genetic adaptations through a process of gene-culture co-evolution. This interplay between culture and genetics has significant implications for understanding the origins and functions of music in human societies.

1. A study from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology investigated how musical activities, particularly those involving synchronized rhythmic movement, might influence pro-social behavior in four-year-old children. The study involved two conditions: one where children engaged in singing and drumming together while waking up wooden frogs, and another where they excitedly made the frogs jump without singing or drumming synchronously.

2. After the musical activity, the experimenter left the room, leaving behind toys that were designed to test the children's helpfulness—specifically, a tube with marbles that was rigged to break and spill the marbles when one child picked it up.

3. The findings revealed that children who had participated in the synchronized musical activity were significantly more likely to help their partner pick up the spilled marbles than those who had engaged in the non-musical activity.

4. In a follow-up test with another cooperative toy, children who had sung and drummed together also showed a stronger tendency to play cooperatively rather than independently.

5. These results suggest that joint synchronization to a beat can promote pro-social behavior and cooperation, potentially due to social bonding and the release of endorphins.

6. The study's findings have implications for education, indicating that group music-making could be beneficial for promoting cooperation and helpfulness in children, skills that are crucial in various aspects of life.

7. Additional research by Ian Cross et al. at Cambridge University supports the idea that long-term musical training in children can enhance empathy, further reinforcing the link between music and pro-social behavior.

8. The study underscores the importance of basic scientific inquiry into seemingly abstract topics like the origins of music, as it can lead to insights with real-world applications and practical implications.

1. Music can express emotions through various mechanisms, some of which are more universally understood across cultures than others. Acoustic cues that mimic emotional vocalizations and patterns of tension and resolution have a more cross-cultural consistency due to their deeper roots in our shared biology.

2. Conventional associations between musical elements and emotions, such as the use of minor keys to convey sadness or seriousness, are learned and can vary across different cultural contexts.

3. Emotional expression in music is not a single phenomenon but involves multiple layers, including:
   - Acoustic cues that resonate with human vocal expressions of emotion.
   - Nonverbal behaviors in music that mirror expressive human actions.
   - Patterns of tension and resolution that create a sense of emotional narrative over time.
   - Conventional associations between musical elements and emotions, which are learned and can differ across cultures.

4. The idea that music is the universal language of emotion is an oversimplification. While some aspects of musical expression are indeed universal, others rely heavily on cultural conventions and learning.

5. The emotional communication in music is complex and involves a combination of innate biological responses to acoustic cues and learned cultural associations with certain musical elements and structures.

1. **Brain Imaging Studies**: These studies have shown that emotional responses to music involve multiple brain regions beyond just the nucleus accumbens. Key areas include the amygdala, insula, hippocampal formation, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior parietal operculum, and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as auditory regions.

2. **Emotion-Evoking Mechanisms**: Music activates these areas not just in healthy individuals but also in patients with brain damage, indicating a causal role in the emotional experience of music. This confirms that multiple emotion systems are engaged by music.

3. **Loss of Emotional Response to Music**: Case studies of individuals with frontotemporal lobar degeneration who have lost their ability to respond emotionally to music illustrate the importance of these brain regions for emotional sensitivity to music.

4. **Correlational Nature of Brain Imaging**: The correlation between brain activity and psychological phenomena, like emotional responses to music, does not necessarily imply causation.

5. **Multiple Mechanisms for Emotional Responses in Music**: Music leverages various emotion systems, some of which are specific to music (like rhythmic containment) and others that are more general and used by animals for survival (like brainstem reflexes or episodic memory).

6. **Why We Are Attracted to Music**: The power of music may lie in its ability to activate multiple distinct emotion systems simultaneously, connecting abstract cognitive processing with ancient survival mechanisms, leading to complex emotional experiences that are deeply valuable to humans.

In summary, music's capacity to evoke strong emotions is due to its ability to engage a variety of brain regions and psychological mechanisms that are fundamental to our perception, memory, and emotional experience. This multifaceted engagement is what makes music such a powerful and significant aspect of human culture and mental life.

1. Musical timbre plays a crucial role in our ability to recognize sound sources quickly, which is an inherited skill that we use when listening to music.

2. Carol Lynn Krumhansel's study in 2010 demonstrated that college undergraduates could identify the artist and title of songs with surprising accuracy from just 400 milliseconds (half a second) of audio, suggesting that timbre is a powerful identifier in musical memory.

3. Emotional responses to music can be rapidly elicited, even from very short clips. A study by Immanuel Begand and colleagues in 2005 showed that listeners could accurately categorize their emotional responses to purely instrumental music clips that were one second long.

4. The quick recognition of emotions and timbre in music likely has evolutionary roots, as our early mammalian ancestors needed to quickly identify sounds for survival and respond with appropriate emotions.

5. Timbre's role in musical perception is a testament to the evolutionary importance of sound source identification, which has been refined over millions of years into a sophisticated auditory system capable of appreciating complex musical experiences.

6. As a takeaway, listeners can experiment with their favorite pieces of music at home to experience how quickly they react emotionally to timbre and other elements of the music. This emotional response is a legacy of our evolutionary past.

1. The song illusion involves hearing a spoken phrase as a sung melody when it is repeated, due to the listener's psychological interpretation rather than any change in the acoustic properties of the sounds. This phenomenon was first described by Deutsch and colleagues in a scientific paper in 2011.

2. Not all phrases trigger the song illusion; those that do seem to share certain pitch and rhythm patterns that may engage similar cognitive processes involved in musical perception. The exact nature of what makes these phrases more susceptible to transformation is still under investigation.

3. Musical scales across different cultures, despite their diversity, often have between five to seven notes per octave, which suggests that this is a cognitive rather than sensory limit. This reflects how humans process and track pitches in a melody.

4. Western music psychology has long sought to find universal scale structures based on acoustics and hearing, but cultural variation in scales is evident, with the Javanese gamelan scales serving as an example of this diversity.

5. The octave and perfect fifth are almost universally used in musical scales, indicating a possible biological basis for these intervals, beyond which there is more cultural variation.

6. Human cultures universally use musical scales to create melodies, similar to how all human languages use a limited set of phonemes to construct sentences. This suggests a common cognitive framework underlying both language and music processing.

7. The acoustic realization of both phonemes in speech and pitch intervals in melody can vary depending on context and emotional expression, indicating a deep connection between language and music cognitively.

8. In the next lecture, evidence will be presented that suggests music and language are indeed closely related in terms of cognitive processing, despite their different forms and functions.

1. **Historical Context**: The concept of prediction and its role in brain function has been recognized for decades, with neuroscientist Karl Lashley and musician-scientist Leonard Meyer exploring the idea that expectation plays a crucial role in the perception of music and art in the mid-20th century.

2. **Modern Cognitive Neuroscience**: Today, prediction error is a key concept in cognitive neuroscience, where the brain is thought to constantly predict incoming sensory information and adjust accordingly. When predictions are incorrect, it can lead to learning and adaptation.

3. **Expectation and Prediction in Music**: In music, expectation is formed based on schematic knowledge (general patterns of western music) and veridical knowledge (specific knowledge of a piece). Jamshed Bharucha highlighted the distinction between these two types of expectations.

4. **Emotional Response to Music**: When expectations are thwarted or fulfilled in unexpected ways, it can lead to emotional responses. For example, a deceptive cadence in music—where the expected tonic chord is replaced by another—can evoke an emotional reaction due to its surprise, even if the piece is familiar.

5. **David Huron's ITPRA Theory**: Music psychologist David Huron's ITPRA theory describes the interplay of several cognitive processes involved in musical expectation: Imagination, Tension, Prediction, Reaction, and Appraisal. These processes work together to create a dynamic and fleeting emotional experience.

6. **Dynamic Emotions in Music**: The emotions evoked by music through the fulfillment or thwarting of expectations are dynamic and temporal, making them a nuanced and integral part of our musical experiences. Unlike static moods, these emotions unfold over time, contributing to the richness of our engagement with music.

7. **Cognitive Science Framework**: The link between expectation and emotion in music is situated within a broader cognitive science framework that emphasizes the brain's reliance on prediction and the complex mechanisms involved in processing unexpected events.

1. **Rhythm vs. Periodicity**: Rhythm in music can be understood as the pattern of durations between events, and it's not always periodic or based on regular pulses. Human speech rhythms, for example, are often characterized by duration contrast between neighboring sounds rather than by a steady beat.

2. **Speech Rhythm Studies**: Researchers like Oded Yrami and Sharon Inbar-Heppner have found that languages with syllable-timed rhythm (like Italian) have more duration contrast between syllables, while stress-timed rhythmed languages (like English) tend to reduce unstressed vowels to a lesser extent, thus preserving more duration contrast.

3. **NPVI (Normalized Pairwise Variability Index)**: This is an equation developed by Francis Nolan and colleagues to measure the average degree of duration contrast between adjacent vowels in sentences. It can be applied to music as well to measure note durations.

4. **Application to Classical Music**: In 2003, Joseph Danielli and John Benson reanalyzed classical music themes from a musical themes dictionary using the NPVI. They found that themes from English composers around the turn of the 20th century had greater duration contrast between adjacent notes compared to French composers of the same period.

5. **Further Research**: This finding was groundbreaking, showing that rhythmic patterns in instrumental music could reflect speech rhythms. Subsequent studies have shown similar relationships between folk fiddling rhythms and the speech rhythms of different regions. Additionally, a 2006 paper by John Benson, John Eberson, and Jason Rosenberg demonstrated that English and French classical music also reflects the intonation patterns of their respective languages.

6. **Implications**: These studies highlight the interplay between musical rhythm and speech patterns, emphasizing that rhythm is not solely about periodicity but also about the contrasts and patterns of event durations within a sequence.

7. **Conclusion**: The research on non-periodic rhythm in music and its relationship to speech has opened up new avenues for understanding music cognition and the ways in which different cultural expressions, like language and music, influence each other. It underscores the importance of considering rhythm beyond simple periodicity and encourages further exploration into this complex aspect of both music and language.

1. **Vocal Learning Hypothesis**: This hypothesis suggests that the ability to synchronize movements to a musical beat in a predictive and flexible manner is limited to vocal learner species, which include humans, some monkeys, certain birds like parrots, and possibly some whales and dolphins. The hypothesis posits that non-vocal learners, such as dogs and cats, cannot perform such tasks due to different brain structures.

2. **Snowball the Cockatoo**: A cockatoo named Snowball was observed dancing to music in a way that appeared synchronized and predictive, challenging the vocal learning hypothesis. Research conducted with Snowball and his owner, Irina Schultz, demonstrated that he could indeed synchronize to different tempi of music, suggesting that beat perception and synchronization might be a byproduct of brain circuitry associated with vocal learning.

3. **Further Research**: A study by Adina Schachner and her team at Harvard University analyzed thousands of YouTube videos of animals dancing to music and found that the only ones that seemed to display synchronized behavior were vocal learners, primarily parrots, supporting the vocal learning hypothesis.

4. **Sea Lions**: In 2013, a study by Peter Cook showed that a sea lion could also synchronize its movements to a musical beat in a predictive and tempo-flexible manner. This finding was surprising because sea lions are not known to be vocal learners, suggesting that the capacity for beat processing might be more widespread than previously thought.

5. **Horses**: Horses, which are not vocal learners, have been reported to spontaneously trot to the beat of music without a rider's cues. If scientific research could confirm this behavior, it would challenge the vocal learning hypothesis. A study by the author and colleagues in 2012 proposed a method to test if horses do indeed synchronize to music, which remains an open question.

6. **Broader Implications**: The research on beat-based processing across different species is revealing how complex and nuanced this ability can be, suggesting that it may not be as simple or universally shared as Darwin initially thought. Brain imaging studies in humans and behavioral studies in other animals are contributing to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying beat perception and synchronization.

1. **Arcuate Fasciculus Study**: A study examining highly trained singers, instrumentalists, and non-musicians found that the arcuate fasciculus, which is important for auditory-motor integration, was larger in musicians than in non-musicians on both the right and left sides of the brain. The singers had an even larger volume in the left hemisphere compared to instrumentalists, indicating a stronger connection between sound and movement coordination in musicians.

2. **Absolute Pitch (AP) Study**: A study by Psyche Louis et al. focused on the difference in connectivity within each hemisphere between AP musicians and non-AP musicians. The findings showed that AP musicians had significantly stronger connections between the posterior superior temporal gyrus and the posterior middle temporal gyrus, areas involved in pitch perception and sound categorization. These connections were present on both sides of the brain but particularly significant on the left side, which is associated with language processing in right-handed individuals. The strength of these connections correlated with the musicians' proficiency in AP, suggesting that this ability may be linked to enhanced connectivity between specific temporal lobe regions.

3. **Implications**: These studies highlight the specialized brain structures and connections that are developed through musical training and demonstrate a relationship between music processing and language cognition. The findings underscore the idea that early musical training can lead to observable differences in brain structure and connectivity, with implications for understanding the neural basis of music and its potential impact on other cognitive functions.

4. **Questions Raised**: The lecturer raises questions about how much these observed differences are caused by musical training versus other biological factors, as well as the broader implications these changes might have on other aspects of cognition, particularly language processing, which will be explored further in subsequent lectures.

 The opera hypothesis is a theoretical framework proposed to explain why musical training can enhance the processing of speech in the brain. This hypothesis is grounded in the idea that both music and speech share some overlapping neural circuits, particularly those involved in processing aspects like pitch contours or temporal patterns. Here are the key points of the opera hypothesis:

1. **Overlap**: There must be an overlap in brain networks that process aspects of both music and speech. For example, the processing of pitch in music relies on similar neural mechanisms as those used for intonation in language.

2. **Precision**: Music demands more precise processing of these overlapping aspects (like pitch) than language does. This heightened demand can lead to improvements in the precision of neural processing within shared networks.

3. **Emotion, Repetition, and Attention (ERA)**: Musical training often involves emotional expression, extensive repetition, and focused attention—factors that drive experience-dependent plasticity. These elements enhance learning and can lead to improvements in cognitive functions beyond music.

4. **Sensory Processing**: The original opera hypothesis focused on how musical training could improve the sensory processing of speech sounds (e.g., discriminating different pitches or rhythms).

5. **Cognitive Processing**: The expanded opera hypothesis also considers how music training can enhance cognitive aspects of speech processing, such as short-term memory for sound patterns and selective attention to specific elements within a complex auditory scene.

6. **Neuroplasticity**: The hypothesis posits that the combination of music's strong emotional connections with its high demands on shared neural mechanisms can lead to neuroplastic changes in the brain, enhancing both musical and speech processing abilities.

The opera hypothesis provides a framework for understanding how musical training can benefit cognitive functions associated with language, and it sets the stage for future research to explore this relationship further, potentially leading to new interventions for individuals with language deficits or other cognitive challenges.

1. **Music vs. Speech in Infant Development**: Research on infant responses to music and speech suggests that infants are more captivated by music than by speech, at least when hearing sounds without visual cues like facial expressions or gestures. Studies with infants aged six to nine months found that they listened to a song sung in an infant-directed manner for nearly nine minutes before showing signs of fussiness, compared to four to five minutes for both infant-directed and adult-directed speech.

2. **Infant-Directed Speech (IDS)**: IDS typically has higher pitch and more rhythmic patterns than adult-directed speech, and is believed to be a form of communication that captures infants' attention effectively. However, the studies indicate that music captivates infants even more than this specialized form of speech.

3. **Singing as Emotional Soothing**: In a study where mothers interacted with their 10-month-old infants and then suddenly became unresponsive (a technique known as the still-face procedure), singing proved to be more effective in calming the infants than speaking, even when the mothers used IDS. This suggests that music can have a profound emotional impact on infants, potentially due to its inherent structural properties or rhythmic qualities.

4. **Implications for Understanding Human Cognition**: These findings challenge the notion that speech is always the primary means of engaging with infants. They highlight the importance of music in human development and suggest that music may have an evolutionary advantage as a means of communication, given its ability to capture attention and influence emotions from a very young age.

5. **Conclusion**: While speech is crucial for language acquisition, these studies indicate that music has a unique and powerful role in infant cognition. It can hold infants' attention longer than speech and has the added benefit of soothing emotional distress more effectively when used as a form of comfort by caregivers.

 The lecture discusses two distinct conditions related to music perception, shedding light on how our brains process musical key and the social aspects of music cognition.

1. **A-musica** is a condition where individuals have difficulty processing musical key relationships. Previous research by Stefan Kolsch and his colleagues had shown that A-musics exhibit an brain wave response known as the E-R-A-N when processing musical key, suggesting implicit knowledge of music theory. However, a 2015 study revealed that A-musics do not bring this knowledge into conscious awareness during music perception, which may be due to impaired connectivity between auditory and frontal lobe regions responsible for processing musical structure.

2. **Frontal temporal dementia (FTD)** is a disorder characterized by atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes, often leading to difficulties with social cognition, such as interpreting others' mental states. A study by Jason Warren and colleagues found that patients with FTD had significant problems when classifying music based on mental states, which aligns with previous findings by Steinbeis and Kolsch in 2009. This earlier study demonstrated that the way people process music can be influenced by their beliefs about its origin; for instance, telling subjects that a piece of music was composed by a human led to increased activity in brain regions associated with theory of mind, whereas if they were told it was composed by a computer, they processed it differently. The regions involved in this task are the same ones that degenerate in FTD patients, emphasizing the connection between social cognition and music perception.

In summary, both A-musia and FTD provide insights into the complex interplay between sensory processing, implicit knowledge, and social cognition within the brain. These conditions highlight the multifaceted nature of music perception, which encompasses not just auditory processing but also our ability to understand and connect with the thoughts and feelings expressed through music.

1. **Research Context**: The studies conducted by Goethe and colleagues in 2008 and others in the field have explored the effects of music therapy on patients with Alzheimer's disease, focusing on its potential to reduce anxiety and improve quality of life.

2. **Music Therapy Study (Goethe et al., 2008)**: This study involved French patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's who were divided into two groups: one that received music therapy and another that served as a control group with reading sessions. The music therapy group showed a significant reduction in anxiety levels during treatment, which persisted at a two-month follow-up. There was no significant change in cognitive scores on the mini-mental state exam for either group.

3. **Music and Memory**: The studies suggest that musical memories are often preserved in Alzheimer's patients, even as other forms of memory are impaired. This is significant because music is strongly linked to autobiographical memories, which can be triggered by listening to familiar songs, potentially leading to a reduction in anxiety.

4. **Neuroimaging Studies**: Research by Genata and colleagues has shown that the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in associating music with autobiographical memory, is relatively spared in Alzheimer's disease. This could explain how music can help reconnect patients with their past experiences, leading to decreased anxiety.

5. **Emotional Impact of Music**: Music activates structures within the brain's limbic system, such as the ventral striatum, amygdala, and orbital frontal cortex, which are involved in emotional processing. These regions also tend to be relatively preserved in Alzheimer's patients. Thus, music can promote positive emotions and facilitate better interactions with caregivers and family members.

6. **Cultural and Societal Implications**: The documentary film "Alive Inside" illustrates the profound impact of personalized music on individuals with Alzheimer's, highlighting the potential of music to improve the well-being of these patients.

In summary, the evidence supports the conclusion that music therapy can have a beneficial effect on reducing anxiety in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This may be due to the ability of music to engage relatively preserved brain regions associated with emotional processing and autobiographical memory recall, leading to improved emotional states and social interactions.

1. **Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT):** This therapy is used for individuals who have suffered aphasia as a result of stroke or brain injury. MIT combines melodic singing with intonation patterns that are designed to cue speech production. Studies, including a case study by Albertin et al. in 2007 and a group study by Mueller et al. in 2013, have shown that this therapy can lead to significant improvements in speech production and neural plasticity in the motor areas of the brain responsible for speech.

2. **Rhythmic Auditory Cueing (RAC):** RAC is another music-supported therapy used for aphasia rehabilitation. It involves rhythmic auditory cues that are given in sync with movements of the unaffected limb. This therapy has been shown to improve speech and motor functions in individuals with aphasia, as seen in a study by Alain et al. in 2011.

3. **Auditory Motor Mapping Training:** This is a new form of therapy for nonverbal children with autism. It involves intoning words while playing a drum, linking the auditory and motor systems. A proof-of-concept study by Juan Schlaug et al. in 2011 demonstrated that this therapy can increase speech output in these children, with improvements that were maintained at follow-up visits.

4. **Music Therapy for Parkinson's Disease:** Music therapy has been used to help individuals with Parkinson's disease with movement and balance. A study by Peretz et al. showed that learning to play a musical sequence changes how the brain reacts to those notes, activating parts of the motor system associated with movement. This auditory-motor coupling is thought to be part of the neural plasticity driven by music-supported therapy, as seen in the improvements in movement tests and motor-evoked potentials in chronic stroke patients, as studied by Mueller et al. in 2013.

In summary, music-based therapies have shown promise in improving speech and motor functions in individuals with various neurological disorders. These therapies leverage the brain's plasticity and ability to integrate auditory and motor information, suggesting a broader application of music in medical rehabilitation. Ongoing research aims to further elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these improvements and to compare the efficacy of music-supported therapies to traditional interventions.

1. **Human Music vs. Birdsong**: Researchers have been investigating whether certain aspects of the frequency relationships in bird song, particularly in the hermit thrush's song, resemble a harmonic series, suggesting a possible connection with human music and its reliance on harmonic intervals.

2. **Harmonic Series in Birdsong**: A study by Emily Doolittle, Tecumseh Fitch, and colleagues found that the notes in the songs of hermit thrushes often fall within a harmonic series when analyzed at a slower tempo, indicating a preference for complex harmonic tones, which is also a characteristic of human music.

3. **Pitch Contours in Human and Birdsong**: A study by Elizabeth Campbell, Adam Tierney, and Frank Russo examined the pitch contours in songs from various human cultures and found a tendency for rising followed by falling pitch patterns or high to low pitch movements. This pattern was also observed in birdsong, suggesting that the biomechanics of singing while exhaling might influence the shape of pitch contours in both humans and birds.

4. **Biological Basis for Pitch Contours**: The tendency for rising-falling pitch contours in both human songs and birdsong can be explained by the physiological process of breathing out while producing sound, which naturally leads to a rise and fall in air pressure and thus pitch.

5. **Implications for Understanding Music Across Species**: These findings contribute to our understanding of the commonalities between human music and birdsong and suggest that some aspects of musicality could be rooted in basic biological processes shared across species.

6. **Further Research**: There is a need for more empirical research to explore the acoustic structure of birdsong and human music, which could shed light on the evolutionary roots of music and its function in communication and social interaction among different animal species.

1. **Music as a Transformative Technology**: The course has emphasized that music is not just an art form but also a transformative technology that can influence the brain's structure and function within individual lifetimes. This is a unique trait among human inventions, with the potential to reshape neural microarchitecture and cognitive processes without requiring genetic adaptation.

2. **Biological Significance of Music**: Even if music wasn't specifically designed by natural selection, it has significant biological roots and implications. Cognitive neuroscience and comparative psychology can explore these connections and differences between human cognition and that of other species.

3. **Comparative Study of Musicality**: The field is growing, with an entire issue of the journal "Philosophical Transactions B of the Royal Society" dedicated to comparing musicality in humans and other animal species. This approach avoids language barriers, allowing for more direct comparisons.

4. **Learning Opportunities**: Resources like the Society for Music Perception and Cognition's website can help continue learning about this field, with access to conferences, research talks, and lab maps focused on music cognition in North America.

5. **Voyager Golden Record as a Metaphor**: The Voyager spacecraft's golden records symbolize the importance of music in human culture. They contain a selection of human achievements, including 90 minutes of various musical genres, representing humanity's accomplishments.

6. **Recent Discoveries**: In the past two decades, neuroscience has revealed the majority of what we know about the relationship between music and the brain. These findings have revolutionized our understanding, with about 95% of current knowledge being new within the last 20 years.

7. **The Future of Music in the Brain Research**: The course concludes by highlighting that we are at the very beginning of understanding music's impact on the brain. As we continue to develop new neuroscience methods, our insights into this relationship will only deepen.

8. **Final Reflection**: The course encourages listeners to imagine hearing the Voyager Golden Record as a future alien species might, appreciating the depth of human emotion and thought conveyed through Beethoven's "Cavatina." This reflection serves as a poignant reminder of the profound impact music has on humanity and its potential to transcend time and space.
