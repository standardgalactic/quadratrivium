Welcome to lecture 34, Nuclear Matters.
We human beings have been aware of nuclear matter since around the turn of the 20th century,
but nuclear roles in our lives go back much further than that in the lives of ourselves
and our species and our planet.
4.5 billion years ago the sun formed and soon its nuclear reactions turned on in its core
and since then those nuclear reactions have been supplying the sunlight energy that keeps
earth systems and life on earth going.
Even earlier than that nuclear reactions in long dead stars cooked up the chemical elements
that were made of.
That will be the subject of lecture 36.
But through the 20th century the role of nuclear physics became more and more prominent
in our lives both in ways that are obvious and subtle.
For example in the United States we get 20% roughly of our electrical energy from nuclear
sources.
This picture I have on the screen shows you the percentage of electricity supplied by
nuclear plants in the top 10 nuclear states in the United States.
My own state of Vermont is the highest.
We have somewhere between 70 to 80% of the electricity generated in our state from our
single nuclear power plant.
By the way these numbers are not the percent of nuclear electricity consumed in the state.
Vermont is actually an exporter of nuclear energy and so about half of our electricity
comes from nuclear sources and the same arguments might apply to some other states.
But you can see there is a substantial fraction of nuclear energy being generated in quite
a number of states.
And if you look around the world there are countries, France, the leader with somewhere
between 70 to 80% of its electricity and now this really is the supply being supplied
by nuclear power plants.
U.S. is down off the bottom of this chart at about 20% but many European countries and
some Asian countries get a substantially larger fraction of their energy from nuclear sources.
There are many other ways in which nuclear matters impact our lives.
The threat of nuclear annihilation still hangs over us decades after the end of the Cold
War.
Nuclear technologies are also used in a variety of benevolent ways.
They're used in medicine.
They're used in screening airline baggage for explosives.
They're used in simple things like home smoke detectors.
They're used in a wide variety of medical applications.
Nuclear matters are very definitely a part today of the physics in our lives.
In this lecture I'd like to give you a little feel for how nuclear technology works, how
nuclear physics works, a brief history of nuclear physics and then a number of applications.
So the history, the first hint that there was nuclear physics, anything nuclear was
going on occurred in 1896 when the Frenchman Henri Becquerel accidentally left some uranium
compounds in a drawer where he also kept film and he found the film was fogged and he reasoned
that some sort of emanation must be coming from the uranium.
A young physicist Marie Curie followed with a doctoral thesis on this subject and she
and her husband Pierre shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work
on radioactivity.
Marie Curie later shared the Nobel Prize or won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering
several new radioactive elements.
In the early days of nuclear physics it wasn't clear whether this was physics or chemistry
and physicists and chemists both contributed to the efforts.
Scientists studying nuclear materials soon realized there were three kinds of emanations
that came out of these materials.
One they called beta emission and that later turned out to be just high energy electrons.
One they called alpha emission and that turned out to be helium nuclei, more on that in a
minute also coming out with high energy and the third called gamma radiation was actually
a form of very high energy electromagnetic radiation even shorter wavelength than x-rays.
In the early 1900s scientists began using these high energy particles as probes of the
structure of matter, something which has continued to this day although nowadays we accelerate
the particles in accelerators rather than using radioactive sources.
And particularly in 1909 to 1911 Ernest Rutherford and his collaborators Ernest Marsden and Hans
Geiger the latter of Geiger counter fame did a series of experiments where they took a
source of these alpha particles helium nuclei they bombarded a gold foil with them and to
their great surprise they had expected all the particles to go through most of them went
through but a few bounced back almost in the direction they had come from.
It was as if you spread out a roll of paper towels and shot it with machine gun fire most
of the bullets would go through but once in a while one came bouncing back as if it hit
something extremely massive and hard in there.
And so Rutherford and his colleagues had discovered the atomic nucleus.
Before that time the nucleus was thought to be something like the picture on the left
here.
This was the model of Thompson and Kelvin around 1900 who imagined the nucleus or the
atom as kind of a spherical blob of pudding like material the plum pudding model all positively
charged with an equal negative charge spread throughout in the form of the electrons.
Rutherford and his colleagues had discovered by 1911 that the nucleus was more like a solar
system mostly empty space a very tiny but very massive nucleus at the center and the
electrons in some kind of orbital system around them.
Well we want to focus in more on that nucleus we've already talked about atoms and electrons
we're going to look in on the nucleus.
By the 1930s physicists understood that the nucleus was composed of two different kinds
of particles protons positively charged particles and neutrons electrically neutral particles
that are very similar to protons in other ways each of those particles by the way is
about two thousand times more massive than the electron.
Now protons repel each other by the electric force so a nucleus couldn't stick together
unless there was some other force there and that other force is the so-called nuclear
force and if you look at my modern physics lectures you'll see that that is a residue
of something more deep called the color force that binds quarks together but we won't go
there we'll simply point out there is a very strong but very short range force that binds
nucleons protons to protons protons to neutrons neutrons to neutrons together.
There is still the repulsive force of the protons and if you put too many protons in
a nucleus it will be unstable and it will tend to fly apart that's why all elements
heavier than uranium are in fact unstable they are naturally radioactive they don't occur
in stable forms.
The number of protons in the nucleus the amount of positive charge determines how many electrons
get attracted around it and that determines the elements chemistry it's chemical nature
it's interaction to make molecules that's interesting but it's not what interests nuclear
physicists that number by the way is called the atomic number and the important thing
for physicists is different atoms different atoms of the same element that is the same
chemistry the same atomic number can have different numbers of neutrons and elements
of the same or atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons and therefore
different weights are called isotopes and I'm going to give you some examples of isotopes
here I've got a picture first showing a proton I'm going to symbolize that as a red sphere
positively charged a neutron will be a gray sphere and here are some examples of isotopes
hydrogen the simplest hydrogen its nucleus consists of a single proton it's called hydrogen
1 that's the common isotope of hydrogen but there is also deuterium it's given its own
name it's also called hydrogen 2 deuterium consists of a proton and a neutron because
it's still got one proton it gets one electron around it and its properties chemically are
the same as ordinary hydrogen but its nuclear properties are quite different and its mass
is twice as great tritium hydrogen 3 is a radioactive version of hydrogen it has a
half life or more of that later of about 12 years so it doesn't exist in nature unless
it's formed by some process here are some isotopes of oxygen the common form of oxygen
is oxygen 16 there's another stable isotope called oxygen 18 again they're identical
chemically but water made with oxygen 18 and water made with oxygen 16 evaporate at
different rates because of their different masses and it's that effect and measuring
the relative ratios of these two isotopes that allows a climatologist to look at ancient
ice cores and figure out what the temperature was I'm not going to go into details but
I showed you some results of that data back in the lecture on climate change now one of
the more massive nuclei is uranium and uranium comes in two well comes in a number of isotopes
but two are particularly important uranium 235 which constitutes less than a percent
of natural uranium has 143 protons and 90 at 143 neutrons and 92 protons uranium 238
has 92 protons also but 146 neutrons so it has a total number of particles it's mass
basically of 238 again these are chemically similar but their nuclear properties are very
very different now with the discovery of the neutron in the 1930s physicists began using
these neutrons as probes of the nucleus and with good reason because the neutron is neutral
it doesn't get repelled by the positive charge of the nucleus and it easily penetrates them
one of the leading pioneers in this was Enrico Fermi a name that may be familiar to you I've
showed you pictures of Fermi lab before where the giant accelerator is for example named
after Enrico Fermi he was an Italian physicist who came to the United States about the time
of World War II in 1938 two German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strasmann had begun bombarding
uranium with neutrons and to their great surprise they found that sometimes instead of just making
a slightly more massive nucleus as the extra neutron was absorbed or maybe making a slightly
less massive nucleus as an alpha particle came out sometimes they found nuclei that
were about half the mass of uranium and they were very puzzled about this and a former
colleague of theirs Lisa Meitner who had by that time fled Germany to escape Hitler and
was in Sweden was the one who came up with the explanation and by the way in one of the
great travesties of scientific history Meitner is not always recognized for this discovery
and she also did not share in the Nobel Prize that was awarded eventually for it and she
certainly should have much later she was honored by having element 109 an artificially
proofed element named after her that element is now called Meitnerium anyway Meitner was
walking in the Swedish countryside with her nephew Otto Frisch who was also a physicist
and she drew a picture reasoning what was happening how the uranium was splitting and
she coined the term fission and they published a paper in which the term fission was first
used in nuclear fission a uranium 235 nucleus is hit by a neutron in comes a neutron and
the combined nucleus now with the extra neutron is uranium 236 is not very stable and it begins
vibrating with the energy that's been imparted to it and that vibration takes the two makes
it an elongated structure and then the positive electric charge associated with the protons
is far apart and the electrical force although it falls off with distance does so less rapidly
than the nuclear force and so the electrical force becomes important this nucleus vibrates
a while but eventually it forms this dumbbell shape and then the two halves go apart they
aren't necessarily equal halves and a whole range of sort of middleweight elements is
formed in this process of nuclear fission now remember this discovery is made in the
late 1930s on the eve of World War two and then one could issue one could do a whole
course in the history of nuclear physics especially around World War two so in this one sentence
I'm going to utter is crammed a lot of history in the sentence is this the military implications
of this discovery were obvious and I think they were also very ominous and that's what
started the Manhattan Project I can't go into the history of that Einstein's role
Wigner's role various other roles but eventually the Manhattan Project was started by 1942
Fermi had led a group building a controlled nuclear fission reaction under the stands
of the University of Chicago and by 1945 the first nuclear weapons were detonated both
of those nuclear weapons evolved chain reactions and understand what a chain reaction is let's
look at something else that comes out in this process of nuclear fission in addition to the
uranium fissioning in half splitting in half typically one or two or three loose neutrons
are released either immediately or after a very short time in this process well what
can happen then is if a single nucleus a single neutron comes in and hits a uranium 235 and
it fissions outcome those additional neutrons and they hit additional uranium 235 nuclei
and cause additional fissioning and pretty soon that whole thing can go up in a giant
release of energy by the way it's only uranium 235 that readily fissions and that's the
reason why we worry a lot about the so-called enrichment of uranium uranium 235 is only
0.7% of natural uranium so that fissioning process doesn't really occur easily in a
massive natural uranium but if you enrich it to most the uranium 235 you can get an
explosive chain reaction if you have what's called a critical mass a big enough amount
that those neutrons can't escape and unfortunately a critical mass of uranium weighs about 50
pounds and is about the size of a grapefruit and if a crude bomb like the one used in Hiroshima
can destroy an entire city that's one of the reasons you read in the news all the time
about people worrying about uranium enrichment technology because that's a key to nuclear
weapons for controlled fission we want something else to happen we want exactly one neutron
coming out of each fissioning uranium to cause another fission chain reaction so for
controlled fission we want to have materials in with the uranium that will absorb neutrons
and prevent fission from occurring from most neutrons so the reaction won't run out of
control and typically we use fairly unenriched uranium in the United States we enrich uranium
to about 3% u 235 for our fission reactors Canada has a natural uranium kind of reactor
called can do that works on different principles and doesn't need any enrichment and so on
we also put in special neutron absorbing materials that can be moved in and out of the reactor
to control the rate of the nuclear chain reaction there are a whole lot of different reactor
designs in the world and I don't think it's fair to say that any of them are superior
I mentioned the Canadian reactor in the United States we tend to use reactors that are called
light water reactors because they use ordinary water something else in nuclear fission reactor
needs that a bomb doesn't need is something called a moderator it turns out these nuclear
reactions occur better with neutrons that are moving relatively slowly that isn't really
an issue in a bomb or you have a lot of stuff altogether in one place but in a reactor unless
you could slow down the neutrons they wouldn't be effective enough at causing fission so
there's something called a moderator you might think it moderates the reaction but it doesn't
it actually makes it go better because it slows down the neutrons and water makes a
very good moderator for a reason I described in an earlier module when I showed two objects
of equal mass colliding or I showed my newton's cradle thing and that is because a neutron
and a proton have the same mass and when a neutron strikes a proton in water it transfers
all its energy or almost all its energy and slows down significantly so US reactors use
light water US reactors are an outgrowth basically of submarine based reactors the can do reactor
I mentioned that the Canadians make uses heavy water as its moderator and that allows it
to use natural uranium without enriching it that's because the heavy water doesn't absorb
neutrons as easily heavy water is deuterium based water kind of rare though you have to
remove it from ordinary water at some cost and expense and trouble the Russian reactors
tended to be graphite moderated they had a solid moderator the reactor at Chernobyl which
caught fire chemical fire was a graphite reactor and it's not clear which of these reactors
is best they all have engineering safety efficiency proliferation and other tradeoffs
in a US reactor a US light water reactor in a US light water reactor the nuclear fission
reactions are occurring in rods containing uranium fuel these rods move these rods are
stationary in a vat of water which is either boiling a big pressure chamber of water that's
either boiling or under pressure boiling water reactors versus pressurized water reactors
between the uranium fuel rods are so-called control rods and the control rods can move
up out of the way absorbing fewer neutrons making the reactor go a little faster down
slowing down the reactor if they're pushed all the way down they will make the reactor
stop completely well that's one way of making energy from nuclear reactions another way of
making energy from nuclear reactions involves fusing light elements together that's the
process of fusion a very famous graph title of a book by John McPhee the curve of binding
energy describes these two processes and what it says is if you start with very heavy
elements like uranium and split them you can release energy if you start with very light
elements like hydrogen and fuse them together you can also release energy that's the process
that powers the stars we have not yet made fusion work successfully here on earth but
if we did we would have 300 billion years worth of energy in the oceans because about
one every 6500 hydrogen nuclei in ocean water is in fact deuterium and we could join deuterium
to make energy and improve helium in the process by the way you'll notice iron is the element
with the when you make it you release the most binding energy the most energy and you
can't do anything with iron you can't extract any more energy from it how would a fusion
reaction work well it would look something like this here's a bunch of deuterium nuclei
running around together in a very hot system we have to contain them at about 100 million
degrees we haven't totally figured out how to do that I showed you in earlier lectures
two possible methods one was the magnetic confinement of the ITER experimental fusion
reactor another was the nova laser system I showed you in the previous lecture that
achieves this by blasting a tiny pellet with very high energy laser beams but occasionally
if you get to enough temperature these rapidly moving nuclei overcome the repulsion the electrical
repulsion of their being positive form a helium nucleus and emit a large amount of energy
in the process so that's how nuclear fusion works but we simply aren't there yet in terms
of producing nuclear fusion as a reliable energy source as a something we can control
unfortunately we have learned to make it go off with an explosive reaction and that's
what a so-called hydrogen bomb or thermonuclear bomb is about now talk about nuclear things
and everybody worries about radiation and radiation is indeed something we should worry
about but it's also something that can be useful the most important characterization
of radiation is the half-life of a radioactive nucleus the half-life is the time it takes
half of all the nuclei to decay if I start out with a hundred nuclei for example then
one half-life later whatever the half-life is there will be 50 of them left approximately
they decay at random by quantum mechanical processes that are intrinsically random but
roughly 50 will be left after two half-lives 25 will be left after three half of 25 or
12 and a half six and a quarter I guess blonde down it goes and by the time a few half-lives
are going by the total original amount of radioactive material is largely gone it is
decayed by emitting particles into some other kind of substance some typical half-lives
of some radioactive materials some of which are quite useful uranium 238 that's still
around because it has a half-life of four and a half billion years uranium 235 is only
700 million years so a billion years from now there won't be nearly as much uranium
235 around but there will be almost as much 238 by the way billions of years ago there
was enough 235 that natural fission reactors actually occurred on earth at least in one
place in Africa and ran for thousands of years because there was enough concentration of
you 235 strontium 90 is a fission byproduct it lodges in bones it was a big worry during
nuclear fallout times of the nuclear bomb tests in the atmosphere it was also it's
also a worry in a nuclear power plant accidents because it behaves like calcium and lodges
in your bones plutonium 239 is produced in nuclear reactors when uranium 238 absorbs
a neutron and turns through a series of reactions into plutonium 239 plutonium 239 is even more
dangerous as a nuclear weapons fuel than uranium 235 and that's the reason we also
don't want a lot of nuclear reactors producing plutonium 239 and then countries extracting
it and using it to make nuclear weapons but both those processes are for better or worse
going on around the world carbon 14 with a 5700 year half-life roughly is formed by
cosmic rays in the atmosphere it's used for radiocarbon dating I'll show you in a minute
how that works oxygen 15 is a very safe isotope you have to make it right in a hospital it's
used for medical studies pet scans particularly with its 2 minute half-life it's gone pretty
soon rate on 222 lives only 3.8 days but it's part of a byproduct part of a sequence of
products produced by the decay of natural uranium and there's plenty of natural uranium
in rocks and so this is a gas and it seeps into our basements and is actually a major
source of radiation for human beings in fact if you ask how much radiation do you receive
and where does it come from the answer is probably not what you might think about half
your radiation dose on average and this varies a lot with where you live what the geology
is what the altitude is and so on about half is from radon the local rocks and soil immediately
provide about 8% cosmic rays about another 8% although if you live in Denver that's
about doubled because you're there's less atmosphere above you in the cosmic rays are
less attenuated your body is a major source of radiation to you your body has radioactive
substances particularly radioactive potassium naturally radioactive potassium that produce
about 11% of your radiation medical products and medical techniques x-rays particularly
give you about 15% some consumer products are radioactive and you get about 3% and other
is about 1% that by the way includes radiation from nuclear power plants and operations of
the nuclear power industry it's pretty negligible in terms of the overall effect now radiation
has a whole lot of practical uses and I want to just give you some of them I'm not an advocate
of nuclear radiation I'm kind of neutral on the whole issue but I want to give you here
a sense that things nuclear are not all bad they aren't all good either here's all radiocarbon
dating works well there are these cosmic rays coming from the sun partly but mostly from
distant parts of the galaxy and maybe even beyond the galaxy they consist of very high
energy particles they come barreling into the solar system and they bombard the earth's
atmosphere and they come in with such energy that they can induce nuclear reactions in
materials in the upper atmosphere and one nuclear reaction forms a product called carbon
14 and carbon 14 is chemically just like carbon normal carbon is carbon 12 it has six neutrons
and six protons carbon 14 has six protons because it's carbon that's what makes it carbon
so six electrons that determines its chemistry but it has eight neutrons it's a little more
massive and it happens to be radioactive it's unstable it's got too many neutrons and so
it decays and it decays with this half-life of 5,730 years and so here's what happens here we
have this mammoth some time ago walking along and the carbon 14 is formed in the atmosphere
and becomes carbon dioxide on interacting with oxygen and plants growing plants take
up the carbon dioxide so the and the grass then becomes slightly radioactive with this
carbon 14 of course most of the carbon is not carbon 14 but a little bit of it is and
the mammoth eats the grass and the mammoth gets carbon 14 and it becomes radioactive
well the mammoth is a bit radioactive and that's what that is designed to show okay the mammoth
dies the mammoth stops eating grass stops taking up radioactive carbon and the radioactive carbon
now in the mammoth decays while the mammoth is alive although the radioactive carbon is decaying
the mammoth is always eating more radioactive carbon and so it stays approximate at the same
level of radioactivity but once it dies that uptake stops and the mammoth's radiation begins
to decay over time there it is later less radioactive after a while the mammoth has
become just a pile of bones still just very slightly radioactive depending on how long
they've lain there and along comes some archaeologists and they dig up these bones now I want to
point out the archaeologists are radioactive because they're eating plants even if they're
not vegetarians they're eating meat and the meat is coming from plants and that has been
taking up radioactive carbon by the way there are a lot of subtleties here the exact amount
formed depends on what the sun is doing because the sun's activity keeps cosmic rays out of
the solar system to get these dates exact we have to be pretty careful but the big idea works
pretty well so here are these anthropologists or archaeologists and they're kind of radioactive
themselves and they dig up the mammoth bones and they go to the laboratory and they compare
the radioactivity in these old bones with that in a fresh bone say from an animal that's
just been killed or they don't even need to do that they simply know what the radiation
levels are in contemporary organic materials by the way this works for things like charcoal
from a fire because that's wood as well as from animal material okay so in this particular
case I've indicated the amount of radiation by the number of arrows you see and in this
particular case there are half as many arrows in the old bone so it's half the radiation
level that implies one half life has gone by and this bone is there for one half life
old or 57 30 years here's a bone that's older it's only got a quarter as much radiation
two half lives that's 11,000 something years here's a bone that's only one eighth is radioactive
that's three half lives to get you down to that level so that was about 17,000 years
old and obviously you could do the math to get any numbers in between radio carbon dating
works quite effectively back to 050,000 years or so and there are other radioisotopes we
can use to date things further back so that's a very very effective technique and has given
us a real sense of our place in history because we can date objects that go back from a few
hundred to a few tens of thousands of years very nicely with radio carbon dating give
you some other examples of where radiation is important in your lives smoke detectors
save thousands of lives every year in the United States well most common form of smoke
detector a little thing you put on your ceiling has a little battery and has a little test
button and if smoke gets into it it beeps how does that work smoke detectors contain
a tiny quantity of a radioisotope called americium 241 americium is a substance which is not
produced naturally in is not does not occur naturally in nature it has too short a half
life it's heavier than uranium it has atomic number 95 uranium is 92 in fact it's a byproduct
of nuclear reactors so the americium in your smoke detector ultimately came from nuclear
waste there's a very tiny bit of it there it produces a very tiny amount of radioactivity
some of that 3% of your radiation dose that you get from consumer products does come from
smoke detectors that radiation is well worth what smoke detectors do namely saves thousands
of lives how do they work well the americium emits alpha particles high energy helium
nuclei they can knock the electrons off atoms in the air or they can collide with air molecules
and stick to them and either way the air molecules get an electric charge the air becomes a conductor
of electricity the battery is trying to put the battery in your smoke detector that you're
supposed to change once a year is putting some electric current through that air if smoke
gets in there it interferes with the alpha particles and cuts down on the conduct conductivity
the makes the electrical resistance higher the current goes down your smoke detector detects
that and triggers the alarm so that's a very simple example where radiation is helping
you by the way when you're worrying about fire safety you don't have to worry about
the power going off and causing you not to know where the exit sign is in the case of
a fire in some buildings the exit signs are powered not by electricity but by tritium
which again emits high energy radiation and these detectors are basically like fluorescent
lamps except instead of the energy coming from an electric current it's coming from
these high energy particles emitted in this case by radioactive tritium so some exit signs
like the one I'm showing here are actually powered by radioactive tritium now radiation
has also been used for a long time for chemical analysis I mentioned in that in the 1930s
scientists began bombarding materials with neutrons because neutrons being neutral easily
get absorbed by the nucleus and they create new materials and when a particular ordinary
everyday nucleus gets absorbed absorbs a neutron it turns into an isotope of something
else or of itself or of something else it may undergo a few nuclear reactions and turn
in something else or it may just absorb the neutron and turn into a heavier isotope itself
but that isotope may be radioactive and it gives off characteristic radiation and if
we examine that radiation and measure its energy we can tell and measure what different
kinds of radiation are emitted we can tell what kind of material we have so the process
of neutron activation consists of bombarding material with neutrons seeing the radiation
that comes out we make the materials temporarily radioactive by the way it's one of the few
processes involving radiation that does that makes the material temporarily radioactive
but with relatively short half lives we measure the distribution of emission and we can tell
what and how much material is in there one of the more promising methods for screening
airline luggage not your hand luggage but the big luggage that's going into the hold
of the aircraft for bombs which tend to have particular concentrations of certain materials
like nitrogen in them is to neutron activate the luggage that is exposed to flux of high
energy of neutrons and high energy neutrons because they can just get into the nucleus
because they aren't repelled by the nucleus electric charge expose that to neutrons and
then put the baggage against radiation detectors that determine what kind of material is in
there so that may be a technique that ends up used soon to detect explosives and other
dangerous materials in airline luggage well that's a quick survey of nuclear matters in
your life nuclear physics is certainly a part of the physics in your life it's in ways
that both threaten you as in nuclear weapons ways that may be benign and some ways that
are downright helpful.
