Felly now that we've dealt with some of the possible mechanisms that can cause mass extinction events, severe downturns in biodiversity suddenly in earth history, let's have a closer look at the first of the extinction events, the first of those big 5.

to the heavens. So what was the Audubition world like? Well by the middle Audubition we've
seen another rapid radiation of creatures, another flowering, another boom of forms.
Some people say that it's almost as spectacular as the Cambrian explosion that proceeded it.
The Audubition would see creatures moving into different levels of the ecosystem. They were
burrowing deeper, they were growing higher above the ocean floor. We'd see wonderful
Llywodraeth妹. The Orthoconic Nortelloid becoming the top predator
taking over from the anomaly carries from the Cambrian period.
A common creature of the Urdovician are the graptolytes.
They, too, would undergo rapid diversification in this period.
Now, we've mentioned graptolytes a few times in relation to
biostratigraphy and correlation.
I thought it might be a good idea here
to just describe them a little bit to you.

finally i ni ei mıchaf ni. The paleomagnetic evidence that we get from these Sahara rocks
shows that these rocks with were definitely at the south pole when these glacial features
are formed. This is an example of where glacial features have really been moved by plate tectonics
to a now warmer place. Another way though, of reading the onset of this glacial period
in addition to glacial features, is isotopic evidence. Remember we talked about carbon isotopes?

in the oceans, and this signature can be recorded in the chemistry of creatures that secrete shells.
For example, in the Ordovician, a common creature that would record this isotope
would be the brachypods that we met in a previous lecture. This isotopic shell data shows
that the geological period, the glacial period that we're dealing with here, was short, no more
than one million years in duration. The extinction starts in the last stage of the
Ordovician, that is a stage that's called the Hernantian. It's about 1.9 million years long
between 445 to 443 million years ago, but by the time it had finished, as many as 85% of all
species had gone, that is a very significant blow to the earth's biosphere. The first pulse
starts around 445 million years ago, and it's very severe in reef forness,
and anything that is warm water adapted. So, the beautiful scene that we can see in this image
is going to disappear. 50 out of the 70 genera of tabulate and regose corals go extinct,
very, very suddenly. Cooler water forms start to migrate towards the equator, chasing
the warmer water, but the tropical forms really had nowhere to go. Well, nowhere to go apart from
extinction, unfortunately. Glaciation would have another effect as well. Obviously, when you're
locking water upon the continents, you're not only going to change the ratio of oxygen isotopes
in the ocean, you're also going to stop water physically getting back into the oceans,
and the ocean levels, sea level, is going to drop as a consequence. We've seen that through
all major glacial periods. You have a glacial period, sea levels fall. In the Ordovician,
we can see this as an erosion surface in many Ordovician sediments. It developed as deep canyons
in river systems, so land was suddenly exposed, which was eroded, and rivers would be running
across it. Rivers effectively trying to come into equilibrium with the new lower sea levels that
have been created. Now, lower sea levels mean the withdrawal from shallow shelf areas. Now, think
about the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is in a shallow shelf area. It's a shelf area
continental shelf, so the ocean is just lapping up onto the edge of the continents, and in that
wonderful, warm, shallow water is where we got all those corals developing. Now imagine
a glaciation, a period of sea level fall, and all that water just runs away. So there's a double
blow. We have lower temperatures, which a lot of these tropical forms wouldn't like,
but also sea level fall as well, so habitat loss is going to be a severe effect of this extinction
too. The second pulse of extinction at the end of the glacial period is related to sea levels
and temperatures rising again. It's not as severe, but we think it occurs in forms that have become
cold adapted. They've made the struggle forward to adapt to these new conditions,
but then very suddenly they switch back again. They couldn't cope, and they were to go as well.
But what else could be contributing to stress in the biosphere? Is it just an earth-based system
that we're looking at here, or do we have to look into the heavens? Do we have to look to space?
The story I've just told is kind of neat, isn't it? It kind of sums things up very nicely. We have
a continent drifting down towards the South Pole. Obviously it's going to get colder. We have
glaciation. We have drops in temperatures, falls in sea levels, and creatures going to extinction
because of lower temperatures and loss of habitat. The hernension glaciation is the smoking gun
for the Ordovician extinction event, but we have a problem. Gondwana had moved apparently over
the South Pole some millions of years before the glaciation had occurred, so why the gap?
We're obviously missing part of the story. Something changed moving earth into a cooling
phase, something that would allow the earth to cool. Obviously it's not just the presence of
Gondwana under the South Pole that has pushed the earth into this severe cooling episode and
associated glaciation, and if we're looking for a potential culprit to explain why we might
suddenly turn into a glacial episode, I guess the first culprit we look to are greenhouse gases.
Now we have two continents here, Baltica and Avalonia, and they're moving towards the continent
of Laurentia, and there's a shrinking ocean between them. That shrinking ocean is called the
Iapetus Ocean. Now that ocean that it is shrinking, of course, is being removed by subduction at the
continental margins. The mountains would develop along the edge of those subducting oceans. If you
want a modern analogue, just think of the Andes today developed along the coast of South America,
as the Pacific is pushed underneath the continental rocks there. Basically the mountains are just
rucking up in response. Likewise, a mountain belt would be built either side of this disappearing
subducting Iapetus Ocean, on either side of that ocean. It's the Iapetus Ocean and the Iapetus
story that I actually cut my geological teeth on. I had many influences when it came to getting into
geology, those walks that I talked about in the Derbyshire Hills, but also my high school geology
teacher, one, Jim Sidley, who was quite the character and unfortunately passed away just
recently. He was a great influence on my career. He would describe in florid and graphic detail
the destruction of Iapetus. He would paint a picture of an entirely different world,
a world that we could visit by visiting the rocks on various field trips. He described the
movements of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia, and that really, really fired my imagination.
I would take that love for geology that Jim helped inspire to my undergraduate studies in Plymouth,
where I would complete an honours geological mapping project in a particularly special area
of the United Kingdom. I'd be looking at the Ordovician and Cylorian rocks of the English
Lake District. Here's a picture of the English Lake District, but way back in the Ordovician time
it sat on the southern margin of the Iapetus Ocean. In particular, I was studying rocks around
this area. This is the Old Man of Coniston. It's one of the local mountains that you can go hiking on.
It's a beautiful picture you have here. The Lake District is a beautiful place to visit,
but I must admit it does rain an awful lot. The mountain that you can see there, the Old Man of
Coniston, is composed of lots of lavers and ashes. They're part of those Ordovician volcanoes that
were popping on and off as the subduction was occurring along the margins of the Iapetus Ocean.
The land in front of the mountain, that slightly rolling landscape, the agricultural landscape,
is composed of Ordovician and Cylorian sediments. Within those sediments you can find trilobites
and graptolites, creatures that were inhabiting that Iapetus Ocean as it was closing.
Eventually, the Iapetus Ocean would be removed and it would collide. The continental fragments
would collide to form loresia, or sometimes it's called your America, a larger continental fragment.
The line where the continents met is often called a suture line, and we've been able now geologically
to work out where that suture line is. In the United Kingdom it runs right through northern England.
So, in looking at this diagram you can see that Scotland and southern England were on opposite sides
of the Iapetus Ocean. The line in North America runs right down the east coast, so the east coast
of North America was actually on the same side of the Iapetus Ocean as southern England was.
Again, that kind of blew my mind as an undergraduate too. The story of the destruction of the Iapetus
Ocean has now been fragmented because parts of that story are present on both sides of a new ocean,
the Atlantic Ocean. The existence of the Iapetus Ocean is now recorded in the rocks and fossils
that once developed along its margins. Now, 14 years later, in the year 2000, I was a brand new
faculty member at UBC, and I was attending a geology conference at Memorial University in St
John's, Newfoundland. At the airport arrival lounge, I really stepped off the plane and looked to the
walls to see a display of local rocks. Imagine my thrill when I looked at those rocks. I studied them
and realised they were the same type of rocks that I had studied when I was an undergraduate,
but they're from an entirely different continent, at least now. The fact is, those rocks were deposited
originally on the same side as the Iapetus Ocean as the rocks that I studied when I was an undergraduate.
I had crossed the Atlantic but found myself on the same side of the Iapetus Ocean. What we're looking
at here was an old piece of Avalonia which had basically decided to stay with North America
when the Atlantic formed. I was absolutely overwhelmed by the experience and was getting one or two
strange looks by people passing a short bleary eyed man with his nose pressed up against an airport
arrival lounge wall. Well, let's go back to the story. As the Iapetus Ocean shrank, mountains started
to rise, as we've already discussed, and as those mountains started to rise, they do what any mountains
do when they start to rise. They start to get eroded. They would be subject to fairly intense erosion.
Now, we've already described the way that erosion of rocks can use up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Remember, we talked about silicate weathering. Now, usually, though, the drawdown of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere by this erosion is matched in general by the addition of new carbon dioxide by
volcanic activity. However, it's been suggested that during the Hernansian, that very end period of the
Oedivision, volcanic activity had dropped. It wasn't as intense, so there'd be a net drop in atmospheric
carbon dioxide. That meant that when Gondwana, which is already under the South Pole and getting cold,
recorded this drop in lower carbon dioxide levels, which would mean a lower greenhouse effect,
which means lower temperatures on the planet, that would be the spur. That would be the key to driving
the earth into a sudden glacial episode, and that explains the lag.
This explanation, although, again, seems fairly neat, explains that time difference. Why didn't we go
immediately into the glacial period? Well, we are waiting for CO2 levels to drop before it really
could trigger the glaciation event. But the Hernansian glaciation is very short when compared
to others, and I said this left some people uncomfortable. For example, we are at the moment
in a glacial period. We're currently just in an interglacial period. The current glacial period
that we're in started about 2.58 million years ago. And as of yet, although, as I said, we've witnessed
some extinction events in the megafauna, we've not witnessed an extinction event on the scale
of the Ordovician. So, why was the Ordovician glaciation so different?
Brian Thomas, who is an astrophysicist at Washburn University in Kansas, thinks that the
cause of the Ordovician extinction might have a somewhat more distant and even more frightening
origin. He thinks it might be related to something that is called a gamma ray burst. Gamma ray bursts
were first detected in 1967. They were detected by these. These are the Vela satellites. Now, in 1967,
we were right in the middle of the Cold War, and everybody was watching everybody else, making sure
nobody was letting off a sneaky nuclear bomb somewhere. So, the Vela satellites were designed
to watch for gamma radiation, a product of a nuclear bomb. And the satellites started to detect
emissions. You can imagine the panic that that generated, but after everybody had calmed down, I guess,
and taken the finger off the red button, they realized that those gamma emissions weren't coming
from Earth. They were coming from space. Sometimes they were microseconds in length, sometimes
several minutes long. So, where were they coming from? Well, if they were from our galaxy, they
shall have a particular distribution when you map them on the night sky. If you've ever gone
to an area which doesn't suffer from light pollution, you look up to the night sky, you might see
the backbone of the night, the Milky Way stretching across the sky. That's effectively the edge of
our galaxy. So, if the gamma ray bursts are coming from our galaxy, they should effectively line up
with the Milky Way. But when we did look at where those gamma rays came from, this is the picture we
got. They were coming from all over the sky. The only conclusion you can draw from that is that these
are of intergalactic origin. But what causes them? Some people thought, well, perhaps what we're looking
at here is star wars. We're looking at vast intergalactic civilizations destroying themselves
in a flash of gamma rays. Although we do have a more natural course, the longer bursts are thought to
be the death of something quite spectacular, the death of a hypergiant star. Now, hypergiants are many
millions of times more luminous than our sun, and they represent about 300 solar masses. Just look
at this diagram here. That tiny little dot in it is a representative of our sun. Just absolutely
incredible, the mass of these things. Because they're so large, they kind of live hard and die
young. They have a lifespan of no longer than around 3 million years. Our sun has a complete
lifespan of about 10 billion years. We're halfway through it. We're about the 5 billion year mark
at the moment. So these things, as I said, live very short periods of life and then die in a
spectacular event. Not a supernova, they die in what is called a hypernova, releasing 100 times the
amount of energy released in a standard supernova. Any star you see is a delicate balancing act. The sun
is burning its fuel that keeps the star inflated, but because of the mass of material in there, gravity
really wants to keep collapsing it inwards. Once the hypergiant had used up all its fuel, gravity
would take over, gravity would become the dominant force, and the star collapses catastrophically
inward and then explodes. Because of the sheer mass of the hypergiant, though, it would eventually
form a black hole, that singularity that we talked about. But also it would produce two jets of plasma
emitted at nearly the speed of light, and these are the jets that produce, we think, the longer
gamma ray burst. Thomas speculated that a gamma ray burst emitted within the range of the earth
might occur about once every, perhaps, billion years. And what would the effect on the earth be?
Well, it wouldn't be very good. We'd see a severe depletion in ozone levels. Remember, ozone is that
O3 molecule that is helping absorb some of that harmful ultraviolet radiation that would otherwise
penetrate the surface of our planet and cause a lot more skin cancer. Paleontologist Bruce Lieberman
from the University of Kansas thinks that, potentially, this could account for extinction
in trilobites. Now, adult trilobites mostly lived on the ocean floor, so they would have a large,
protective body of water above them, and this probably wouldn't bother them very much. But it's
likely that trilobites had a juvenile stage that was probably planktonic in its embryonic stage,
and not just trilobites. Lots of other creatures in the ocean have planktonic embryonic stages,
and these would be severely affected by increased UV levels. Perhaps what you're looking at here,
according to these guys, is the wiping out of an entire generation of progeny, and perhaps,
therefore, as well, the extinction of many groups. The gamma-ray burst could also cause the
formation of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere. You know nitrogen oxides by another name, smog.
That could cause global dimming. Perhaps that is the initial cause of the
hynnotion glaciation they suggested. Also, nitrogen gases when in the atmosphere can become a
dissolved in rainwater forming a wheat nitric acid. So, in addition to all the other problems we're
talking about, we could have a period of acid rain. And what is the evidence for this?
Hardly any. It's a bit of a thought experiment to guess. It's an interesting possibility, but as my
hero Carl Sagan said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Another reason why a short
glacial period might have such a profound effect on the biosphere, as I'm concerned, though,
is that this is the first major extinction of the new meta-zoan biosphere. It's the first one it had
faced. A glaciation was a new event for this biosphere. None of the Ordovician creatures had
really become pre-adapted, as later iterations of the biosphere would become pre-adapted. And as a result,
the casualties in the Ordovician were unfortunately for that biosphere very high indeed.
During the Silorian, the biosphere would start to slowly recover and would start to see
another burgeoning beautiful world full of tropical reef systems. But a new frontier would start to
be explored in the Silorian as well. The biosphere was looking outwards from the ocean and was going
to start to make a conquering move towards the land.
