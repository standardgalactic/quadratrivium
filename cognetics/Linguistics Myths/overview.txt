Processing Overview for Linguistics Myths
============================
Checking Linguistics Myths/01 - Alarm over the Decay of English.txt
 In this course, we will explore the intricate history, diversity, and complexities of the English language, particularly when compared to Frisian. We will delve into why English has more chaotic transformations than languages like Frisian, which often use suffixes like "ito" in verbs (e.g., "ittwoamlen" for "to walk," resulting in "we itto apples" for "we eat apples"). The course will challenge traditional notions of grammar and correctness by examining the differences between descriptivism and prescriptivism, and how these perspectives have influenced the evolution of English.

We will also consider the impact of cultural and technological advancements on English usage, noting that modern English is more informal than in the past. This shift has led to debates about language standards, but from a broader perspective, it can be seen as an enrichment and liberation of the language. The course aims to provide a fresh understanding of English by drawing parallels with other languages worldwide, offering insights into concepts such as formality, informality, correctness, appropriateness, and error.

Throughout the lectures, we will reconsider what grammar is and how it functions, challenging preconceived notions and looking at language from a more global and linguistically informed perspective. The course promises to be an engaging journey into the multifaceted nature of English, inviting learners to see the language in a new light with a focus on its vibrancy, complexity, and ever-evolving nature.

Checking Linguistics Myths/02 - Surprises in the Ancestry of Old English.txt
1. The Phoenicians, known for their seafaring abilities, are believed to have reached as far west as Portugal around 200 BC, but there's no definitive evidence they reached northern Europe, where Proto-Germanic was spoken.

2. Proto-Germanic, a descendant of Proto-Indo-European, was a simplified language that had lost much of its original complexity before it even gave rise to English. This suggests that the speakers of Proto-Germanic learned and adapted the language in a way that streamlined it.

3. The development of English was influenced by a history of mixture and simplification, with proto-Germanic already being a less complex version of an earlier Indo-European language.

4. English's roots include this process of "destruction" where much of the original linguistic complexity was stripped away, setting the stage for the language's subsequent evolution.

5. The English language today is a product of both the breakdown and mixture of languages, with its origins deeply rooted in a simplified form of Proto-Germanic, which itself was already a pigeonized version of an earlier Indo-European language.

6. In the next phase of English's development, we'll explore how it continued to evolve through chaos and change, leading to the complex, dynamic, and diverse language we have today.

Checking Linguistics Myths/03 - Not Exactly Anglo-Saxon.txt
1. **Proto-Germanic to Old English Evolution**: The English language has roots in Proto-Germanic, from which Old English (also known as Anglo-Saxon) evolved. This period saw significant linguistic changes, including sound shifts like the Great Vowel Shift and consonant gradation, which transformed the language's phonology.

2. **Complicated Plurals**: Old English had a complex system of plurals that didn't always follow regular patterns. There were various plural forms, similar to how 'child' becomes 'children' in Modern English, but with many more exceptions and irregularities.

3. **Simplification Over Time**: The transition from Old English to Modern English saw a simplification of the language, including its plural formation. Today, the plural form is almost universally indicated by an 's'.

4. **Loss of Complications**: While Old English had a rich tapestry of grammatical forms and irregular plurals, Modern English has streamlined these for clarity and ease of learning. This simplification is not universally true for all aspects of the language, as seen with irregular verbs and the "who/whom" debate.

5. **Modern Perceptions**: Despite the loss of some Old English linguistic complexities, Modern English speakers do not feel a deficit in expressive power or clarity. The perception that certain constructions (like using "they" as a singular pronoun) are grammatically incorrect is often more about tradition and less about language function.

6. **Language Change as a Continuum**: Just as Old English speakers experienced changes in their language, we too are part of the ongoing evolution of English. Our current usage reflects both historical continuity and contemporary adaptation.

In summary, the lecture highlights that the English language has undergone significant changes from its Proto-Germanic roots to Old English, and then again as it developed into Modern English. The simplification of plurals is an example of how languages can change over time, often for practical reasons related to clarity and ease of use. As speakers of Modern English, we are part of the language's ongoing evolution.

Checking Linguistics Myths/04 - Don't Forget the Celtic Connection.txt
1. The French influence dominated language use in England during the Norman Conquest, with French being the official language. This was the norm for several centuries until the English regained control and began to reassert their language.
   
2. During the period of French dominance, writing continued to reflect the old forms of English, which had become different from everyday spoken English. This gap between written and spoken language lasted until the end of the 'English blackout' when Middle English emerged.

3. Middle English was a more authentic representation of how English was actually spoken, including the influence of Celtic languages that had been present since the Germanic invaders arrived in the 5th century AD. This period saw the integration of Celtic grammar into the Germanic language of the invaders, creating a hybrid language.

4. The reason we don't see Celticisms and other colloquial features in old English texts is due to the conservative nature of writing during that time. Scribes wrote formal and often outdated forms of the language, not the everyday speech used by people.

5. As English evolved, it continued to absorb influences from various sources, leading to its status as a 'magnificent bastard tongue' today—a language rich in borrowed features from many different languages and cultures.

6. The lesson here is that English has always been a mix of influences, starting with its early form as a hybrid of proto-Germanic and Saxon (Frisian), which was later shaped by Celtic grammar. This history of blending and adaptation is what makes English so diverse and dynamic today.

Checking Linguistics Myths/05 - From Insider Language to Lingua Franca.txt
 The video discusses the complexity of languages, particularly focusing on the Keresan language Navajo (Diné bizaad). It highlights that many people assume complex grammatical structures are difficult, but in reality, this complexity is normal for languages around the world, especially those that have not been influenced by large-scale adult learning due to recent technological and social changes.

The video suggests that for most of human history, small bands of people lived in isolation, with each group having a complex language that was passed down through generations without the influence of large numbers of adults from outside groups. This would have been the norm until relatively recently, with the onset of agriculture and subsequent population movements leading to more contact between different linguistic groups.

In these pre-agricultural societies, there was little need for people to learn each other's languages, as they were already fluent in their own and had no reason to move or interact extensively with others. The spread of a language typically occurred through the expansion of the group speaking that language, rather than through adult learning.

The video posits that the simplicity of modern languages like English is an anomaly, resulting from historical processes that led to large populations moving and imposing their languages on others. This has created a situation where English, for example, has simplified its grammar to accommodate new speakers who are adults encountering the language as a second language.

In essence, the video argues that what we consider complex in a language like Navajo is actually the norm, and what we find simple in languages like English is a result of historical linguistic shifts influenced by large-scale population movements and colonization.

Checking Linguistics Myths/06 - English as Easy German.txt
1. In this part of the lecture, Duncan describes the nature of the German language, its grammatical complexity, and the concept of language having a spirit or inner geist that can influence its use—leading to either simple or elaborate expression.

2. He contrasts German with English, suggesting that English seems to favor terse and direct communication, possibly due to historical events that reshaped the language into its current form.

3. Duncan explains that a language's spirit, like that of German, is not a tangible entity but rather a reflection of how we perceive the development and evolution of a language over time.

4. He uses Indonesian as an example of a language that has not undergone significant change, maintaining its simplicity with terms like "ini" (this) and "itu" (that).

5. English is described as exoteric—meaning it appears to be on the outside as if something fundamental happened to it, making it more regularized than languages like old English, which had complex grammar with case endings and verb conjugations.

6. Duncan likens modern English to a "heritage" version of older forms of the language, which has been regularized through codification but still bears the marks of its past complexity.

7. He emphasizes that the uniformity seen in words like "walk" repeated without variation is not accidental but suggests a historical event or series of events that reshaped English, much like a fire might leave behind only certain remnants of houses it has destroyed.

8. Finally, Duncan sets up the expectation for the next lecture, where he will discuss who or what could have been responsible for this "burning" or transformation of the English language. The implication is that this was a deliberate act by people, possibly through conquest, colonization, or other forms of linguistic influence and change.

Checking Linguistics Myths/07 - The Viking Conquest of English.txt
1. English has a unique history among languages due to its Celtic roots, influenced by the Celts, and later transformed by the Norse invasions, which led to the adoption of many Norse words and the simplification of its grammatical structure—a process that made English a "Germanic-Junior" language.

2. English's history has been characterized as chaotic due to the mixing of languages and influences, which has resulted in a streamlined and relatively uncluttered language compared to many others. This has often been described metaphorically as direct, muscular, or clean.

3. The uniquely uncluttered nature of English is not just about its vocabulary but also about its grammar and structure, which were simplified during its historical development.

4. While English is less complex than languages like Navajo or even German, it is more streamlined than these due to historical processes that stripped away unnecessary complexities.

5. The stripping down of English's complexity was a gradual process, with languages like German being less complicated than Navajo but more so than English.

6. English's level of simplicity can be contrasted with the complexity of Creole languages, which are even simpler as they arise from the simplification of contact between different language systems.

7. Black English Vernacular (BEV) is an example of a form of English that is more streamlined than Standard English due to historical processes similar to those that shaped Modern English.

8. The eclectic and somewhat eccentric history of English has led to its status as a global lingua franca, with a vocabulary enriched by contributions from many languages. This will be further discussed in the next lecture.

Checking Linguistics Myths/08 - How the Words of Modern English Emerged.txt
1. The English language has a vast vocabulary, with the Oxford English Dictionary containing approximately 170,000 words. This richness is not only due to the sheer number of distinct meanings for each word but also to the interplay between words and their evolving definitions over time.

2. Some words in English have multiple forms that trace back to Old English or other historical stages of the language. For example, "most" and "mast" both come from Old English, with "most" being more commonly used in Modern English. The choice between these forms is arbitrary, as both were once dialectally variant expressions of the same concept.

3. The evolution of words can be random and sometimes humorous. Words like "Lord" (from loaf ward) and "lady" (from laf digger, meaning one who kneads the loaf) show how meanings can shift over time through processes of language use and pronunciation.

4. Writing plays a crucial role in preserving vocabulary by recording different stages of language use and by keeping words alive that might otherwise be forgotten or fall out of use.

5. The English language is characterized by a dynamic process where new words are constantly being created, whether through compounding (e.g., "blog" from weblog), blending (e.g., "smog"), clipping (e.g., "ad" from advertisement), or other linguistic processes. This reflects the ongoing evolution of English vocabulary.

Checking Linguistics Myths/09 - Black English-The Streamlining Continues.txt
 The discussion here revolves around the complexity and evolution of languages, particularly focusing on Scots and Black English. The speaker highlights that Scots has irregular past forms that are more complex than what most English speakers are used to, which can seem quaint or incomprehensible. This complexity is a result of the language's historical development from Proto-Indo-European through Proto-Germanic and into Old English, shedding some of its original complexity along the way.

Black English, on the other hand, is described as a more streamlined form of English that has retained some complexities but also shed others. It's a dialect that has developed over time, particularly after the introduction of English to Africa through the Atlantic slave trade. The speaker emphasizes that Black English is not just about slang or being street; it's a rich and evolving language with its own grammar and rules.

The speaker draws parallels between the development of all languages over time, including standard English, which has also undergone changes and simplifications. The eternal aspect of Black English is its unique form of English, which is distinct but still part of the larger English linguistic family.

In essence, the speaker argues that Black English, like any other language variety, is a living system that continues to change and adapt, with its own set of rules and structures that are every bit as complex and beautiful as those found in standard English or any other dialect. The Martian might find the intricacies of Black English fascinating, not just because of its slang but because of its deep linguistic history and ongoing evolution.

The course is then set to explore why we have language standards and what these standards mean for different dialects and languages, including how they shape our perceptions of language correctness and identity.

Checking Linguistics Myths/10 - Honored Conceits of Blackboard Grammar.txt
1. **Prescriptive Grammar vs. Descriptive Linguistics**: The lecture contrasts prescriptive grammar, which dictates how a language ought to be spoken or written, with descriptive linguistics, which simply describes how a language is actually used by its speakers and writers. Robert Loth, an 18th-century linguist, was a proponent of prescriptive grammar.

2. **Robert Loth's Influence**: Loth believed in maintaining certain aspects of English, such as the use of the second person subjunctive "lest you weren't sick" over the past subjunctive "lest you was't sick." He also had specific preferences for past tense forms and the plural form of "chick," which he referred to as "chicken."

3. **Changes in Language**: Despite Loth's efforts, English has continued to evolve. Words and usage that were once considered correct have changed, and what was prescriptive at one time is now descriptive. The language adapts over time, often without a central authority dictating its course.

4. **Historical Context of Prescriptivism**: The notion of maintaining certain linguistic forms was based on historical contingencies and the beliefs of the time, rather than immutable truths about language. Loth's work represents one attempt among many to control or shape language change.

5. **Modern Language Relationship**: In the modern context, we have a more flexible and individual relationship with prescriptive grammar. We recognize that all languages, including English, are dynamic and constantly changing. Our understanding of grammar is informed by both historical prescriptivism and contemporary descriptive evidence.

6. **Moving Forward**: The course will explore further ways to forge a personal relationship with prescriptive grammar, understanding its role in the past and its relevance in the present. This includes recognizing that our use of language reflects both tradition and innovation.

Checking Linguistics Myths/11 - Pronoun Fashions Come and Go.txt
1. Pronouns can be very complex in different languages, with some languages like Quia having multiple forms for "we" depending on the number of people involved.
2. English has a relatively simple pronoun system compared to some other languages, but it still has its own idiosyncrasies and exceptions.
3. The idea that pronouns can be neatly categorized into subject and object roles is an oversimplification and doesn't accurately reflect how pronouns function in natural language use.
4. There are no universal grammar rules that apply across all languages, and the "it is I" vs. "it is me" distinction is one example of this complexity.
5. Pronoun usage is influenced by social context, formality, and regional variation, rather than strict logical rules.
6. The rules of language are often more a matter of fashion or convention than pure logic, similar to the way hemlines change over time.
7. In English, as in many languages, there are numerous exceptions and irregularities in pronoun usage that learners must adapt to, rather than following a set of consistent rules.
8. The lecture emphasizes the importance of understanding the natural, thoroughly awesome system of English grammar beyond traditional prescriptive grammar rules.
9. The next lecture will delve deeper into the nature of language rules and our relationship with following them in different contexts.

Checking Linguistics Myths/12 - Wrong Then, Proper Now-and Vice Versa.txt
1. The video discusses the use of unconjugated verbs like "don't" in historical texts, citing examples from Shakespeare and Dickens where such forms were considered proper. It highlights that language evolves over time, and what is acceptable can change.

2. The video points out that Ann Bradstreet, an American poet of the 17th century, used standard English of her time, which included unconjugated verbs like "don't" in formal writing, demonstrating that even in the past, such forms were not necessarily colloquial.

3. The concept of language change over time is compared to fashion, noting that both can be arbitrary and reflect societal norms without any particular systematic reason. This is illustrated by how Aunt Betsy's hairstyle, considered beautiful in her day, might now be seen as outdated.

4. The video emphasizes the importance of understanding the history of language to appreciate its evolution and to make informed decisions about how we use it today. It suggests that by looking at past usages, we can gain insight into our current linguistic practices and how they might change in the future.

5. William Cobbett and Charles Dickens are cited as authors who provide evidence of the changing nature of proper English over time. The video concludes by encouraging viewers to consider the historical context of language use when evaluating what is "right" or "proper" in language.

Checking Linguistics Myths/13 - A Procession of Accidents and Fossils.txt
1. The sentence "Ned and his health" demonstrates the use of the 'th' suffix in English, which can be attached to adjectives to form nouns (e.g., wealth, health). This suffix is a tail bone or a skeuomorph in language, where an old form persists even though its original meaning may have changed or become obscure.

2. The 'th' suffix cannot be added arbitrarily to any word; it is limited to certain roots that historically took this ending (like strong becoming strength). New words cannot naturally incorporate the 'th' suffix, and attempts to do so might create nonsensical or humorous results (e.g., "shalloth" from old "youth").

3. English is a dynamic language with elements that are alive, dead, or somewhere in between. It has a mix of systematic patterns and idiosyncratic exceptions, making it both orderly and disorderly. This complexity is part of what makes English rich and full of unexpected twists, like the evolution of some to "somewhat" or "sum" (with the latter having a hint of life in it).

4. The 'th' suffix is an example of how language evolves and retains elements that may no longer have a direct connection to their original forms, reflecting the historical layers and the living nature of language. As learners and users of English, we must acknowledge and embrace this inherent disorder and the skeuomorphic aspects of our language to truly understand its complexity and beauty.

Checking Linguistics Myths/14 - The Pursuit of Logic in Language.txt
 The video discusses the complexities and illogical nature of English language usage, particularly focusing on sentences that may seem nonsensical if taken strictly at face value due to the arbitrary nature of language rules. The speaker uses examples like "There were water and mud on the table" versus "There were books on the table" to illustrate how language doesn't always adhere to logical consistency.

The speaker also points out the usage of "just" in sentences, such as "You just can't get enough" versus "You just can't walk into the room and scream." These examples demonstrate that language evolves and that certain phrases become so common they change how we use auxiliary verbs like "can't." The speaker emphasizes that while some may find these inconsistencies bothersome, they are inherent in the nature of language.

The video goes on to explain that certain word orders, such as "is he not?" vs. "isn't he?" are arbitrary and have been established over time, regardless of their logical sequence. The speaker humorously notes that these irregularities might have annoyed someone long ago but are now an accepted part of language.

In conclusion, the video aims to highlight that language is full of exceptions and historical anomalies that don't always make sense from a purely logical standpoint. It serves as a reminder that language evolves and often defies strict logic, which can be both fascinating and maddening for those who try to understand its intricacies.

Checking Linguistics Myths/15 - Clarity as the Logic of Language.txt
 In this lecture, we discussed the common colloquial expression "I ain't," which is often considered substandard but actually makes sense in its own way. The example from the radio sitcom "Our Miss Brooks" illustrates how language can be full of illogic that we accept and use regularly. The concern with clarity rather than strict adherence to grammatical logic was emphasized, as it is often the case that what we consider "illogical" in English does not lead to misunderstandings, provided the communication is clear.

The lecture challenged the idea that language must always be logical in the same way as mathematical logic and suggested that our appreciation for certain illogical aspects of language contributes to its charm. Clarity is what matters most in communication, not the pursuit of an idealized grammatical order.

Looking forward, we will explore how Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style" can guide us towards clarity in our writing and speech, despite some of the questionable linguistic rules it might enforce. The next lecture will delve into how we can use this guide to achieve fashionable clarity in our communication while recognizing that language is a complex and sometimes illogical system that we all navigate effectively every day.

Checking Linguistics Myths/16 - 20th-Century Fashions from Strunk & White.txt
1. The discussion revolves around the evolution of language and how perceptions of correct usage can change over time. Henry Fowler's "A Dictionary of Modern English Usage" is highlighted as an example of prescriptivist grammar, which provides a snapshot of what was considered correct by educated individuals at the time it was written.

2. Fowler's views on words like "aggravate" and "obnoxious" illustrate how language use can be contentious and subject to change. While Fowler preferred the original meanings of these words, their usage has shifted over time to reflect a different understanding among the general population.

3. The Fowler book is not a scientific or authoritative guide but rather a reflection of one person's aesthetic judgment at a specific point in history. It serves as an interesting historical document that reveals the values and preferences of its time.

4. Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style" can be seen in a similar light, as a clever aesthetic manual rather than a definitive scientific guide to English usage.

5. The lecture emphasizes that for a more authoritative understanding of English grammar and usage, one should look to linguistic studies from the modern era, which provide a systematic and consistent approach to language analysis.

6. In the next two lectures, the course will explore these more recent perspectives on English usage, offering insights into how language is studied and understood by linguists today. These insights may challenge some of the prescriptive notions found in older style guides but are grounded in a scientific approach to language.

Checking Linguistics Myths/17 - The Kinds of Grammar You Don't Hear About.txt
1. **Passive Constructions**: The passive voice in English has two different types based on the distinction between unergative and unaccusative verbs. This is important because it affects how we express actions that are not directly performed by an agent (unaccusative) versus those that are performed by an agent who is also the subject of the action (unergative).

2. **Get Passive**: Often used for unaccusative verbs, especially when the action involves a change of state or an event rather than an action performed on an object. For example, "He was praised" vs. "He was punished."

3. **Be Passive**: Used with both types of verbs, but with unergative verbs (actions performed by an agent who is also the subject), it often implies a passive or unfortunate experience. For example, "The report was written by him" vs. "His homework got done last night."

4. **Grammar Learning**: When learning a new language, one must understand not just isolated rules but the broader system behind them. This includes understanding the differences between mass and count nouns, which can affect how passives are used.

5. **Language Variation**: Different languages have different ways of expressing passives and other grammatical concepts. For example, Vietnamese has a passive marker that indicates misfortune, which is not directly paralleled in English but can be reflected in expressions like "He got schooled" or "He got served."

6. **Language Mastery**: Mastering a language's grammar involves understanding these subtle distinctions and being able to use them appropriately in communication. Non-native speakers may make mistakes that reveal their mastery level of such distinctions.

7. **Grammar as Systematic**: Grammar is a complex system, not a set of rules to be followed or broken. It's a set of conventions that facilitate clear and effective communication. Understanding this system can lead to a deeper appreciation of the language and its nuances.

In summary, grammar is a rich and dynamic aspect of language that goes beyond simple rules, encompassing a wide range of constructions, including passives, which are essential for expressing various meanings in English. Mastery of these constructions allows speakers to communicate effectively and to convey subtle distinctions in meaning.

Checking Linguistics Myths/18 - Linguists Uncovering Grammar We All Use.txt
 In this video, the speaker discusses the intricacies of the word "own" in English, highlighting how it's used in various ways that might confuse learners. While "my own" is correct, saying "a own place" or "I have an own car" is incorrect because English has specific conventions for using possessives. The speaker points out that these idiomatic uses of "own" are something native speakers know intuitively, but can be puzzling to those learning the language.

The video also touches on the complexity and pride associated with mastering the nuances of English grammar. Native speakers have a deep understanding of their language's structure, which includes subtle distinctions like the use of "own" or the hypothetical marker that is an integral part of the English language but can be challenging for non-native speakers to grasp.

The speaker notes that English has a rich set of expressions and constructions that are not always straightforward, such as using "up" in phrases like "I'm frying up some eggs," or choosing between "look" and "have a look." These elements add to the complexity of the language but also contribute to its character and expressiveness.

Overall, the video emphasizes that English is a complex language with many unwritten rules and idiomatic expressions that native speakers learn over time. It's this complexity that non-native speakers often find daunting when trying to master the language.

Checking Linguistics Myths/19 - Speech versus Writing-Different Languages.txt
1. **Language Variation**: The spoken and written forms of any language often differ significantly, especially in societies where there is a clear division between high (formal, literary) and low (informal, colloquial) language use. This is evident in Sinhalese, a language with a wide gap between its formal and informal registers.

2. **Formal vs. Informal Usage**: In literary Sinhalese, to say "he is a teacher," one would use the words "hetema," "goveyak," and "veyi" for he, teacher, and is respectively. However, in everyday speech, even among educated individuals, this changes to "aya" for he, "goveyak" for teacher, with no explicit verb for is.

3. **Language Accessibility**: The disparity between formal and informal language can create barriers for those who have not mastered the literary variety, potentially disadvantaging them in various aspects of life beyond basic tasks like chopping potatoes.

4. **Historical Context**: Aldous Huxley's work points out that people may become accustomed to a significant gap between everyday language and formal or written language, as seen in his character's critique of the artificiality of certain literary works compared to the simplicity of Beowulf.

5. **Societal Changes**: Over the centuries, with widespread literacy, there has been a trend towards using more elaborate language forms in public discourse. However, in recent decades (40-50 years), there has been a shift towards greater informality in public speech, which is both unique to modern society and subject to celebration and concern.

6. **Public Speech Evolution**: The next lecture will delve deeper into how this shift in language use—from formal to informal—has impacted our sense of public speaking and what it means for communication in contemporary society.

Checking Linguistics Myths/20 - Speechmaking-From Oratory to Plain Speaking.txt
1. **Oratory vs. Logical Brilliance**: The lecture begins by discussing the difference between being an orator and possessing logical brilliance or insight. It notes that William Jennings Bryan, known for his oratory skills, was described by an acquaintance as someone whose thoughts were vague and did not always coalesce into a clear or practical position. This suggests that while oratory can be persuasive, it is not necessarily indicative of logical prowess.

2. **Balancing Oratorical Styles**: The lecture emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between an old-style oratorical approach and a more casual, accessible style in public speaking. It points out that to be effective today, speakers need to sound relatable but also avoid lapsing into a written-only style of communication.

3. **Woodrow Wilson's Speaking Style**: The lecture uses Woodrow Wilson as an example of someone who could effectively balance the two styles. Wilson was capable of making detailed, persuasive speeches on complex issues while still maintaining accessibility and sounding somewhat like a "common man." His approach was to address concerns directly and provide clear explanations to counter objections.

4. **Changes in Communication Over Time**: The lecture also touches on how communication has evolved, with a shift towards preferring more casual oral expressions over formal, written language. This evolution extends beyond speech to writing, where the lines between public and private language have become increasingly blurred.

5. **Public vs. Private Sphere in Writing**: The next lecture is anticipated to delve into how our conception of writing has changed, with a focus on how we differentiate between formal writing for public consumption and more informal writing in the private sphere. It will likely explore how these distinctions have evolved with modern communication trends.

Checking Linguistics Myths/21 - The Old and New Styles of Writing.txt
 The passage from the fifth McCarthy reader reflects on the nature of writing and its evolution over time. It suggests that traditional writing, particularly the kind associated with educational texts like the MacGuffey readers, can be as hard to swallow as eating corn flakes smothered in too much sugar. This style of writing is depicted in the passage as overly ornate and not particularly relevant or engaging, especially for a child in America trying to make sense of life.

The author notes that writing used to be closely associated with the style of prose one might find in historical texts, such as those written by Civil War surgeons. In contrast, the author proposes Stephen J. Gould as a contemporary model for effective and accessible writing that is neither overly formal nor "dumbed down."

The author also reflects on the physical aspects of writing throughout history, from the laborious process of using a pencil to the more recent advancements with typewriters, which still required effort, to modern word processing technology, which has made writing much easier and more accessible. This ease has led to a significant change in our relationship with writing, as we might expect a greater prevalence of written expression if the act of writing was as physically easy as it is now.

However, this has not resulted in an increase in poetry or poetic expression as one might have anticipated a century ago. Instead, there has been a shift in our relationship with speech-making and writing itself. The author suggests that these changes are worth exploring further, particularly in understanding the human universal of poetry and how it fits into contemporary society. The author intends to delve deeper into these changes in the next lecture.

Checking Linguistics Myths/22 - Got Poetry - Language with Spice.txt
 In this lecture, John Green discusses the role of structured rhyming in music, particularly in Disney films like "The Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin," noting that such tight rhyming is often seen as training wheels for children. He contrasts this with the type of poetry favored by adults, which is more abstract, individual, and less focused on strict rhyme and rhythm. John argues that dismissing casual language or forms like the Edna St. Vincent Millay style would be a limitation, as all forms of language have their place and value.

He suggests that embracing structured poetry can enrich one's vocabulary and understanding of syntax, and proposes an activity where one could read an old-fashioned poem out loud to someone else before bed to aid memory and education. This practice can help maintain a connection with the formal aspects of language that might otherwise be lost in everyday informal speech.

John teases the idea for the next lecture, which will explore the role of texting in modern communication and whether it should be considered a form of writing at all, and what implications that might have for our understanding of language and communication in the digital age.

Checking Linguistics Myths/23 - Why Texting Is Misunderstood.txt
 The discussion revolves around the idea of a comprehensive linguistic culture that includes all four aspects of language use: informal orality (everyday conversation), formal written communication (traditional essays, legal documents), formal orality (public speaking, oratory), and informal writing (texting, social media posts). The latter, often dismissed as mere casual communication, can be a form of art and creativity when done with skill. The ideal society would value and cultivate proficiency in all four areas, encouraging individuals to refine their abilities across the board. This holistic approach to language not only enriches personal expression but also contributes to cultural diversity and innovation.

Checking Linguistics Myths/24 - The Living Past and Future of English.txt
1. **Brand New**: The phrase "brand new" doesn't necessarily have a direct translation in other languages, but it means something is completely new or has just been created.

2. **Pitch Black**: This means the color of the darkness is as dark as it can possibly be, often used when there is no light at all.

3. **Hot Pink**: When something is very pink, we might describe its intensity as "hot pink." It's a specific shade that conveys brightness and vividness.

4. **Soaking Wet**: This term is used to describe someone or something that has absorbed a large amount of water and is visibly saturated.

5. **Dead Quiet**: This means there is complete silence, no sound at all.

6. **Pencil Thin**: To be "pencil thin" means to be extremely thin, as if one could be the same thickness as a pencil.

7. **English's Future**: English will continue to evolve with greater diversity, particularly among younger people and in digital communication forms like emails and texting.
