What we've seen so far is that the modern English that we know is actually an abbreviation
of something that was once much more complex, old English.
Now at this point we are going to come to the end of this arc of the course and we're
going to see that we can look at colloquial English of all kinds in the times that we
live in in different ways and that that in turn can give us a different sense of the
standard English that we speak.
And an example of this is of all things the colloquial English of black Americans which
is known in some quarters as African American vernacular English or more economically and
in this course black English.
And one reason that black English is interesting is because it's quickly becoming a kind of
lingua franca of American youth of all shades.
But it's also of interest and particularly in this course because often and quite understand
the belief black English is viewed as bad grammar when in fact what black English is
is this and this is really important.
Black English is a continuation of the exact same process that led from that great grandfather
language proto-Indo-European to modern standard English today.
Now before we dwell on this we have to understand what I mean by black English because often
if you hear somebody refer to black English to the extent that you allow that there's
such thing as an English that is common to black American people you might think that
what I'm talking about is slang and various expressions.
And I'm not even going to use any of the expressions right now because they are like all slang
with all people transitorians.
So if I use anything now then about ten minutes from now the whole course will look antique.
But you probably know what I mean and if you don't just turn on the radio and wait for
about five minutes.
But the fact of the matter is the slang is part of the dialect but it just keeps going
by it's always different.
In the linguistic sense what I mean by black English is the grammatical constructions that
are typical of the dialect.
Yes grammatical constructions despite the fact that often what I'm calling a grammatical
construction in black English is processed understandably as mistakes.
So what I mean is the mistakes.
This is an example of what I mean by black English and this is what's important about
this passage.
There's no slang in it yet this is what we mean by black English.
Now I'm going to read it out in my voice which has been described as sounding like a 50 year
old white insurance salesman.
The person who described it that way was me and I believe that it's accurate.
But that's the point to show that we're talking about these constructions in this English
language without any cultural associations that you may have with it.
So here we go.
In a girl named Shirley Jones live in Washington.
Most everybody on the street like her because she a nice girl.
Shirley treat all of them just like they was her sister and brother but most of all she
is like one boy named Charles.
But Shirley keep away from Charles most of the time because she start to liken him so
much she be scared of him.
So Charles you don't hardly say nothing to her neither.
Still that girl got to go around telling everybody Charles supposed to be liking her.
Now that sounds like a very ordinary passage of what you might associate more with a black
American than even a white southern American and linguists have shown that there is a cluster
of features involving both sound and grammar which are much more typical of black people
than white people including white southerners that's black English and so for example it
a girl instead of there's a girl.
That one may sound odd if I isolate it like that especially in my you know old Disney
film announcer voice but if you haven't heard somebody say it a girl or it's a book on the
table or something along those lines then go out and if you can do this in any socially
graceful fashion listen to some African American people and give it about 10 minutes and you'll
hear it use that way.
Or everybody on the street like her instead of likes her you have what we process as
unconjugated verbs and remember that standard English's conjugations are really rather
paltry we're talking about in this case leaving off that stray third person singular s but
it's not there.
Or she a nice girl so the B verb is omitted so not she's but she a nice girl or don't
hardly say nothing double negatives and we're taught that those are a terrible thing well
black English it's full of those.
So is this just bad grammar or if it isn't bad grammar then whatever it is why is it
that so many black people talk that way.
Well the reason is interesting and it really does bring us full circle in understanding
what this thing called English is in all of its facets.
Now here is one argument that some people have given that pops up in the media every now and
then and we've got to get rid of that argument as fascinating as it is it's one of these
things that you want to be true and therefore because life is hard it turns out that it
isn't.
You will hear people saying that black English is African grammar with English words and
that this is just something that isn't always obvious but that the difference between standard
English and black English is that really with black English you're listening to an African
language here in the United States except dressed up with English words that would be really
cool like most things where you put wood and really cool together it's not true.
For example slaves brought to America spoke a great many languages.
Africa as a continent is home to about a thousand languages and even if you're only talking
about the West African coast which is where slaves were brought to America from you're
talking about so very many recently I was giving a talk and one woman asked in the question
session so talk about African languages and I was thinking to myself that's like being
talking about plants they're just so many different ones and so probably in terms of
even the ones that were highly represented you're talking about a dozen languages and
more to the point those languages to the extent that they're related to the extent that they
could possibly be a dominant pattern that this African black English were based on the
problem is that those languages don't pattern anything like not only English but black
English and so for example in Ghana one of those languages is called Shwee in Nigeria
there's one called Yoruba those languages are broadly related but for example if you wanted
to say I put the crab on the table the way that you put it in those languages is I take
crab put table on it's rather similar to the way you would put it in Chinese not anything
like you would put it in even black English you have never heard any black man say I take
crab put table on yo that's absurd and that's because what that man is speaking is certainly
different from standard English but it doesn't have anything to do with Ghana or Nigeria
or an African language of that area the West African coast tends to have syllables that
end in vowels and so the structure tends to be rather like bo ke la fo that's a nonsense
sentence but that tends to be the structure unlike a language like English where you say
bed hook etc. now for example there's the Swahili phrase in the Lion King Hakuna Matata
and that means you know there's no problem everything is okay that is typical of how
especially West African languages Swahili happens not to be one but West African languages pattern
Hakuna Matata that's not how black English sounds because black English is not an African
language in any significant way and so we have to come up with something else when we're
trying to figure out why black English is the way that it is and before we truly zero in
on the issue of why black English is the way it is in terms of what we perceive we have to
take a slight detour one more the African thing was one one more detour and think about the fact
that there's a lot more in black English than meets I should say the ear and so for example
a lot of what we might hear to the extent that we hear it as slang is actually grammar so
here's an example and you would never think of it this way but it's actually very interesting
if you just listen you'll hear somebody I have heard somebody say what are these people doing
up in my house and there's this usage of up now what's interesting is that if you got to know that
person you might very well find that that person does not live high up in some apartment building
they do not live on a hill a person will say that when they live on the ground floor I knew
somebody who said that and I knew that person and they didn't live up anything and they were
talking about up in the house and of course if you hear it once you think well there's
that person or it was just random or you misheard but if you listen if you've you know gone to a mall
or wherever you went so you could hear people saying it a girl named Shirley Jones listen for
the up it's it's everywhere that up has a meaning but it has nothing to do with verticality
what that up means is of all things it's the up of intimacy that up has the same use as
an adverber preposition as calling somebody named Robert Bob does when you're dealing with a name
when you say that you're up at someone's house in black English what you mean is not that you're on the
40th floor you mean that their house is somewhere that you happen to be comfortable you're in your
comfort zone this is somewhere that you either live up in my house or it's a friend and so you're
up at your friend's house so for example if you said I was up at Mr. Taylor's in black English
that doesn't mean that he lives uptown he probably doesn't it means that Mr. Taylor is a long time
friend of the family or something like that this is what's important about up in standard English
you can convey that it's certainly possible in standard English to convey that you're comfortable
somewhere but in order to do that you'd have to say I was at Mr. Taylor's house a man with whom I
have a long-standing and comfortable relationship that's nice but wouldn't it be nice if you could
just say up black people can so that's what that is which means that that up is grammar if we were
talking about a language spoken by 3000 tribes people in the middle of Burma then that up would be
processed as a piece of grammar that one has to learn so that's a kind of grammar that's in black
English that is not in standard English those sorts of things are quite common and in addition it
should be remembered that black English has 95% that's a random percentage but I'm going to give it
anyway 95% of the things that make standard English hard so for example standard English has a regular
plural like children when is the last time you ever heard a black person say child's never or you
never hear a black person say think or come that's not there and so if a Martian and I use this Martian
all the time I'll bet this Martian is tired of learning languages tired of going back in time but
this Martian if you brought him down for some reason it's a man and had him learn black English
instead of going to Connecticut and learning standard English well Connecticut outside of many
neighborhoods in Hartford then the Martian would have as hard a time with black English as the
Martian would have with trying to learn English from from Brian Williams or somebody else so what
this means is that with black English we can look at the English language soundscape or better we can
listen to it in a brand new way and the analogy if we're going to pull the camera back is for
example Italy you look at the Godfather and their scenes where they're in Sicily and they're
subtitling the fact is if you have schoolboy Italian a frustrating thing about those scenes is
that you have a hard time understanding about half of what anybody says anyway and it's because
really they're speaking Sicilian Italian which is a completely different dialect than standard
Tuscan Italian really if the dice were rolled differently in terms of Italian history Sicilian
would be considered a separate language and so if you know from your school switch the gender
girl Italian that our bread is il nostro pane and of course all Italians have that accent that's
the way I always do Italians il nostro pane in Sicilian you don't have to know these languages
to hear that it's different when somebody says il nostro panuzzo Sicilians have lower voices I
think and so il nostro pane il nostro panuzzo quite different black English and standard
English have that same relationship and so black English is not bad standard English it is a
different kind of English which means that we have a diversity of speech varieties along the Italian
lines so it's not that black English is a bad habit is that we have different kinds and so il
nostro pane il nostro panuzzo tomorrow I will write to you tomorrow I'ma write you same thing
exact same relationship linguistically except and now here's where we get to the good part I am
leaving something out the relationship between black English and standard English is not exactly
the same as the one between Sicilian and standard Italian because you can readily perceive the fact
is that black English does seem to so often not have something that standard English has or it's
undoing what standard English has and so you've got the unconjugated verbs you've got the omitted
B verbs not new ones omitted B verbs so if black English isn't broken language then if maybe deep
in the night when you know that nobody's listening you find yourself mumbling why is black
English different from standard English in a subtractive way I'm sure you've all mumbled that in
your sleep at some point well you know it's okay that is a genuine question that is a legitimate
question and the reason for it is very similar to the reason that right now I am speaking truly
crappy old English the reason is that black English was created in case you hadn't heard by
slaves so the first black people brought to the United States tended to be slaves and they were
learning English as adults and the Vikings and so as we would expect English learn by these slaves
got a close shave if you're 30 years old and you're learning English out you know you're
learning there are no books nobody's teaching it to you deliberately you could learn pretty darn
good English but it's not going to be English exactly like the people who are native English
speakers who you are working under or around or next to so in terms of the terminology that
we've seen black English is an exoteric kind of dialect it's a matter of adults learning it
rather than kids so just like old English was beaten up a little by Vikings and now I of all
people am talking the way Vikings talked in England 4,000 years ago well black English is what
happened when more adults with the same ossified language learning capacities as those Vikings
hit English once again and they produced an English that is slightly streamlined compared to what
they were hearing and that is now still used by the majority of black Americans today and in order
you know we did Sicilian but if we're going to pull the camera back and use a really perfect
comparison then of all things it is Hebrew. Hebrew is a language very dear to me because it was the
first one that I encountered where I realized that there were ways of speaking other than English
it was one day in 1969 I imagine it with Kodak film and it was this little Israeli girl in
overalls her name as it happens was Shirley, Shirley guys Shirley if you by any chance are seeing this
please write me I have missed you since we were 4 years old but Hebrew is exactly the same thing
modern Hebrew if we compare it to biblical Hebrew because modern Hebrew is what happened when
in the late 19th century various adults were brought to what would become Israel and Hebrew was
brought essentially back from the page it had been spoken to a certain extent for liturgical
purposes but it was no longer really a spoken language in any colloquial sense and it was brought
from the page to be the language of Israel by grown-ups who were speaking Yiddish and a great
many other things now what would you expect would happen then we're back to the Vikings it
happened with the Vikings it happened with the slaves it happened with these adults they're raising
kids they're cutting up carrots they're talking about how pretty the sky is they have a lot to do
are they going to learn perfect biblical Hebrew well certainly not and so as a result biblical
Hebrew had some guttural sounds just like Arabic seems to be kind of famous for having and so not
just that's nothing but things like you go way back biblical Hebrew was because it's a close
relative of Arabic they are of the Semitic family that we've seen in this course biblical Hebrew
had a couple of those sounds modern Hebrew barely does most speakers don't make those sounds and
that's because those sounds can be harder to pick up if you don't pick them up when you're a baby
if you're not making sounds way back there when you're a kid then by the time you're an adult it's
more difficult you might even find it a little bit embarrassing to go and so you probably don't
modern Hebrew therefore has much less of that than a card carrying on interfered with to make
up a word Semitic language or another thing about modern Hebrew and those of you who went to
Hebrew school may remember this kind of thing it is there's something that's called the construct
and let's forget that it's called anything but if you are speaking Hebrew then there's a way of
saying the A of B so for example if you're talking about dinner you're talking about the evening meal
and one way that you can say that is a RUHA is your meal EREV is evening and you say A RUKAT EREV
and that little T is your oveness so A RUKAT EREV but then if you want to say sons of the covenant
then it's something that we we see often that's BNE BRIT or BNE BRIT and so BNE is son BRIT covenant
BNE BRIT and that A is your oveness again now A RUKAT BNE you have to know which one to use
and there's some rules but they get broken often that construction is one of the more annoying things
about learning the Hebrew language now not surprisingly if you are a modern Hebrew speaker then as often as
not you will undo this A RUKAT EREV and you'll say it in what we would think of as the normal way
it's not normal but it's easier and so meal of the evening A RUKAT SHEL HA EREV meal of the evening
I notice some languages for me are high and that's Italian and Japanese some of them are low
Sicilian and for me Hebrew is always spoken like this and it's because of Shirley's father
somebody please bring me that little girl except now she's of course my age her father said we are speaking Hebrew
and therefore Hebrew is in that voice so A RUKAT SHEL HA EREV meal of the evening
so this means that of all things black English is analogous to modern Hebrew in terms of its relationship
to standard English now no one is under any impression that modern Hebrew is broken biblical Hebrew
there's a historical relationship between the two and if modern Hebrew takes it a little bit lighter than biblical
Hebrew that's because of what happened to it 125 years ago and no one bats an eye it's the same situation
in terms of judgment that we have to have in terms of black English streamlining standard English to a certain extent
because of things that happened a little longer than 125 years ago but the situations are really quite analogous
and what all this means is that it's social history that makes for the differences between dialects of a language
as grammars so anything that we call a language is actually a bundle of dialects and the dialects will have different histories
black English has a heavily exoteric history if we're going to use our terminology but then with other dialects
you'll have a more exoteric history meaning that this is a dialect that has not been learned by outsiders
it's not a matter of English having been picked up by people who were beyond their best language learning capacities
and to take an example of that there is Scottish English or Scots Scots is a dialect of English which culturally
and in some ways structurally is sometimes proposed to be really not English at all but something different
what differentiates it from what we know as quote unquote normal English though is that it's got things in it
that happen when a language has not been beaten up by adults but rather just stewing along as a language does
always accreting needless complexities because that's just what language does
and so for example in Scottish English there's some things that you might think of as quaint
but really it's because we're dealing with this esotericness so I in deep Scots is E and I's is not E's
it's Een and so you have this N plural now we think of oxen and children these remnants more of that in Scottish
because it hasn't been as beaten up the Viking effect wasn't as strong and nobody else has been messing with it
and so for example shoe shin is not odd so not shoes with Scottish accent shoe shin
the plural of horse in good Scottish is just horse so another one of these irregularities
all that's been much more ironed out in English as we know it's Scots Scots Scots these other things
or one in Scots comes in two flavors and really it's a matter of the word one just occasioning more complexity in Scots
than it does in the English that we know so one man one comes before man that one one comes after
now in English that we speak that is probably the dullest fact ever adduced by human being in the history of our species
but in Scottish English it's different because you have Eman that's one man not a man it's one man that's the number
Eman but if you say that one then you say that in and so Eman that in two different words
think of the Martian the Martian would have to learn that it's more complex and a joyous thing
a joyous thing about Scottish I'm becoming elderly joyous a joyous thing about Scottish
is that it's irregular past forms are often much messier than what we're used to so think thought okay
but we have laugh so do that in the present and then if the laughing happened on Tuesday and this isn't Tuesday
then you laughed and then for the participle well laughed again so I have laughed it's not well I have laughed
and nothing like that in Scots in many dialects of Scots then for laugh you've got Loch and so that just seems quaint
but then past is not locked but which we would find quite incomprehensible and then the participles
and that's just one verb and so learning Scots irregular verbs is even harder than learning the ones that we have
so all of that is to say that what we are seeing with black English is something much more interesting
than it's often thought and for reasons that were not often told what black English is of all things is a kind of a tune up
I remember learning that word from my father I still don't really know what it means in terms of a car every now and then
he would disappear for a day and the car would have had a tune up and it didn't seem any different to me
but I know what it means in terms of a language which is that in a way the problems of the language
the needless complexities of the language can be wiped slightly away and so it starts with Proto-Indo-European
which was this fearsome thing and that got streamlined into this Proto-Germanic and that's another lost language
but we know that it was oddly streamlined compared to Proto-Indo-European
Proto-Germanic gets streamlined into Old English
Old English gets streamlined into Modern English and all these are perfectly normal things
and we don't think of Modern English as Proto-Indo-European of the back alleys
we just think that language has changed and if they shed a certain amount of needless complexity
then if there's a value judgment to be put on that which there isn't then it would be good
and then Black English is more of that sort of story
Black English is what happens when you have Modern English getting even more of a close shave
and remaining a complex variety but nevertheless one that has a little bit less of the needless, nasty sorts of bells and whistles
that a language just accretes and then you have other dialects like for example Scots
and this is true of many other dialects of English that have morphed not in these exoteric ways
but in more esoteric ways as time has gone on
and of course then because nothing is clean we've seen that Black English has its esotericities as well
and so that little up which seems kind of slangy or street or random is actually a complication
that has crept in to Black English over time because it's not being learned by slaves now
and if you think about it it's quite rare that an adult walks into a Black American community
with the desire to become fluent in Black English
so now Black English is very much by itself now as opposed to its origins
it is very much an esoteric language so of course it's developing all sorts of new features
that would challenge for example that Martian
and so that is what Black English is
Black English is slang, that's part of it
but in a way that's the least interesting part of it because it keeps changing
what is interesting about Black English in the Handelian sense
as in you've got a beautiful basso continuo that's always there
what's eternal about Black English is that Black English is a kind of English
not bad grammar, it's just different grammar
and to the extent that it seems like less grammar than standard English
the fact is it is very slightly less
but for the same reasons that what we're speaking is less grammar than old English
which was less grammar than proto-Germanic which was less grammar than proto-Indo-European
so these are the sorts of things that happen to all languages
these are the sorts of things that have happened to English
and we see manifestations of it right here in our ordinary lives
in places that we would never look
and now that we've seen that it's time to begin a new module of this course
and take a look at what we think of as language standards and why
