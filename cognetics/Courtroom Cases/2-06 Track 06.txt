His corruption began in the early part of the 20th century when he represented labor unions
Against corporations and against the Pinkerton cops who were hired by the big corporations
And he saw as a lawyer that the process had been corrupted by the corporate side very often that the corporate side
Sent messages to jurors
Indicating that their relatives might suffer consequences if they voted against the corporation
Sending messages not so subtle to witnesses that they would be better off if their testimony was skewed favorable to the corporations and
Against the labor unions and in one early case in his career
Clarence Darrow was actually himself prosecuted for bribing
witnesses in a labor union trial and
In another trial involving the Los Angeles Times and an explosion directed against the Los Angeles Times
Which was very pro-corporation and anti-labor at the time
Clarence Darrow hired a great lawyer to defend him against charges of bribery
But the lawyer didn't do a very good job. And so Clarence Darrow fired the lawyer and made his own closing argument and
One one count of his case and had another as a hung jury
And so he was never successfully prosecuted for
Corruption for bribing jurors and bribing witnesses
But he allegedly told friends of his that he had done that and he told them that proudly
Saying that he did it to level the playing field
He did it in order to make it fair for labor and poor people to get a fair shot in an already corrupt system. Well
As a law professor, I can't myself find that as any kind of a justification for corruption
If you think the other side is corrupt expose it if you think the other side is corrupt of file charges, but you can't
make two wrongs try to come out right and
Lawyers are not under any circumstances
Entitled to pursue their own form of corruption as an antidote or counterweight to other forms of corruption
Well, what does that have to do with the Leopold and Loeb case?
Well, there's a very very interesting story in the case that has never been followed through
Remember, this is Chicago Chicago, Illinois in the year
1924 was there ever a more corrupt city? Was there ever a more corrupt judiciary?
Was there ever a more corrupt political system?
remember that Clarence Darrow purposely
Waves a jury trial in the case and puts the lives of his two
Wealthy clients in the hand of a Chicago judge a product of the Chicago
Political system
Okay, that's just a little bit of background
There's another issue in the case a large portion of the legal fee that was given to Clarence Darrow
Was never accounted for it was supposed to be used for expenses and he would not account for how the expenses
were used
