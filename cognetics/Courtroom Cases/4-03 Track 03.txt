She had had two comas and that was one of the most interesting parts of the case
She had had a coma the year before she went into her final coma, which she is still in today
The first coma she recovered from rather quickly and she never pointed a finger at
Claus von Bulow and for very good reason. She knew what had put her into that first coma her own actions
And she therefore didn't want any investigation in fact
She had told Claus von Bulow if I ever get sick again, don't call a doctor. She hated doctors
She hated doctors being called. She hated ambulances and that resulted in when she went into her second coma Claus von Bulow
Not calling the doctor right away, but finally after seeing that she was in a desperate way
Calling the doctor the first time the doctor was called. He was able to save her and she was back
Conscious shortly after the first coma the second coma nobody was able to bring her out of and that was the coma
Particularly for which Claus von Bulow was placed on trial
The appeal was a very difficult one because we had to persuade an appellate court in Rhode Island
that there was insufficient evidence in the case that
Would justify a conviction of assault with intent to murder or attempted murder
But we also had something very important going for us
In a previous lecture. I mentioned that sometimes
Wealthy people have the resources to defend themselves
Whereas the victims don't have the resources to try to put a case
Forward helping the prosecution in this case the shoe was exactly on the other foot
The victims family the alleged victims family Sonny von Bulow's family was enormously wealthy
they had hundreds of millions of dollars Claus von Bulow was a pauper in comparison and
Was able to pay only relatively reasonable
modest legal fees
But the von Arsberg family Sonny von Bulow's family was able to hire all kinds of lawyers and experts
and those lawyers and experts did their own investigation and
The main lawyer for the von Arsberg family was a very fastidious note-taker
His name was Richard Q and he took very very careful notes of every interview he conducted
Now when we came into the case we decided the first thing we wanted to do was get those notes
We were entitled to see the notes that the private lawyer had taken and turned over to the prosecution and
The court turned us down initially and said no you're not entitled to see those notes
those are notes taken by a lawyer for a private client and
They're not
Prosecutorial notes if they hadn't taken by the prosecutor we'd be entitled to see them
But they're notes taken by a private lawyer
Well on the appeal we argued that point and we were able to win
We got the court of appeals to rule that we were entitled to see
All the notes that the private lawyer took when he conducted his investigation and those notes were a
bonanza
