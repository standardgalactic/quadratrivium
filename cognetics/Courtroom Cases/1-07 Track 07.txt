But Brian did not fall into the trap.
His actual answer was, not six days of 24 hours, he then proceeded to suggest that each
of these days were really periods or epics, and that creation may have taken six million
years or six hundred million years.
Now that doesn't make for such interesting movie making or such interesting drama on
the stage, but that's the reality.
When Clarence Darrow questioned William Jennings' Brian about the biblical story of Joshua
ordering the sun to stand still, he obviously expected Brian to claim that the sun orbited
around the earth, as the Bible surely implies, and as most people in the world believed up
through the Middle Ages.
You'll remember that various famous scientists were subject to the Inquisition and to imprisonment,
Galileo, predominant among them, for espousing the heliocentric theory of the universe, or
at least of our planetary system, that the sun was at the center and that the earth revolved
around it, which violated the teachings of the church during that period of time.
But Brian was no fool, and Brian was no believer in the geocentric theory.
He didn't believe that the sun revolved around the earth, he believed the earth goes around
the sun.
He then proceeded to explain why the divinely inspired author of the account about Joshua
and the sun stopping, why the account of that author, quote, may have used language that
could be understood at that time.
All in all, if you read the transcript of the actual trial of scopes in Tennessee in
1925, it shows Brian doing quite well defending himself, while it is often Darrow who comes
off quite poorly, in fact, as something of an anti-religious bigot, or at least an anti-religious
cynic.
Now, Brian won the case, it wasn't so hard for him to win the case, after all this was
being tried in Dayton in 1925, in a place that was frequently called the Buckle of the
Bible Belt, the center of religious fundamentalism.
