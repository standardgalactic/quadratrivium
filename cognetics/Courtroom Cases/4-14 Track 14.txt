Of course, the great Oliver Wendell Holmes, as usual, got it right when he said careful
calculation should not be expected in the presence of an uplifted knife.
In other words, when you have to make a split second decision, whether it's your life or
the assailant's life, plainly, law professor's logic is not expected to apply in the crisis
moment that that decision has to be made.
And juries clearly favor the innocent alleged victim over the so-called guilty assailant
when the innocent victim uses self-defense and even uses it sometimes disproportionately.
The interesting issue in this case, though, was whether or not Bernard gets his own particular
brand of racism in which he thought that black young people were much more dangerous than
equivalently dressed or equivalently aggressive white people, whether that brand of racism
can be taken into account by a jury in deciding whether or not Bernard gets acted reasonably.
Whether his actions were reasonable to him or whether his actions would be reasonable
to the normal average rider of the New York subway, assuming the normal average rider
of the New York subway did not also harbor some racist feelings.
And so the question raised was whether the reasonable person used to be the reasonable
man, now we've made it gender neutral, the reasonable person, whether the reasonable
person can also include a reasonable racist person or whether the reasonable person, as
judged by a jury, has to be the reasonable egalitarian person, the person who is colorblind.
After all, it was Jesse Jackson, one of the leaders of the African American movement who
once said if he were walking down a dark street and he saw four black kids on one side of
the street and four white kids on the other side of the street, he'd feel more comfortable
walking on the side of the street with the white kids than the black kids.
So even leading black intellectuals and leaders harbor certain views about the dangers, the
imperative dangers of white and black youths, of course, there's never a simple comparison
if the four black youths were wearing crew neck sweaters and well dressed and talking
like college kids and the four white kids were dressed like thugs and walking with an attitude,
the responses may very, very well be different.
But all things considered, if the only factor is race, many, many New Yorkers at that time
and probably many New Yorkers today would take into account race and deciding what was
a reasonable response and what was not a reasonable response.
