Processing Overview for Why Evil Exists
============================
Checking Why Evil Exists/01 The Nature and Origins of Evil.txt
 In this lecture, Professor John Milbank introduces the topic of evil and its various interpretations throughout history. He emphasizes that evil is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been debated by thinkers across different cultures and eras. The lecture sets the stage for exploring these debates over the next 36 lectures, highlighting that our understanding of evil influences how we perceive the world and respond to it.

Milbank begins by referencing Augustine's "Confessions" and Friedrich Nietzsche's critique of Christianity, pointing out that discussions about evil often intersect with questions about human nature, civilization, and the role of personal agency versus societal influence. He mentions the Tower of Babel as an early example of human defiance against divine authority and how modern civilization might be implicated in the Holocaust, suggesting a deep-seated connection between individual actions and broader cultural phenomena.

The professor notes that the question of why evil exists is not one that will be directly answered in these lectures but rather explored through various perspectives. He acknowledges the difficulty in distinguishing between meaningful intellectual engagement with the concept of evil and the potential triviality of such discussions, especially when contrasted with direct life experiences like witnessing suffering or injustice firsthand.

Milbank warns that history can be a strange teacher, and what is taught theoretically may not always align with what is learned through personal observation and experience. However, he also suggests that engaging with historical perspectives on evil can provide valuable insights into the human condition. The lectures aim to offer a survey of different voices and approaches to understanding evil, drawing from a wide range of thinkers and experiences throughout history.

In conclusion, Milbank's introduction sets forth the complexity surrounding the concept of evil and invites listeners to consider how this ancient and ongoing debate shapes our perceptions and responses to the world's darkness. The lectures will delve into these issues, offering a historical perspective on humanity's struggle to comprehend and confront the problem of evil.

Checking Why Evil Exists/02 Enuma Elish—Evil as Cosmic Battle.txt
 In this lecture, we explored the concept of evil within the context of the ancient Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh. The story of Gilgamesh and his quest for immortality is a profound exploration of human mortality, vulnerability to death, and the existential dread that comes with the knowledge of our own finite existence. The epic reflects on the dual nature of human beings as both creators and creatures, capable of greatness yet also subject to the same limitations as all living things.

The narrative of Gilgamesh confronts the reader with the reality of evil and suffering, which is an inescapable part of the human condition. The epic does not offer a clear-cut source of evil, like the biblical fall from grace, but rather presents evil as a pervasive aspect of existence that is intrinsically linked to the human experience.

The story also highlights the importance of human relationships and achievements in overcoming the despair caused by the awareness of mortality. The walls of Uruk, for instance, are a testament to human resilience and ingenuity, and they represent the tangible results of human effort against the backdrop of inevitable death.

Gilgamesh's journey can be seen as an allegory for the human quest for meaning in a world where death is certain. The knowledge of our mortality, which sets us apart from other animals, is both a double curse and a catalyst for understanding what it means to be truly alive. This wisdom, though difficult to fully grasp, is accessible to humans and is central to the human experience.

The epic of Gilgamesh sets the stage for later discussions of evil in Western literature and thought, influencing how these concepts are understood and represented. It presents a dualistic view that will be both challenged and reinforced by other texts and philosophies we'll discuss in subsequent lectures.

In summary, the epic of Gilgamesh offers a complex and nuanced understanding of evil as an integral part of human life, emphasizing the importance of how we live in light of our mortality and the potential for human beings to create meaning and achieve greatness despite the shadow of death. As we move forward, we will compare this perspective with other ways of thinking about evil, adding to our growing understanding of humanity's struggle with these profound questions.

Checking Why Evil Exists/03 Greece—Tragedy and The Peloponnesian War.txt
1. **Thucydides' Account of the Melian Dialogue**: Thucydides, a general in the Peloponnesian War and the author of a detailed history of the conflict, recounts an incident where the Athenians, out of fear of Spartan reprisals, destroy an entire island population, including women and children, despite their previous treatment by the Melians being entirely peaceful. This event starkly contrasts with the Athenians' civilian behavior and was not driven by any strategic necessity but by the perceived need to demonstrate dominance.

2. **Moral Ambiguity in Human Actions**: Thucydides does not interpret the Athenians' cruelty as a moral judgment or as an inherent evil within humans, but rather as a consequence of the context and circumstances they found themselves in. He presents a form of fatalism where the necessity of the situation dictates human behavior, often turning virtues into liabilities and brave individuals into the most vulnerable.

3. **Thucydides' Objectivity**: Thucydides describes his own experience during the war, including his exile, in a detached manner, focusing on the events rather than trying to justify or condemn them. This objectivity is a hallmark of his historical writing and sets him apart from the subjective narratives that politicians might produce.

4. **The Role of Chance and Accident**: Thucydides introduces the idea that suffering, including what might be considered evil, can arise without any discernible cause or purpose. This challenges the notion that there is a straightforward moral order and suggests that human actions and their outcomes are subject to dramatic reversals and unintended consequences.

5. **Greek Tragedy Perspective**: The Greek tragedians and Thucydides both offer a perspective where evil and suffering can arise without intentional malice, highlighting the complex interplay between human agency and the forces of fate or chance. This view stands in contrast to later philosophical interpretations that seek to understand these phenomena through a more rational lens.

In our next lecture, we will explore the philosophical responses to these tragic and fatalistic views, particularly those of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and their followers who believed that human reason could uncover the true nature of the cosmos and provide guidance for navigating the moral challenges faced by individuals and societies.

Checking Why Evil Exists/04 Greek Philosophy—Human Evil and Malice.txt
1. **Ancient Near Eastern Texts**: These texts depict evil as part of a cosmic struggle between the gods or divine forces. Evil is often personified in these texts, with figures like Tiamat or the chaotic god Marduk representing the forces of disorder and destruction. Humans are typically seen as bystanders or recipients of the will of the gods, with less agency in addressing evil themselves.

2. **Greek Philosophical Views**:
   - **Plato**: Evil is a radical challenge that may be due to a metaphysical revolt or a poorly designed society that encourages individuals to act against the Form of the Good. Plato believes that through proper education and social organization, evil can be mitigated, if not eradicated.
   - **Aristotle**: Evil is a more mundane issue, stemming from the natural imperfections in humans and their environment. Aristotle sees humans as a combination of mind and flesh and believes that evil is an unfortunate pathology that can be addressed through proper philosophical detachment and practical wisdom. He is less optimistic about radical human change after childhood compared to Plato.

3. **Debate between Platonism and Aristoteleanism**: The debate between these two views on the nature of evil and the potential for human change remains a central theme throughout the lectures. Plato's view is more dramatic and theological, while Aristotle's is more moderate and practical.

4. **Hebrew Bible/Christian Old Testament**: These texts begin to synthesize the cosmic and human aspects of evil. Evil is often seen as a result of both divine will and human choices. The Old Testament introduces the concept of a moral covenant between humans and God, which implies a greater role for humans in actively engaging with and addressing evil.

5. **Christian New Testament**: The New Testament further develops the idea that evil is not just an external force but also an internal condition that individuals can confront through faith, repentance, and divine grace. It offers a moral framework for understanding and combating evil, emphasizing personal transformation and ethical behavior.

In summary, the concept of evil has been understood in various ways across different cultures and philosophical traditions. From the cosmic struggles depicted in ancient Near Eastern texts to the more human-centric approaches of Greek philosophy, and finally to the synthesis of divine will and human responsibility found in the Hebrew Bible and Christian New Testament, these sources all contribute to our understanding of evil as a complex phenomenon with both external and internal dimensions.

Checking Why Evil Exists/05 The Hebrew Bible—Human Rivalry with God.txt
1. **The Tower of Babel**: This story (Genesis 11) illustrates human ambition and the desire for unity and power as a form of evil. It describes humans attempting to build a tower to heaven, which God interprets as an effort to make a name for themselves and thus usurp divine authority. As a result, God confuses their language, scattering them across the earth and thereby creating diversity in human cultures and languages, which is seen as a divine corrective to human unity and pride.

2. **The Underlying Themes**: The narrative at Babel carries two significant themes:
   - **Divine Fear of Human Unity**: It suggests that when humans act in concert without divine guidance, it is a threat to God's sovereignty. This reflects a theological perspective that human cooperation must be under God's control to be benign.
   - **Cultural and Linguistic Diversity**: The scattering of peoples and the creation of different languages at Babel are seen as a divine response to sin, resulting in the pluralistic world we inhabit today. This diversity is viewed as a sign of human disobedience and fall from grace.

3. **Ambivalence Towards Large-Scale Human Endeavors**: The story sets a pattern for viewing large political organizations, like empires, with suspicion and as potentially corrupt or depraved, which resonates throughout Jewish and Christian traditions.

4. **Theological Dimensions of Evil**: In these stories, evil is depicted as an active force that works in various ways: dividing humans, inciting rivalry, and ultimately challenging the divine order. Rebellion against God is a key aspect of evil, suggesting that God is not responsible for this rebellion but rather it originates from within humanity itself.

5. **God's Innocence**: The biblical narratives maintain that God is innocent of creating a world where humans would revolt against the divine order. This contrasts with other mythologies where gods may support or even initiate human revolts.

6. **The Mystery of Human Motives**: The story raises questions about why humans, especially in a state of innocence like Adam and Eve, would choose to rebel against God's will, which has intrigued theologians, philosophers, and religious leaders for centuries.

7. **A Rival Story**: Alongside the Genesis account, there is another biblical tradition that presents a more complex view of God, suggesting that God may have a murkier or sinister aspect. This rival story will be explored in the next lecture. It challenges the simplicity of the divine goodness and introduces a more nuanced understanding of both God and evil within the biblical narrative.

Checking Why Evil Exists/06 The Hebrew Bible—Wisdom and the Fear of God.txt
1. **Cosmic Battle**: The epic of Gilgamesh from ancient Mesopotamia describes a cosmic battle between order and chaos, which is reflected in many other cultures' mythologies.

2. **Greek Tragedy**: Greek tragedians like Aeschylus depicted human suffering as a result of the will of the gods, often focusing on the tragic flaws (hamartia) of heroes that led to their downfall.

3. **Historical Accounts**: Thucydides provided a secular account of human behavior and history, emphasizing the reality of power and human nature in shaping events.

4. **Philosophy**: Plato and Aristotle offered philosophical interpretations of the human condition, with Aristotle focusing on the role of place and context in human development.

5. **Biblical Perspective**: The Hebrew Bible presents a unique view where humans are both dependent on and in rebellion against God. The prophets, like Jeremiah and Second Isaiah, interpret history as part of a divine plan, with an eschatological hope for redemption and the idea that obedience to the covenant is central to human identity.

6. **Wisdom Literature**: The fear of the Lord is considered the beginning of wisdom, suggesting a reverential approach to God that is both wise and challenging.

7. **Human Vulnerability**: Across all these perspectives, there's a clear recognition of human vulnerability to suffering and death. This has significantly changed with modern medical advancements and living conditions, especially in the first world.

8. **Transformation of Ancient Inheritance**: Both rabbinic Judaism and Christian churches have transformed the ancient religious inheritance of Israel into their own doctrines and practices, each in its unique way.

In summary, the ancient texts from Mesopotamia to Greece and the Hebrew Bible reflect a deep concern with the human condition, particularly our vulnerability to suffering and our search for meaning. These texts provide a rich tapestry of thought that has shaped Western civilization's understanding of morality, human nature, and the divine.

Checking Why Evil Exists/07 Christian Scripture—Apocalypse and Original Sin.txt
1. The story of Adam and Eve in the Hebrew Bible is not about the origins of evil, but for Paul in the New Testament, it represents a cosmic calamity where evil was introduced into the world as a new and powerful force.

2. The Christian conception of evil evolves to depict sin as actively seeking humanity's downfall, which is a dramatic shift from a state where failure was always possible to one where evil made a definitive entrance.

3. This Christian view of evil is deeply intertwined with the hope and optimism of Christian salvation, as seen in Jesus' saving work and the promise of a new covenant with humanity.

4. The parting of the ways between Judaism and Christianity is partly due to differing interpretations of these same biblical texts regarding the nature and origin of evil.

5. Despite the presence of apocalyptic imagery in the New Testament, particularly in the Book of Revelation, Christian thought does not reject the world outright but seeks to guide believers through trials with an eye towards eventual redemption and restoration.

6. The notion of original sin in Christianity is not about nature being inherently evil, but rather about humanity's relationship to its nature becoming corrupted by sin.

7. In the Book of Revelation, the cosmic struggle between good and evil is temporary, and God's kingdom ultimately comes to earth, not taking believers away from it, but redeeming and restoring it.

8. The belief in the resurrection of the body underscores the Christian hope that humanity will properly inhabit the flesh, rather than rejecting it.

9. In the next section of our exploration, we will examine how this view of evil is further developed and nuanced by early Christian theologians such as Irenaeus and Augustine.

Checking Why Evil Exists/08 The Inevitability of Evil—Irenaeus.txt
1. **Irenaeus' Theodicy**: Irenaeus, a second-century bishop of Lyons, offers a unique perspective on how to understand and interpret evil in the context of Christian faith. He posits that the world is an organic whole and that all events, including those we perceive as evil, are part of the divine pedagogy designed to lead humanity towards salvation and perfection. According to Irenaeus, evil serves a purpose in this process by provoking us to seek God and thus become more like Him.

2. **Challenges with Irenaeus' Theodicy**: While Irenaeus provides a framework for interpreting evil within the context of divine purpose, his views raise several challenges. Firstly, they can seem to trivialize the reality of evil and suffering by implying that all suffering has an ultimately beneficial outcome. Secondly, his perspective does not adequately account for cases where individuals suffer horrendously without any apparent opportunity to learn or improve in this life, such as children who die from natural disasters or the victims of the Holocaust.

3. **Influence and Legacy**: Despite the profound implications of Irenaeus' thought on Christian understanding of evil, his vision was largely eclipsed by Augustine's more influential perspective in the subsequent centuries. However, elements of Irenaeus' ideas reemerged in the philosophy of Hegel, Marx, and within modern progressive thought that views history as a learning process where we can permanently benefit from our suffering.

4. **Augustine's Theodicy**: Augustine, another early Christian thinker, offers a different take on evil, emphasizing human free will and the fall from grace as the sources of moral evils. He also discusses natural evils as tests or temptations that can lead to spiritual growth if one remains faithful.

5. **The Next Steps**: As we continue to explore the history of Christian thought on evil, we will delve deeper into Augustine's ideas and consider how these ancient perspectives influence contemporary understandings of suffering, moral development, and divine justice. The legacy of both Irenaeus and Augustine continues to shape discussions on evil within Christian theology and beyond.

Checking Why Evil Exists/09 Creation, Evil, and the Fall—Augustine.txt
1. **Inner Evil and Divine Mystery**: Augustine views evil as primarily an issue of what happens inside the soul rather than external actions. He believes that the root of all outward misbehavior is the corruption of the inner self. This perspective makes evil mysterious and profoundly remarkable, as it arises from a source that is not immediately understandable or explainable.

2. **Augustine's Anthropological Pessimism**: Augustine holds that human nature, post-fall, cannot be inherently good by itself. The human will is corrupted and often acts in ways that are mysterious and without clear rationalization. This view suggests that the depth of sin has made us calloused to evil and astonished by goodness, indicating the extent of our moral corruption.

3. **Epistemological Optimism with a Twist**: While Augustine believes that we can understand the reasons behind good actions, he also maintains that we should find evil actions astounding and inexplicable. This position reflects his belief that evil is not just a lack of good but an active corruption that is deeply mysterious.

4. **Augustine's Emphasis on Interiority**: Augustine's focus on the inner workings of the self highlights the complexity and depth of human beings. He suggests that we possess a mysterious kind of depth that is capable of harboring and producing evil, which cannot be attributed solely to external factors or material causes.

5. **The Challenge of Learning Not to Understand Evil**: Augustine posits that one of the difficult tasks for humans is to truly comprehend the incomprehensibility of evil. He argues that our failure to find evil actions astounding indicates our moral decay. In a good world, we would be shocked by cruelty and indifference, but in our fallen state, we often take such things for granted.

6. **The Next Two Lectures**: The lectures will explore two alternative perspectives on evil from the Jewish rabbis of Augustine's time and the Islamic thinkers who followed. These perspectives offer a contrast to Augustine's Christian view and provide different insights into the nature of evil and its origins.

Checking Why Evil Exists/10 Rabbinic Judaism—The Evil Impulse.txt
1. **Jewish View of Evil**: In Jewish thought, particularly in Rabbinic Judaism, evil is viewed as a human issue—a challenge within human experience that individuals must confront and overcome through halakah (Jewish law) and personal responsibility. This contrasts with Christian views where evil can often seem to be a divine or theological problem, potentially overwhelming an individual's capacity to resist it.

2. **Rabbinic Perspective on Suffering**: The rabbis believe that suffering is a human dimension that individuals are responsible for overcoming. This view holds that evil can be confronted through personal behavior and religious practices rather than attributing it to a supernatural force beyond human control.

3. **Challenges to the Rabbinic View Post-Shoah**: The Holocaust (Shoah) presents a significant challenge to the traditional Jewish understanding of evil. The industrialized slaughter and attempted elimination of the Jewish people seem to exceed the scale of evil that Rabbinic Judaism typically addresses, which is more focused on everyday moral challenges like greed and envy.

4. **Post-Shoah Reflections**: Since 1945, the attempt to understand the meaning of the Holocaust has been a powerful inducement for Jewish thought. The event has led many to question how such evil could have occurred despite the covenant between God and the Jewish people, and whether God allowed it to happen.

5. **Distinctive Features**: The Rabbinic understanding of evil is characterized by its psychological and moral acuity, emphasizing individual responsibility and the capacity for self-knowledge in facing everyday challenges. This view stands in contrast to both ancient combat myths and the more dramatic Christian conceptions of evil.

6. **Transition to Islamic Views**: The next topic will explore the Islamic account of the fall of Satan and the role of Iblis (Satan) as the embodiment of evil, offering another perspective on how different religious traditions approach the concept of evil and its implications for human responsibility and suffering.

Checking Why Evil Exists/11 Islam—Iblis the Failed, Once-Glorious Being.txt
 In this lecture, we explored different interpretations of evil within the Abrahamic faiths, focusing particularly on Islam, with a brief comparison to Judaism and Christianity. We examined the story of Iblis (Satan) in Islamic tradition and how different interpretations within Islam, especially those of the Sufi branch, offer alternative perspectives on the nature of evil.

The orthodox view presents Iblis as an angel who rebelled against God's command to prostrate himself before Adam, out of pride and jealousy. This view sees evil as a result of free will misused, a choice that Iblis made irrationally, lacking any legitimate reason or good.

In contrast, the Sufi minority report offers a more nuanced understanding of Iblis's act as not merely prideful but as a misplaced sense of right value and loyalty to God. This interpretation suggests that evil can stem from what appears to be noble and worthy motives, where an individual, like Iblis, upholds what they believe to be the correct order of values, even if it is in direct opposition to God's will as revealed in the story.

This alternative view of Iblis underscores a profound insight about evil: it can be aggravated or even enabled by a person's own tradition or beliefs. It raises the question of whether evil might sometimes be prompted by genuine good, highlighting the complexity of moral choices and the difficulty of distinguishing between right and wrong.

The lecture underscores that the Abrahamic faiths have grappled with understanding evil in various ways, and these different interpretations offer a rich tapestry of thought on this perplexing topic. In the next lecture, we will delve into the thoughts of Christian scholastics who engage with these ideas within their own tradition's framework.

Checking Why Evil Exists/12 On Self-Deception in Evil—Scholasticism.txt
1. **The Nature of Evil in Scholastic Thought**: The medieval scholastics like St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas provided complex accounts of human motivation and the nature of evil that were grounded in a deeper understanding of human psychology, including self-deception and illusion as integral to moral failure.

2. **Anselm's "Fall of the Angels"**: Anselm offered an account of the fall of angels that emphasized their rational agency and how they became demons due to their free choice to reject God. This rejection was not just a lack of belief, but a willful turning away from the good, which led to their own corruption and the perversion of their desires.

3. **Aquinas's "Actual Reality"**: Aquinas, drawing on Aristotelian philosophy, further developed the concept of evil as a privation or absence of good. Evil is not a substance but an absence of being that arises from the free choice of rational beings to act against their true end, which is to live in harmony with God and the universe.

4. **The Collegiality of the Damned**: Aquinas noted an ironic solidarity among the damned, each pursuing their own perverse version of the good, but ultimately isolating themselves from the true good because their "good" is self-centered and self-deceptive.

5. **The Metaphysics of Privacy and Evil**: The scholastics saw evil as inherently connected to an attempt at radical privacy or self-possession, which they regarded as problematic and potentially sinful. This view stands in contrast to modern notions of individualism and privacy that are deeply ingrained in contemporary society.

6. **Tension with Modern Beliefs**: The pre-modern understanding of evil and the human person challenges many aspects of our own society, particularly the way we value individual privacy and autonomy. This tension is worth keeping in mind as it highlights significant differences between historical Christian thought and modern perspectives.

7. **Invitation to Explore Dante**: The lecture invites us to consider how Dante Alighieri, influenced by Anselm and Aquinas, further explores the nature of evil on an even grander scale in his epic poem "The Divine Comedy." Dante's work offers a vivid depiction of the consequences of moral choices and the journey towards redemption.

In summary, the scholastics provided a nuanced understanding of human agency in relation to evil, emphasizing self-deception, illusion, and the misuse of free will. Their insights offer a profound look at the psychological underpinnings of sin and its manifestations within the individual and in society, which contrasts with some modern views on individuality and autonomy.

Checking Why Evil Exists/13 Dante—Hell and the Abandonment of Hope.txt
1. **Satan's Sin and Punishment**: Satan's fundamental sin was his desire to escape God's service, as encapsulated in his motto "non serviam" (I do not serve). His punishment is equally ironic; he becomes the ultimate servant of hell, an instrument of torment for other rebellious spirits. This serves as a perpetual reminder of his own failed attempt to resist God's authority.

2. **The Sign at the Gates of Hell**: The sign "Abandon all hope ye who enter here" can be interpreted in two ways: as a dire warning and as a guide for escape. It suggests that the only way out of hell is to give up on the vain hope of self-deliverance.

3. **Satan's Desire and Ambivalence**: Satan's desire to cease serving is fundamentally confused and ambivalent because he cannot fully commit to his own wish due to his status as a creature dependent on God. His punishment is not merely what he deserves but also what he wants, albeit in a distorted form.

4. **Hell as Self-Inflicted**: The inhabitants of hell are not just getting what they deserve; they are choosing their state in some mysterious way. They are trapped by their own desires and choices.

5. **Dante's "Inferno"**: While Dante's "Inferno" is often read as a direct commentary on evil and suffering, its primary purpose is the spiritual reeducation of Dante (and by extension, all humanity) to help us resist the power of sin and adopt a new vision of good and evil.

6. **Augustine's Influence**: Saint Augustine's idea that he wanted to teach people how not to know what they should not know resonates with Dante's aim in "Inferno" to help us avoid the pitfalls of sinful habits and vision.

7. **Transition to the Reformation**: The discussion transitions to a comparison with the Reformation, highlighting that while both Dante and the Reformers dealt with issues of evil, sin, and redemption, their contexts were different, yet the underlying spiritual and ethical concerns remained relevant.

Checking Why Evil Exists/14 The Reformation—The Power of Evil Within.txt
1. **Sanctification and Discipline**: In the Reformed tradition, particularly in John Calvin's thought, sanctification is about deepening our commitment to God and others, which involves disciplined actions that counteract self-centeredness or narcissism. Discipline is central in this tradition as a strategy for recognizing and overcoming sin.

2. **Self and Sin**: Calvin believed that after justification, believers become more acutely aware of their own sins and the pervasiveness of sin in the world. This heightened awareness of sin is paradoxically a sign of being elected or chosen by God.

3. **Evil and God**: Luther and Calvin incorporated evil into God's plan in a way that was different from traditional medieval views, where Satan was seen as an independent force. They argued that humans must rely on God's power to overcome evil because of its subtlety and wiles. This view deepens the interiorization of evil as something inherently within the human soul rather than an external cosmic force.

4. **The Individual Struggle with Evil**: Unlike earlier Christian thinkers who saw the struggle against evil in broader terms—cosmically or historically—Luther and Calvin focused on the individual's inner battle with sin. This shift emphasizes personal responsibility and the need for self-discipline in the context of sanctification.

5. **Innovation and Revolution**: While Luther and Calvin's views on evil and sanctification were revolutionary, they were not necessarily condemned for this. Their ideas set the stage for further developments in Christian thought and practice.

6. **Transition to Machiavelli**: The lecture series hints at the next figure in our exploration of the problem of evil, Nicolò Machiavelli, who would revolutionize political thought and further interiorize the concept of good and evil within the human heart, focusing on the realities of power and governance.

Checking Why Evil Exists/15 Dark Politics—Machiavelli on How to Be Bad.txt
1. **Machiavelli's Approach to Evil and the Past**: Machiavelli represents a significant shift in how historical wisdom about evil is accessed. Unlike scholars who rely on immediate predecessors or teachers for insights from the past, Machiavelli reaches back further than his contemporaries, specifically bypassing the medieval tradition of political thought that was prevalent during his time. He sought to find a more usable past than what the medieval mirrors for princes offered, looking to Greek and Roman sources for a different kind of wisdom about politics and power.

2. **Implications for Understanding the Past and Future**:
   - *Rupture with Tradition*: Machiavelli's approach implies a significant break from the immediate past, suggesting that the traditional wisdom of his time was inadequate to address contemporary challenges. This rupture marks a new way of thinking about politics and morality, where the traditional Christian moral framework is set aside in favor of a more pragmatic and empirical approach.
   - *Historical Consciousness*: Machiavelli's method represents an early form of historical consciousness—a self-aware effort to reach back into history to find useful insights that are not immediately available in one's immediate environment or tradition.

3. **Looking to the Future**: By reaching back to a deeper past, Machiavelli opens up the possibility for new thinking about politics and morality. This approach assumes that the wisdom of the distant past holds valuable lessons for addressing the future's challenges. It also suggests that the immediate past as taught by tradition may not be sufficient or relevant for these new circumstances.

4. **Machiavelli as a Prophet Methodologically**: Machiavelli is seen as a pioneer in historically conscious thinking, not just for his content on power and politics but also for his method of looking to history as a source of wisdom that is distinct from the immediate past. This makes him a prophetic figure in how he approaches the study of evil within the context of political thought.

In the next lecture, we will explore how Thomas Hobbes, another thinker with similar insights into the nature of power and politics, developed these ideas further into a more rigorous and systematic philosophy.

Checking Why Evil Exists/16 Hobbes—Evil as a Social Construct.txt
1. **Butler's Critique of Hobbes**: Butler identifies two senses of self-interest that Hobbes conflates. The first sense is the ordinary sense where individuals want their will fulfilled, such as wanting a drink or a particular teacher for their child. The second sense recognizes that individuals can genuinely care about others, which isn't mere selfishness. Butler argues that Hobbes fails to distinguish between these two senses, leading to a skewed view of human morality.

2. **Hobbes' Influence**: Thomas Hobbes' view that humans are self-interested and motivated by the pursuit of power has had a profound influence on Western thought and politics, particularly in the realms of international relations and nuclear strategy, where game theory often applies his ideas to predict or guide behavior.

3. **Game Theory**: In the 20th century, Hobbes' ideas were formalized into game theory, which models interactions between rational individuals or states based on self-interest and the anticipation of others' actions. This has significant implications for understanding strategic decision-making, especially in international relations.

4. **Enlightenment Skepticism**: The discussion around Hobbes sets the stage for Enlightenment skeptics who questioned traditional moral categories and sought to establish a new foundation for ethics based on reason and empirical observation of human nature.

5. **Continued Relevance**: Despite living in the 17th century, Hobbes' ideas continue to shape contemporary debates about morality, human nature, and political strategy. His legacy is evident in both scholarly discussions and real-world decisions.

In essence, Butler's critique of Hobbes serves as a reminder that our understanding of self-interest should be nuanced and not reduced to mere selfishness. Hobbes' influence on modern thought, particularly through the lens of game theory, shows how his ideas continue to inform and challenge our views on human behavior and ethical decision-making.

Checking Why Evil Exists/17 Montaigne and Pascal—Evil and the Self.txt
1. Blaise Pascal's perspective on human behavior and the concept of divertissement: Pascal argues that humans engage in diversions (divertissement) as a means to avoid confronting the fundamental truths of their existence, particularly death and their own nature. This active avoidance is a form of dynamic ignorance that keeps individuals from reflecting on their true purpose or seeking a meaningful end.

2. Pascal's critique of Montaigne: Pascal criticizes Montaigne for being too lenient towards the trivial distractions (divertissements) that lead to greater evils. Pascal believes that it is only by addressing these trivial distractions early on that one can potentially avoid catastrophic outcomes such as violence and self-destruction.

3. The importance of zealotry for Pascal: For Pascal, zealotry is necessary to counteract the tendency towards divertissement. It is a call to be serious about life's fundamental issues, to confront God and His commands, and ultimately to escape the cycle of trivial distractions that lead to evil.

4. The disagreement with Montaigne: Pascal and Montaigne have fundamentally different views on human nature and evil. While Montaigne sees evil as a byproduct of accepting life's diversity and incoherence, Pascal sees incoherence as a result of human fall and evil.

5. The influence of John Milton: Although often remembered primarily as a poet, John Milton had profound philosophical insights, particularly in his treatise "Areopagitica." In this work, Milton argues for the importance of free speech and the open exchange of ideas as means to discern truth and promote virtue. His ideas on liberty, toleration, and the role of the poet in society have had lasting influence.

6. The call to keep both Montaigne's and Pascal's views alive: It is beneficial to consider both Montaigne's acceptance of human diversity and incoherence as well as Pascal's view of human fall and the dangers of divertissement. Both perspectives offer valuable insights into the complex nature of human behavior and the challenges of addressing evil.

In the next section, we will explore John Milton's "Areopagitica" in more detail to understand his views on freedom of speech and the role of the poet.

Checking Why Evil Exists/18 Milton—Epic Evil.txt
1. **Paradise Lost and Human Evil**: In John Milton's "Paradise Lost," human evil is depicted as a form of folly and satanic rebellion, which, despite its darkness and realness, is ultimately futile and can be used by God for the improvement of the world or the maturation of humans.

2. **Satan's Portrayal**: Satan is portrayed as a compelling and seductive figure in "Paradise Lost," so much so that some have argued Milton made him the most interesting character, which may be intentional to show the nature of evil in its purest form. William Blake famously suggested that Milton was "of the devil's party without knowing it" when writing about angels and God, but at liberty when writing about devils and hell.

3. **Milton's Depiction of Evil**: Milton's depiction of evil is not an elevation of Satan per se, but a way to expose his motives and rationales for closer examination. The tragedy in "Paradise Lost" lies more in Adam's choice for Eve than in Satan's choice for himself.

4. **Milton's Rebellion**: Milton's decision to write an epic about rebellion, amidst the English Civil War, which some saw as satanic, reflects his attempt to distance his own rebellious sentiments from true evil while still presenting a complex and vivid narrative.

5. **Paradise Lost's Legacy**: The poem remains one of the most profound imaginative representations of human experience in English literature, offering a nuanced exploration of good and evil, free will, and divine providence.

6. **Transition to the Enlightenment**: As we move to consider the context of the late 17th and early 18th century Enlightenment, we'll see how ideas about good and evil, human reason, and the role of the individual in society evolved, offering a different but equally important perspective on these themes. The Enlightenment thinkers sought to understand the world through reason and often proposed new ways of thinking about ethics, governance, and human potential that were both optimistic and transformative.

Checking Why Evil Exists/19 The Enlightenment and Its Discontents.txt
1. **Philosophical Perspectives on Evil and Hope**: The conversation about evil and hope involves various philosophical perspectives, from the optimism of Voltaire to the skepticism and naturalism of David Hume. These discussions often confront the struggle between our misappropriation of hope and freedom in performing evil actions.

2. **David Hume's Contribution**: David Hume, a Scottish philosopher, is known for his skepticism and naturalistic view of human beings as natural animals. He offers a synthesis of the views of Voltaire and Andrew Bailey (Pierre-Sylvain Rousseau), while also addressing the problem of evil in a way that challenges religious explanations.

3. **Hume's Problem of Evil**: Hume poses the famous trilemma regarding evil: if God is willing to prevent evil but cannot, He is impotent; if He can prevent evil but is not willing, He is malevolent; and if He is both willing and able, the existence of evil remains a mystery.

4. **Skepticism and Rational Religion**: Hume argues that theory, especially when it comes to rational religion, often leads us into confusion or unpleasant directions. Observations of the world suggest an indifferent cosmos toward humanity, and evil provides evidence that might support Manichaean views.

5. **Natural Morality and Human Decency**: Hume believes in a natural human inclination towards order and care for others, suggesting that humans are naturally moral and hopeful. This view contrasts with the idea that the world is predominantly evil or that humans are inherently bad.

6. **Uncertainty and Pragmatism**: For Hume, uncertainty about religious and abstract beliefs should not hinder us from living a happy and flourishing life. We should focus more on helping those in need and living virtuously rather than being overly concerned with theological debates.

7. **Two Themes in the Discourse on Evil**: Two recurring themes emerge in discussions about evil: the tension between abstract versus concrete modes of thinking about evil, and the metaphysical debate on the dualism of good and evil or the proportions of good and evil in the cosmos.

In the next lecture, we will explore how Immanuel Kant attempts to reconcile these tensions within his own philosophical system.

Checking Why Evil Exists/20 Kant—Evil at the Root of Human Agency.txt
 The video discusses the concept of demythologizing myths, particularly in the context of understanding evil and the human condition. This approach involves stripping away the literal or supernatural elements of a myth and interpreting its deeper, symbolic meanings through rational analysis. The tension between demythologizing and maintaining the profound wisdom embedded in traditional myths reflects a broader philosophical debate about the nature of human knowledge and the sources of moral and existential insight.

Philosophers like Kant have influenced modern thinking on evil by suggesting that humans are inherently selfish but possess the capacity for self-improvement through reason and moral effort. This view contrasts with the more traditional religious perspectives that attribute a certain level of profound, though incomplete, insight into the nature of evil within mythological narratives.

The video then introduces Hegel as a philosopher who disagreed with Kant but was also influenced by his ideas. Hegel offers an alternative view on how to understand and confront evil, which is grounded in his dialectical method. This method involves the interplay of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, where contradictions are resolved through a higher level of understanding or reality.

In Hegel's view, evil is not simply an individual flaw but arises from the contradictions within the world itself, including the social, historical, and existential conditions that shape human life. Unlike Kant, who sees individuals as capable of overcoming selfishness on their own, Hegel believes that evil and good are dialectical opposites that evolve together through history. The resolution to this conflict is not an individual act but a collective historical process where humanity progresses towards greater freedom and understanding.

The video ends with a reminder that while demythologizing can be a valuable tool for understanding, it must be done carefully to avoid distorting the original message of the myths. The discussion invites us to reflect on how we approach the complex and often paradoxical nature of evil and moral development in human life.

Checking Why Evil Exists/21 Hegel—The Slaughter Block of History.txt
1. **Hegel and Evil**: The lecture discusses Hegel's philosophical approach to understanding evil within the context of his broader system, which seeks to reconcile the existence of evil with a world that is fundamentally rational and ordered. Hegel argues that evil is not an independent force but is part of the unfolding logic of history, which ultimately justifies all that happens as necessary for the good.

2. **Hegel's Theodicy**: Unlike traditional theodicies that attempt to explain why a good God allows evil in the world, Hegel's approach does not reconcile humans to the existence of evil but claims that evil is not truly evil—it is a necessary part of the historical process that leads to progress and rational order.

3. **Hegel's Parochialism**: The lecture suggests that Hegel's method, which claims to unlock the key to history, may be parochial because it assumes that only with the benefit of hindsight can one fully understand the necessity of historical events. This raises the question of whether anyone who had similar insights at different times but did not see the full scope of history could have been mistaken.

4. **Hegel's Optimism**: Hegel is criticized for his optimism, which arises from his belief in the intelligibility and progressivity of history. His system demands that humans are thinking creatures capable of understanding and influencing their world. However, this optimism can be seen as overly confident or even authoritarian because it presents a singular view of historical progress.

5. **Kant-Hegel Debate**: The lecture concludes by drawing a parallel between the critiques Kant and Hegel would have of each other. Kant might argue that Hegel's acceptance of everything that happens as necessary for the good's development is a form of resignation that undermines human free will. Conversely, Hegel might criticize Kant for his reliance on a transcendent hope that does not engage sufficiently with the world's problems and potential for improvement.

6. **Looking Forward**: The lecture sets the stage for the next one, where Karl Marx, influenced by Hegel, will be discussed as an influential descendant of Hegel's ideas on history and evil, particularly in terms of how Marx views history in relation to class struggle and social change.

In summary, the lecture explores Hegel's complex and controversial philosophical approach to understanding evil and history, highlighting his optimistic view that all historical events, including those we consider evil, are part of a rational process leading to progress. It also prepares the ground for an examination of how Marx builds upon Hegel's ideas, particularly in his analysis of social dynamics and change.

Checking Why Evil Exists/22 Marx—Materialism and Evil.txt
1. **Historical Determinism vs. Moment-by-Moment Integrity**: The lecture explores two contrasting views on history. One view, influenced by Hegel and Marx, sees each moment of history as not fully understanding its significance until later events clarify its role within the larger historical narrative. In this view, suffering might be justified if it leads to a better outcome later on. The other view holds that each moment of history possesses its own integrity and moral weight, independent of how it fits into the broader historical context.

2. **Marx's View of History**: Marx believed that history is shaped by material conditions and economic forces, and that human suffering can ultimately be resolved through revolutionary change and the establishment of a classless society. However, the practical outcomes of Marxist ideologies in the 20th century often resulted in increased suffering rather than its resolution.

3. **The Problem of Evil**: The lecture raises the question of how to account for evil within a materialist framework like Marxism. A thoroughgoing materialism may actually intensify the search for an explanation of evil, as the absence of idealist explanations can make the reality of suffering more acutely felt.

4. **Marx's Engagement with Evil**: The lecture notes that Marx himself, in his journalistic work, engaged with the problem of evil, particularly in relation to American slavery and the American Civil War. This indicates that even Marx recognized the need to address evil as a practical concern.

5. **Theodicy in Practice**: The lecture suggests that a theoretical explanation of evil, such as the one Marx offered, may not be sufficient to alleviate human suffering. Instead, it may highlight the need for an idealist understanding of evil, which might be lacking in a purely materialist analysis.

6. **American Thinkers on Slavery**: In the next lecture, the professor plans to discuss how two American thinkers approached the issue of slavery and its evils, offering insights that are relevant beyond the specific historical context of the Civil War. This suggests a deeper exploration into how different philosophical perspectives address the problem of evil in history.

In summary, the lecture presents a complex discussion on the nature of history, the role of suffering within it, and the different ways philosophers and historians interpret and respond to the problem of evil. It contrasts Marx's historical determinism with the view that each moment of history has its own intrinsic significance and moral weight. The lecture also sets the stage for a deeper analysis of how American thinkers confronted the specific issue of slavery and its evils, which will be explored in greater detail in the following lecture.

Checking Why Evil Exists/23 The American North and South—Holy War.txt
1. Mark Twain and Abraham Lincoln were prophetic figures who anticipated later understandings of moral conflict and human behavior, particularly in their insights on dualism, complicity, and the nature of evil.

2. Twain's satirical works, such as "Letters from the Earth," reveal a deep understanding of how societies can distort religious teachings to justify oppression and cruelty, much like the Nazi regime's perversion of Christian values.

3. Lincoln's approach to the American Civil War was marked by an acute awareness of the evil inherent in the institution of slavery, which was a joint creation of both the North and South. He recognized that resolving such conflicts required acknowledging the complicity of all parties involved.

4. Both Twain and Lincoln offer a model for dealing with moral crises: by understanding history and morality through the lens of religious beliefs while also recognizing the importance of reading contemporary events in light of those beliefs.

5. Their vision encourages people to see their enemies not as irredeemable foes but as fellow humans who can be invited into a shared struggle that transcends immediate conflicts.

6. The lessons from Lincoln, in particular, are universally applicable and demonstrate that to move beyond societal sins, all members of society must acknowledge their part in the problem and work together to find a solution.

7. This approach is evident in successful social movements throughout history, where leaders like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr. sought to unite rather than polarize, inviting everyone, including former adversaries, into a shared vision for change and reconciliation.

In essence, the legacy of Twain and Lincoln teaches us that complex moral issues require nuanced understanding and a willingness to see our enemies as part of the same human family, all striving towards a common good.

Checking Why Evil Exists/24 Nietzsche—Considering the Language of Evil.txt
 Nietzsche's concept of the will to power is a fundamental force in his philosophy, representing both power and the creative drive to make or create. This concept should be understood in the context of the romantic emphasis on human creativity and dynamism. The will to power is not merely about domination or control but also about the expression and discharge of energy within individuals and society at large.

Nietzsche's view challenges traditional notions of autonomy, suggesting that we might be more affected by this force than we are in control of it. This has profound implications for our understanding of ourselves, as it requires a radical reevaluation of our psychology, morality, and the nature of our being.

Nietzsche calls for an anthropological revolution—a transformation in how we conceive of humanity. He proposes that we view the human soul not in terms of traditional binaries like good and evil, but as a spectrum of health and sickness. This shift is grounded in Darwinian ideas, but Nietzsche diverges from Darwin by suggesting that evolutionary understanding serves not just as an objective account of nature, but as a foundation for rethinking human values and identity.

For Nietzsche, "killing God" is metaphorical for the death of traditional moral frameworks, which he sees as rooted in a Christian or Platonic conception of truth. By embracing this new understanding, we move beyond the categories of good and evil not by disproving them but by no longer finding meaning in their existence. This allows for a reevaluation of our values and a recreation of our purpose based on a more dynamic, creative, and life-affirming set of principles.

Checking Why Evil Exists/25 Dostoevsky—The Demonic in Modernity.txt
1. **Raskolnikov's Self-Deception**: In Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," Raskolnikov convinces himself that he is an exceptional individual who can transcend moral boundaries for the sake of a greater good, drawing parallels with figures like Napoleon. He believes in a form of 19th-century liberal nihilism, which holds that individuals can define their own morality and values without divine or traditional constraints.

2. **Raskolnikov's Failure**: Raskolnikov's attempt to live into the story he has told himself about his own exceptionalism fails dramatically when his crime is botched and he is traumatized by the reality of his actions. He is unable to cope with the consequences of his deed and ultimately confesses to his sister, showing that he cannot bear the weight of the narrative he constructed.

3. **Dostoevsky's Theological Understanding of Evil**: Dostoevsky's novel suggests that it is hubris for humans to try to usurp God's role by defining their own stories and moral boundaries. The novel emphasizes Raskolnikov's inner turmoil and spiritual punishment rather than formal legal consequences, highlighting the importance of aligning one's life story with a divine narrative rather than one's own self-justifying narrative.

4. **Dostoevsky vs. Milton**: Dostoevsky contrasts with Milton, who in "Paradise Lost" sees rebellion against tyranny as sometimes justifiable. For Dostoevsky, any active rebellion against an established order is inherently evil. Acquiescence to authority is seen as accepting one's place in society as ordained by God.

5. **Literary Debate**: In the context of Russian literature, there has been a long-standing debate over whether Dostoevsky or Tolstoy was the greater novelist. Globally, when it comes to representing evil in the modern world, Dostoevsky and Joseph Conrad are often seen as two contenders for the title of the greatest novelist.

6. **Preview of Conrad**: In the next lecture, we will explore Joseph Conrad's representation of evil and assess his claim to be the most profound novelistic representation of evil in the modern world, alongside Dostoevsky.

Checking Why Evil Exists/26 Conrad—Incomprehensible Terror.txt
 In this lecture, Professor Kertzer discusses Joseph Conrad's novella "The Secret Agent," which offers a profound exploration of evil and terrorism within the heart of civilization. The story revolves around Mr. Verloch, a secret agent who is directed by foreign spies to commit an act of terrorism in London to provoke the English into arresting dissident exile anarchists. His mission is to bomb the Greenwich Observatory, a symbol of global navigation and timekeeping. However, during the execution of the bombing, Verloch accidentally kills his mentally handicapped brother-in-law, Stevie, who had unwittingly accompanied him on the mission.

Kertzer highlights how "The Secret Agent" challenges the notion that evil resides only at the peripheries of civilization, such as in the infamous "heart of darkness." Instead, it suggests that the capacity for evil can be found within civilization itself, questioning whether the dichotomy between civilized and uncivilized is merely an illusion. The novella implies that the idea of civilization might harbor a subtler form of cruelty and evil than previously recognized.

The lecture draws parallels between Conrad's work and the optimistic views of the late 19th century, which held that progress and enlightenment had left brutality behind. However, the 20th century would prove this belief to be naive as it was fraught with conflicts and a recurring confrontation with the darkness within human nature.

In the next lecture, Professor Kertzer will explore Sigmund Freud's theories on evil, which have some intriguing similarities to Conrad's and Dostoyevsky's perspectives on the subject. Freud's ideas on the unconscious and the darker aspects of human psychology are particularly relevant to understanding the nature of evil as it relates to civilization and its discontents.

Checking Why Evil Exists/27 Freud—The Death Drive and the Inexplicable.txt
1. Freud saw human corruption as rooted in natural drives, particularly the death drive, which is a fundamental aspect of our nature that seeks annihilation and destruction. This contrasts with the life drive (Eros), which seeks to preserve and create life.

2. The existence of the death drive is inferred by Freud from the observed behaviors of individuals where the love drive alone cannot explain the destructiveness or malice observed.

3. Freud warns that the power humanity has over nature could lead to our self-destruction, given our capacity for mass destruction.

4. Michel Foucault extends Freud's ideas by suggesting that in the modern era, humans have become political beings whose politics can endanger their natural existence.

5. Freud's work on evil encompasses three perspectives: (1) Evil as a natural structure, (2) evil as an intrinsic part of individual development over time, and (3) evil as folly or privation of being in goodness, similar to Augustine's concept of sin as the perversion of good actions.

6. Freud's thinking on evil offers a complex and nuanced view that is both pessimistic and hopeful, suggesting that while Eros might ultimately have the upper hand on the death drive, humanity must navigate these forces carefully, especially in light of our newfound destructive power.

7. The thinkers who survived World War II and grappled with its consequences offer different perspectives on the nature of evil, which we will explore next. These post-war thinkers may shed more light on the complex interplay between human desires for justice and individual moral evil.

Checking Why Evil Exists/28 Camus—The Challenge to Take Evil Seriously.txt
1. Albert Camus, a French-Algerian philosopher, writer, and journalist, explores the theme of evil in his works, particularly "The Plague" and "The Fall." In "The Plague," he examines the moral response to evil during an outbreak of bubonic plague in the city of Oran. The protagonist, Dr. Rieux, recognizes the evil of the plague but finds hope in the human capacity to confront and resist it through acts of solidarity and compassion.

2. In "The Fall," Camus delves deeper into the nature of evil with his main character, Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a man who reflects on his past actions and moral failures. Clamence realizes that he has missed opportunities to act ethically and is trapped in a cycle of self-love and sin. He acknowledges that it is too late for redemption in this life, but he finds a twisted kind of fortune in this realization because it absolves him from the possibility of further moral failure.

3. Camus' works provoke us to consider whether our conceptions of evil are adequate and whether we take it seriously enough. He suggests that human nature may have a tendency to avoid or distort the reality of evil, either by medicalizing it or by attributing it to vast, unstoppable forces.

4. Camus emphasizes the importance of recognizing evil for what it is and the moral imperative to confront it without any assurance of success. He believes that the mere act of seeing clearly and communicating this vision is a significant moral victory.

5. The next lecture will explore how religious thinkers contemporary to Camus responded to the Second World War and the manifestation of evil during that time, examining their attempts to address the moral crises and take evil seriously.

Checking Why Evil Exists/29 Post–WWII Protestant Theology on Evil.txt
1. **Augustine of Hippo**: Augustine viewed evil as a privation of good, an absence or lack of something that should be present. It is not a substance or entity in itself but the result of free will turning away from God.

2. **Thomas Aquinas**: In line with Aristotelian philosophy, Aquinas saw evil as a result of the misuse of good things (malum = "bad" or "ill"). It is not a substance but a perversion or corruption of what is good. Evil can be found in the agent (the one who acts), the act itself, or the purpose for which the act is done.

3. **John Calvin**: Calvin saw evil as rooted in human sinfulness and depravity, an inherent condition resulting from the Fall. For Calvin, evil is deeply woven into the human heart and can only be addressed through divine grace and predestination.

4. **Friedrich Schleiermacher**: Schleiermacher, a German Protestant theologian, emphasized the role of human consciousness and feeling in understanding sin. He saw sin as a disordered state of the self, where the individual is estranged from the infinite (God).

5. **Paul Tillich**: Tillich, influenced by existentialism and process philosophy, viewed evil as an ontological category, an aspect of being that emerges from the tension between the finite and the infinite. For Tillich, evil is not accidental but necessary, emerging from the very structure of existence.

6. **Karl Barth**: Barth saw evil as ultimately derived from the devil's rebellion against God, an intrusion into creation that is opposed to God's creative will. Barth emphasized the sovereignty and transcendence of God over evil, which is a real and powerful force but ultimately subservient to divine power.

7. **Reinhold Niebuhr**: Niebuhr described sin as essentially pride or the assertion of the self beyond its proper bounds. Sin can manifest as either an overemphasis on material desires (sensuality) or a denial of the flesh and finitude in favor of ascetic escapes from reality. Grace, for Niebuhr, is the merciful power and knowledge that enables responsible moral action despite our sinful nature.

In summary, these thinkers offer a range of perspectives on evil within the context of Christian thought, each with its own understanding of the origins, nature, and implications of evil. These views have significantly influenced contemporary discussions on the topic, providing different lenses through which to view and address the problem of evil in the world.

Checking Why Evil Exists/30 Post–WWII Roman Catholic Theology on Evil.txt
1. The concept of evil within the Roman Catholic Church has evolved over time, particularly in terms of how it is applied to individual moral behavior and broader social issues. The language of "intrinsically evil acts" is a relatively recent development, primarily influenced by John Paul II's writings.

2. The use of the term "evil" in Catholic moral theology has traditionally focused on guiding individuals towards a virtuous life, but its application to societal issues involves more complex considerations, as seen in the church's stance on issues like masturbation and homosexual acts.

3. Civil law is not designed to enforce moral perfection or eliminate all objective evil, as this would require an unreasonably extensive governing power. Instead, civil law aims to maintain the relative well-functioning of society.

4. The language of intrinsic evil has been increasingly used in the Roman Catholic Church's social teachings, but it was sparingly used before the late 20th century, with a notable exception being Humanae Vitae in 1968.

5. Two different uses of the term "evil" within the church reflect both its profound spiritual implications and the challenges it poses. One use is theological, focusing on how God overcomes evil through suffering and redemption, which fosters a spirituality of hope and charity. The other is more sociopolitical, identifying specific acts as objectively evil and calling for explicit opposition to them.

6. The theological approach to evil, as proposed by Fumpaltasar, emphasizes God's victory over evil through endurance and love, but has faced criticism for potentially downplaying the reality of evil or the possibility of damnation.

7. The Magisterium's approach to identifying objectively evil acts provides a clear stance on moral issues, but some argue that this language can be too harsh and may oversimplify the moral complexities of human experience.

8. Transitioning to another religious tradition, we will now explore how the Jewish tradition has confronted the reality of evil, particularly in light of the Holocaust and other catastrophic events of the 20th century. This will involve examining how Judaism understands suffering, evil, and divine justice, as well as the implications for moral and ethical behavior in response to such traumas.

Checking Why Evil Exists/31 Post–WWII Jewish Thought on Evil.txt
1. **Richard Lichtman** discusses the philosophical responses to suffering and the Holocaust among four Jewish thinkers: Emil Fackenheim, Elie Wiesel, Hans Jonas, and Emmanuel Levinas. Each thinker grapples with the meaning of suffering and the implications of the Shoah for Jewish identity and ethics.

2. **Elie Wiesel** emphasizes that suffering is radically meaningless in itself. It is an annihilation of sense and agency, which are essential to humans as meaning-makers. Suffering is the antithesis of meaning because it eradicates the capacity for agency that gives meaning to life.

3. **Hans Jonas** also sees suffering as inherently meaningless. He argues that pain cannot be intrinsically made useful or given meaning since it negates the very possibility of sense-making by destroying the agents who create meaning.

4. **Emmanuel Levinas** extends this view, suggesting that after the Holocaust, all people, not just Jews, have an obligation to care for one another and to prevent suffering wherever it occurs. He sees a universal call to ethical action in response to the Holocaust, which is a departure from his earlier, more explicitly Jewish philosophical works.

5. **Emil Fackenheim** argues that after Auschwitz, Jews must remain Jews, preserving their identity and faith as a response to the Holocaust. He believes that Judaism offers a unique perspective on suffering and the relationship with God that is crucial in the wake of such evil.

6. **Hannah Arendt** is noted as another influential Jewish thinker who addressed the implications of the Shoah for the world, particularly through her concept of the "banality of evil" as demonstrated by Adolf Eichmann. Her work, "Eichmann in Jerusalem," remains controversial for its analysis of the Holocaust and the nature of totalitarian evil.

In summary, these thinkers each contribute to our understanding of suffering and its implications for ethics, identity, and meaning-making, particularly in light of the Holocaust. They highlight the importance of preserving human dignity and agency, even in the face of overwhelming evil, and call for a universal ethical response that transcends religious boundaries.

Checking Why Evil Exists/32 Arendt—The Banality of Evil.txt
1. Hannah Arendt coined the term "the banality of evil" to describe Adolf Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official responsible for facilitating the Holocaust. She argued that Eichmann was not a monstrous figure but rather an ordinary bureaucrat whose actions were a result of his adherence to the system and its rules rather than any deep-seated personal wickedness.

2. Arendt's observations at Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem in 1961 led her to believe that Eichmann's evil was as deep as it could be within the framework of his thoughtlessness and adherence to the system, rather than arising from any particular sadistic or demonic nature.

3. The term "banality of evil" does not imply that anyone could have done what Eichmann did, but rather that the kind of political evil we face in the modern world often comes from individuals who are not inherently wicked but who are embedded within a totalitarian system and follow its directives without question.

4. Arendt's focus on Eichmann's actions rather than his character or soul was central to her argument. She believed that he should be judged for what he did, not for who he was, emphasizing the importance of holding individuals accountable for their actions within a political and judicial context.

5. The lessons from the Yugoslavia war crimes trials and the Hague, as well as post-genocide Rwanda trials, have echoed Arendt's observations. Many of those on trial had no apparent history of sadism or cruelty, suggesting that political evil in modern contexts often does not stem from pre-existing inner malevolence but from the functioning of a totalitarian system.

6. The internal experiences of those who have suffered under totalitarian regimes also provide literary reflections on the nature of political evil, offering further insight into the dynamics of obedience and compliance that enable such systems to function and perpetrate atrocities. These personal accounts complement Arendt's theoretical analysis.

In summary, Arendt's concept of the "banality of evil" is a nuanced understanding of how individuals like Eichmann could commit heinous acts not out of personal wickedness but through their role within a totalitarian system and their adherence to its rules and procedures. This insight remains relevant in understanding the nature of modern political evil.

Checking Why Evil Exists/33 Life in Truth—20th-Century Poets on Evil.txt
1. **Aesthetic Resistance to Totalitarianism**: Herbert Aptheker argues that an appreciation for beauty and aesthetics can serve as a form of resistance against totalitarian regimes. He suggests that the ugliness of totalitarianism is something that can be resisted, particularly through poetry and the arts. This idea is that by engaging with what is beautiful, we are also upholding our conscience and humanity in the face of oppression.

2. **Poetry After Auschwitz**: This concept is a response to Theodor Adorno's claim that writing poetry after the atrocities of World War II, particularly after Auschwitz, was barbaric. Herbert Aptheker and others like Czesław Miłosz and Hannah Arendt disagree with Adorno, contending that poetry and the arts are essential in recovering civilization and humanity after such catastrophic events.

3. **Lessons from Poets and Thinkers**: Each of these poets—Czesław Miłosz, Hannah Arendt, and Herbert Aptheker—offers a unique perspective on how to represent and understand evil. They highlight the profound impact of totalitarian regimes on human experience and the importance of maintaining a sense of truth and beauty as acts of resistance.

4. **Living in Truth**: Intellectuals like Adam Michnik, Giorgi Conrad, and Václav Havel, who were leaders in the Eastern European resistance against totalitarianism, emphasized the importance of living authentically amidst a society that demands conformity to a lie. They advocate for a life lived in truth as a form of resistance to totalitarian power structures.

5. **The Vulnerability of Totalitarianism**: The lesson from these thinkers is that totalitarian regimes are vulnerable to the truth and that by living honestly and telling the truth, individuals can create a rival community that survives and eventually overcomes the state's efforts to control and manipulate reality.

In the next lecture, the focus will shift from poets and intellectuals to scientists and their discoveries about human behavior, exploring another dimension of what we consider "evil" and how it manifests in our world.

Checking Why Evil Exists/34 Science and the Empirical Study of Evil.txt
1. The experiments conducted by psychologists at the University of Virginia and the New School for Social Research aimed to test the influence of situational contexts on helping behavior, using the biblical story of the Good Samaritan as a basis for their study.

2. The researchers found that the presence of a bystander, even if they are not directly interacting with the person in distress, significantly increases the likelihood of help being offered. This contrasts with the expectations set by the Good Samaritan story, where an individual is expected to act morally regardless of external influences.

3. The key finding was that situational factors play a much larger role in determining behavior than previously thought. Only 10% of individuals who were hurried and had heard the Good Samaritan story stopped to help, suggesting that inner character or moral compass might not be as influential as context and situation.

4. This research supports the situational attribution theory, which posits that people's behavior is heavily dependent on their surrounding context rather than on an innate moral character.

5. The good news from these studies is that under the right conditions, people can surprise us by being better than we might expect. The bad news is that our innate moral qualities may not be as strong determinants of our behavior as we like to believe.

6. These experiments underscore the complexity of human behavior and highlight the importance of context in shaping actions. They also raise questions about the nature of character and morality, suggesting that situational factors are often more powerful than individual dispositions.

7. The study's findings serve as a reminder of the potential for both good and bad within all people, and they call for further research into how individuals can be encouraged to act morally and resist becoming indifferent or cruel under certain conditions.

Checking Why Evil Exists/35 The Unnaming of Evil.txt
945. discusses the difficulty contemporary culture faces in comprehending and addressing the concept of evil, as highlighted by literary critic Andrew Delbanco. The 20th century's literature often grapples with the impossibility of fully representing the horrors of our world, reflecting the profound moral challenges and the complex nature of human behavior. Despite the extensive reflections on evil by numerous thinkers from Arendt to Freud, there is a notable gap between our awareness of evil and our intellectual resources for handling it.

Delbanco points out that in the modern era, our ability to conceptualize and respond to evil has weakened. We have largely abandoned efforts to understand evil, opting instead for ironic detachment or muscular moralism, or a combination of both. This avoidance is indicative of a broader issue where our moral imagination is lacking when faced with the realities of evil in the world.

Our culture tends to be optimistic and views humans as inherently good and the world as fundamentally ordered. When confronted with acts of mass evil, we attribute such behavior to either supernatural forces or the subhuman status of the perpetrators, thus failing to grapple with the complexities of human nature.

945. suggests that by examining the historical contexts and previous understandings of evil, we can gain valuable insights and resources for confronting and understanding this aspect of the human experience. The next lecture will explore these historical perspectives further, aiming to provide a more nuanced framework for considering why evil exists and how to address it.

Checking Why Evil Exists/36 Where Can Hope Be Found.txt
 In this final lecture of the series, we've discussed the concept of evil and our natural resistance to it. We've explored how humans universally recognize evil as such and resist it, not just on an intellectual level but also through practical actions. This innate aversion to evil is a form of acknowledgment or confessing, a testament to the human intuition that there is some basic goodness in the world.

We've seen that many philosophers, theologians, and thinkers throughout history have grappled with the question of why evil exists. From Plato's theory of the soul to Augustine's account of free will, from Leibniz's optimistic view of the best of all possible worlds to contemporary discussions on the problem of evil, there is a common thread: the mystery of evil itself prompts reflection and search for understanding.

C.S. Lewis highlights that our stubborn belief in a good creator despite the presence of evil is perplexing if the universe were entirely bad or even half so bad. This points to the fact that religion, the belief in a wise and good creator, exists not because of the evidence of the universe alone but due to something else, which Lewis suggests is a providential provisional witness to basic goodness.

The lecture concludes by emphasizing that our practical resistance to evil, our puzzlement at it, and our active opposition to it may be more insightful into understanding the nature of evil than any theoretical speculation. The persistent questioning and struggle against evil across different cultures and intellectual traditions suggest that this is a fundamental aspect of human existence.

In summary, our innate resistance to evil, our cognitive dissonance with the concept of an entirely evil universe, and the universal human experience of recognizing and opposing evil are key aspects of understanding the nature of evil. This resistance, puzzlement, and struggle are not just practical responses but may also hold the key to a deeper philosophical insight into one of humanity's most profound questions.
