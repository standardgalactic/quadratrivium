Hello and welcome back you know in our last conversation we left off talking about things
like debt for nature swaps and large-scale strategies for preserving biodiversity and
I know as we're beginning to reach the end of the course here we're moving to as I say
with my students we're moving to solution space you know as I consider myself to be
a hopeful ecologist and I want to explore with you additional solutions to some of the
apparently implacable challenges that we've encountered throughout the course you know
remember that ecosystems are ultimately incredibly resilient and if we can just provide some
facilitation then typically these systems can be self-healing you know conservation
biology tackles the questions of this issue of resiliency and here we're going to do
it in the context of park design and implementation you know the precious resources that go into
conservation must be used in the most efficient way possible you know techniques have been
developed to design parks and reserves that have efficiency and sustainability as their
goals here we're going to consider the dilemma of which species to leave out of the recovery
plan and even the partial elimination of populations of threatened species now before
we really get into the meat of our conversation I want to want to return to our tortoise this
is a leopard spotted tortoise if you remember from Africa and this is an extraordinary creature
has come through hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary change of ecosystem change
their evolution and has remained essentially genetically unchanged and yet despite this
you know sort of perfect adaptation to the environment without appropriate habitat the
species can't survive and so when we think about the strategies that we're implementing
with respect to species recovery we have to remember that individual organisms need a
place to live and with all of the political negotiations it boils down to can these animals
complete their life cycle in this case the grasslands of West Africa which are the native
home to the species are the critical geospatial link in their evolutionary history so techniques
have developed to design parks and reserves for endangered ecosystems and wildlife and this
is designed to really counter the effects of deforestation and although we've talked about
this before we need to review this because in understanding the impacts of deforestation we
can get a better handle on one how we need to design parks and what are the challenges or
limitations that parks are trying to overcome so remember if we take a look at our data here
and in in a naturally occurring ecosystem you're going to have some solar energy that's lost to
the albedo effect some that's lost by the movement of air across the habitat and then there's a
so-called latent heat loss so when we remove trees actually the albedo effect of the land
increases and it tends to lower the amount of solar radiation and so you actually end up on
one aspect cooling the environment a bit and the changes in surface roughness also end up
cooling the landscape just a bit but these cooling effects as you can see are more than
offset by the warming effects of the decreased latent heat and the loss by evapotranspiration
and this reduced evapotranspiration reduces the recycling of moisture which further exacerbates
the problem so ultimately what happens is that when we clear forests the system heats up we lose
moisture and the value of the ecosystem is reduced. Now one tool that we have in the United States to
protect not only org populations of organisms but the habitats that they live in is the Endangered
Species Act which was implemented in 1973 in a period of time when this tremendous environmental
awareness and action that was taking place in the United States we also got the Clean Air Act and
the Clean Water Act in that same window of time and the Endangered Species Act was important in
the preservation and restoration of many animal species in their habitat. The act itself protects
ecosystems that have been threatened and the endangered species of plants and wildlife that
live there. Now the Endangered Species Act or ESA allows for the determination and listing of
species as either endangered or threatened different scales of protection and Endangered
Species is a population of organisms which are at immediate risk of becoming extinct and this
can be due to the fact that they're either too few in numbers or they're threatened by environmental
change or the change in the risk of predation as a result of habitat degradation. Threatened
species are vulnerable to extinction in the near future but not immediately and so it's a different
but slightly less aggressive level of protection and for most species it's habitat loss that is the
primary threat that imperils them. Now the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration the Fisheries Branch are allowed to designate specific areas as critical
habitat as part of the Endangered Species Act. So these federal agencies can protect individual
species by nominating certain areas for critical habitat. Now overall and although the act is
controversial as of August 2008 44 species that were at one time put on the endangered species list
have actually been delisted. Now 19 of those were actually due to recovery which is good news,
9 actually went extinct which is bad news and 7 of which actually were physically extinct prior to
listing and have never actually been discovered again during that window of time. Now as mentioned
in a previous lecture some of those success stories with respect to endangered species include the
bald eagle, the recovery of grizzly bears, gray wolves, hooping cranes and the black-footed ferret.
Now the National Park Service has developed a series of policies that require the restoration
of native species. If there is sufficient habitat to support a permanent population
and if local extinction will result if human impacts continue. So if those two criteria are met
then it allows the National Park Service to implement some changes in management and human
access to those areas. Now let's move off the terrestrial area for a moment and take a look
at marine systems. Turns out marine reserves are an incredibly important strategy to both improve
biodiversity and in the long run to support local fishing industries. Now they remain controversial
because in creating these these protected areas you have what we call no take zones
that create refugia where fish cannot be caught. Now this in the short term limits the total
catchable biomass that fishermen can go after and so for that reason there's some pushback from
the fishing community. But the theory behind this is that by creating a no catch zone these reserves
will act as a source for other areas being actively fished. Let's think about this for a moment.
What you really are trying to do when you create one of these no take zones is create an area where
natural processes and reproductive activities of the fish you're trying to protect can can take
place without human intervention without without human fishing. The idea being is the population
rates will actually grow pretty rapidly in these no take areas and they'll feed out as the animals
disperse. Remember our previous conversation one of the keys to animal survival is dispersal.
So in these no take zones as they become more populated the fish don't stay there they move
and as they move out they repopulate areas that were at one point depleted by fishing activities.
That's the theoretical model. Well how do we move from theory to data? Well this was done by a team
from Australia and the Philippines that have been studying the impact of these no take reserves
near Apo Island in the Philippines. Now the primary commercial catch there are so-called
surgeon fish and jacks which account for up to 75% of the annual fisheries yield. The problem
is the yield has been dropping pretty dramatically as a result of overfishing. Now to counter this
the island community established a a half square kilometer no take area over a coral reef and that's
where these fishes tend to be found and that represents 10% of the fishable area so it's
it's a measurable area that was taken and placed out of bounds to fishermen. Now the data show
pretty clearly and we'll look at just a moment that the that the reserve is gaining in fish biomass
even as the rest of the reef was being depleted. However here's the and that's not unexpected
if you stop fishing the population will come up but here's I think the most interesting part.
However the areas near the reserve are also gaining in biomass as a result of recruitment
of fish from the no take zone. So let's take a look at some of the data. If you look at the biomass
of these fish within the reserve you can see that beginning at the at the start of the study in
the early 80s you can see that the the mean biomass in kilograms per thousand square meters has gone
from under 40 to nearly 120 over the period of time in the study running from 1982 to 2002. So
within the reserves you're seeing a tremendous increase in the amount of biomass that's great
but that's not unexpected. Notice in the other graph however that the biomass in the rest of the
area is actually going down because fishing pressures are still continuing but take a look
at the third graph and here we see the the biomass available as a function of the distance from the
reserve and what you see is those areas nearest the reserve are actually gaining in biomass.
I mean it's really quite extraordinary so the the theory is playing out here where the reserve area
is essentially a nursery that produces an overabundance of individual fish that are now moving
out into these areas replenishing the depopperate landscape and are able to provide fishing resources
again. So in the short term fishermen have to give up in this case 10 percent of their potential catch
but in return they're making a long-term investment in the sustainability and the
recoverability of their fishing grounds in general and we see the same thing playing out in in fishing
reserves around the world including places like george's bank which it off the coast of massachusetts
which at one time where was the richest fishing grounds in the world nearly depleted we've talked
about this earlier in the in our course and now are recovering because of these reserve strategies.
Let's go back on to the terrestrial landscape and think about park designs you know park designs
in wilderness areas are changing and as we think about the role that parks and reserves are playing
the design is actually evolving to promote ecosystem recovery. Now traditionally a park
is an area that we set aside for use by people and in nature reserve is primary purposes biological
restoration but in as we mentioned earlier these parks and preserves both become what
we consider to be ecological islands and so given the role that they play the size of a park and
reserve and the diversity of its habitat are critical and they're actually going to determine
the number of species that will that will thrive and also one of the things that we need to consider
is the idea that since these parks serve as isolated islands what are the distance between
these parks because of the distances to greater corridors aren't provided you're not going to
have genetic interchange and as we've talked about earlier on the lack of genetic interchange
is the first step in the decline of a population of organisms. From a political standpoint you
know when we design parks they tend to have a definitive boundary and when we develop wilderness
areas they tend not to have boundaries however as we've talked about before we talked about water
pollution and the idea of watersheds these boundaries the political boundaries means
mean nothing to the wildlife and in the past these boundaries are so arbitrary that wildlife will
move on and off of these areas and remember in the challenge when we talked about prairie
potholes and migratory species if you don't protect the species and provide habitat throughout
its entire annual cycle then wherever the weakest point is will become the the linchpin of failure
if you will in the context of preserving that species all the money and time spent when the
animal is one area if when it's in another location the protection fails then the whole system collapses.
So for example Lake Manara National Park in Tanzania they was created to protect elephants
however the boundaries didn't include the areas for their annual migration
from the valley region to the lake and so what happens is as they move off of these protected
areas they're at higher risk of poaching and the habitat quality declines and so the system hasn't
been as successful as it might be because the protected area didn't encompass the entire needs
of the organism. Now wilderness areas we describe as essentially being undisturbed by people the
only disturbance is by a limited cadre of visitors and so actually the U.S. Wilderness Act which was
in 1964 marked the first time that any wilderness was recognized by law as a national treasure to be
preserved and under the law wilderness includes an area of undeveloped federal land retaining its
primeval character and influence without permanent improvements or human habitations.
There's sort of the legalese that describes the the the area that we're talking about and there
really three conditions for wilderness determination that the imprint of human work is unnoticeable
that there are opportunities for solitude and primitive and unconfined recreation
and there need to be at least 5,000 acres so one of the challenges that we face on a national scale
is to develop wildlife corridors that will connect parks to wilderness areas right so we can't
necessarily protect the entire area but we have a network of parks and preserves and wilderness
areas all essentially generated under different budgets and different different management systems
how do we connect them so that we can exaggerate the value of each of these little habitat islands
by making them interconnected and they tend to be separated of course by human populations
and their activities we've talked about this before roads and cities and things like that
end up marooning these isolated areas of protection so one of the strategies is to come up with a
series of ground rules for park design that foster biodiversity and maximize resource investment
and coming out of this is the idea of core natural areas and these are areas that are large enough
in scale so that nature in and we could we could translate that legalese word into ecological
functions will operate on natural pace and scale the populations can maintain themselves
and may serve as a source to buffering areas or a sink a refuge as well now core natural
areas should be buffered by compatible land uses that still permit indigenous uses such as the
harvesting of forest products grazing tourism and human social development and these habitat
corridors should be developed to connect core areas across larger geospatial scales and remember
these corridors might be terrestrial aerial or aquatic because the animals that need to be protected
in the plants may use those three different spatial environments to move now we have much to learn
about corridors however some studies have found that corridors helped butterfly and pollinator
dispersal within the pine force of georgia but other studies in the same area found corridors
increasing the risk of predation on certain species of songbirds
so what we have learned is that there are there are some sort of steps that we can take or sort
of guideposts compass points if you can that will help us guide us through the development of park
design now first of all we think about the size of the reserves and i direct your attention to
to a graphic that will help us to understand this first of all as a general rule larger
areas tend to be better than smaller areas and if we have a choice creating us larger reserves is
probably better than creating a few small ones and if they are disjoint or unconnected it's better
if the reserves are in close proximity to each other it's really critical critical that these
reserves be interconnected in ways that allow for the movements of organisms among them and if we
can think about reserve shape we want to minimize the surface area we want to have as much interior
space as possible remember back to some of our conversations about things like oven birds whose
population numbers have shrunk because they're an interior species and as the areas create more
surface area become more linear then they tend to be invaded by nest parasites think of the
conflict between scrub jays and blue jays we talked about where scrub jays needed this particular
kind of scrub environment and as that environment changed in this case it was becoming more woody
but as it changed as the island got smaller they were invaded by blue jays and finally when you
create parks you need to also consider buffer zones so that there is a transition between
the wilderness area that's protecting the species and the environment that happens around it so you
want to create buffer zones that are that are both connected ecologically to the to the creatures
you're trying to protect the species you're trying to protect but also are socially compatible
to the humans that are living nearby now one mega initiative which is really quite fascinating
is the so-called Yellowstone to Yukon initiative and here what you see and if you take a look at the
map you see that there's a series of parks that already exist but there is an effort to try and
connect these wilderness areas that run all the way from montana and south up into up into northern
canada and into alaska it's extraordinary so the idea is that there would be a series of
corridors that would connect Yellowstone National Park to the Yukon and Canada and continue north
now the Yukon to Yellowstone model has historically supported this notion of providing
space for these large mega predators like grizzly bears wolves wolverines and also the grass eaters
the caribou to survive and it's only on reserves of this scale that we could have the very largest
of top order predators and here's where that notion of triage comes in when we build in the more
crowded areas of the northeast when we create wildlife habitat it's never going to be large
enough if we're talking about a place like new england it's not going to be large enough
to once again welcome wolves and bears back into the system i mean that's a that's a triage decision
we can't create habitat large enough to support those species so we have to say essentially
they're off the table for planning let's work with species that we think can be sustainable
but when you talk about these giant initiatives like the Yukon to Yellowstone that may be one of
the last areas in north america where we can support the very largest of our top order predators
and also our very most extensive migratory species like the caribou so within this system this at
one time wilderness system that ran essentially uh from the Yukon to Yellowstone the home ranges
of these animals were bisected by roads and additional development such as buildings and
also consumptive uses such as forestry and gas extraction and certain areas are absolutely
critical to the maintenance of these corridors one such location is right at the northern spine of
the continent where there's an area there's a highway that crosses the rocky mountains
i mean it's right at one of these critical choke points and when you're looking to preserve these
areas you have to look at the areas of highest risk and invest there now the roots of these
ideas trace all the way back to a Laura by the name of Harvey Locke who considered that this
Yukon to Yellowstone era was a fantastic environmental resource and wildlife refuge
as areas were being lost to consumptive use
there was considered to be some sort of a formal development of a of a plan for a reserve
now one of the early successes happened way back in 2001 where a wildlife corridor was restored in
Alberta that passed through a golf course was located in Jasper National Park and this corridor
facilitated the movement of wolves on their foraging and territorial routes the wolves were able to go
around the greens and the data suggests that they frequently use the corridor after this restoration
the wolves were passing through the corridor frequently
now corridors remain controversial and there's a very interesting study that was done on
the effective corridors on species of rodent called voles and researchers in Norway from
the University of Oslo have been studying the impact of corridors on the genetic exchange
among isolated populations of root root voles microtus economists in an attempt to understand
the efficacy of these corridors now they used a traditional mark recapture experimental design
that looked at movement over the span of a breeding season and was conducted for two years
now both males and females transferred between the isolated populations whether or not there
were corridors present now the males were much more likely to move as is their life history patterns
males tend to be the dispersing gender that moves the farthest remember we talked about this in a
previous lecture however the fascinating part of their discoveries was that the data suggested
a very different pattern for female transfer although overall the transfer was much lower
for females the corridors had a big positive effect on their activity and i direct your
attention to the data and here we take it on on the x-axis we have the period of time through
the breeding season and then on the y-axis we have the proportion that that transferred
among habitat patches and what you see is that that the males as the summer goes along the males
transfer at a higher rate to these other patches and there's really not much difference between
the patches that had corridors and those that didn't but you see that for the females
although the transfer rate was relatively low it was significantly higher if there were corridors
and this may actually prove to be a critical role for corridors as breeding female dispersal
may really help to secure genetic variation in the species so it's not that the dispersal has to
happen constantly but it has to happen at some level to maintain the genetic diversity so it's
great to have males moving but to have females moving may be also a critical piece for the recovery
and maintenance of genetic diversity in the species now back over to north america one of the biggest
challenges we have with habitat recovery is that of sand plain grasslands now sand plain grasslands
habitat is one of our most rare ecosystems and it's a unique composition that's a result of
very harsh conditions poor soils and wind driven features however these ecosystems which tend to
be treeless are perfect lands around golf courses and airports and other human dominated spaces
however in order to maintain these habitats sand plains need a pretty careful regime of cutting
burning and control of fertilizer overwash now naturally coastal heathlands and sand plains
are native to ecosystems places like long island and cape cod that are the result of a post-glacial
outwash that occurred along the moraines so it's a relatively rare habitat and it's being
lost because of development but a study done in 1997 to 2000 surveyed grassland bird populations
throughout the northeast and found that their numbers were declining dramatically frighteningly
so and it suggested that that there was a tremendous need to reinvest in the protection of these
habitats later a study led by nature conservancy scientists maryland jordan included monitoring
and hand planting of rare sand plain vegetation members your vegetation communities that are the
critical supporting base of any ecosystem so in order to maintain sand plain grasslands in a
natural regime the sites would normally be maintained by burning and so that's what has
to happen you have to have controlled burns each fall sometimes the seeds must be hand gathered
and distributed to the less endowed sites and her efforts along with her team have increased
the distribution of this rare plant sand plain gerardia on long island from only about 500 plants
in 1990 to 14 000 at the turn of the last century and now more than 80 000 plants are found on the
island another success story with respect to habitat management has been the reintroduction
of wolves the yellowstone park you know predator control was the general management regime regime
for wolves from the late 1800s and early into the 1900s through 1926 at least 136 wolves were killed
in the park and by the 1940s wolf packs were essentially non-existent in fact by 1970 there
was no evidence of a wolf pack at all in the park now near glacier national park in northern
montana wolves began reestablishing themselves and by 1996 at least 75 wolves were found in in
montana and in 1995 and 96 there were 31 wolves were reintroduced to yellowstone national park
and they used a technique called soft release where the animals were held temporarily in suitable
habitat and long distance dispersal was actually prevented which is wolves tend to do that by the
use of pens because the problems of the wolves walked off the park they were pretty high risk
of being shot so by 1996 four packs had produced about 14 pups and by the end of 2007 a minimum
estimate of 171 wolves and 11 packs and associated social groups occupied the park
and the population has increased about 26 percent between 2006 and the present and closely matches
the population park peak of 174 recorded in 2003 and wolf reintroduction has really helped restore
yellowstone flora and fauna to its original state because remember wolves in the ecosystem are going
to exert top-down forces and the presence of wolves alters the ungulate foraging patterns
which allow the vegetative communities to recover so wolves also prey on deer and elk
and prior to wolf introduction the elk population was increasing and they were grazing on lowland
grasses and aspen shoots and the elk populations were disrupting the floral ecology of the valleys
but as wolves were reintroduced it wasn't that they just were able to eat large numbers of elk
which they ate a few but the predatory pressure from wolves kept elk on the move and out of these
valleys they don't have time to intensely browse the willow communities which is what causes the
devastations so the willow stands are recovering from intense browsing this has helped the beaver
populations recover and there's now an abundant food source for them that hadn't been there earlier
so the wolves control over the elk population has also helped the aspen
now one of the challenges of designing wildlife reserves is that is that different biomes face
different threats now if we take a look at sort of the overall strategies for ecosystems we find that
in thinking about our living planet index and so forth we know that there is a significant
threat to certain forest communities but we've actually done a pretty good job with others
so for instance in boreal forest communities the threats remain high tropical forests the threats
remain very very high but in temperate communities we've actually begun to recover those forests
although dry grassland communities are still at very high risk whether it's
temperate or Mediterranean or desert another interesting element is to consider the history
of how these human impacts occurred you know for when we think about the impact of technology
and industrialization we tend to think that habitat destruction is sort of a new phenomenon
that is the result primarily of rapid population expansion but in island communities such as Tonga
strong data suggests that some of the most important habitat destruction
or reduction in biodiversity actually occurred hundreds or even a thousand years before
and especially the reduction in in fruit eating birds which ultimately are important at dispersing
seeds ended up contributing to this collapse and actually occurred sometime in the past
so as surprising as it may seem one of the keys to solving biodiversity solutions
is to think how people will live on a planet of 10 billion and we're going to tackle that
in the next lecture when we look at humans and the role that they play in ever shrinking ecological
space
