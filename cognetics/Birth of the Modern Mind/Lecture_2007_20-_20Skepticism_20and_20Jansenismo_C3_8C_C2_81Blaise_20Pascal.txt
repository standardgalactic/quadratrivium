Lecture 7 Skepticism and Janssenism, Blaise Pascal
Welcome to lecture 7 on Blaise Pascal and the question of skepticism and Janssenism.
In 3, 6 or 7 lectures I should remind our audience that my purpose here is not to advocate
for this or that way of looking at the world, not to argue for the truth or falsity, wisdom
or fatuity of any given system of thought, but to make these ways of thinking come alive
as the historical phenomena they were, and to let us understand other minds in other
places. And that is true of everyone of the lectures in this series. You should not be
able to infer my own beliefs from any of them. My goal is to make systems of thought historically
real and intelligible to you. Today we turn to the problem of skepticism and Janssenism,
both of which we'll explain, because for all of the growing attraction of the new philosophy
in the 17th century with its empiricism, its quantification of its view of nature, its
criticism and rejection of traditional authority and the Aristotelian system of natural philosophy,
there are very deep skeptical strains in the 17th century. Skeptical that is about the
claims of human knowledge. Skepticism is one of those words that has undergone a radical
transformation from its original meaning that endured from the Greeks through the 17th century
to the modern day. In the modern day skepticism tends to mean skepticism about religion. Indeed,
skepticism from the ancient Greeks until the 17th and 18th century was a philosophical
perspective that argued about the severe limitations of all claims of human knowledge. And again,
the essential skeptical proposition is that nothing may be known with certainty, that
neither by logic, which always culminates in paradox, and has the problem, if you think
back to the lecture on Descartes of the criterion of truth, nor from the senses, which are errant
and always misleading, may things be known with certainty. The dominant form of skepticism in
the 17th century, and indeed in the 16th and 17th centuries, is known as fideism from the
root fide faith from the philosophically skeptical position that human knowledge cannot attain
significant certainty. Fideism argues that that should convince the seeker after truth of our
absolute dependence upon faith and grace, that the proper response to the humbling of human
reason and claims of human knowledge is an awareness of the necessity and the power of faith.
There are two particularly influential and deep models of such fideism in the 17th century. One
of them the Catholic thinker, Blaise Pascal, about whom we shall talk in this lecture, and the
second Pierre Bale, a figure largely unknown today, but an author of exceptional, renowned and
influence in his own time and throughout the 18th century, and we shall return to Pierre Bale
in a subsequent lecture. Had Blaise Pascal never entered the arena of religious writing, had he
never addressed issues of fideism, he would be a celebrated figure in the history of 17th century
thought, for reasons that lend a very dramatic force to his fideistic writings, because Pascal was
a figure of a quite exceptional and brilliant scientific career. He was a child prodigy in
mathematics. He did groundbreaking work on conic sections and cycloid curves. He is an essential
figure in the history of barometrics, fluid dynamics, pneumatics, and the mathematical
calculus of probability. His father was a tax collector in Normandy, and Pascal even devised a
calculating device based on a binary system of zeros and ones to make calculations, which is why one
of the premier programming languages in the computer age is named in his honor Pascal.
The fact that Pascal was at the frontiers of the scientific revolution of the 17th century,
the fact that he was so deeply involved in the kind of knowledge that could be acquired by
inductive empiricism, quantification, mathematical reasoning, lent particular force to his turn
toward fideistic philosophy and theology. Pascal with a few fits and starts, because there are
questions that he always feels obliged to return to in science and above all disputes and debates
that he will not abandon to his adversaries, Pascal nonetheless essentially abandons his
extraordinary scientific career after his encounter with a movement within European
Catholicism that is known as Janssenism named after a Dutch bishop Janssen who had written a book
on the theology of Saint Augustine. Janssenism can be looked at in several ways. It is so
controversial in the 17th century that almost anyone who comments on it in the 17th century
does so in a biased and partisan manner and we won't attempt to adjudicate those disputes
in this lecture but Janssenism can be looked at in several vital ways one of which that it is a
continuation of a very ancient contest in the west and indeed in Islam as well between piety on the
one hand and the pursuit of a rational philosophical theology on the other. Within European Catholicism
it is a continuation of the intense contest between Augustinianism and Thomism that is to say
followers and would-be disciples of Saint Augustine and of Saint Thomas Aquinas as argued in the 17th
century above all over issues of the consequences of the fall upon the human will and upon human
reason and upon issues of salvation. It is the view of Janssenists that the fall had catastrophic
categorically catastrophic consequences upon the human will and that without election by God
and grace unmerited given by God without any merit or dessert on the part of the recipient of that
grace the human will was incapable of choosing the good was incapable of choosing reconciliation
with God and turning away from sin. Also for Janssenists the consequences of the fall upon
human reason and knowledge were catastrophic though here Janssenists tended to divide and Pascal is on
one extreme end of the spectrum of that divide though he will be the most influential Janssenist.
All Janssenists agreed that we were corrupted in the fall by our reliance upon the flesh,
the sensory, the things of the senses and that knowledge acquired through the senses
and attempts to know God through the senses with doom to failure the senses linked us to the evil
and depravity of this world the senses led us away from salvation and many Janssenists though not
Pascal loved the philosophy of Ren√© Descartes because without reliance upon the senses and the
body he had given us proofs of God and the soul and the distinction of the soul from the body
that were based purely upon something of the spirit mind but other Janssenists including Pascal who
will be Janssenism's most influential voice in France believe that the consequences of the fall
upon human reason were such that we were incapable by reason itself of knowing any significant truth
of knowing anything essential about the nature of reality and about the nature of God Janssenism
also stresses that human beings stand in absolute dependence upon the grace of God for their salvation
and that that grace is personal that it is something given by the election of God to the
individual sinner transforming that sinner into someone sanctified and justified in God's eyes
through grace this poses difficulties within a catholic context and Janssenism is a movement
within European Catholicism because of the role of sacramental grace in the catholic church that
is to say the church dispenses God's grace through its sacraments of baptism of communion of last
rites Janssenism accepts that there is a role of sacramental grace but when it looks at the
Catholicism around it it is scandalized by Catholic reliance upon the sacramental grace of the church
as a means of avoiding the need for personal forgiveness and for personal encounter with the
grace of God a leading Janssenist work by the brilliant philosopher Antoine Arnaud is a work
called of frequent communion and the scandal that Pascal denounces are worldly individual Catholics
who go to confession do penance receive absolution and then recommence their sinning on Monday
sin on Monday through Saturday and then undergo the sacramental ritual of frequent communion
as Arnaud will write Christ did not die on the cross to give us the scandal of frequent communion
but to give us an efficacious grace that overcomes the depravity of the human heart and saves us
the Janssenist convent at a center called Port Royal which will be raised to the ground when the
French monarchy moves against Janssenism becomes a center of moral and ecclesiastical revolt when
the crown and the papacy denounce Janssenism and the Janssenist urged the French church to reject
that denunciation Janssenism will become a center of religious and political opposition in France
throughout the 18th century and underground of opposition to what it sees as the worldly evil
of the monarchy and large parts of the established French church and there are many historians who
see it as contributing mightily to undermining the old regime in the monarchy before the French
revolution Pascal will give up his scientific career in despair after meeting the Janssenists
over his own relationship to God saying that he can tell by his inner life that he is not saved
and that the God of the philosophers the God who is the object of a philosophical proof by the
Aristotelians or by Descartes is not the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and is not Christ on
the cross dying for the sins of mankind our sole source of real understanding and salvation.
After Pascal's own experience of what he believes is God's grace upon his soul Pascal
abandons his scientific career and becomes one of the great religious apologists of Janssenism
Catholicism and Christianity there is a word in need of explanation in terms of its early
modern meaning apology, apologia in the Greek does not mean an apology for one's belief or an
apology for one's life for one's life and apologia is a defense so an apologist for the faith is
not someone who says I'm sorry about the faith it is a defender of the faith people who write
apologia provita mea an apology for my life a writing a defense of my life and Pascal becomes
a profound religious apologist upon his death which occurs at the age of 39 his friends at
Port Royale discover in his papers a set of thoughts that clearly were supposed to be the
foundation for a major work of apologetics and they published these shortly after his death as
Pascal's pens√©e his thoughts his thoughts on religion it is his Janssenist friends who put them in
order who arranged them thematically but the publishing history of the pens√©e shows us that
Pascal touches remarkably deep chords in 17th century culture they are a sensation they go
through addition after addition people love the pens√©e and they move debate and belief in very
different directions the themes of the pens√©e give us the direction of Pascal's apologetics
first the misery of human beings without god what is human life it is an endless quest
for diversion we are forever unhappy and will do anything to avoid being alone with ourselves
and our own self-consciousness we will do anything foolish talk to anyone we will hunt not to catch
animals but for the thrill of the hunt anything to divert us from being alone with our own
consciousness and the thought who am I and what is my fate we are creatures who experience two
absolutely extraordinary emotions hatred and self-hatred enmity toward others hopes that friends
fail fear that others will succeed and as if that is not tragic enough self loathing self-contempt
self-homful behaviors the misery of man without god leads to the simultaneous realism if we look
at it an absolute absurdity of the human condition who could explain hatred and war in Pascal's
celebrated phrase a river is a boundary between two countries on one side of the river my friend
on the other side of the river someone I shall be praised for killing that absurdity is the human
condition we see a plain man and we feel nothing but contempt for him but put on a judge's wig
on that person or the robes of a king we feel awe and reverence could there be anything more absurd
than human beings and human life the world works not through charity not through love not through
wisdom it works because what ties us to the things of the world concupiscence love of the things of
this world makes us fear for what happens if we don't honor contracts if we don't obey the laws
and we see a world that generally functions god was good enough to allow our love of the world to
give us a modicum of peace and the ability to live human lives but all around us unhappiness and
unhappiness and irrationality mankind for Pascal is a mass of inexplicable contradictions by any
natural attempted explanation we are creatures of such genius you look at the frontiers of science
and mathematics and creatures of such ignorance lost in superstition and absolutely absurd belief
we are capable of remarkable science but we lack ethics morality decency we are filled with energy
but it is an energy without purpose we are capable of extraordinary subtlety look at our
works of art and we are capable of grossness of beastliness almost beyond comprehension
we are creatures of endless self assertion and we are wracked by fear and guilt we are creatures
of reason and yet almost everything we do is arbitrary and indefensible custom done because
well here on this side of the river that's the way things are done we are creatures of intellectual
weakness we have reason without sincerity and we believe what we want to believe we are governed
by false appearances the influence of passion and prejudice upon our minds and beliefs is an
influence to which all human history and literature testifies the empire of imagination upon us is
such that the greatest scientist seeing a black cat walk across his path is in terror
knowledge is relative to the kind of mind that we possess some of us intuitive some of us needing
to follow out plottingly proof by proof and even among our geniuses we have an absolute inability
to grasp the infinitely large or the infinitesimally small between which nonetheless we must place
ourselves and our lives well you love to gamble pascal writes about his contemporaries you think
you're so wise and you love to gamble in the 17th century as an age when everyone gambles
everyone plays chance that's why pascal's works on probability make him one of the heroes of the
intellectual world everyone gambles and pascal offers what he calls the logic of the wager
which is terribly misunderstood if one believes it to be a proof of god it is not a proof of god
for pascal there are no proofs of god human reason is weak human will doesn't want to believe
the wager is a way of showing people what fools you are not to see what you should want to be true
about the world what is pascal's wager and he says you have to bet
you can wager that there is no god there either is or isn't that there is no god
and supposing you wager there is no god and you're right what do you gain nothing absolutely nothing
what do you lose infinitely everything if you wager that there is a god and you're wrong
you're wrong what do you lose absolutely nothing if you wager that there is a god and you're right
what do you gain infinitely everything what human being faced with that choice on the one
side of the wager the possibility of no loss and infinite gain on the other the possibility of
infinite loss and no gain would not at least want there to be a god would not take that as an
incitement toward belief but then one turns to the philosophers and sees the insufficiency
of knowledge of god without knowledge of christ what is the god of decart
a perfect being at the end of a philosophical proof or a first mover or a first cause
in what way does knowledge of such a philosophical god make comprehensible to you your hatred and
self-hatred evil and human nature remain incomprehensible given only the god of the
philosophers there is pasca will write an infinite distance between knowledge of god and love of
god and no philosophical proof gives you love of god for you are still left with the inexplicable
world of human depravity and suffering and self-hatred and unhappiness faith's reply
is the christian revelation now it has its reasons it can prove itself by prophecy by the power of
grace by the miracles of christ by the consequences of belief but that is not why one believes
the heart has its reasons that reason cannot understand one believes the christian revelation
by the heart because it reconciles one to god it leads to love of god it makes sense of life
if one has been touched by the grace of that revelation if we understand atoms fall and
redemption through christ we understand our dual nature if we understand our original creation by
god and the fall we understand why we are subtle and gross wise and stupid capable of beautiful
things and of grossness and baseness we understand why there is evil in the world and if one understands
the sacrifice of christ and the redemption of human nature through christ then one is reconciled
in one's heart to an understanding and a love of god that has nothing to do with philosophical proof
whatsoever for pascal looking at the world from a christian perspective is like looking at one of
those trick pictures you look at it from one angle it appears to be one thing but you look at it now
with christian faith achieved through grace and an understanding of the fall original sin
redemption through christ our original nature and our depravity since the fall and everything
falls into place and what one gets is not philosophical conclusion but inner peace and that
peace and salvation not philosophy are the goal of life and reason is only useful to humble
reason but think on the implications of pascal arguing the incompatibility of faith and reason
in what is justly known as the age of reason that is emerging in the 17th century thank you very much
