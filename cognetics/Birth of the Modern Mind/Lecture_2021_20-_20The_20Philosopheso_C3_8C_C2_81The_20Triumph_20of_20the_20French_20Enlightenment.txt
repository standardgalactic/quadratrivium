Lecture 21, The Philosophs, The Triumph of the French Enlightenment
Welcome to lecture 21, The Philosophs, The Triumph of the French Enlightenment.
In our last lecture we talked about the shift away from abstract, metaphysical and speculative
issues to concern for the causes of remediable human suffering.
One sees this in so many ways in the 18th century in the Scottish Enlightenment and
the movement of Jung from abstract philosophy to histories that he thought would be of political
and moral utility to his countrymen in the shift from Adam Smith's work on moral theory
to Adam Smith's work on economics and the conditions of human prosperity and wealth.
But nowhere is this shift more dramatically seen than in the movement that has come to
be called the French Enlightenment.
And in this lecture we shall talk about that movement and its triumph in France and in
so many ways in the Western world.
In the mid-18th century in France there emerged a community of thinkers and writers around
certain shared attitudes toward the new philosophy, toward arbitrary authority, toward the church
and toward the role of the informed man of letters in the society in which he found himself.
This community of thinkers and writers saw itself as part of something that it termed
quite explicitly the Republic of Letters, a republic in which figures would be judged
by the quality of their work, by their contribution toward human understanding.
In their self-image this community of thinkers in France saw itself quite dramatically as
standing between a sad past of human superstition, despotism, ignorance and suffering on the
one hand and a possible future of human enlightenment in which freed of the presumptive authority
of the past empirically derived knowledge could be applied toward the reduction of human
suffering and an increase in human well-being.
This is a remarkable moment in the history of human consciousness, this generation that
quite literally thought of itself as leading humanity into a new relationship with nature
and into new possibilities of human society, human community and ways of living human lives.
It is a community that redefines the meaning of the term philosopher and they appropriate
the name for themselves, Les philosophes, technically the philosophers, but henceforth
the philosophers of the French enlightenment, Les philosophes, working to alleviate the
remediable causes of human suffering to apply knowledge in manners useful to mankind.
They are diverse in their social and indeed in their educational origin, but they recognize
each other by common values, common interests and often above all by common opponents.
They coalesce around certain institutions, there are cafes, salons, patrons and academies
of the enlightenment and they coalesce around certain shared ideas, the rejection of inherited
authority per se, the commitment in theory at least to empirical evidence, rational analysis
and the belief that nature was our sole source of knowledge and of value and by a common
ethical principle that they share and one that does not sound the least bit pedestrian
to them, the principle of utility, the view that the happiness of the human species is
the highest value and that all things may be judged by their contribution either to
human suffering or to the alleviation of that suffering and human happiness.
These values, natural and secular and the philosophes competition with the clergy for
the role of the educator of their society, of their civilization, lead enlightenment
thinkers into a fundamental conflict with the Roman Catholic Church of 18th century France.
Indeed anti-clericalism was the most common denominator of the enlightenment. Primarily
deistic with a very small current of atheism to which we will turn later in this course,
the enlightenment believes that God spoke to mankind through nature and nature alone
and that the priests historically and in their present society had usurped and falsified
God's voice in sectarian religions. Their debate with the church centers around the
most fundamental issues, the critical issue of tolerance and censorship, religious toleration
and the right of minds to think, explore, write and communicate what they believe about
the world around profoundly differing histories of the world, of Europe, of their own nation
of France and profoundly differing analyses of their societies. They debated the rejection
of traditional authority and of supernatural claims. Think on that drama, a clergy that
is educating the philosophs as young men, a clergy that is educating all of France and
a group of writers who have won the affection and loyalty of the reading public, who are
saying traditional authority has no presumptive claim on us and the supernatural is no source
of knowledge, authority or value. The priority of secular over religious concerns that the
goal of things, the goal of one's own life, the goal of one's society was secular, was
not with reference to the supernatural, things above or beyond nature, a world to come and
there is a mutual identification by both philosophs and the church of each other as their antithesis,
as their deepest foe. One of the major agencies of the organization and dissemination of the
Enlightenment was the project of what was known in French as the encyclop√©die, the
encyclopedia, intended to be a great encyclopedia of human knowledge and produced largely under
the editorship of Denis Diderot. In the early history of the encyclopedia, a simple decision
was made by a consortium of French publishers to produce a French encyclopedia to compete
with several similar and successful British publications. The publishers selected a group
of scholars to work on this and named two Enlightenment thinkers as editors, the prudent
mathematician Jean Laurent D'Alembert and the impetuous Denis Diderot. D'Alembert and D'Aerot
projected and convinced the consortium of publishers to produce a vast work that would be a
sanctuary of all acquired human knowledge and experience, that would provide a bridge to the
future, that would be a barrier against any new dark ages. D'Aerot would write, a new barbarian
invasion could come, the last one destroyed all European learning, but if one copy of the
encyclopedia survives, the human mind will be able to reconstruct human knowledge. He believes
that about this work because the encyclopedia reflects the essential Baconian and Lockean vision
that one communicates not merely what we know, what we believe we know, one communicates how we
came to know it on the basis of what experience and experiments one has come to know what one now
knows. Communicate that and method along with conclusion and knowledge has been secured.
The encyclopedia reflects the Enlightenment's profoundly expanded notion of what constitutes
significant human knowledge, for it includes not simply philosophy, but history, the arts, letters,
and most interestingly technology, the mechanical and technical inventions that are changing the
human relationship to the application of human power to nature and to production.
The encyclopedia becomes an extraordinarily ambitious publication and in many ways
the essential publication of the 18th century. At first to be published in a few large volumes
between 1751 and 1754, the encyclopedia grows to 17 massive volumes of text published between
1751 and 1765 and 11 volumes of technical plates published between 1765 and 1772
that demonstrate the means of production, the nature of machines, the nature of techniques
available to human life in the 18th century. The encyclopedia is a runaway bestseller
and it is frequently sold in pirated editions, not paying any royalties to its authors and costing
the consortium of publishers great fortunes, but spreading the fame of the work and as a both
legal and pirated bestseller it spreads the knowledge and the self-image of the Enlightenment
across the face of Europe. So popular is it that there scarcely is a library that you are near
hearing or seeing me that does not have a copy and for the drama I urge you to sit with a copy
in front of you open of the articles and the technical plates of the encyclopedia of the 18th
it is an intellectually and humanly thrilling experience. It engaged over 160 writers and
another hundred or so informal consultants in its work drawing into its orbit and its frame of
reference the expertise and the scholarship of lay and which sometimes cause scandal in the church
even clerical France. The encyclopedia embodies a dramatic intellectual vision whose tone and agenda
are set by the preliminary discourse to the encyclopedia written by Dallombere in 1751.
For Dallombere and the preliminary discourse there had been a rebirth of knowledge in the 17th
century and through the acquisition of proper method a qualitative change in human thought
in the 17th century that had altered our ability to know and to acquire real knowledge of the world
in which we found ourselves and that knowledge Dallombere explained was a human power to
understand all natural things and to alter what could be altered which is why the technological
side of the encyclopedia it sense that human beings are not in a static fixed fatalistic
helpless relationship to nature why that is such a dramatically important side of this work.
The encyclopedia provides a focus and a means of diffusion for the worldview and for the scholarship
and the analyses of the new philosophy. It embodies a need to reset the priorities of knowledge thus
it has articles on invention diplomacy philosophy no article on Jesus Christ in this encyclopedia.
It embodies the need and the right to question the origins and foundations of all authorities
all beliefs and all institutions every one of these things is open to examination
by the free human mind and it embodies the belief that given proper and methodical use
of the human mind there will be intellectual progress cumulative changes in human knowledge and
it celebrates the dynamism of secular inquiry of science and of human technology. The encyclopedia
struggling again and again for the right to publish is in and of itself an education for
Europe and above all for France of the need for freedom of inquiry and expression frequently
attacked and occasionally suppressed the encyclopedia draws its authors and its experts
and its readers into the drama of censorship the issue of which now can be presented you
have the right to communicate and to its vast audience you have the right to read and to think
for yourselves. The encyclopedia finds agents of collusion and support in the highest structures
of the old regime in the courts in the ministries indeed in the aristocracy indeed in the very royal
agency that is supposed to be censoring it it has at the leadership of that agency its most ardent
supporter and admirer the very existence of the encyclopedia as well as its contents
is corrosive upon the sacred idols and established intellectual authorities of its culture
and it plays a major role in establishing the consciousness of this movement that more and more
comes to call itself the party of humanity or the party of reason that is the encyclopedist's
self-image but increasingly it is their image in a culture in which they are winning the war
for public opinion. The Enlightenment is a diverse set of phenomena but the culture recognizes the
part of it in the claim that so much existing authority intellectual religious political
and social is arbitrary authority arising from power and tradition alone. The Enlightenment
and it is important to understand this does not assail authority per se in and of itself
but arbitrary authority and in countless works it calls upon existing authority
to justify itself but justification demands criteria so what are the criteria of the Enlightenment
to above all natural experience and utility in terms of natural experience the Enlightenment
is Lockean claims to justify authority must be social they must be communicable they must be
verifiable the commitment to natural experience as the source of knowledge and value and justification
has dramatic implications for education change experience change education and you change the
individual and the world composed of those individuals though there is dramatic debate
within the Enlightenment over the role of environment and the role of physical constitution
what is from nurture what is from nature is a very intense 18th century debate the agreement
is that it is an empirical debate to be decided by the facts of the world a philosopher named
Helvetius and the philosopher Diderot our editor will argue over the implications of Locke
Helvetius will write if I and my valet had been switched in our cribs my valet would be writing
works of philosophy I would be putting on his cloak Diderot believes that there is a strong
inheritance of children from parents of very deep qualities including things such as intelligent
and gifts and aptitudes and that is very much an 18th century debate the other implication of
natural experience is anti supernaturalism that our knowledge being bounded by natural experience
that no supernatural justification for authority carries any weight whatsoever utility the other
major criterion of the Enlightenment is the experimental side of moral theories that all
things that have been judged by their contribution to human happiness or human suffering that is the
ultimate ethical criterion but this is a criterion that is no means unproblematic and initiate some
of the great debates of the 19th and 20th century do we think of happiness as individual happiness
or as the happiness of society as something collective do we think of happiness in physical
and sensual terms do we think of happiness as psychological above all there is a great
debate over whether there is a happiness to virtue itself or whether society must structure
rewards for virtue so that they bring about happiness one intriguing solution is by a
philosopher by the name of chastelukes who is third in command of the french armies in the
american war of independence who says everyone has a different notion of happiness the way to judge
public happiness the way to judge societies is by the amount of time a civilization leaves each
individual to pursue his or her own private vision of happiness as chastelukes puts it in
any given society there is a certain amount of time that you must spend to have enough to eat the
means of subsistence so technology productivity affects that then there are the demands of the
state are you spending 12 hours a day building the pharaoh's tombs or are you spending 12 hours a day
working to pay for standing armies right that's a plus b the state's demands on time subsistence
demands on time c is your total amount of time subtract a and b from c chastelukes writes and
you can judge a society by its contribution to real happiness how much each individual has
to pursue his or her own private vision from the 1750s on europe witnesses the triumph of
the enlightenment there is a voluminous literary output from the phyllis of each year scores and
then hundreds of enlightenment works large and small which become the rage the church is on the
defensive every act of censorship and scandal excites the interest of the reading public
and the battle cry and most successful issue of the enlightenment is toleration you have the right
to judge for yourself it will win first the battle of public opinion and then the state itself
one enlightenment work in the 1760s argues that the king if he thought it in the interest of peace
in his society could establish religious toleration the argument is set in ancient rome in a work
called bellis air by marmont tell but the issue is clear for france the church begins to draft
after it is formally censured bellis air a document saying the king of france has no
right to proclaim toleration and now the crown comes in and says to the church don't you dare
the enlightenment is winning the struggle for public opinion and nowhere is that more obvious
than in voltaire's passionate and in terms of europe's conscience ultimately successful
campaigns on issues of toleration voltaire will take cases of what he believes to be
the judicial murder and torture of protestants in france the coloss family the servan family
or of free thinkers labar who is accused a young aristocrat of having to face the crucifix
his tongue is ripped from his mouth while he's alive he is put to death among the evidence
cited against him he owned voltaire's philosophical dictionary they found it in his apartment
voltaire will campaign and successfully storm the battlements of european conscience on the issue
of torture and religious hatred and religious persecution the ascent of the enlightenment
to privilege itself to sinecures high positions honors in the old regime shows us that this is
not merely among the reading public but among officials of the state as well that this triumph
is occurring and before the french revolution the old regime in france will grant religious
toleration in increasing levels and will put an end to all torture and all serfdom that remains
in france the enlightenment represents nothing less than a battle for the soul of europe who
will advise and teach the culture the clergy of the church or the secular naturalist intellectuals
the enlightenment embodies profound tensions and debates it wants reform but there is no agreement
about by whose agencies by whose power it wants us to learn from and follow nature but it disagrees
about the meaning of nature it wants to reach the freest possible conclusions but there are the most
searing debates between deists and later atheists in the enlightenment it is torn between optimism
that human beings will succeed in making themselves less miserable more happy and pessimism that human
beings are so prone to error so easily manipulated and ruled the enlightenment is torn between where
to put its trust between elitism and the cultivation of existing rulers and elites
and egalitarianism giving more power to a people whose superstition whose lack of knowledge
it's so often fears but the legacy of the enlightenment is to change a civilization
salman rushdie on the sentence of death for mocking islam in the 20th century was asked what did you
read during that first year he said a lot of montesquieu a lot of voltare islam did not have
its enlightenment its legacy is a free science the primacy of a secular society the ideal of
religious toleration the view that government exists in the service of citizens not that citizens
exist in the service of government and its major legacy is an endless series of debates
with which we still live thank you very much
