Lecture 24, Materialism and Naturalism, The Boundaries of the Enlightenment
Welcome to Lecture 24, Materialism and Naturalism, The Boundaries of the Enlightenment.
The last in our attempts to understand the 17th and the 18th centuries from within.
In the 18th century there is the growing practice of naturalistic, mechanistic and materialistic
explanation of the world in which we find ourselves.
There are, whether one is a Christian, a Daist, an unbeliever, extraordinary strides
being made in the physics of moving bodies and what one can explain in terms of physics.
In the physiology of living things and in our knowledge of the human body of animals and
of plants.
And in these domains of natural, mechanistic, materialistic explanation, spiritualistic
explanation of physical behavior increasingly is seen as an admission of ignorance.
If someone said, why did that river overflow?
And you said, the river spirit was angry.
The 18th century thinker would turn away and say, well, here's someone who knows nothing
about hydrodynamics.
If someone said, why is that giraffe ill in the zoo?
And someone said, oh, the spirit that possesses the health of the giraffe, in the 18th century
people would have laughed and thought, here's someone who knows nothing.
So we have increasing natural, mechanistic, materialist explanations and a growing sense
that spiritualistic explanations of physical behavior are nothing but an admission of ignorance.
But there remain two areas in which spiritual explanation remains absolutely essential to
the 18th century thought.
First on the issue of the source of motion in the world and secondly on the question
of explaining human nature and behavior.
The 18th century almost to a thinker agrees with Rousseau's argument in the positive part
of his dayism that matter being inert and lifeless, it acquires motion from something
outside of itself, thus from something immaterial, thus from God.
One way to think of this is imagine if you walk in the middle of a complicated billiard
shot.
You would explain everything happening on that billiard table in terms of the laws of
physics and you would infer since you know that billiard balls don't set themselves in
motion that some human being hit the cue ball against the billiard ball but you missed it.
Well that's the way the 18th century thinks about nature.
We're in the midst of this complicated set of physical relationships, explicable by physics,
but the original source of the motion must come from something spiritual, something immaterial.
So there is one of the sources of motion where spiritual explanation is considered essential.
But think also on this, not all motion is acquired motion, one billiard ball striking
another billiard ball.
If I push a dog that's lying down, that's the same as a billiard ball pushing a billiard
ball, that's acquired motion.
But there's also spontaneous motion, a dog sitting down gets up and walks away.
A tree grows, a bird hops off a limb and flies away or look at the difference between two
kinds of motion.
If I push my arm we can explain that by physics, that's acquired motion.
But there's also spontaneous motion.
I can wow you all by saying without any strings or any other object hitting it saying to my
right hand up and up it goes.
That is spontaneous motion.
And for the 18th century to account for spontaneous motion, there must be something immaterial.
So that even though plants and animals are explained physiologically, it is posited that
they are governed by an animal soul or a vegetative soul that makes inert lifeless matter capable
of spontaneous motion.
But above all, spiritualist explanation is deemed absolutely essential to accounting
for human nature and human behavior.
The human being knows and chooses and wills.
That is not for the 18th century physiological.
And if one would laugh at a river soul that accounts for a flood, if one would laugh at
a rock soul that accounts for its rolling downhill, one does not laugh at the explanation
why did a human being do this in the answers in terms of a depraved soul or free will
or the choice of a spiritually free being.
There is in the 18th century a refusal to extend the model of specific animal physiological
behavior to human beings.
The 18th century posits there is an animal soul, otherwise there couldn't be spontaneous
motion, but it wants to explain animal behavior in terms of physiology.
But it does not want to explain human behavior in terms of physiology.
Here creatures with souls and inexplicable without souls and moral choice and moral responsibility
and an immaterial side to our being.
The stakes in retaining spiritual explanation are very high, absent it, Europe faces the
specter of a categorical naturalism, of a natural philosophy with no reference to God's
spirit, the immaterial.
That always had been the Christian philosophical understanding of atheism when Saint Thomas
Aquinas in the 13th century was asked what would an atheist argument look like.
He gave it two forms, one it would believe it could disprove all proofs of God and two
it would say that since nature can be explained in terms of nature alone we have no need to
posit any other being.
And Europe always had been haunted by a sense that there was a persistent small current
of materialistic naturalism in its culture and it always was looking to identify that
and root it out.
Well, in the 18th century it would not have to look very hard.
One witnesses in the 18th century the emergence of explicit materialistic naturalism in the
French Enlightenment, one of whose most representative voices is the medical doctor
Julien Afroi de La Maetrie.
La Maetrie is educated at medical universities in Holland.
He becomes a practicing physician in France.
He is expelled from France probably above all because he wrote satires against the French
medical profession also because some of his early writings were deemed philosophically
dangerous and like many people who annoy the court of France he is invited to the court
of Frederick the Great in Prussia, Frederick loves to tweak the French monarchy that way
and there he dies after eating a spoiled liver pâté which gives rise all throughout
Europe to countless sermons and writings that this materialist has died from gluttony
which becomes a part of this modest man's reputation.
Also La Maetrie is not particularly admired though they borrow very heavily from him by
later materialists in the French Enlightenment because La Maetrie defines happiness above
all in terms of sensual pleasure and later French materialists will define it above all
in terms of psychological pleasure and they see something a little dangerous about La
Maetrie and he'll give a bad name to materialism and atheism as if anything were needed to
give a bad name to materialism and atheism in France and so La Maetrie despite his rich
medical and educational background his deep familiarity with the life sciences his effort
at a total physical medicine that would eliminate spiritual explanation and push the boundaries
of physiological explanation encompassing all aspects of human behavior is widely known,
widely discussed and in general widely loathed in the 18th century but his influence is significant
and later materialists will draw very heavily from him.
La Maetrie writes several important materialist works but the most important of these is his
work L'homme machine sometimes translated machine man or man a machine but given the
change in the meaning of the term machine probably best translated as the human mechanism
or the mechanism of man.
For La Maetrie human thought faces an absolute either or between spiritualism and materialism
there is no middle ground in his history of prior philosophy he argues that much of ancient
Greek thought was wholly materialist and it has always been one of the two fundamental
philosophical choices facing the western mind.
La Maetrie spiritualism is a scientific dead end a confession of ignorance and helplessness
it is an abandonment of inquiry the moment you say of any phenomenon it was caused by
something spiritual there is not a further scientific question to be asked there is no
means of applying human knowledge if someone says an illness a mental illness a set of
behaviors in the same way as if someone said a flood has been caused by spiritual agency
then we are helpless inquiry is over we have reached a dead end in our investigations into
nature materialism for La Maetrie which would assume that all phenomena have material causes
is the possibility of human knowledge and mastery it is an invitation to human exploration
of the phenomena of nature and above all of human phenomena it is a tearing down of the
boundaries to science to the extent that we have said that we may only explain certain
human phenomena by reference to an immaterial soul we have said we have no means of knowledge
we put a do not enter sign before exploration we abandon ourselves to ignorance and to helplessness
in that sense for La Maetrie since metaphysics was not a science that could reach final conclusions
materialism is a strategy of human knowledge not a metaphysical truth if we assume phenomena
have material causes we seek them the moment we say God caused that flood demons caused
that crop failure or the human soul caused that change of personality we face a dead
end of a human medicine and knowledge why should we believe that it is possible to have
a material as science of man because we are one not two beings the mind is not an entity
a soul distinct from the body it is a behavior of the body look La Maetrie says at the effect
of physiology on our consciousness and our will reason with someone who has a temperature
of 104 as opposed to a temperature of 98.6 we ingest opium into our bodies and by coincidence
our immaterial soul wills and thinks differently we are engaged in or deprived of sexuality
and lo and behold the content of our mind the nature of our will is wholly different we slow
down the circulation of the blood we change food body temperature we make someone hungry
we see the effects of age and what do we observe we are one organism put a lesion in the brain
and lo and behold by coincidence the immortal soul behaves differently the immaterial spiritual
cause acts in a different manner slow the circulation of blood to the brain just scene of blood and
look at the effects on what you are calling an immaterial soul distinct from the human body
look at the correlation of thought and will to the physiology of brain and central nervous system
put water pressure fluid pressure on the brain and look at what happens to the immaterial soul
relieve that pressure and look at what happens to the allegedly immaterial soul we are not two
beings we are one further human beings are not categorically distinct from other animals
the transition from other animals to the human being la metrie argues is gradual and is founded
upon observable physical differences of constitution look at comparative embryology and you will see
how long will remain similar to other beings and what is it that differentiates us it is complexity
of brain and central nervous system that is not coincidence that is not theologically
dangerous it is a scientific truth to which human knowledge must be open we think we are
categorically distinct that there is no thought or ethical behavior in animals watch the dog
sacrifice itself for its master watch a mother animal sacrifice itself for its young indeed he
writes there is less theft and murder within one single species in other animals than in human
beings if anything they seem to have ethical superiority in terms of natural law further
matter is not inert and lifeless absent an indivisible soul matter is alive and vital in
certain specific organizations he knows the life sciences and the experiments with muscular irritability
that after death one may produce irritability in the tissue of muscle or peristaltic movement
inject the heart of the dead frog with a certain temperature of saline solution the heart beats
but look above all la metrie says to that extraordinary discovery of the 18th century
the polyp the soul is indivisible the body needs soul to move spontaneously and soul is
indivisible but look at the polyp cut it in half it regenerates into two polyps cut it into 50
it regenerates into 50 identical polyps but if the soul is indivisible how could that be
don't arbitrarily limit the resources of nature la metrie's conclusion is that the soul is the
effect not the cause of the body's behavior that nature has formed us as organisms capable of
thought after la metrie the most dramatic enlightenment naturalist materialist atheist
is Dennis Deterot whom we have known thus far primarily as editor of the encyclopedia he is
a member of a salon of the french enlightenment that of the baron dolbach where rousseau where
rousseau had met three atheists at once with whom he argues in the email the baron dolbach its host
Dennis Deterot and a man named Jacques André Nejon there are historians who believe that Deterot
is not interested in atheism per se but like la metrie above all wants a wholly open natural science
free from all theological interference but the only way he can do that is to argue against
theistic and spiritualist explanation my own view which i will articulate here is that indeed
atheism is primary and essential to Deterot though it is not his primary concern in his life
he tells his friends we are far from the century of reason his main effort is the encyclopedia
and opening up the minds of the culture to the central themes of the enlightenment he leaves
his atheistic manuscripts to his friend Nejon and he says publish these when you think they will
do no harm after my death and it is in that sense a bit gradually that the 18th century reading
public comes to meet the atheistic Deterot though the population of the salons had met him for decades
for the most striking thing about Deterot in the salons was his obsession with the themes of
atheism for Deterot and his writings on these subjects the crucial issue is the existence
or non-existence of God and what leads people to accept the existence of God is their sense that
it is the only explanation for motion and spontaneous motion and Deterot argues by contrast
that all nature is potentially alive that there is no categorical distinction between the organic
and the inorganic between the living and the inert that each is made of the same matter
and is capable of existing in either form and that that physical behavior depends upon organization
and upon purely material catalysts what his interlocutor says there's no categorical difference
between a man and a marble statue of a man and Deterot says no I can change the one
into the other how he says I grind up the marble statue a purely physical process
I mixed the marble statue with mud and water a purely physical process and it forms a humus
that has all of the material elements of the marble end of the earth end of the water
a purely physical process I plant in its seeds a purely physical process they grow until a goons
a purely physical process a human being ingest them a purely in physics of a purely physical
process and the elements of the marble statue become brain and skin and heart and the liver
we have transformed the one into the other all of nature is one material entity that exists
in different forms and can become living and alive when he is a precursor of Carl Sagan saying
saying you are the stuff of stars for Deterot also you are the stuff of stars life and death are
two modes two different organizations of the same matter and the hypothesis of god explains nothing
confuses much and is unnecessary to support such arguments Deterot engages in startling proto
evolutionary speculations he writes to his mistress I have no notion if this is deep philosophy
or the most aren't nonsense ever penned but he writes it appears that we have species that are
transformed over time and the survival of those that coexist best with nature and we are looking
at the survivors and we cannot predict what future species what future life will be if we
abandoned scriptural time six thousand years and give nature hundreds of thousands or millions
or tens of millions of years to work the evolutionary hypothesis can explain the world in which we
find ourselves and it must be that there is an inheritance that every cell in a body has the
information about what that entity is he projects in a book dollum bears dream that in the future
will take one cell and grow the whole human being from that it's not that he knows anything about
cloning he is speculating about if we are to explain nature without god and design what must
things be and he gets quite whimsical he says you can go into a store in the future and say 1764
that was a good year for poets I'll take one human thought Deterot argues is a scientific mystery
not a theological mystery and we must understand human thought not by ignorant speculation without
the ability experimentally to test we must understand human thought by a new science of the brain
and the nervous system we must even find analogies to understanding consciousness and the will the
vibrations of strings that set each other off the brain is the spider at the center of a web
the monastery that changes cells one at a time and changes members one at a time but preserves
the same character thereby as the brain that can change cells one at a time while preserving its
essential character and Deterot looks square in the face of the question what are the ethical
implications of such an atheistic naturalism it would mean he argues that ethics at as a behavior
ethics is something partly inherited and partly learned it has something to do with the survival
of the species it has something to do with what we learn from nature but it is a behavior of the
organism and the goal of ethics in such a model is survival and better interaction with nature and
our selves the only ethical criteria then are the pleasurable and the useful it leads him into
one of the first philosophical defenses both of masturbation and homosexuality he says neither
is terribly useful doesn't procreate the species but for the people involved there's pleasure
so there's no argument against it is the lack of pleasure the causing of pain and it is the
absence of utility that constitute the only significant meaning for vice his interlocutor
says to him but isn't that dangerous and Deterot says it might be but we need an ethic of truth
for there is nothing more dangerous than to deceive ourselves about the real nature of the world
in which we find ourselves that is the greatest danger of all for nature doesn't love us it doesn't
care for us to the extent that we coexist with nature successfully we survive otherwise we
too disappear as a species and we need an ethic of truth if we are to coexist with nature for
Deterot atheism is not an arrogance it is a humility an admission of ignorance that says
there is so much we do not know about nature about human life about ourselves and it is an
ethical commitment that we have a right through knowledge to eliminate our suffering it is for
him the ultimate humanism Deterot and French Enlightenment naturalism takes us to the end
of our course and the ultimate overthrow of an Aristotelian scholastic system that gave us a fixed
static unchanging nature of forms of qualities of essences of a great chain of being naturalism
has to be judged less on philosophical than on historical grounds is this a way of thinking
that will add to the human ability to coexist with nature to live happily it opens up a new system
of value that will be much of the modern age in an unplanned universe that does not care for us
the need to coexist with nature and each other and build a human well-being with the end of the
enlightenment the debates of the modern age will begin in all of their rich and complex and bitter
