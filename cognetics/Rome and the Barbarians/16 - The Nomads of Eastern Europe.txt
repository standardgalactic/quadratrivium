Lecture 16, The Nomads of Eastern Europe.
In this lecture I shall introduce a new set of barbarians who've really been on the periphery
up to this point, and these are various Iranian-speaking nomads in Eastern Europe.
Probably the range of nomadic tribes, or to be more precise, steppe tribes, at the time
that Rome began to move boundaries into Northern and Central Europe, extended not only from
Eastern Europe, where the Carpathian Mountains are today, the Lower Danube, but across the
steppes of Southern Russia, along the Northern and Eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, into
Central Asia.
The exact limits of Iranian dialects is difficult to determine, but Iranian languages and dialects,
that is languages related to what is now called Persian, or Farsi, spoken in Iran, was spoken
by many, many tribes dwelling from Eastern Europe well into Central Asia, and the shift
of that region linguistically from an Iranian to a largely Turkic-speaking population is
a shift that will come much later after this course in the early Middle Ages.
The first installment of Turkish speakers we think may be the Huns, they may be the first
of a group of Turkic-speaking tribes that enter in the 4th and 5th century and will
really change the political dimensions, not only of the Roman Empire, but the whole of
the steppes, but there in the future.
At the time that we are dealing with the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire, there
are no Turkish-speaking peoples out on those steppes, at least on the western half of the
Eurasian steppes.
They instead speak a language that links them linguistically to the people of Iran, that
doesn't mean that they think of themselves as Iranians, but their language goes back
to a common parent.
These people were long known to the Greeks, the Greeks call them generally Scythians,
and our best account on these Iranian nomads comes from the Greek historian Herodotus, writing
in the 5th century BC.
Herodotus is often known as the father of history, his detractors call him the father
of lies, I on the other hand think that Herodotus was a delightful individual, and he did tell
us what he was told, and he does have a sense of what's accurate or not, but being a marvelous
rock-on-tour, he wasn't going to be discouraged from telling us a very good story, just because
some of the facts weren't quite in alignment.
Nonetheless, he did check his sources, he traveled extensively, and about 450 BC he was
on the northern shores of the Black Sea, he visited a town called Olbia, which was a Greek
colony established there probably in the 7th century BC, and that would be at the mouths
of what is now the Bog River, one of the rivers of southern Russia that is actually on a trade
route that leads to the Vistula, which is the major river now bisecting Poland, and it was
part of this river access that linked the Black Sea to the Baltic.
There at Olbia, Herodotus gives us our first report of Step Nomads.
We can trace these people archaeologically back into the 7th and 8th century BC, as they
learn to perfect other riding of horses, they're marvelous saddles, we also know that they
learn to move with the seasons, they would move their herds, goat, sheep, horses over
great distances, they learn to exploit the grasslands of Central Asia, this is really
comparatively late in the history of human development, and it is a very, very sophisticated
and difficult pattern, and requires a large amount of land, you have to be able to move
these herds and horses, your stock animals and horses over great distances, you have
to be very well attuned to the seasons, it's few miscalculate in any way, there's not much
forgiveness on those Eurasian steps, you could very end up starving in the winter.
And so these Iranian nomads, as they're described by Herodotus Scythians, show many of the same
features that we have of reports of Turkmen, that is Turkish speaking tribes from the middle
ages and even from modern day, from today. The Scythians and the Romans fall heir to
these perceptions of these people, very much so, the Scythians by Greek accounts are really
the most primeval of nomads and people, they have no city, and the Greeks themselves didn't
really know who the Germans were, they didn't, Celts were as far as they got, but the Scythians
had everything that marked them as barbarians in a cultural sense as well as a linguistic
sense, they lived and felt tense, they drank mares milk, there were no cities, there were
no institutions as the Greeks understood them, they were constantly on the move and as warriors
they thought of as absolutely ferocious, they're depicted as bowmen, they are already using
that light cavalry tactics of attacking your opponent, shooting arrows, luring them, your
opponent into ambushes. The quintessential depiction of an archer in Greek art by the
6th century BC is a Scythian bowman, that is an Iranian nomadic bowman wearing a peculiarly
nickel leather cap, trousers, rather than the kind of togas and the chitons, the garments
of the Mediterranean world, this comes to embody an eastern barbarian and that art form
which you can see on Greek vase painting from especially the 5th century BC is transmitted
to the Romans and the Romans continue to use that generic image of a Iranian nomad to designate
all barbarians of the east, whether they're steppe nomads, later the Persians and the Parthians,
they're all depicted the same way and it was almost a Roman artistic convention, here is
your average eastern nomad, we just conquered him, who's different from our northern barbarian
who comes to be represented by the Germans in the 1st and 2nd century AD. So there's
an awful lot of stereotyping coming out of Herodotus that gets transmitted through artistic
and literary media to the later Romans who just pick up on these and simply apply many
of the same prejudices and assumptions about these people that you would find in the earlier
Greek accounts. Among the various customs that distinguish them is their scalping of
opponents and taking of heads, that's fairly common among many barbarians, I mentioned
it's common among the Celts, there are some really gruesome looking finds from Entremont,
the side I spoke of earlier, one of the early Celtic cities near the Rome Valley, it's on
the eastern side of it where we have monuments to severed heads, but the Scythians are notorious
for taking off the skin, sewing them together in cloaks, there's all sorts of stories about
them chopping the top off, turning the skulls into drinking cups, gilding them and filling
in the holes where the eyes and the mouth were, and these are traditions passed on to
later Turkic nomads, we find these being reported in the Middle Ages, there's no reason to
disbelieve this from the finds that we get. There's also reports that the Scythians and
their successors, the Sarmatians, the Iranian people who come to displace the Scythians in
the 2nd century BC and who encounter Rome, that both of them value women as warriors.
The Scythians, because of their trade contacts with the Greeks, gained a lot of wealth and
built some very impressive barrows, kurgans as they're called in southern Russia, especially
in the region of the Kuban, which is just to the east of the Sea of Ozoff today, and
these kurgans are monumental burials, sometimes multiple burials of generations, and about
a third of all burials excavator are of women, and they're invariably found with all sorts
of weapons and horse implements and equipment, and this just reinforced Roman stereotyping,
aha, you see they're really barbaric because they got Amazons, they're mounting on their
armies and they're absolutely ferocious and they're putting women in charge, and so you
can see where some of the stereotyping comes into the classical literary tradition.
The earliest report of a Scythian war is by King Darius of Persia, who in 512 BC crossed
from Asia Minor into Thrace, into the Balkans, crossed the Danube, and tried to pursue and
bring to battle the Scythians because he was aware that these nomadic Scythians who were
threatening his European possessions were essentially the same people attacking through
the Caucasus into the Iranian heartland and farther east on his distant northeastern frontiers,
that he was aware there was this large arc of Scythians dwelling to the north of the
civilized zones. Well, there was warfare between the Greek
world and the Scythians, there will be a great deal of cases of Romans legions clashing with
the later Samaritans who are the next group of Iranian nomads we know about, but it should
always be kept in mind, as in the case of the relations of the Romans with the Germans,
that probably most daily transactions didn't involve warfare, and the Scythians proved
very adept, particularly their princes, in subjecting various peoples in their area,
such as the Dacians in the modern region of Romania, the Carpathians, the exacted tribute
in metals, from the agriculturalists of southern Russia who grew grain, wheat primarily, from
tribes dwelling in the forest zones of what are now European Russia, tribute was imposed
in the form of furs and timber and honey, flax, slaves, and what happened is that the
step nomads very quickly learned, the Scythians and later the Sarmatians who followed them,
that they could tax all of these different cultures and take these goods and trade it
for the prestige goods of the Mediterranean world. A Scythian wheat, it's called, it's
really wheat grown by the subjects of the Scythians in southern Russia, becomes the
wheat that feeds the Greek world from the 5th century B.C. on. And it's so important
that the Greeks actually give up growing barley and eating imported wheat from southern Russia
because the trade is so brisk, and this continues well into the Roman age, where the cities
of the Aegean world very much depend on the commodities of the Russian steps and the areas
controlled by Iranian nomads. In turn, all sorts of finished Greek goods arrived, there's
the usual cultural exchange, the tombs, the kurgans have been marvelous this way, they
date from the 7th century B.C. to the 2nd century B.C. They show that the Scythians
proved to be very adept imitators and students of Greek art, they brought their own traditions
of what is known as animal style art, very well seen in their decorative jewelry, there
have been several very spectacular displays of Scythian art, and they've taken this animal
tradition, that is the depiction of horses and gazelles and mythological animals, and
combined it with Greek naturalistic tendencies in their art to produce absolutely stunning
jewelry, writing equipment, the quivers of where they kept their arrows were just marvelous
decoration. These techniques of decoration get passed to the Greek world, many Scythian
objects become the rage, and the lynchpin in this trade are the Greek cities on the
northern shores of the Black Sea, Olbia, which I mentioned was a city visited by Herodotus,
and particularly the cities in what is now called the Crimea, which the Greeks would
have called the Tauric Cursinesis. There were a group of Greek colonies going back to the
7th century B.C., mostly Greeks coming from the city of Miletus and Asia Minor, these
Greek cities had long term connections with the nomads of Eastern Europe, those connections
would pass to the Romans and eventually to the Byzantines, and so those Greek cities
were the points of contact, many Scythians moved into these Greek cities, at one point
there was a Hellenized dynasty of Scythian kings ruling sort of as the Greeks would call
them a tyrant, think of them as sort of a military figure, a warlord of sorts, acting
as probably an extended protection racket, I'm going to be king of the Greek cities,
pay me so much tribute and I'll keep even nastier barbarians away from you, and the
Romans fall heir to that system. King Mithridates' apontus, that last determined opponent of
the Hellenistic world, took over the Greek cities in 110 B.C., he moved into the Crimea,
took them under his protection, and that was very important because it gained him access
into the mercenary markets of all of those Iranian warriors, and he fielded large number
of Iranian nomadic horsemen who battled the Romans, especially in the first and third
Mithridatic war. Well, as I said, these people would have been on the fringe of the Roman
world through much of the Republic, and it was only at the beginning of the Imperial
Age, as the Romans moved into Northern and Central Europe, that they began to encounter
these nomadic horsemen of the steppes, and they found them quite different from the desert
nomads that they had encountered in North Africa, or they encountered along the deserts
of Syria. By the time the Romans arrive on the scene, the Scythians are long gone. The
term Scythian is still used. It appears in classical and Christian sources well into
the Middle Ages, and it becomes a designation, it's almost on the order of the way Huns or
Tartars are used, or the word ogre in English. The Orgoy, who are a particularly vicious
Turkic tribe, actually the ancestors of modern Hungarians are probably Orgors, and so, you
know, all Hungarians are ogres, and the word comes to mean the fantastic giant animal,
these horsemen, barbarians, and Christian tradition, they're linked with the horsemen
and the apocalypse. So when the Romans established frontiers on the Rhine and the Danube, their
whole frontier running from what would today be essentially Vienna, down to the mouth of
the Danube, a stretch of probably something on the order of 800 miles of frontier, 750
miles of frontier, marched along new barbarian people, some of them settled, the Dacian,
particularly these peculiar nomadic tribes, and one wonders, well, why spend so much time
on them? Well, the Romans found them particularly curious and came to dread them and respect
them on the order that they did of the Germans, and they had a sense that somewhere in Central
Europe, you moved out of this dramatic zone into this nomadic zone, you were encountering
and dealing with a different set of peoples. The Sarmatians, as far as we can tell, we
don't have much in the way of, you know, we have personal names, report it from classical
sources, we have some specific loan words that have come in through Latin and Greek,
but we really don't have much to go on in terms of their language. The Sarmatians seem
to be probably an element of the Scythian confederation, people who were dwelling to
the east of the regions north of the Black Sea, which were in on the trade routes, that
is, there would be east of the Don River, they might have been on the lower Volga, north
of the Caspian Sea, and sometime in the second and first century BC, moved into the heartland
of where the old Scythian, the royal Scythians as they were called in Greek, where they had
dominated, that is, from the lower Danube to the Don River, that whole area along the
western and northern shores of the Black Sea. They did not represent a single unified group,
the ancient sources are quite clear on that, they notice a number of different tribes,
all of them are glumped together as Sarmatians, a new term to designate these people, and
there is a change in the material culture. For one thing, the Sarmatians do not have
the wealth, the resources, or the inclination to build these marvelous tombs, and therefore
we know much less about them than we would like, whereas the Scythians put great effort
into building these great kurgans, these burial mounds where we get all this information,
the Sarmatians don't do so, their burials are much simpler, there's apparently cases
of cremation, it just doesn't leave the remains. There have been efforts to link these people
with figures named, tribes named in the annals of the Han Empire of China in the third and
second century B.C., the Ancai or other such renditions of the name, which may be a Chinese
rendition of Alhans, and you get a lot of speculation that maybe these Iranians came
farther east, they had been chased west by the Chinese armies, this is quite speculative,
we'll get into this issue when we go to the Huns, there's this very, very strong popular
image that perhaps I should address at this point, that ultimately Rome fell because China
built the Great Wall, and eventually all these nomadic peoples that the Romans had been dealing
with for hundreds of years were just sent in motion by the Chinese, and the Romans were
just not smart enough to build the same type of wall and send them back to the Chinese
compliments of Rome, and actually what you're looking at the Great Wall is a construction
of, it's really a construction largely of this 17th and 18th century, at the time of
the Roman Empire the Chinese Great Wall looked very much like the walls that we will find
in Rome, Hadrian's Wall, walls in Germany, they were largely moat, palisades, they divided
certain areas that were, strong points, you know, key invasion routes might be marked,
those areas were not fortified, the Chinese just as the Romans understood, it isn't walls
that regulate your frontiers, it's effective armies, it's policy, it's coming to terms
with those people on the other side of the frontier, and so this notion that there was
a Chinese wall that sent somehow all of these people in motion and gave us the serrations
and later the Huns is very much overdrawn, what we do know is whenever, whatever reason,
whenever a nomadic group decides to move, and this is very clear when you're dealing
with the period of the Mongols, and it could be set in motion simply by harsh conditions
of famine and local tribal wars or trying to avoid a plague, those tribes can move very
quickly within a generation, they can move thousands of miles from the original homeland,
set themselves up in a similar climate, and within a generation see this as their new
homeland, so in terms of movement, in terms of migration, they will move very, very quickly
and they don't leave much of a record in the archaeological evidence. Well, the eastern
branch of the serrations, the Romans called the Alhans, these are fellows who eventually
end up coming into the Roman Empire and some of them end up in Spain and North Africa talking
about movement. The Alhans were one branch of the serrations, they ended up settling
on the eastern steppes, stretching between the Black Sea and the Caspian, and that put
them in a very, very favorable position because they were able to cross the Great Caucasus
and invade what was called Transcaucasia. This is the Russian term for the region, which
we would today call Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, sections of eastern Turkey. The heart of that
region was the historic Armenian kingdom, centering on Lake Van and the associated rivers,
the high Armenian plateau, which is now a large chunk of eastern Turkey and the Armenian
Republic. The Armenian kingdom had come together as a Hellenistic style kingdom in the 2nd
century BC. By 100 BC, their king Tigranis aspired to be one of the great kings of the
Near East, and we'll discuss them in a later lecture, but these zones were now subject
to attack by Alhans who had crossed the Great Mountain Pass, the Caspian Gates, and invaded
Armenia, and from there they could enter into Mesopotamia, Iran, and the civilized zones.
We get reports of fearful raids, launched in 35 and 72 AD. One of them by the Jewish
historian Flavius Josephus, who takes time out in his discussion of the Jewish War against
the Romans, that's the first Jewish war in 6673, to make a note that, oh, by the way,
in 72 AD there were the really dreadful people who came and just ransacked all of these regions,
and aren't we lucky that we're not being attacked by them, but he uses images that
associates them with the apocalypse that later Christians seize upon as a possible image.
These Alhans are one of the major reasons why the Romans will end up reorganizing their
northeastern frontier along the Euphrates, because they're situated at a point where
if they come through those passes in the Caucasus, they have two directions to go, and I always
like to think of the Eurasian steppes as this massive highway that runs from the Roman world
to the Chinese Empire, and one of the major exit ramps off that highway is through the
Caucasus, and they can either hook a right turn and go into the Roman Empire and invade
Asia Minor, or they can sort of veer left and crash into the Parthian and Persian Empire,
and the Romans do everything in their power to encourage them to go east, to go into Persia,
but should they hook into the western route, the traditional route of entering Turkey,
the Romans are going to have to handle this, and that really is one of the major reasons
why the Romans build a whole eastern frontier in what is eastern Turkey in the first and
second century AD. Furthermore, the Romans respect these Alans and their kinsmen they
encounter on the Danube, not only were they very, very good horse archers, these Sarmatians
do fight differently from the Scythians. By the first century AD, they are equipping
heavy cavalry as well as horse archers. The Latin term for them are cataphracti, a term
that persists well into the Byzantine age. These are heavily mounted warriors in overlapping
leather armor, the Lamala armor, or chain mail in some instances. They are mounted on
chargers, horses not nearly as large as the medieval horses, but horses that are trained
for riding in groups. They are lancers, they wield a double sword. The Romans, on a number
of occasions, tell how they can get the better of these forces when they get them in snow
conditions. They're too heavily weighted down. There's two reports where the Roman legions
actually bushwhack these guys and bring them down. They're also regarded as the people
who introduced a lot of the military emblems used in the later Roman Empire, including
inflated balloons of dragons and leather and other such devices, heraldic devices that
get passed on to the Middle Ages, because they're adopted by Roman forces. Certainly
by the reign of the Emperor Hadrian 117-138 AD, there are cataphracti, that is, the Romans
are mounting their own formations as heavy cavalry to counter these nomads coming out
of eastern Russia, the steps of southern Russia, south-western Russia, sorry, getting a little
geographically confused here. One of the most remarkable accounts we have
on them is by a fellow named Flavius Arianus. We anglicize his name as Arian, he's a Greek
writer, he's a personal friend of the Emperor Hadrian, he knew the Emperor Trajan, he was
a Roman senator and governor in Asia Minor in Cappadocia. He wrote a remarkable work known
as the Battle Line Against the Allons, or sometimes the Sarmatians, and he tells us
how not only the Sarmatians, the Allons are armed, but how do you counter them? And he
gives us a very detailed discussion of the way he lines up his legions in auxiliary cavalry,
and if you read it carefully, it is a shift from the Roman tradition of fighting in swords
to the dense phalanx formation that characterized Greek warfare, close cooperation between the
infantry and the Roman heavy cavalry, use of foot archers. In fact, the manual could
very easily be applied to the tactics the Austrians used against Ottoman forces in the 16th and
17th century, the only difference is you'd introduce early firearms rather than bows.
They had figured out, and he's writing this about 135 AD, they figured out very quickly
on how to counter these people, and there's a great deal of respect the Romans accord
to them. As I mentioned, there were other kin of the Allons, other Sarmatians that moved
into Eastern Europe. One of the most important one are known as the Roxalani, they dwelled
in what today would be Wallatia and Moldavia, that would be the Eastern sections of Romania,
they're just north of the Danube. The Yad Zigeis are a group that move into the basin
of the Tice, that is the great river system flowing into the Middle Danube, the Eastern
plains of Hungary, sections of Slovakia, parts of Romania, they are described in very similar
terms to the Allons, and there they intermix with Germans and with Dacian peoples, and
are involved in transmitting a lot of Roman goods from the Danube markets into Central
Europe. The Sarmatians as a group, while feared and respected by the Romans, were never targeted
for conquest the same way the Germans would, and this will bring us back to the Roman preoccupation
with the Germans as the northern barbarians. There are reports of Sarmatian nomadic armies,
combinations of horse archers and heavy cavalry, they number between 5,000 and 10,000, there
are several reports of Sarmatian tribes, especially Roxalani, that is people on the lower Danube,
surrendering themselves to the Romans, and the Romans are taking them into military service,
Emperor Marcus Aurelius actually took 7,200 of them as allies, enrolled them in the Roman
army, sent 6,000 of them to Britain, that kept them pretty loyal, and the other 1,200 were
dispersed in the Roman world. The Romans never felt that these groups of barbarians posed
a serious threat to the overall security of Rome. On the other hand, the Romans had to
take very, very strong measures to protect their frontiers, and did evolve the kinds
of policies I've discussed in passing elsewhere, that the dealing with these people was a matter
of regulating the contact and the flow of trade and immigrants across the frontiers
of Roman Europe, especially the Danube and the Euphrates. We have a remarkable document,
one of our best documents about how the Romans saw this problem, and again to stress the
fact that these Roman frontiers are not boundaries as we understand them today, with a clear demarcation
and customs and passports and the like. This is from a funerary monument, it's from a tombstone
of a fellow named Tiberius Plautius Silvanus of a great Roman family, who was legate, that
is Governor of Moesia, which would be today the sections of Bulgaria along the Danube,
and he lays out in great detail his entire military and political career as a governor
and consul official in the reigns of the Emperor Claudius and Nero in the early first century
AD. And in this document, he goes out of his way to tell you that he was a governor, pro-preter
in the province of Moesia, and in this province Moesia, he, referring to himself in the third
person, so technique going back to Caesar, transplanted and forced to pay tribute more
than 100,000 trans denubians with their wives, children, chiefs and kings. He suppressed
an incipient disturbance of serrations, although he had sent a great part of his army to the
expedition against Armenia, and kings hitherto unknown or hostile to the Roman people, he
brought to the bank of the Danube, which he guarded to honor the Roman standards, he restored
to the kings of the Barstarnians and the Roxalanians, these are, one is perhaps Celtic, the other
is Iranian, their sons, to the kings of the Dacians, his brothers, who had been captured
or rescued from the enemies. And from the other kings, he received hostages. By these
measures, he both strengthened and advanced the peace of the province. And that is a very
telling summation of his activities, that the disturbance apparently was a possible migration
of these nomadic peoples to come into a Roman province, he had somehow halted it, probably
north of the frontier by some kind of military action, and then he selected, he claims, over
100,000 peoples, these would be serrations and other people, who could have been sent
in motion by this tribal migration, he's brought them in, he's scattered them, he's settled
them in the Roman province on vacant land, he's turned them into Roman provincials, he's
taken hostages, he's made treaty arrangements, and has so secured the peace. And that inscription
is a rare contemporary document written by a man who understands frontiers and understands
these nomadic peoples and how the Romans dealt with them. But also in a way, it gives a sense
of how the Romans came to regard these serrations as very much a secondary threat. And so, Rome
in the late 4th century was quite ill-prepared to handle a new set of nomads, Turkish-speaking
nomads, Huns, who swept out of the Russian steppes at the end of the 4th century and
changed the ground rules between Rome and the Eastern nomads.
