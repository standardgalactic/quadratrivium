In this lecture I'm going to shift our focus away from the western Mediterranean where we've
dealt with different types of barbarians in Spain and Gaul and North Africa to the eastern
half of the Mediterranean and at start you might think well what sort of barbarians could
be living out there because the Aegean world was the home of Greek civilization we have
Egypt which is one of the oldest civilizations in the Near East very wealthy cities in Syria
and it must be stressed that while you do have the Nile Valley and you have these Mediterranean
zones stretching from Greece through Asia Minor along the Levantine shore the interiors of these
regions were anything but civilized even in the 3rd and 2nd century BC the Balkans were largely
unexplored region through most of the period of the Roman Republic these regions would not be
conquered until the time of the emperor Augustus really at the very end of the 1st century BC
the great plateau of Turkey today the interior the Anatolian Plateau and the high table land of
Armenia just to the east the regions of Transcaucasia these were all forbidding in barbarian lands
and regions that involved great distances and natural barriers and then farther east
dwelled peoples that the Romans regarded as barbarians those would be again another
set of desert nomads the Arabs along the rim of the Arabian desert threatening the area the
Romans would call Syria and the Parthians to the east the great step descendants of step nomads
who would build up a counter empire who would come to represent in the imperial age one of Rome's
two principal barbarian enemies the Parthians in the east and the Germans whom we introduced in
the last lecture to the north so that while Rome initially in this region was defeating the great
civilized powers the Hellenistic monarchies that succeeded Alexander the Great the lesser Greek
leagues and city-states in taking over these areas and in reducing the Greek or the Hellenistic
perhaps is a more correct name powers inherited the problem of coping with frontiers with new
barbarian peoples in the east as well as in the north and in the south that requires us for a moment
to see exactly what the Romans inherited when they took over the hegemony of the Greek world
in terms of defeating the Greek civilized powers and again these terms civilized and
barbarians are always a certain amount of relativity here that the Romans did very quickly
those those powers could be humbled in decisive battles in two major wars the kingdom of Macedon
is destroyed in 197 and 168 BC both of them in a decisive battle and those battles prove that
without question the Roman legion just absolutely outclassed any of the phalanx or other types of
heavy infantry used in the Greek world the other leading rival was the Seleucan empire that was
the the emperors the kings Macedonian generals originally kings who ruled over the asian possessions
of Alexander that stretched from the Aegean to the Indus that empire was smashed into decisive
battle in 190 BC at Magnesia perhaps the most ferocious infantry charge on record where the
Roman legionaries just carried the field and that essentially ended Seleucan power as a serious
rival there was a very harsh treaty imposed on the defeated king Antiochus III and his empire
went into rather rapid decline in the generation after his death and essentially fragmented and
the victors of that fragmentation would be the Parthians that Iranian foe will be talking about
in the future a descendant of step nomads who moved into Iran the Romans as a result inherited
rather complicated political situation and as in North Africa and for a fair amount of time in
Spain the Romans that it sent it did its best to dodge any kind of responsibilities and running
these areas they hope that the Greek powers that were left in place all much lesser states
little kingdoms like Pergamon or the city of Athens or these regional Greek leagues or the
reduced Seleucan empire they're also a Macedonians ruling in the Nile Valley in Egypt the Ptolemies
but they were they were so weak and decadent and Romanized that they were just a you know
a marginal client power that happened to be very wealthy and the Romans always
were extorting money from them but they posed no threat it was hoped that they rule as dutiful
clients and and one of the main themes that really don't belong to this course but essentially the
Greeks never understood what these obligations meant and the Romans were constantly involved in
coming in and rectifying these disputes and later Roman government governors in the Greek
speaking provinces as I mentioned spent a lot more time sorting out disputes among litigious
Greeks that is facing Greek lawyers a far more menacing threat than facing barbarians on the
battlefield on the other hand these civilized zones were a bordering frontier areas that would
require the attention of Rome and increasingly so because these regions were extremely profitable
and it's an important point to stress that as Rome acquires that Mediterranean empire
while Spain is important and North Africa is a great success story the preponderance of population
wealth in cities is in the eastern half of the Mediterranean that is in Asia Minor in Egypt
and Syria these were much older civilizations so it became evident to the Romans fairly quickly
that they're going to have to take measures to handle the barbarians threats to these now
eastern provinces now in the Balkans in the late republic the Romans are really quite fortunate
they'd never faced a serious opponent in the Balkans in the late republic they had a couple
of Macedonian rebellions there is the usual mismanagement of the province the Thracians
people occupying today what is known as Bulgaria the the republic of Bulgaria the Thracians a
people described by the Greeks from the sixth century BC as ferocious barbarians wild red hair
they drink unmixed wine as they don't cut it with water obviously they're all crazy in Greek
actually these people have been very much Hellenized they were a martial race and they
were brought in in a client arrangement and they pretty much could control the Balkans
patrol the Balkans in Roman interest and these regions have been greatly affected by trade and
it wasn't until really the first and early second century AD when the Romans faced a serious threat
in the Balkans that is the Dacians so the Romans essentially didn't have to take any measures
in defending their their Greek possessions there was there are no military forces I think a legion
was stationed in Macedon which probably spent more of its time at the gaming tables at Philippi
in Thessalonica than it did actually on on patrol east of the Aegean in Asia Minor where the Romans
eventually organized a province known as Asia and 133 BC that would be the western third of Turkey
as well as in southern Turkey there was a province Cilicia which would be the southern shore of Turkey
in those areas they inherited Greek cities there were Roman governors sent there but primarily
the region was open to tax farmers to merchants many of them coming from Sicily and southern Italy
that is they either spoke Greek they may have been of Greek descent they moved in to exploit
all the opportunities that these civilized areas offered tax farming contracts and commercial
farming shipping of banking loans certainly tens of thousands of people from Italy not just Romans
but many Italian allies moved in and exploited the areas but there was no real military presence
or organization the Romans sent some military forces in to put down a rebellion rather embarrassing
rebellion in 133 to 130 BC a group of ill armed slaves and peasants for four years opposed Roman
rule and on the whole the Roman presence in the Greek world was really rather unimpressive
added the fact the Romans were having all their draft problems in Spain there was the embarrassing
screw-ups in the Jigurthine war and so that the main barbarian opponent which would be the peoples
in central Anatolia Armenia and the steps of southern Russia the various uh step nomads there
probably didn't have much of an impression of Roman power and this proved to be quite dangerous
and it resulted in the emergence of a barbarian king and to the Romans he would have been regarded
as a barbarian and he's called as such he's often compared to Jigurtha a man by the name of
Mithridides Mithridides Upatur the sixth king of Pontus a northeastern Asia minor who man who liked
to think of himself as the new Alexander the great he's often shown in an alex costume with the
the hair in this sort of heroic guys and he's wearing the lion skin helmet and he mints coins
and has statues put up so he looks like the new alexander in reality he was descended from Iranian
and Anatolian dynast who ruled in northeastern Asia minor who had come to style themselves as
Phil Helene that is pro-greek kings and he ruled a very tough and rugged area of Turkey today
in which he could draw on these martial races races the people of Pontus the Galatians that
is the Celts settled in central Anatolia the various step nomads the the Greeks called all
these people Scythians these are Iranian speaking nomads of southern Russia Mithridides control
what is now the Crimea which is part of the Republic of the Ukraine I believe anyway when I
checked most recently it was and this area was a home to a group of Greek colonies that acknowledged
Mithridides as their king and he had very good military contracts out to the Scythian nomads
he also had contacts with the various Georgian peoples of the Caucasus and of the Armenians the
king of Armenia Tigranis the great who for a short time aspired to become king of the east was his
son-in-law so he had the Armenian cavalry he also had contracts out with the barbarians of the Balkans
and central Europe and so Mithridides built up a enormous mercenary professional force by calling
on the martial races of the Balkans Anatolia Armenia and the Russian steps he had inherited
a position where he along with other client kings in Asia Minor were supposed to patrol the
Roman frontiers and Anatolia that is the Romans when they got into what is now Turkey which
would have been largely a Greek speaking urban area in its western third and its southern shores
and a couple of Greek colonies on the North Sea really did not wish to get involved in dealing
with these very vast unknown areas in the interior and what they did is essentially apply the system
they had in North Africa they tried to make arrangements with the various kings there were
at least three major kingdoms in Anatolia there's one in Bithynia the kingdom of Pontus that's
Mithridides kingdom a kingdom of Cappadocia which is still a region in Turkey today very well known
to tourists for its textiles its rugs and its pottery um farther east were the Armenians and
the Romans hoped that turning these kings into friends of Rome meant that they would handle the
patrolling of the area and the Romans could happily exploit the Greek cities which they did to great
delight and success and a couple of um mistakes in handling these reasons by the Romans resulted
in a military crisis that nearly toppled the republic at one point seemed to topple the
republic or it's at least its eastern empire in the eastern half of the Mediterranean first
there were no regular military forces stationed east of the Aegean what the Romans did send were
governors they built some important highways and they sent above all tax farmers and bankers
and the Romans exploit the Greek cities ruthlessly it the worst of corruption that one could imagine
in a Roman province occurred in the province of Asia it was an extremely wealthy area it was put
up for tax contracts every five years and above all the tax contract the bidding for the right to
collect the taxes in Asia uh was done in Rome by equestrians it got uh connected with the
political struggles in Rome the equestrians wanted lucrative contracts they were given
all sorts of generous terms no one bothered to investigate the corruption charges and above all
as a way of winning this equestrian order over to the the popular race that is the the so-called
popular rather you know loaded term party in Rome was to give the jury courts that is the courts
that were to handle corruption charges over to the very equestrians who were extorting the
province you could imagine what went on there was there's one governor who actually went in there
and tried to reform the province Poulius Rutilius Rufus in 92 BC he tried to renegotiate the contract
he thought it was unreasonable when you started charging more interest than the actual principle
of the debt and this this was starting to annoy the provincials and what happened to Rufus is the
equestrians put him on trial for corruption and he was tried and and banished from Rome and he went
back to stay with the Greeks whom he supposedly shaken down and it was just another mark in the
dismal politics that were going on in Rome so that these very wealthy provinces were alienated
of the Greek cities there were no Roman military forces and Roman military performance had not
been impressive in the last generation furthermore King Mithridates who came to the throne in 121
or 120 BC as a young man very quickly drew the conclusion and he had been warned by none other
than Gaius Marius who was out on a mission in Asia Minor at the time that either he would have to
learn to be strong or obey the laws and the will the will the demands of Rome in silence
and he proved to be a king who not only styled himself after Alexander the Great but also had a
lot of the organizational skill and knowledge of warfare that Alex had Roman authors and of course
the Romans are the Romans are always in this inferiority complex with Alexander every Roman
commander wants to think that he is as good or greater than Alexander none of them is maybe Julius
Caesar is getting close to it but that that's just a fact and so when the Romans defeat different
opponents well that opponent is the greatest king since Alexander and that's what they say with
Mithridates is the greatest king since Alexander and by the way we defeated him it actually took
you know three major Roman Roman commanders to do it which is another story coming up
so Mithridates proved to be an indomitable opponent well organized and had at his beck and
call enormous resources from the various barbarian lands around the Black Sea and you have to think
of him as dominating all of these areas through his military contracts economic contacts political
alliances matrimonial alliances with these different peoples he was bullied in my opinion to some
extent he was really bullied into a war by the Romans that broke out in 90 BC on the other
hand Mithridates was also looking for an effort looking for an issue to test his power against
Rome and was not going to be satisfied being a dutiful client king so there's there's wrong
on both sides here Mithridates timed his first war against Rome extremely well in 90 BC the
Italian allies in frustration rose in rebellion against their Roman master these are the various
allies of south and central Italy who had been allied with Rome since the fourth century BC
and we're clamoring now for Roman citizenship and the Roman political figure a man named
Marcus Olivia reduces the younger who tried to broker an honest agreement to get all of these
Italian allies citizens was assassinated under mysterious circumstances the bills of enfranchisement
were were thwarted and 150,000 Italian allies many of them veterans from the wars in Spain
and north Africa rose in rebellion and Rome was facing a whirlwind of destruction in Italy and
had to summon every general they even got Marius out of retirement to try to beat down the Italian
allies and as I mentioned earlier the only way they defeated this rebellion was to give the
allies citizenship and that more than doubled the citizen body because now all of Italy was
going to be enfranchised as Roman at the same time Mithridates declares his war the Romans are
battling in Italy for their lives and the armies of the king of Pontus sweep Asia Minor the Romans
are stunned there are three Roman governors out there plus a client king in the course of three
months Mithridates smashes three Roman armies one Bithynian army that's the client king a fellow
named Nicomedes the fourth overruns the Roman province of Asia and sends his armies into Greece
Athens welcomes a Pontic army and before the Romans know it they are receiving news that their
eastern empire is essentially collapsed that brought about the near financial collapse of money
markets in Rome it was a it was a financial disaster the Romans had never expected such a swift
collapse of their possessions in the east they had been quite complacent they had had no forces
there they also didn't bank on the depths of bad choice of word in a way on the depths of Greek
hatred for Roman misrule over the last generation and a half Mithridates didn't need to give the
Greeks much encouragement to tell them to slaughter the Romans in their midst according to account
60 000 Romans and Italians were slaughtered in the province of Asia alone now we don't know what
these figures mean I mean 60 000 is a conventional number you always get numbers of 60 000 80 000
100 000 it means a lot of Romans and Italians uh some of the tales are absolutely horrifying and
in the city of trawlis in the meander valley were told no is a trawlis no nisa I think um no it's
trawlis nisa was pro-roman tra in the city of trawlis they actually took the children of the
Romans uh there and drowned them as if they were little cats you know that you didn't want
drown them in the wells uh there's there's stories of Romans rushing into temples trying to seek
asylum being dragged out and having their their throats cut I mean there was no love lost between
the Greek provincials and the roman masters and they hailed Mithridates as in alexander the great
and part of Mithridates problem is he you know he fell victim to his own propaganda unfortunately
what the Greeks had summoned out of the depths of asia minor was not so much a Macedonian or
Greek king but a uh a barbarian king who was masquerading as a a phil hellene and Mithridates
as soon as the romans were massacred and the property was confiscated started taxing these
cities quartering his barbarian soldiers on on uh Greek cities and you can imagine all the problems
when you bring you know the nomads of russia and you quarter them in a city like Ephesus
Ephesus 250 000 strong uh the city is just a swinging place I mean even roman armies go
berserk and Ephesus and lose all discipline and immediately uh Mithridates begins to alienate
uh many of these Greek provincials who begin to wonder well maybe the romans aren't so bad
after all in the meanwhile the romans uh conclude their social war very quickly and they're forced
to make concessions to their italian allies largely because they have to take on Mithridates
there's a complicated scene in italy and and this is perhaps even more important in some ways than
the the course of the actual three Mithridatic wars and only one in three count number two is
really just sort of a interlude uh and that is the romans are put into a major constitutional
dilemma they enfranchise all the italian allies by series of bills in 89 bc they also extend the
potential of franchise to the people of sasal pangol I mentioned that all of those provincials
now have latin status and the cities are made into roman colonies this is an enormous undertaking
that meant all of these people had to be registered in the roman constitution they had to be put in
tribes so they could vote in the tribal assembly the 35 tribes they had to be registered in the
censured assembly according to their property regulation they had to there there had to be a
census and accounting thousands of people had to be enrolled and by even a conservative estimate
that meant there would be more new citizens than old citizens new citizens would be 60% of the
citizen body anyone who carried out the registration of these allies was going to become the patron
of all these potential voters who are now new citizens this caused a political football in
roman uh there was rioting in the city marius came out of retirement uh to back the popular race
group headed by a guy called silpicious rufus a tribune who wanted to distribute the new citizens
evenly among the tribes the residential districts the property districts so that they would get a
full representation in the assemblies the conservatives wanted to take all the new allies and dump them
in a group of later you know less new tribes or units which wouldn't really vote because they'd
vote last and they were majority that is they would manipulate the unit voting system so that
these numbers could be neutralized you'd have 17 new tribes but the earth the first 35 tribes would
have already carried the motion before the new ones could ever vote uh and of course the allies
weren't going to be cheated this way and uh marius came out of retirement hoping to get the command
against mithridates and and marius thought well he deserved it he beat jugertha after all or at
least claimed to he beat the northern barbarians now's my chance to fight eastern barbarians you
know i haven't had a chance to test my efforts against armenians and people from anatolya uh
unfortunately no one took marius seriously at this point he hadn't been active in command for 12 years
and the console of the year who was supposed to get the command was a guy called sulla
lucius cornelius sulla who was marius's old lieutenant and had actually negotiated the
surrender of jugertha and sulla in his in recent years had become the darling of the conservatives
at rome and sulla believed that he should have the command and in the rioting in in in rome sulla
actually found refuge in marius's house he agreed to allow the uh the populare so rufus and marius
to give marius the command so he could go against mithridates well sulla wasn't going to be thwarted
this easily he left rome he went to southern italy to the city of nola in campania where he found his
veteran legions that he had led in the social war and sulla was known as a really disreputable type
he was from a depraved aristocratic really patrician family uh the cornelii he uh he had hung around
with actors and prostitutes earlier in his career his acting ability that's as low as you can get
in rome being an actor uh his um his acting career uh actually helped him a great deal
he convinced his soldiers that uh they should march on the city of rome and make him commander
because marius and the radicals had illegally taken away from him and the army responded
uh this is a turning point in rome politics uh sulla got into rome chased out the popularies
there's a bloodbath and essentially initiated the first civil war he didn't stay around to fight
the civil war he went east and handily defeated the armies of mithridates he drove pontic armies
out of greece and what mithridates didn't realize when he carried out his first war with rome is
he wasn't facing those ill armed and ill led or more more demoralized legions that had fought the
last wars in spain and north africa he was facing the veterans that had been drilled in fighting
the northern barbarians the numidian foe that is the army that marius had created sulla arrived and
swept out the pontic armies mithridates fortunately got off with a treaty retreated to his kingdom
in 85 bc and sulla who could have destroyed mithridates decided instead to consolidate his
his his position in the east tax the eastern provinces raise great forces and go back to
italy because in his absence marius and the popular race had reoccupied rome in 87 bc and had
declared sulla illegal a rogue consul sulla returned in a swift civil war crushed his opponents
carried out a brutal set of reprisals and imposed a dictatorship on rome and rewrote the roman
constitution now that's a separate issue in itself but what this what this experience of the first
mithridatic war proved is that a general who could go and win a tremendous victory over barbarians
and have the time to forge a veteran army could come back with a veteran army thousands of clients
and allies among the provincials money take power in rome and then legitimize himself
and that's essentially what sulla did with sulla's experience the roman republic is now in trouble
uh mithridates challenged rome again in 74 bc as the romans were involved in repeated civil war
actions and the only way mithridates could be defeated in this last war the third mithridatic
war between 74 and 63 bc is the romans had to send out commanders uh the senate sent out first
a man called lucius lysinius who call us uh as consul and then extended his career down to really
down to 69 bc was he was recalled in 68 bc and then uh pompe pompe the great who took over
the command against uh mithridates who eventually was driven to suicide and remained in the east
till 63 bc these are two very extended commands now the romans had done this before that is they
had given pro consular power uh to magistrates before but never had you had commanders on this
order especially with pompe when pompe went out to the east he had 120 000 men under his command
120 warships 24 legates that is magis men who could act as his lieutenants it's a
latin war for lieutenant he had overriding power to make treaties arrangements he could supersede
any governor or any roman magistrate in the provinces he was in effect a king he defeated a
number of different types of barbarians he reordered the eastern provinces he put in provincial
administration he created the frontiers of the late republic which were inherited by the emperor
gustus he also uh set up the system of client kings he he gave uh uh mithridates son the control
of the crimea he arranged a client king in armenia he also was to negotiate with the parthians and
and define roman eastern frontiers he incorporated syria the romans now inherited a new nomadic
foe in the arabs he arranged the balkans but all of these frontier arrangements these organizations
of provinces and in some cases these arrangements lasted into the second century ad were all done
by this super magistrate a man who held powers above the normal roman constitution so what
mithridates had done is make the final challenge to that republican system which forced the romans
to send out a professional army under long term uh pro consuls super governors who had the powers to
become kings what they needed was legitimacy constitutional legitimacy in rom that is to win
and to reinforce that position and in the case of pompy just as marius he was reluctant to do so
he was from a relatively new noble family his father had been consul but none of his previous
ancestors pompy really wanted respectability in the eyes of the old families and so he was not
going to play a sulla and and wage a civil war and put himself in power on the other hand the
constitutional precedents what became the powers of the roman emperor the uh lesson the example of
using a war against these barbarians to build up this superposition was there uh the implications
of how to win over a professional army not only by winning victories but indulging them with loot
and plunder and giving them donatives that is gifts at the triumph which were fantastic pompy's
gifts to his veterans broke all records soldiers received at the triumph the equivalent of 20 years
pay just for showing up to march in in pompy's triumph as well as all the booty and loot along
the way all the elements were there for a great pro consul defender of rome from the barbarians
not only to defeat the barbarians but then to take that army and all of the profits of victory
and come back and play king in rome in effect uh the blueprint was there for julia caesar
who will be the last of the great republican commanders um in latin we call them an imperator
where we get the word emperor who will take the lessons learned in battling mithridates and the
eastern barbarians and apply them uh with great skill in the conquest of gall which is coming
up in a future lecture and above all taking that season army and turning it on the republic and
making himself dictator and venting for rome uh the first monarchy that rome has seen a great
imperial monarchy that would lead to the roman empire
