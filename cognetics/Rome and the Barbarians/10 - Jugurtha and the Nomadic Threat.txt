In this lecture, I plan to look at the relationship between Romans and barbarians in North Africa.
I think before I get into the talk, I should explain a bit what we mean by the term Africa.
The Romans applied the term Africa not to the continent, although it does in the classical
age come to represent the continent, but to a very restricted area, which today would
be essentially Tunisia and the western coastal fringe of Libya.
This is an area where the Carthaginians, that is the Punic settlers, were located.
It also had a lot of the original population, those are the Libyans, which is the Greek
and Roman term used for the natives who were living there before the Phoenicians showed
up.
They would be speaking a Hermitic language, a language related to modern Berber.
So that would be the Roman term Africa.
Historians, however, use the term North Africa or Roman North Africa to embrace a rather
large area.
It's the coastal lands running from really almost from the borders of Egypt, where today
you would have Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.
Now the region of Morocco today would have been called by the Romans Mauritania.
The region of western Algeria and the desert zones into the Sahara were often known as
Numidia.
Africa was reserved for what was called Tunis today, Tunisia.
And then really the western part of Libya was part of that African province.
So you're dealing with a very, very large area and the Romans by going into this region
inherited an enormously long border of desert zones.
And if you include all the Egyptian frontiers as well, you're getting up to several thousand
miles worth of desert and frontier.
Egypt as is obvious is regarded as a separate area.
When the Romans moved into Egypt, they inherited a very ancient civilization.
It was not a matter of dealing with a barbarian foe.
In fact, it was a matter of taking over earlier administrations and making it work for Rome.
So we're not going to consider Egypt in this discussion.
The Romans got into this region of North Africa because they had to defeat the rival
city of Carthage.
I've mentioned that in 264 BC, Rome embarked on the first of three wars with Carthaginians.
And in the second half of the third century BC broke Carthaginian power and Rome became
a naval power.
Carthage was defeated in 201 BC and reduced to the status of a client state.
And the Romans themselves could have argued that the getting into the whole venture of
Africa, North Africa, Roman North Africa, was really a matter of self-defense.
There's a lot of Roman historians who'd like to claim that the Romans just conquered the
world out of self-defense.
As they moved in, defeated a dangerous rival, Carthage.
This was one of the reasons why they got into Spain because they had to defeat Carthaginian
power there.
And the Romans authors would always say that when we waged a just war, a bellum ustum,
Rome always waged just wars.
There was a procedure known as the fecal rite of taking a spear and throwing it into the
enemy territory.
And boys had informed the Carthaginians on each occasion that Rome would be willing to
negotiate if Carthage surrendered, of course, you know, bullying the Carthaginians, especially
into the Second Punic War.
All that aside, there is a certain amount of truth to that.
When the Romans finally decided to destroy Carthage in the Third Punic War in 149 to
146 BC.
In that particular war, they besieged the city, which had already been a Roman client
state for two generations.
And essentially, the Romans picked a fight to humble an ancient enemy, and it was more
of an act of revenge than anything else.
The city was sacked.
Some 50,000 survivors were sold into slavery.
It was abandoned.
For over 100 years, the city of Carthage was unoccupied.
Carthage today is essentially a suburb of Tunis, and it is the natural port hub of all the
trade going into North Africa.
That trade had to be redirected to lesser cities such as Utica, and for 100 years the
Romans didn't bother to exploit the advantage of the site of Carthage.
It was cursed.
It was only refounded in 46 BC by Julius Caesar.
And again, Carthage proved an instant success when all the colonists came in.
It emerges as the second largest city in the western basin of the Mediterranean.
By 100 AD, it's maybe 200,000, 250,000 strong again.
By doing so, the Romans gained control of a very fertile area, the area they called Africa.
Much of that region was probably annexed as Roman public land, Argyre publicus.
It was exploited by the people already living there, but they had to pay a tax to the Roman
state, the Senate and people of Rome.
Colonists moved in.
We know that in 103 BC, there was sponsoring of veterans from the Northern Wars.
These are soldiers who fought with Marius.
They received allotments.
There was a lot of illegal and informal settlement.
There were still a number of Punic towns on the coast, which had brisk trade in the Mediterranean
economy, and of course, Italians moved in.
Many of them coming from Sicily and southern Italy, because the conditions in these towns
in North Africa were very similar to what you would find in Sicily and the Bay of Naples,
and so it attracted Italians and Romans from those regions.
On the other hand, the Romans also inherited a problem that they never encountered before,
and that is, in destroying their civilized rival Carthage, they now faced a potentially
very dangerous barbarian opponent in the form of desert nomads.
These would be the ancestors of the modern Berbers and Tauric today in North Africa.
These people had perfected the means of traveling across the Sahara, living off oasis farming.
At this point, the Sahara was not as dry as it is today.
We know as late as the 5th century BC, there were points where you could cross the Sahara
on horseback.
There were enough water wells and oases that you could do it on horses.
You didn't need a camel, and incidentally, the camel was actually brought in by the
Romans, originally in order to patrol this area, they brought it in from the Near East,
and so that the trade was difficult.
You had to only follow certain routes, and it was in the hands of these Berbers-speaking
tribes.
The Romans had never encountered people like this before, and the dealings with these people
never threatened Roman security, it never taxed Rome the way the wars in Spain would,
it would not be nomadic tribes that would bring down the Roman Empire as the German
tribes did in the West, but nonetheless, the Romans were really faced with quite a problem
of how to deal with these people.
Unfortunately, Roman authors for a long time really didn't know what to make out of them.
Our earliest accounts come from Roman authors who dismissed these people as somehow simple
barbarians known for treachery, constantly changeable.
They didn't live in cities, they didn't even live in towns, and so that meant to the Romans
they were at much lower cultural level, there wasn't a racial prejudice, but they just,
they weren't culturally there.
Most of these people, however, had a very sophisticated way of exploiting the landscape.
In the West, you have the High Atlas Mountains, you had mountain peoples known as the Gaetulians,
who had a combination of herding and agriculture.
Along the desert, or pre-desert rim of the Sahara, you have a mixture of oasis farming
and transhumans that is moving herds, these are humans who move with their herd seasonally,
they come into the oasis areas a certain times of the year, the animals actually fertilize
the land, and so the nomads swap hides and milk and meat with agriculturalists who swap
dates and grains and other goods, and there's an exchange, so you have that pattern extending
all the way from the Atlas Mountains, really essentially to the borders of Egypt.
You have a coastal zone, which would be very similar to the Mediterranean, but that was
largely Punic towns and cities, and the Romans could understand that, and then especially
in the region of Algeria, eastern Algeria and Tunisia today, you had an intermediate
zone, the Aurese Massif, where you had this very dry, high zone that could be put under
agriculture with irrigation, olive trees and grain, but it was a very delicate balance,
you really had to put the area under cultivation, you had to impose a certain amount of security.
So you had a set of four distinct zones in North Africa, and all of them rimmed by this
mixture of oasis farming and transhumans on the rim between the desert and the more
settled areas, and this was perplexing to the Romans, it wasn't as simple as dealing
with say the Spaniards or later the river systems they found in central Europe.
Well initially the Roman senate did what it usually did in the early wars of expansion
is it ignored the problem, for at least 50 years the Romans annexed the province of Africa
but didn't do anything with it, we don't know of any regular governor, there are probably
officials, magistrates sent out there to collect the taxes on the public land, but most of
these fellows were tax farmers, that is they were men of equestrian rank or lower who bought
the contract to collect the taxes, which was a way of the Roman republic avoiding administrative
costs, which you do is the censors put up for bid the taxes of a province for five years,
whatever, a private outfit company, Sokiatos in Latin would buy the contract, pay the money
up front and then essentially go into the province and collect the taxes plus the cost
and reimbursement, and you can imagine the number of abuses that would go in there, and
for some Romans if the provincials couldn't pay they could advance money at the provincials
to pay their tax at the usual lucrative rates of 20%, 56% and such types of interest rates,
enormous amount of extortion and abuse that could go on in these provinces, this is especially
true in the Roman east, so that for some time the Romans really didn't deal with the problem
and so security was essentially turned over to those nomads, here the Romans were fortunate
in that they had found an ally in the second Punic War, a man named Massinissa, who had
been a Punic mercenary leader, he was a leader of a tribe of Numidians, these are people
living on that desert rim and in that mix zone where there would be some towns and irrigation
and agriculture, but they were also included, many of these desert nomads, and Massinissa
had struck up a personal relationship with Scipio Africanus, the man who defeated Carthage,
he fought at the decisive battle of Zama in 202 BC, in which Scipio defeated Hannibal,
there were 10,000 Numidians who fought on the Roman side, 6,000 of them are the light
cavalry for which the Numidians were famed, the North African nomadic cavalry, swift in
attack using javelins, primarily not bows, and superb in reconnaissance, in skirmishing
techniques, and the Romans immediately appreciated these light cavalry forces in North Africa,
as much as you get prejudices that these people don't have cities and they're the usual fickle
and treacherous barbarians, when it came to the martial prowess of the North African
cavalry, every Roman commander knew that these were top forces, you wanted them and they
would actually recruit them, use them in Spain and eventually in the east, and one of the
greatest cavalry commanders under the Emperor Trajan in the 2nd century AD was a North African
Berber, a man named Lucius Quietus who raised a special force to be used in the conquest
of Dacia, so the Romans appreciated these people, furthermore Massinissa turned out
to be one of the most adroit barbarian kings on record, he understood the manipulation
of client and patron relationships, he was a close friend of Scipio Africanus, and that
relationship was inherited, Massinissa is on the spot in the 3rd Punic War, he reputedly
lived to his 80s, and according to certain accounts he had hundreds of sons because
he had multiple wives, he was always marrying a daughter or a sister of one of the sheikhs
from an opposing tribe, and Massinissa essentially welded together these tribes into a very effective
kingdom of Numidia, something that had never existed there before, where you had had a
group of tribes, oasis, farming, and towns in the Carthaginian period, Massinissa welded
together a kingdom which very much depended on him, he was a charismatic warrior, he
had ties with Scipio Africanus, then with Africanus' son, his grandson, I'm sorry his
adoptive grandson, Scipio Africanus Emilianus, the man who took Carthage in 146 BC, he was
technically the grandson of the first Africanus, he had been adopted by the first Africanus'
son who had no sons, who was a rather sickly man and never had a political career, and
so from the start Massinissa knew how to gain respect from the Romans, he provided soldiers,
grain, and all of Rome's overseas wars, he remodeled his capital city along Greco-Roman
lines, at least the palace, at least when the Roman merchants and envoys showed up,
it looked something like a Roman city, Massinissa however could not last forever, he died at
a very advanced age in 148 BC, just before Carthage fell to Rome and he had been an opponent
of Carthage all his life, succeeded by a son, Makipsa, who ruled for another 30 years, and
then in 118 BC Makipsa died and there were immediately problems, there were several successors
to the throne, among them was a grandson of Massinissa who was an illegitimate child, a
fellow named Jugurtha, now Jugurtha had two cousins who technically were supposed to be
the kings, and Jugurtha understood the exploiting of Roman client and patron techniques, he
had served in Spain as a Roman auxiliary officer, a very charismatic figure, and his two cousins
were really men of no account, they were Himpsoil and Audrabal, they had Punic names,
they were fellows who tended to hang out in the towns, and they couldn't pal around with
the different tribal leaders and impress them as a great warrior, a charismatic figure,
and incidentally a ruler who had the gift of Rome, who had all those contacts in Rome
who could bring in patronage and other advantages, Jugurtha had it, so Jugurtha reasoned quite
logically given Roman indifference to the area that if he bumped off his two cousins
and took over and ruled as a dutiful client, there would be no problem, and so Jugurtha
got involved in a series of wars with his relatives and eventually killed them all,
but in the process in 112 BC when he killed his last rival who was holding out in the
royal capital of Kittra, the Nubidian forces broke in and killed a group of Romans, they
were probably Italian allies, they weren't really Romans, most of them were merchants
and government contract types, and who knows how many they were, but they were killed,
and Jugurtha would make the usual apologies and expect it no problem, he knew a lot of
the leading senators and this would all be settled and he would rule as the new Messinissan
and everything would go as it had gone on before. Well, it didn't turn out that way,
and Jugurtha had the misfortune of stumbling into a situation which he couldn't have had
any idea what was happening, and I mentioned this briefly in connection with the wars
in Spain, and as the rising political violence in Rome mounted, as more and more political
agitation for reform, more and more issues over the reform of the draft, land redistribution,
Rome had become so politicized that frontier wars now became a battleground between opposing
factions, popular race, those are political figures at Rome who want to carry out reform
for the benefit of the people, they were in favor of distribution of public lands, renegotiating
the draft, helping the urban poor who were growing in numbers in Rome, they were seen
as the more dangerous and radical element, they were all aristocrats, they were all related
to the optimates, the best men who wanted everything to go as it was, that the senate
would run a foreign policy, that the voting assembly should simply elect the magistrates
and otherwise shut up. Well, at the time that these Italians got
murdered in Kittra by Jugurtha soldiers, the popular race group were really smarting under
a number of political defeats and they used this debacle as a way of criticizing the senate's
handling of the policy in North Africa, they demanded war, now the senate tried to avoid
war, they sent down commissions and tried to rectify the situation, none of this satisfied
popular outrage in Rome where a powerful voting coalition came together of the urban dispossessed,
the numerous ruler voters who were angry over the draft and the failure of land reform
and the equestrian order, that is the order of political, not political, economic elites
who had emerged in the trade, tax contracts and justice that went with the Roman Empire,
that is the key voting elements other than the top senatorial families and they clamored
for war as a way in effect to discredit the senate and especially the membership in the
senate that were seen as conservative and obstructionist in reform at Rome.
The senate bungled the operation, they sent in commanders to deal with Jugurtha, the first
one, man named Calpurnius Bestia, actually got himself defeated, Jugurtha negotiated
a treaty, this is again a case of a barbarian king forcing a Roman army to go under the
yoke, that is they have to bend down as a sign of submission, but Jugurtha was willing
to negotiate, that didn't work, Jugurtha was actually summoned to Rome under safe conduct
by the senate to present his case to the senate and Jugurtha who had only dealt with senior
senators, men who were commanders in their own right, went to Rome thinking well I'll
just talk to my friends in the senate and it's all going to be taken care of, he's
a king, he deals with other chieftains, he has no idea what politics are like in Rome
and the mission was a disaster, he was ridiculed as a barbarian, our principal account on this
is the Roman historian Salus, a guy solistius chrispus who was a hatchet man of Julius Caesar
and a man with a pretty unsavory reputation of his own, we're told that while in Rome
Jugurtha actually arranges for the murder of one of his rivals who happens to be in
Rome, it just goes wrong and what happens is he plays into the hands of all the stereotypes
of barbarian kings and bloodthirsty tyrants that the popular reformers are clamoring for,
we've got to take this king out, he was responsible for killing our Italian merchants, most of
them the Romans could care less about and they weren't really Romans, think of it as
sort of waving the bloody toga, Jugurtha returned to Numidia with nothing settled, the war continued
and the really interesting aspect of the war was not so much the military operations going
on in Numidia as the political trials in Rome, there was a commission set up in 110 B.C.
by a tribune of the plebeians by the name of Gaius Mimilius Limitanus and they went
in to investigate all the charges of corruption and bribery for the mishandling of the war
for the first four years and even Salus says that if Jugurtha couldn't possibly have that
amount of money to bribe that number of Romans and the people getting nailed in the courts
were all optimists who were opposing political reform in Rome, so really this was a politicized
war if there ever was a politicized frontier war in Rome, eventually the Senate decided
on sending an impeccably honest commander, Gaius Gaikilius Metellus of a leading family
and Metellus waged war for three years and probably waged a very effective war of pacification,
unfortunately he was not popular at Rome, he was seen as prolonging the war for his
own purposes, he was subject to criticism by this powerful coalition of voters and he
was undermined by one of his own subordinate commanders, a man named Gaius Marius who will
appear in the next lectures a very very important political figure, Gaius Marius who at the
time was in his late 40s, he was born about 157 BC, comes from the same hometown as Cicero
or Pinnum, Gaius Marius was a senior commander, a new man, his family had no political office
of account in Rome, he came from a provincial town, Marius realized that he could exploit
all of this popular discontent at Rome and get himself elected commander of the North
African war and make a career for himself, that is he could renounce his ties of client
ship to his commander Gaikilius Metellus and he does it in a very unsavory way, he gets
his soldiers to write letters home to the family saying how badly the war is being
run and he goes back to Rome, stands for the consulship to the shock of everyone gets elected
by this popular coalition and arrives in 107 BC as consul and pursues Juegartha, now
Marius was a good commander, he was expert in logistics, he eventually captures Juegartha's
desert fortress of Copsa in an incredible march, but he also was a great drill master
and he starts to reform that Roman army which is already becoming very professionalized
in Spain into a citizen army that is a professional army, he drops the property qualification
henceforth, they had always been taking volunteers for the last generation, but now you don't
need property to join the Roman army, in fact property is no longer a requirement, becomes
a reward, these landless citizens sign up on the expectation when the war is over they
are going to get land back in Italy for their military service and that is a very important
inversion in the Roman system, he also has to impose all sorts of drill and eventually
he chases Juegartha out of Numidia and Juegartha finds refuge in the mountains of Morocco today
in Mauritania and Gaius Marius' cavalry commander and finance officer, a guy named Sulla, Lucius
Cornelius Sulla arranges for the surrender of Juegartha, the Numidian king is handed
over by the Moroccan Mauritanian king, a fellow named Bocus and that's where the famous exchange
occurs where Juegartha tells Bocus, you hand me over to Rome and you will no longer be
a friend of Rome, you will become the enemy of Rome because Rome will cannot brook having
any neighbor who is too powerful, I will disappear and you will become the new barbarian foe,
prophetic words, they didn't take effect for a couple of generations, with the surrender
of Juegartha the most remarkable aspect is that the Romans simply reinstated the whole
system that existed before, they put in another descendant of Masinissa and they didn't bother
to organize or change the provincial structure, it's only in the dictatorship of Julius Caesar
after the Roman Civil War in 46 BC where the Romans rebuild Carthage and actually send
in a provincial administration to Africa, incorporate that Numidian kingdom as a province
and come to terms with these desert nomads and they very very quickly realize that the
only way to patrol this vast area and as Rome extends her control over all of North Africa,
this becomes a very very long frontier of about 2500 miles length was essentially to base
the system on alliances with the nomadic chiefs, that is to extend the system that had worked
so well with Masinissa, the nomadic barbarian couldn't be conquered really, couldn't really
even be co-opted, but in arrangement an alliance could come to, you could come to an agreement
where these powerful princes and they're called Principais could be given Roman citizenship
because cement relationships either with a prominent Roman senator or later with the
Roman emperor and they would handle all the patrolling for you, these are the people who
controlled the Trans-Saharan trade, they were also the people who could impose their authority
on the various local leaders and princes and this is the system that was put in place
and it worked remarkably well.
Roman rule in North Africa was not toppled by the internal barbarians rising up in rebellion,
far from it, it was toppled by an unexpected invasion of dramatic barbarians, vandals who
crossed over in 429, who came to back a Roman governor in rebellion from the central government
in Rome and those client kingdoms, the people that would later be known as Moors or Maori
in Latin, that is the peoples of today would be Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, in those areas,
those client kingdoms set up under this Roman security system, they actually ended up defeating
the vandals and they actually ended up opposing Arabic rule, that is Rome created these desert
nomads as states which could take over and operate their zones once Roman power had
exited.
Now on the coastal areas and in the immediate hinterland of Carthage, those regions were
subject to Roman colonization and exploitation, there the conditions were very similar to
the Mediterranean farming conditions elsewhere and there we have the development of cities
but that was dependent upon the Punic institutions already in place, in that intermediate high
zone, the Aurese Massif of Eastern Numidia and Tunisia, that region was brought under
intensive agricultural development, olive trees, there's olive presses, agriculture,
in fact in many areas we have the remnants of roaming farming implements and farm homes
where there's no cultivation going on today and that was the area that prospered the most
between this arrangement of the Romans on the coast and the alliances of the desert nomads,
those areas prospered because they were feeding the city of Carthage and the cities of the
coast and the city of Rome and they were exploiting all the possible opportunities of the imperial
peace.
So the result is in Africa you had a remarkable situation of towns that increasingly became
Roman and as in Spain by the end of the first century AD the towns were adopting Latin,
they were putting up magnificent buildings and there were great fortresses and families,
members of the African municipal elites, that is the old Punic towns were entering the Roman
Senate, by 125 AD at least 10 or 12% of the Roman Senate was from those North African towns
so you had that zone, you had the area where people were exploiting agriculture in the
Alres and in the Bagratis Valley feeding the cities, there a Punic was still spoken, some
Libyan there was a certain amount of Latin contact, there was a legionary base at Lombises
in Numidia that was promoting a certain amount of Romanization so you had a sort of mixed
Roman-Punic-Libyan culture and then on the fringe you had the desert nomads tied to Rome
by ties of clientage, patronage who did the patrolling for you but in many ways were still
pursuing their traditional way of life and so what happened in Roman North Africa is
you had a very complicated mixed set of cultures which in some ways could be broken down linguistically
and it's not too dissimilar of what happened in French Tunisia, the top classes in the
city spoke Latin and saw themselves connected to the wider Mediterranean world. In the intermediate
zones and the farming zones and the small towns Punic was still largely spoken and then of
course on the desert rim was where the Berber languages and you think of the situation in
colonial French Africa where you had French, a Latin language spoken in the towns, you
had a certain amount of French emigration especially in Algeria, you had Arabic spoken
in the smaller towns and in the great farmsteads and then out on the desert fringes you had
Berber continued to be spoken and so the success of the Romans in managing rather than the
defeating the desert nomads was to come to terms with the society and incorporate them
as part of the Roman client system and this system worked very well and we will see it
again extended next set of desert nomads and that would be the Arabs along the Syrian frontier.
