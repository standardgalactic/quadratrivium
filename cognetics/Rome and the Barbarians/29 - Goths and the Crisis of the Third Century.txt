In this lecture I plan to bring on a new set of barbarians, the Goths, I've only mentioned
them in passing. These are Germanic speaking people who originated from Sweden, and they
are closely associated with the political and military crisis that Rome suffers after
235 AD. We don't hear of the Goths until the mid-240s, but we suspect that they are
behind the pressures that are driving some of the West Germanic tribes into the Roman
Empire, and from the 240s on they begin to attack the middle and lower Danube, the Roman
province in Dacia, and they are seen as a peculiarly vicious and new threat by the Roman authors.
What this lecture requires us to do then is to find out who these Goths were, where did
they originate from, and why did they end up proving to be such formidable foes to the
Romans in the third century. The second point of this lecture is to look at the Roman situation
itself, the civil wars, and the mounting wars against the foe in the East, the Sasaninid
Shaws of Persia, and I will have a separate lecture on those Persians who represented
the new barbarian threat in the East, and that new barbarian threat in the East turned
out to be probably the most formidable, but the Goths were close second, and the wars
against the Goths on the middle Danube taxed the Roman army, it forced the Romans to come
up with new methods of recruitment and strategy by the fourth century, it contributed greatly
to the debasement of the currency of which I spoke, which ultimately threatened, it didn't
completely undermine, but it certainly threatened Roman fiscal institutions, required monetary
reform at the end of the third century and into the fourth century.
And then finally, we'll see why the Romans surmounted this threat, and that was largely
to the credit of a new breed of soldier emperors, and contrary to many a textbook, I'm fairly
limited in my use of that term, soldier emperors, these would be the emperors coming to the throne
after 268, the first is a man named Claudius II, gothicus, the first time an emperor takes
this title as part of his, well, it's actually the second time, I guess Gordian III uses
it, but it's an indication of how the Goths are now elevated to a specific barbarian foe,
and that an imperial title, gothicus, can grace the imperial name.
And the last of these soldier emperors we'll close with will be the emperor Dioclesian,
who ends the Civil War, consolidates the empire, and carries out a number of reforms that are
very important in reorganizing Roman state and society into what we call the dominate,
and again, the implications of those reforms we reserve for a later lecture.
For this lecture, let's see why the Goths proved to be such a formidable foe.
Well, as far as can be told, the Goths are seen as speaking an East Germanic dialect,
a language that was distinct from the German dialects of the German tribes in Central Europe,
with whom the Romans had had long contact, and this can be concluded by the fact that
we do have substantial amounts of the Gothic language.
To be sure, it dates from the 4th century, when the Bible was translated into Gothic
by a fellow named Bishop Ulpheus, who arrived as the Bishop of the Goths, and this translation
was made in the 340s and 350s, so it is approximately a century later than our first references
on the Goths.
But what the language shows is a Germanic language very closely akin to these North
Germanic languages, the Scandinavian languages, and while they are separated, a great deal
in time and distance, that is, the Scandinavian languages are only written down at the end
of the Viking Age, and really in the post-Viking Age, in the 11th and 12th centuries, when
you have Icelandic sagas and other accounts, Gothic and Scandinavian, as they call it in
the Middle Ages, the Danish tongue, show very, very close associations, and the Goths who
came to settle in Eastern Europe retained close ties with the Baltic world and with their
Scandinavian kin, and the earliest Gothic king we know about, Ermaneric, who is going
to be destroyed by the Huns, was remembered in Scandinavian legend, and we think it's
those connections that account for the large number of Roman gold coins that appear in
Scandinavian the late and fourth, fourth and fifth centuries because of that long, enduring
tie of the Goths to their original homeland.
The Swedes report that there were many tribes, you know, there were many tribes living in
Sweden at the time in the Middle Ages, but in Sweden are preserved names Gautraland,
which apparently refers to the land of the Goths, this is in southern Sweden, and this
is thought to have been the original homeland of the Goths, there's also the very important
island of GÃ¶tland, which was commercially extremely important in the Middle Ages, a Swedish
island today in the Baltic, and it's suspected that the Goths originated in this region.
Sometime in the late second century AD, they crossed from their Swedish homeland into central
Europe, northern Europe.
They got across the Baltic by one of two routes, they may have followed the Alon islands over
to Finland and then picked up the Russian river routes, the same route that would be
used by Scandinavians coming from Sweden in the Viking Age.
The other possibility is they crossed directly over the Baltic and landed at the banks of
the Odor or the mouths of the Odor or the Vistula, and then followed the great routes
of the Odor Vistula to the Bug and Deneaster, that is they came across the traditional amber
routes and so reached the shores of the Black Sea.
By whatever route they came, and they may well have used both, for all we know, since
it's extremely difficult to date or document the movement of such people in the archaeological
record, by the first quarter of the third century, they had reached these new homes in
Eastern Europe, and within a generation of their arrival, they are probably pressing south
east, south west, against tribes, formations and Germanic tribes, that then are feeling
pressure and start attacking and raiding the Roman frontiers.
The main direction of these Gothic attacks will be on what is called the middle and lower
Danube, and that meant the Goths had to cross Dacia, that important province conquered by
the Emperor Trajan, and so Dacia came under very, very heavy pressure, probably from the
240s on, and eventually would be abandoned by the Romans, the first significant territorial
loss by the Roman Empire to a barbarian people.
As far as we can tell, the Goths imposed themselves as a ruling elite over various people on the
Russian steppes, they eventually came to dominate the region from the lower Danube to almost
to the lower Don, certainly up through the Nieper, and in a way they succeeded to the
position that the Sarmatian and before them the Scythian nomads had, that is they took
over a consortium of different types of peoples and tribes, and the Goths learned a horsemanship
from their Iranian subjects, they became very well versed in the use of cavalry, they also
were able to subject the agriculturalists of southern Russia, the people involved in
the grain shipments into the Aegean world, and at certain times during the third century,
the Goths actually blackmailed the Greek cities of the Crimea to turn over parts of their
navy so Gothic warriors could board these ships and attack the Aegean and Black Sea regions
of the Roman Empire, which we'll get to later on in this lecture.
So they proved to be a very, very adaptable people, very formidable and quite willing
to entertain any kind of innovation if it assisted them in their various raids and attacks.
Now certainly by the mid-240s the Goths had moved into Eastern Europe and they were attacking
directly the Roman Empire, that is they're not just pushing other people into the Roman
Empire as I discussed in the previous lecture.
The Romans did not present the best of fronts against the Goths, in fact the Goths from
their viewpoint very fortuitously timed their attacks at a moment where the Roman Empire
was really preoccupied with other problems, and that accounts for the rapid success of
the Goths and why the Gothic threat assumed the proportions it did.
I mentioned in 235 AD the emperor Severus Alexander was murdered and he was the last
representative of a dynasty that had ruled Rome since 193 AD and in many ways ruled in
the tradition of the great Antonine emperors of the 2nd century AD.
The Severan emperors represented the last significant dynasty and political stability
for Rome because what follows in the next 50 years is a period of chaotic civil war
as each regional army, the Rhine, the Danube and the Eastern army would put candidates on
the throne.
Ultimately it would be the Danube army, the most important part of the Roman army that
would succeed with its candidates, but all of the implications of the civil war I described
back in 6970 were now played out repeatedly over the next 50 years.
By one count at least 60 men claimed the throne in this period, the average reign was 1.5 years
although some of them ruled longer and later and there were a number of usurpers and pretenders.
So Rome lost the political stability of the Augustine solution because there was no dynasty
in place to take over when Severus Alexander was murdered.
The Rhine army put on the throne a man named Maximinus, he was from very humble origins
in Thrace, reputedly six feet tall, noted for his great strength at the time he was
declared emperor he was about 62 years old and from the coin portraits had a jaw and
ferocious look which must have frightened most of his soldiers to attention.
He was in charge of recruiting and he was a product of the Severan reforms which allowed
this type of social nobility where a man from outside the traditional Roman aristocratic
classes could seize the throne and it was that unpopularity and his high taxes of the
property classes that precipitated his downfall in 238 he was murdered by his own soldiers
in a complicated civil war and that civil war in 238 put on the throne a very young
emperor named Gordy in the third who represented a member of the older Roman aristocratic elite
and from 238 to 268 the emperors while they seized power with the army most of them were
backed by a particular regional army either the Rhine or the Danube army nonetheless they
were still coming from the high senatorial and equestrian classes they still represented
the traditional aristocracy of Rome to be sure many of these were families that can
only trace their origins back to say the mid-second century AD but they still had the ethos the
notions of patron and client the notions of service to Rome that we would have associated
with the senatorial order back in the time of Augustus these emperors failed to contain
the gothic threat now to some extent it wasn't there just individual fault they were facing
very serious pressure on the eastern frontier from Susanne and at Persia and large numbers
of military forces had to be transferred from the Danube to face the Persian threat and
and that's an important point to stress because in the Roman world by the 240s AD it became
quite clear to emperors that the population and the financial resources of the Roman world
rested in the eastern provinces that's where two-thirds of the population in the wealth
was located and the cities and the third century sees the shifting of the locus of imperial
power to those eastern provinces eventually to be symbolized by symbolized by the founding
of Constantinople as the new Rome dedicated by the emperor Constantine in 338 AD the first
Roman emperor to be named a victor over the Goths he's called Victor Gothorum you know
conqueror of the Goths it's not really the imperial named Gothicus as Claudus II took
was the young emperor Gordy in the third placed on the throne in 238 a very courteous young
man as far as we can tell and he had to battle some gothic invaders as his army was marching
east against the Persian armies a significant point by the 240s the Goths were pressing
very hard on the frontier and they seem to work in tandem with other German dramatic peoples
who also originated from Scandinavia the sources start citing a new German tribes vandals
vandals have a completely overrated reputation that's only because they ended up in North
Africa and St. Augustine thought of the vandals as really terrible barbarians and today we
use the term of the vandals you know they destroy art is a vandal the Romans in North
Africa never met real barbarians like Goths and Huns who did more than just destroy art
but the vandals are reported as attacking into Pinonia that would be Roman Hungary that
would be the that important upper Danube province Jeopardy, Herulians by the early 4th century
we hear of groups Rugeans, Lumbards, Burgundians all tribes to have very important roles to
play in the early Middle Ages and again all of them claiming to be of a Scandinavian origin
and we have the name of one Gothic leader and then in Caneva who is apparently responsible
for coordinating the Gothic raids in the 240s and early 250s he's the only king or ruler
we ever hear and actually the record on him comes from a much later account of Jordanus
writing the 6th century AD so we're not sure if this is you know Caneva represents more
of an eponymous heroes being created in the literary tradition but the Goths who eventually
come to settle in Italy and Spain they still had a memory that somehow they go back to
the princes and kings of these Goths leading the raids against the Roman Empire in 240
and 250 and as I noted they were very much assisted by the Roman Civil War the emperor
Gordian the 3rd was murdered by his army in a mutiny in 244 on February 25th 244 a date
I can remember very easily it's the date of my sister's birthday or probably more accurately
I remember my sister's birthday because it's the date that Gordian the 3rd was murdered
in any case they put on the throne an emperor by the name of Philip the Arab Philip the
first the Praetorian Prefect he battled the Goths on the lower and middle Danube his
success was limited and the man he commissioned to take on the Goths as governor of Moisia
on the lower Danube to protect Dacia was a fellow named Trajan Diceus and Diceus not
only defeated the Goths but was quickly declared emperor by the Danube legions and so he marched
against Philip the 1st in 249 that is the Danube army moved into northern Italy fought
Philip and killed Philip and put Trajan Diceus on the throne now the removal of a Roman military
force on the Danube to fight a civil war in Italy immediately had the obvious result of
the Goths attacking into Dacia and the Danube provinces Diceus was therefore forced to take
the field against the Goths and in 251 fought a large Gothic army on the lower Danube in
the region called lower Moisia at a town called Abritus which is now in the Romanian Dobruja
and he was defeated and killed along with his son this was a significant defeat and a Roman
army the Roman sources claim it was treachery that the man who was declared emperor the cavalry
commander after Diceus Trebonianus Gallus had actually left Diceus in the lurch so the Goths
could cut him apart in apparently swamp swamp areas of the Roman army had been lured whatever
the story was it was a humiliation that had never occurred before in imperial history the emperor
was defeated by a barbarian army and killed and that would happen a century later at the battle
of Adrianople but it was a an achievement for the Goths and a very very serious loss for the
Romans the new emperor Trebonianus Gallus concluded a hasty treaty with the Goths and went back to
secure his position of legitimacy in Rome and as a result of the Goths were still free to operate
along the frontier the governor of lower Moisia in 253 a man named Emelian pulled the same stunt
that Diceus did he won a victory over some gothic raiders and then the Danube army proclaimed him
emperor so you know four years later there's a whole repeat of the civil war the Danube legions
march into Italy they nailed Trebonianus at Verona who's killed Emelian's made emperor he's
emperor for three months the Rhine army is dissatisfied they'd come in with their candidate in
253 they defeat Emelian and the Rhine army then installs a father and son Tim Valyrian and Gallianus
as joint rulers so you could see that within a decade other Romans have fought three major civil
wars on each occasion the Danube legions had been withdrawn from their frontiers and on one occasion
the Rhine frontier armies had moved into Italy to fight the civil war so it's it compromised
entirely the frontiers of the empire and these civil wars had other consequences as a man was
declared declared emperor he had to pay the soldiers and simultaneously the costs of government
are going up because he's asking for more taxes he's hiring more officials soldiers are being used
to collect taxes and that leads to a very rapid debasement of the roman silver coinage which
causes fiscal and monetary confusion by the 260s imperial currency is really in serious need of
reform and the price structure goes a bit crazy in the empire and that that complicates tax
collection that complicates a number of of fiscal demands in the Roman Empire furthermore this
son and father team Valyrian the older and his son Gallianus were confronted with a problem of
now meeting multiple threats the frontiers were being assaulted from three different directions
there were Germans in the north the confederations against the Rhine there were attacks against
Britain by Saxon pirates the Goths were repeatedly raiding into Dacia in the Danube provinces and
there was a serious threat from the east from the persian shaw a man named shop or the first who
unlike the german opponents had a real siege train and army and posed the significant threat of not
only attacking roman territory but conquering and taking these regions over and we will discuss in
more detail the seriousness of that persian threat so the Goths through the 250s and 260s
repeatedly had an opportunity to attack into imperial provinces the situation got worse uh
after 260 uh for for two reasons uh gallianus's father Valyrian who was waging a war against
the persians managed to get himself captured very close to the city of carai where Crassus was
defeated by the Parthian uh the emperor Valyrian was taken uh into the possession of of the persian
shaw he disappears into captivity the eastern army is briefly disorganized there's persian attacks
in the east and at the same time while gallianus has just lost his father into persian captivity
and this was a defeat on par with the the slaying of the emperor trajan desius i mean these were two
major humiliations for the imperial government and the imperial army in 260 the legions of the
Rhine decide that they've had enough that their forces have been withdrawn to fight battles on
the danube in the east uh this was causing them difficulty in containing raiders in northwestern
europe they declare a man by the name of posthumous the commander of the rhine armories as emperor
and break away from the government in rome and this is a significant point they did not uh uh
the emperor posthumous did not follow the route that was done back in the 240s and 260s that is an
army declares you emperor then you march against your opponents fight a battle and winner take all
the whole roman empire in this case posthumous and his successors are content to reside at
treer travery the great uh city of uh in roman germany on the mosul and to uh run effectively a
regional roman empire which lasts down to 274 to contain the threat of the francs the alamani
the other germans who are now pressing into roman territory and beating off attacks by gallianus
and his successors at rome who try are trying to bring this secessionist state back under control
the gothic raids climax and uh in uh with some really devastating raids in 262 and in 267 uh
there are our our gothic invasions into greece uh they get as far as athens in 267 herulians
who are apparently part of this scandinavian mix they're primarily called herulians of boronny
there's a whole variety of tribes apparently goth they get as far as athens and and the destruction
of athens is actually documented in the archaeological record uh the 262 attacks was a um was a uh was a
expedition of goths on those ships they had blackmailed uh from the crimian greek cities
those ships actually entered the aegean world and sacked a number of cities deep within the roman
empire who had not experienced frontier warfare or any kind of warfare for 400 years uh the city
of Ephesus the greatest city of asia minor home to the great shrine of artemis aphasia her sanctuary
is sacked by gothic pirates in 262 and the goths um penetrate as far east as the southern shore of
turkey at cities such as c day in perga and these attacks really bring back memories to the greek
world of the Celtic barbarians the galatians back in the third century bc and after these attacks
in the 260s we can document in uh greece and asia minor uh changes in civic life where uh the centers
are uh the uh cities uh enclosed the uh city with walls a whole new set of wall structures
certain areas beyond the walls are abandoned uh such a city as perga on the southern coast of turkey
builds an enormous impressive gate uh abandon certain regions uh that is they close the circuit so
the walls are more defensible many times these walls are built by recycling debris from public
monuments or areas that are now abandoned this is this is the case in athens where parts of the
original city of athens are abandoned as the city shrinks to a more defensible position all of this
in response to these attacks coming in from the northern barbarians uh in tandem that this is
the debasement of imperial currency rising costs so the cities of the roman empire are our our
experience very uh hard fiscal and monetary difficulties as a result of these wars and
that will change society in significant ways as we shall see when we discuss the reforms of um
dioclesion uh the same pattern is seen in the west in gall and well especially in gall
where uh uh the raids get out of hand by the francs and the alamani that by the two 80s and
two 90s uh cities start to go back in some ways to their Celtic past there's movement to the old
hill forts or villas get fortified uh so there are numerous local responses across the whole frontier
zone and even deep into areas such as Greece Asia Minor in Italy Rome is actually fortified in this
period by the emperor aurelian where a fact of life is that you may be attacked by barbarians
to be sure these barbarians cannot capture cities i report at some of the rather amusing
anecdotes of the efforts of the goths to take city in the Balkans nonetheless they can devastate
the countryside they can take villas they disrupt trade of the disrupt mining operations and so uh
the city suffer financially and gradually the uh economic basis of these cities could be worn down
if the raids and the attacks were not contained in 268 the emperor gallianus who was was murdered
in march of 268 by his army officers most of them men of provincial origin from the Balkan
frontier provinces and they're often known as the allerian or soldier emperors these emperors
rescue Rome uh they halt the crisis and at the time gallianus is murdered the roman empire is
virtually three separate states one in the east opposed to persia the danube and anatolyan provinces
in italy recognizing the central authority at Rome and then the northwestern provinces under
these gala roman emperors uh the first of these emperors claudius the second gothicus i mentioned
him earlier he wins a significant victory over the goths in the Balkans in 269 uh and uh that
victory as later perceived as a turning point uh it is a much needed imperial victory over the
barbarians after the last 20 years of defeats and indecisions in in the field he's followed by uh he
dies of plague he's followed by an emperor named aurelian from 270 to 275 and aurelian is hailed
as the rest of tuto or bis romani the restorer of the roman world aurelian proves to be a talented
general he is remembered in the later literary tradition as a very tough character uh nonetheless
he halts the attacks on the danube and he makes a very momentous decision of abandoning daisha
he pulls the roman forces out of daisha carves a new province of daisha centered on uh surdica
modern sofia in upper moisia uh and the romans give up this territory which is then settled by
goths and clients of the goths uh nonetheless with those forces released um he uh knocks off
the counter empire in the east the uh so-called kingdom of palmyra and then turns west and ends
the gaolo roman empire so when he dies in 275 um he's actually murdered by some mutaneous soldiers
under some really strange uh conditions uh the roman empires the roman empires boundaries have
more or less been restored there are two significant areas that have been abandoned though
one is daisha and the other are those norman northern german districts the so-called agre de
cumantes that is the schwarzwald the herkenean forest as the romans called it which in the 260s
and 270s was essentially abandoned to the aurelian so that two major frontier zones were essentially
left by the romans uh we think a fair number of the provincial population stayed and they would
then have a very important influence for the germans who moved in uh aurelian is followed by a
succession of other soldier empires uh the most important of them the last of them in this group
is a man by the name of dioclesion who in 284 uh not only secures the frontier but ends civil
wars he stays on the throne for 20 years and he is able to conduct some very important military
political and administrative reforms uh that will consolidate the gains won by these soldier
empires now there have been some significant changes in the course of battling uh these foes
in the third century the roman army will be transformed uh the legions win their last great
victories in the third century ad uh and whether it be on the euphrates or on the danube or on the
rine uh one military historian i think rightly states that the victories of the third century
was the climax of the imperial army it was it was the greatest challenge in many ways they
ever met and they rose to the occasion but in the in the course of the fighting that imperial army
would be very badly damaged and would be in need of reform and decisions taken in the early fourth
century would transform that army into something quite different the romans however had lost some
strategic provincial zones uh salience if you will uh in southern germany and indatia and these
were significant losses and i suspect were not forgotten by the barbarians uh the german confederations
that now face the romans uh the west germatic confederations frank saxons alamani the suevese
the goths and their kindred peoples who had moved into eastern europe had gained a certain measure
of confidence to be sure they were defeated but they had also rested territory from the romans a
gothic army had killed a roman emperor they had gained numerous captives booty um probably a lot
of good roman equipment when they stripped the dead after their victories and as a result uh the
germatic tribes came out of this third century uh crisis to be sure humbled and driven back
but better armed and better organized and as we enter the fourth century we begin to hear uh the
names of specific kings among frank salamani goths in a way we didn't hear in the third century with
the exception of keneva who's a debatable case we only hear of the tribes but these wars actually
sharpened uh the powers of uh dramatic kings who could read lead successful raids uh against the
roman empire and come back with booty and so they've learned the germans learn a great deal from
these victories uh and even from these defeats in the third century and the goths and the various
west dramatic confederations while driven back by the great soldier emperors uh still pose a
potential threat and the question in the fourth century is going to be what is the relationship
of this restored roman empire under diaclesion vis-a-vis the northern barbarian peoples
