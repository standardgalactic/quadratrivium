Lecture 36, Birth of the Barbarian Medieval West
In this lecture I plan to conclude the 900 years we've covered dealing with the relationship
between Rome and the barbarians.
And there are two ways in which we can look at this long historical process.
One way would be to see these 900 years as taking us through developments under the impact
of Rome, the creation of provincial societies that is transforming barbarians into provincials
and then into Romans of some sort.
And then with the breakup of the Roman Empire, the loss of the traditional Roman institutions
that could assimilate these people, the return in many ways to pre-Roman patterns in the
5th and 6th and 7th centuries.
Justinians attempt to restore the Roman order proved ephemeral in large part because the
Roman institutions and traditions had broken down, and in many ways those wars fueled the
development of local and regional medieval societies.
And there's a great deal of truth to this.
And on the other hand, it must never be forgotten that while the Roman Empire broke up in the
west and greatly contracted in the east into a new Byzantine order, that Rome did survive
in other ways, and not just in the usual comment that the western church succeeded to the organization
in the literary culture of classical Rome.
But Rome also stood as an example, and as we shall see, still an organizing principle
for these new societies that came out.
So that while the Rome was deleted in effect from the barbarians, we could speak of the
barbarian west or the early barbarian middle ages, nonetheless the barbarians who came
to rule over Rome were by no means the stereotypes that the classical authors had painted and
were by no means the same people who had attacked the Roman Empire in the 3rd and 4th centuries.
They had transformed into another type of identity.
So let's look at the successor societies that came out of the Roman world, and especially
the Roman provincial zones, and see where there was in some ways a return to earlier
patterns, and yet at the same time indications that something new is to be expected from
these societies.
Well, I guess it's easiest to look at the east and move west.
There was a great deal of continuity in the eastern core of the old Byzantine Empire,
which would reinvent itself in the 7th century as an orthodox medieval kingdom, dedicated
to the Roman political and legal legacy, but Greek and speech, and orthodox, that is orthodox
Greek in its faith.
This is certainly the case by the time of the reign of the emperor Heraclius, who ruled
from 610 to 641, and whose reign marked an important transition into that Byzantine period,
and most historians would agree that this marks the beginning of the Byzantine world.
On the other hand, the eastern half of the Roman Empire also fell to various barbarian
peoples, regions which had not been affected in some cases by the assaults of the late
4th and 5th century.
And there are three important groups that come to play an important role in the succeeding
medieval world.
One were the Turkmen tribe known as the Avars, the successors to the Huns.
They moved into Eastern Europe in the later years of Justinian's reign, and constructed
the second of the steppe empires of Eastern Europe, and would plague both that Byzantine
successor state and eventually the Frankish kingdom in Western Europe down to the 8th
century.
They are not broken as a power until the time of Charlemagne.
They raided into the Balkans.
They followed very much the pattern of the Huns.
They were looking for plunder, and they were feared as a very, very powerful nomadic force
that Constantinople, the remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire, either courted as allies or
tried to direct against other barbarians away from imperial territory.
Those Avars were accompanied by various subject peoples, notably Slavic-speaking tribes.
We know very little about the origin of the Slavic languages or the Slavic peoples.
These were organized loosely into tribes and clans.
As far as we can tell, they had very little contact previously with Roman civilization.
They've come out of the fourth zones of Russia.
A number of Slavic tribes and clans moved into the Balkans, which had been devastated
repeatedly by Goths, by Huns, by Avars, and they settled in great numbers as the authority
of Constantinople weakened over its various provinces and as it lost its control over
its frontier areas.
And from the 6th century to the 8th century, the Balkans is ethnically and linguistically
transformed.
Slavic peoples move into the interiors.
Some of the Roman cities surrender or are taken, others are destroyed.
The Greek and Latin-speaking provincials of the area retreat to the coasts.
They'll be found on the Dalmatian shore of what was recently Yugoslavia, cities such
as Raguza, modern Dubrovnik, or to the Greek cities of the northern shores of the Aegean
or the Black Sea that go into Constantinople or to the Greek islands.
And what happens in the Balkans is essentially a return to the pattern that existed well
before the Romans, that is you have the Hellenized urban cities along the shore of the Aegean,
the Adriatic, the Black Sea, and the interior falls into the hands of people engaged in
stock-raising with living in villages with very little on the way of towns and what
develops in the early Middle Ages is a symbiosis between those tribes and between the cities
still recognizing the authority of Constantinople, which is not dissimilar to the situation
of when we first learn about the Greeks in the 7th and 6th century BC and in some ways
in terms of social organization, in terms of trade contacts, there is a return to an
earlier pattern there between the Mediterranean coastal areas that remain urban, that remain
tied to a now Romanized, Christianized Hellenic past and to the interior of the Balkans which
returns to older patterns of organization and settlement, patterns that had obtained
before the Roman conquest and Romanization in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD and there
that's really quite a remarkable change.
Most of these Slavs arrive as pagans, they are only converted to Orthodox Christianity
very gradually over the course of the 9th, 10th and 11th century and with that conversion
comes the means to integrate these people back into the Byzantine world and into a wider
Orthodox world, but that's a later story for the Middle Ages.
The Persians nearly win the age-long struggle, the Sasanidish laws of Persia with the Byzantines
and at one point in the 7th century came close to conquering Constantinople and ending the
Roman political legacy altogether.
That Emperor Heraclius I mentioned earlier rallied imperial forces and carried out one
of the most remarkable of counter-offensives and ultimately defeated the Persian Shaw,
humbled Persia and won the greatest victory that any Roman emperor ever did over the Iranian
foe.
It's just that unfortunate for Heraclius and his empire that this final Persian war that
went from 602 down to willy, the final fighting is not over until 628, weakened both empires
and in the case of the Eastern Roman Empire they were already paying for the expenditures
of Justinian's war and the people who profited from this happened to be the Arabs.
The armies of Islam within just years of the end of the fighting between the East Roman
and Persian empires arrived on the scene and between 634 and 642 conduct some of the most
amazing conquests in history, overrunning the Sasanid Empire, overthrowing the Shaw
altogether and so within a decade of their victory in 639 the armies of the prophet are
reaching Central Asia and pressing on India in the East.
They overrun Roman Syria, enter Egypt, take the cities of Libya and by 700 they have reached
the Atlantic and in 711 they will topple the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.
As I had discussed in earlier lectures the Arabs who emerged on the scene to the Romans
and the Persians both were quintessentially barbarian people, they were desert nomads
and yet over the course of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries we've argued how the Romans
and the Persians fought through Arab proxies, they had created Arab client kingdoms along
the rim of the fertile crescent that is the zone that runs from the Levant into Iraq.
These Arab kingdoms had turned out to be the training grounds whereby the Arabs had absorbed
a great deal of the military techniques of Roman Persia, administrative techniques and
so when the Islamic leadership in Mecca and Medina conducted these vast wars they already
understood, they already were literate, they had adapted an Aramaic script to write the
Quran, they already appreciated writing, they understood administrative and military institutions
so by the time the Arabs arrive in the 7th and early 8th centuries they really can't
be called barbarians anymore the way the Romans would have designated them back in the 4th
and 5th century AD, they step in very easily to the institutions of the Sanated and late
Rome and quickly construct their caliphate and one can argue that of all the barbarian
peoples that entered into the Roman world, the Arabs in the end were the most successful
at least immediately for well over a thousand years, they in some ways were far more the
heirs to the Christian state envisioned by Constantine, they had a new monotheistic creed
but they fell heir to many of the institutions, the urban based civilization, the trade routes
and they were in effect a border people who had created their own peculiar martial society
and they absorbed and gained a great deal from Rome also from the Sanated Persia and
went on to succeed to well over half the Roman legacy and the entire legacy of the Sanated
Empire so those are three new significant groups who have moved in and the emergence
of the Avars, the Slavs and the Muslim Arab Caliphate mark a break from that Roman order
these are new cultural orders, new societies going in new directions. Certainly in the case
of the Arabic Caliphate it cannot be argued that everything went back to earlier pre-Roman
patterns far from it, the Arabic Caliphate certainly by 700 is one of the most successful
civilizations on the Eurasian land mass. We usually think of the barbarian legacy in
terms of western Europe and there's a number of reasons for that because the people who
settled in western Europe were the quintessential barbarians to the Greeks and to the Romans
primarily dramatic speaking tribes, they were the groups that ultimately toppled or at
least succeeded to the Roman Empire by 375 when the Goths first arrived into the Roman
world it was clear that Rome was losing the ability to assimilate these people into the
Roman order that the Romans had gone a great, had contributed a great deal to creating these
tribal identities and now these tribal identities could move in, establish their own basis and
create territorial kingdoms which could not be absorbed or even overcome by Rome. The
wars of Justinian opened Italy up to a new dramatic people, these are known as the Lombards.
The Lombards, again perhaps they are the Longo Bardi, anyway they claim that in the earlier
accounts, they claim in East dramatic origin that is they came ultimately from the Baltic.
In 568 they were settled as imperial federates in Pannonia, in effect they had succeeded
to the position held by the Austro-Goths. The Lombards fought as exhilaries in the later
wars, the later campaigns of Justinian's war to bring the Goths to heal in Italy and
within three years of Justinian's death the Lombards who had had their own complicated
war with neighboring tribes decided to migrate to Italy and in part they knew Italy, I mean
they had served in imperial armies and why should they be blamed, the same tales told
of Celts back in the 5th century and 4th century BC, they tasted good Italian wine, of course
we must go to Italy, I mean all of those stories are attributed to the Lombards and in 568
there was a substantial migration of Lombards into northern Italy. How many were not sure,
some figures are as high as 200,000, the Lombards were accompanied by other tribes but they
quickly overran northern Italy. They took over the regions that had once been Cisalpangol.
The Celtic regions that the Romans had to conquer, master and assimilate between the
3rd and 1st century BC and there's a certain irony there and in some ways what the Lombards
did is move in and reestablish old ties of northern Italy to central Europe. They did
eventually set up Duchies in the far south, especially the famous Duchy of Benevento,
they never succeeded in capturing the city. Rome and the surrounding area of Rome remained
under the control of the Papacy, loosely linked to Constantinople. The far south was held
by Imperial armies, ironically the regions that had once been the seat of Greek settlement
and what happens with the arrival of the Lombards and the evolving Lombard society, which is
very well illuminated in charters and in lawcoats, issued in Latin but discussing Lombard customary
law, actually the most comprehensive dramatic customary law that comes down in continental
Europe is from the Lombards, is that the Lombards settled as a military elite, maybe representing
10% of the population or 15% of the population of northern Italy, they were concentrated
in and around what is today Lombard, Milan, Como, also at Pavia, is that with the Lombards
the Roman political institutions that had survived through the Goths and Justinians wars
break down and Italy enters a medieval world. The Romans disappear from the records, the
names are overwhelmingly dramatic, Lombard customary law is used and what is important
is that with the Lombards comes a martial ethos and a local identity that characterizes
not only the Lombards but the surviving Roman aristocracy by 800 AD, probably by 750 AD,
774 the areas conquered by Charlemagne, it would be very difficult to distinguish between
a Lombard and a Roman aristocrat, they were essentially the same, they now dressed in
the manner of the Lombards, they used the same types of weapons and they also had adopted
that martial ethos, furthermore Lombard Italy identified itself by region, by locale and
these would be dictated by the traditional patterns of agriculture, of cities and the
geographic conditions of Italy and one could look at Italy in 700 AD and see the disappearance
of the Roman road system, the administration except in some of those Byzantine provinces
and see Italy as essentially going back to the position Italy was before Rome unified
Italy, essentially we've come back to the world before 264 BC when I started this course
where Italy was characterized by a host of different societies, linguistic groups which
only slowly were put together by the Romans in the course of the 4th and 3rd century BC
into a commonwealth that was finally legally turned into Rome and Italy in the enfranchisement
laws of 89, 90 and 89 BC and finally incorporated northern Italy, Cisalpangol and 42 BC, all
of that work in effect was undone as a series of local societies brought by the arrival
of these newcomers, the Lombards succeeded, one could argue the same in England, in France,
in Spain and you can certainly use these names now to designate these areas, in the
case of England it occurred probably as violently as anywhere, the Anglo-Saxons who arrived were
Pagans, they destroyed what little progress Christianity had made, Christianity would
have to be reintroduced from Irish monks in the north or from representatives of Rome
in 597 that would be St. Augustine who converted the king of Kent and began the conversion
of the English peoples which would go on well into the 7th century. Looking at Anglo-Saxon
England, one can see a great deal of discontinuity, there is an ethnic transformation, we're
not sure how many dramatic peoples crossed the North Sea between say 450 and 550 AD, maybe
it was 100,000, maybe it was 200,000, they took control of the old Belgique area, that
is the areas where there is the most intensive agriculture where the cities are based, it's
the core of the later Roman province, they took over those regions and perhaps came into
possession of maybe 300,000 native people, the polite word is they killed the men and
married the women, one wonders whether marriage is a term that should be used in this, but
they certainly drove out and exterminated part of the male population, a significant
number enslaved the survivors and imposed their language, their pagan cults and their
ethos on what had been the central core of Roman Britain and that is a remarkable ethnic
and linguistic transformation. The survivors, those who clung to their Celtic language and
traditions were driven into Wales, into Cornwell or Brittany which is in France and they were
all designated Welsh by the English, the Saxons and the various Germanic tribes and Welsh
is really a rather unfortunate term because in English Saxon it simply means foreigner
and the Welsh very correctly resent the fact that they're being called foreigners in their
own homeland, I certainly appreciate their position. So there the break is quite substantial,
in Gaul I noted that the Franks expanded rather than migrated, they took over the Celtic
heartland of Gaul, in many ways they took the Roman institutions in Gaul clearly survived
through the Catholic Church, in many ways the Franks assimilated very quickly the Gaelo-Roman
population, the old aristocratic elite at least, within two or three generations of Clovis's
reign, in Clovis died in 511. It is very difficult to distinguish a nobleman in Gaul who could
claim Roman and Celtic ancestors as opposed to a Frank, those who remained in contact
with the Frankish kings, adopted the nomenclature, adopted the martial ethos and got absorbed
into that Frankish military elite and it is significant that the Merovingian kings, these
are the Frankish kings, based their administration on the Church for civil matters, there wasn't
much in the way of a Roman administration that survived in most of Gaul and real power
was handed over to Counts, a comace, and as I mentioned earlier a comace was simply a
commander of a local, you know, of a regional Roman field army and so what happened is the
Frankish kings designated their chiefs by a Roman military term, probably settled them
in districts and said well you're comace of this area and you get to, you know, to exact
money and rations and quarters from that district acting as in effect a Roman army commander
and eventually this Count turned these exactions into essentially his rents to support his
retainers and increasingly forgot to send his take over to the king, the king was quite
satisfied living on his own domains, he had no commitment to collecting taxes, to maintaining
an urban civilization, to putting up public buildings and in the course of the late fifth
sixth and seventh century the whole society of Gaul becomes privatized very quickly and
breaks up into local identities. The Frankish monarchy gives you the illusion there's a
kingship but really the Frankish monarchy consisted of four major subdivisions and then
beneath that were the various Counts who ruled their own districts and those districts corresponded
remarkably well with the kind of pre-Roman districts you would have found in Celtic Gaul
and so outside of the very far south of France along the Mediterranean zone where the urban
Roman culture remained much of Gaul returned to earlier local communities as you would
have seen in Celtic Gaul before the Roman conquest. Furthermore Gaul was now married
to western Germany which was certainly the case before Caesar showed up and I've argued
in this course that the Rhine and Danube were Roman creations that they are really lines
of communication that Celtic society had emerged in central Europe, had expanded into Gaul
and that in many ways what the Franks did was remove this Roman political and cultural
boundary and merge these two areas which had previously been closely linked in the Celtic
age before the Romans had arrived. So even when you're looking at Gaul you in many ways
can say that well the situation has gone back to earlier Roman, pre-Roman patterns in many
ways. Visio-Gothic Spain is not as well illuminated as it could be and that is a result of political
conditions of the 20th century inhibiting the kind of excavations we would like but
again as far as we can tell from what has come down through the literary tradition you
would find a pattern very similar in on the Meseta that is the high plateau up in the
northern reaches of the peninsula the regions where the old Celtic-Iberian populations had
occupied and the Romans had to move in and conquer. There earlier patterns probably obtained
the Visio-Gothic aristocracy centered itself and court centered itself at Toledo and the
far south Byteca and the Levantine shore where there were the old Punic-Roman cities there
the ties to the Roman traditions would be stronger and significantly that would be essentially
the base of the Arab rule in Spain and if one argues that of all the barbarians who
came into the later Roman world the Arabs in effect were in so many ways the real successors
to the Roman system that would make perfect sense. What is remarkable about Visio-Gothic
Spain to me is not that it collapsed to the Arabs but that the Visio-Gothic aristocracy
rallied in the northwest and eventually reinvented itself as the Christian princes of the Reconquista
a very long process in and of itself but that Visio-Gothic experience in Spain had probably
led to the same kind of fusion the importation of that Marshall's frontier society that had
evolved on the Roman frontiers into Spain just as it did into Italy and to Gaul and the
Visio-Goths if they had not fallen to Arab power their subsequent history would have been an
extremely interesting parallel to draw to what was going on in Frankish Gaul so to some extent
one can look rather depressingly at the whole experience and say well after 900 years all
Rome was an interlude and in the end the barbarians won in a very real way not only did Roman
political power was it toppled but also these barbarian societies that succeeded were regional
followed older trade and cultural patterns that had obtained before the Roman conquest. On the
other hand it should not be forgotten that this was not just an interlude because Rome was a
very powerful memory. It was certainly visible to all of the territorial kingdoms emerging in
Western Europe which looked to the papacy in Rome at least if not for administrative at least for
a symbol and guidance. It will be Rome that will re-Christianize the English and bring those
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms back into the continent and in the 7th and 8th century those Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms are integrated back into continental Europe. It will be the Gaelic church the
Western church in Gaul that will provide whatever administrative a talent the Frankish kings need
and it will be the basis of the Carolingian dynasty which follows the Merovingians the family of
Charlemagne that will use those Christian institutions and will go back to the memories of the
Roman past to construct the great Carolingian Empire which is the basis of Western Europe and
that gets us to what survived of Rome. One was the example it could be done even though in
many ways these were local regional societies that followed. I stress how much the
Germanic kings with the exception of the Anglo-Saxon style themselves as Roman rulers and as they
became Christian the Visigoths converted to Catholicism later did the Lombard the Franks had
the advantage of going from pagan to Catholic without ever being Aryans all of them insisted
in ruling as Christian monarchs. They put value in the literary culture even though that culture
came increasingly to rest in the hands of the ecclesiastical elite. They also understood that
there had to be cities there had to be the issuing of law codes and that somehow if these
Germanic kings aspired to rule as Christian monarchs they looked to Rome as their model.
So society didn't just return to a version of the La Tien Celtic culture in central Europe or
whatever Celtic-Iberian cultures had existed in Spain instead these were new societies. The
Roman legacy was very real and present and it can be seen by the fact that within 200 years
certainly by the year 700 or 800 let's take 800 there had emerged in these former Germanic
kingdoms a sense of being part of a Latin Christendom of kings ruling over a fusion of what
we would call Germanic invaders, Roman provincials, Romans who were now part of a Roman Christian
order and had very little in common with those Germanic peoples particularly in Scandinavia who
had not been affected by this process and remain pagans and outside of that Roman Christian
order and so what Rome perhaps gave foremost to the barbarian successor states is certainly some
of the institutions, the literary culture, the organization that survived in the church but also
the model to which to aspire and even after Rome as a political force had disappeared Rome remained
a mentor to these peoples who fused to become the ancestors of the modern Europeans and so Rome is
ever present with us is ever a mentor even to us today as it was for those barbarians of the fifth,
sixth and seventh centuries.
Thank you very much.
