In this lecture I plan to look at a new frontier in the northern reaches of the Roman world
and that is the island of Britain and the Celtic civilization that was in place when
the Romans arrived in 43 AD.
In addition this lecture allows us to look at some of the differences of how Romans reacted
to a Celtic based civilization as opposed to the German tribes in the imperial age.
In the last lecture I discussed how the emperor Augustus attempted to in effect claim the
Julian heritage in Germany.
His adoptive father Julius Caesar had twice campaigned in Germany, Germany had been marked
for conquest and Augustus' efforts in Germany ended in the catastrophic defeat in the Teutonburg
Forest in 9 AD and the Roman withdrawal to frontiers on the Rhine in the Danube, a decision
that ultimately proved permanent and very very important in future relations between
Romans and barbarians.
At the same time Augustus could have also looked north across the English Channel to
the island of Britain.
In 55 and 54 BC on two occasions during the Gaelic War Julius Caesar had led expeditions
into Britain.
Ostensibly he was rooting out rebels, exiles who had been driven out of northeastern Gaul
and found refuge with their kin in southeastern England today.
He also claimed that the Druids, the priestly cast in Celtic society were particularly well
represented in Britain.
They had a very famous sanctuary on the island of Mona, anglicely today, it's on the northern
shore of Wales, it was an international center in the Celtic world and so to the Romans it
was a hotbed of Druid opposition.
To some extent these were pre-Texas, this was an effort for Caesar to move in and to
find out if exploration could net him yet another conquest.
So the Emperor Augustus for his own reasons decided to go against the Germans and Britain
he could have consoled himself with the fact that a number of the kings ruling over the
tribes in southeastern England acknowledged some type of authority to Rome based on the
second expedition by Julius Caesar in 54 BC when Caesar attempted to put in power friends
in certain tribes, he imposed tribute especially on the principal tribe the Cattu Willani.
It was the most unlikely of Julius Caesar's heirs who ended up directing the Roman invasion
of Britain, this would be the Emperor Claudius, the fourth of the Julio-Claudian emperors,
a figure who has received a great deal of attention not only from modern biographers
but also from the ancient sources and there's a real dichotomy on the depiction of Claudius,
the ancients tended to ridicule him, they saw his lisp and his clubfoot as a sign of being
a well as his mother, his grandmother once said a half-made monster not finished by nature.
Since tend to see Claudius in a very sympathetic light, he overcame these hindrances, ended
up being emperor quite by accident was because of his nephew Caligula being murdered and
Claudius happened to be available and Claudius had a sense that he had to reenact the great
deeds of Augustus of Julius Caesar and went better way than to go into the island of Britain
the region explored by Julius Caesar which he could claim as his contribution to Rome's
expansion against the northern barbarians. Now Claudius's decision was really quite rational
in a number of ways and it's not certain how good his information was on Britain but the
Roman success in conquering Britain and that would today be England and Wales and an indirect
control over the Scottish Highlands, lowlands. The Romans abandoned any notion of going into
what today would be called the Scottish Highlands, Caledonia and they certainly had no interest
in Ireland, hibernia and if you read Roman accounts they have a very distorted notion
of where Ireland is. Tastus thinks that somehow Ireland is between Britain and Gaul, France
so as I mentioned earlier their cartography is a little weak by modern standards although
they can they can navigate their ships and get to Ireland and just didn't find any reason to go
there. On the other hand the reasons they did conquer were regions that had been subjected to
the influence of La Tienne Celtic civilization. About 75 BC a group of Belgic tribes these were
the people residing in northeastern Gaul had crossed over it was a fairly significant migration
it was the last of a series of Celtic speaking migrations into the British Isles.
They brought within the superior technology that I discussed already in central Europe
there is very good evidence that agriculture improved and when the Roman army shows up in
southern Britain and this would today be the Midlands, London and the home counties and the
southern shore in these regions the Romans encountered tribes that were related to the
tribes in Gaul and the area was just bristling with those hill forts the Apidum the Apidum
pleural which Caesar described in his account and which excavations in Germany and in France have
revealed to be very sophisticated settlements in closing wide areas including our agricultural zones
but having all the specialized shops and crafts you would need certainly offering markets.
In addition beyond that immediate area that core area of Belgic civilization
the technology had been transmitted west and north in northern England today
dwelled a confederation of tribes known as the Bragantes they were probably not part of the
original migration the Belgic tribes to the south that Caesar encountered in the Romans
initially conquered but the burials that they have revealed that they've adopted the horse
burials chariots from the continent by the time the Romans arrived they were beyond the zone of
Celtic civilization or I should say Belgic Le Tien on the other hand they were very expert in
herding a certain amount of mixed agriculture and these would be in the Penang mountain regions
in the and the northern regions of of England today beyond them dwelled various tribes in Scotland
who were at an even different level of social organization whales and Cornwall there were
distinct tribes there which were affected to varying degrees by the Celtic civilization on the
continent Cornwall today was home to a Celtic tribe known as the known as the Dumoni that's
their Latin rendition they had been the people involved in the tin trade with the Mediterranean
world since the beginning of the Iron Age and they were very heavily influenced by continental
trade the people of Brittany the Veneti who gave Caesar so much trouble he had to build a fleet to
suppress them they were in close contact with Cornwall the tribes in Cornwall they were engaged
in mining activity so that society was not just a simple barbaric society when the Romans moved in
Wales proved to be a very tough zone there there were two principal tribes in the south the Salures
in the north the Otaviches who both tribes destined to become designations of geological
ages in the 19th and 20th century the so the situation was extremely complicated and there
were a variety of different levels of civilization and tribes and when Claudius made his decision
to go into Britain he was he was largely moved by immediate political concerns his own popularity
in Rome to the Roman upper classes to the army he looked like a miserable specimen he came to the
throne in advance age his his young third wife Messalina ended up being a notorious figure in
Rome and eventually was deposed and executed in one of the most insane Boudoir plots I've ever read
the other fact that Claudius was not a favored member of the household of Augustus he had been
passed over he wasn't considered serious meant that he was not seen as a Julian emperor he didn't
have the name he didn't have all that patronage necessary to command the loyalty of the army
the provincial elites so Claudius the most unlikely of emperors ended up waging a number of wars or
at least carrying out territorial expansion as a way of gaining the reputation of where to
send honor getting a triumph and eventually a triumphal arch which was voted to him for his
British campaign the arch doesn't survive but it is depicted on Claudius's coins and he was very
proud of this military achievement so political reasons at Rome moved him there are also political
reasons in Gaul at the same time the links between Gaul and in Britain at the same time the links
between Gaul and Britain were close the Roman conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar and the development
of the provinces did not interrupt the trade and contact between the Celts in the British Isles
and the Celts now under Roman rule far from it there is very good evidence that in the period
from say 54 BC when Caesar left to 43 AD when the Romans arrived with an invasion force
almost a century three generations there was an enormous amount of influx of Roman goods
into southeastern England particularly among tribes that had fought Caesar the most important
were the Calta Willane who occupied today what would be Hertfordshire in southeastern England
there were tribes in Kent there were the Atre Bates the Trinovantes and Essex a number of
Belgian tribes with hill forts at loggerheads with each other they had their own local rivalries
and the dynast in these tribes were minting coins patterned after Roman style they were
importing Roman wares and wine and certainly by the time the Roman army showed up many of the
native artists were fusing Roman traditions they were making their own ceramics and their own
metalwork inspired in part by Roman prototypes now being wedded to native Celtic art so the region
was in close economic and social contact also there's every reason to believe that the Druids
maintain close contact and the Romans eventually ended up outlawing the Druids because they were
seen as as inciting Roman anti-Roman activities on the other hand they were not opposed to the
Celtic gods per se and this can be documented later in the Roman age when in both Britain and
Gaul where many of these Celtic gods were very very readily and happily identified with Jupiter
Mars this is known in Latin is interpretatio romana that is the local gods were interpreted in
a Roman fashion and and we'll see this both in Gaul and in Britain the city of Colchester
cumulodonum in latin was named after the native war god of the Twin Ovantes in Essex today who
occupied that area and this god would have been identified as Mars eventually cumulodonum becomes
a Roman colony it's the modern city of Colchester today and gets its name from a combination of
the Celtic war gods named Manchester which is an Anglo-Saxon corruption for castra camp you know
it was a Roman military camp there so in 43 AD Claudius decided to invade Britain and he left
nothing to chance he mobilized some four veteran legions three of them from the Rhineland there's
a reason for that his demented nephew Caligula had increased the garrison to 10 legions far too much
military force in the Rhineland too close to march on Rome that it would be a very good idea to at
least send some of them over to Britain and keep them occupied and also a legion from Panonia march
to join this expedition it probably numbered about 50,000 men under very experienced officers
first governor as a fellow by the name of Alus Plautius and this expedition is the largest
organized army ever to land in England it landed in the summer of 43 AD technically to restore
a deposed king the principal target where the Cato Willani the leading tribe in southeastern
England they were claimed to be overthrowing friends of Rome they had occupied cumulodonum
they were seen as not paying the tribute there were a number of pretext but they felt Claudius
reasoned that if they could smash this tribe they could overrun the island and that's exactly
what happened at the time there were two kingsharing power these were the sons of Sinobellinus who's
remembered later in Shakespeare and it was the misfortune of these two brothers to meet the
full fury of the Roman army the Romans just overran England within the first four or five years
very little resistance and they also had in place the network of roads and hill forts which
formed objectives but also were able to sustain this huge military force that moved in and by
47 AD by the end of the governorship of Alius Plautius most of the southeastern the midlands
the home counties of England had been incorporated or the tribes had submitted and become clients and
friends of Rome these included the Eceni in east anglia it included certain tribes along the southern
shore within years of the initial roman conquest we find tribes adopting uh or roman style villas
and mosaics there's a very famous one excavated in fishborn in southern england and so many of
these Celtic notable notables were quite familiar with the romans and many of the leaders of the
lesser tribes were willing to come to terms with the romans in order uh to gain advantage within
their traditional societies uh the best example of that i mentioned the fellow who built um uh the
city uh the villa at um uh a fishborn uh coge uh uh cogey dubnus um a latin rendition of a of a
Celtic name actually styled himself as both king and legate that is lieutenant of the emperor
augustus claudius uh which is an odd combination of roman and local titles uh and uh this this was
probably the pattern across uh much of southern england so the british uh conquest proved a success
what claudius didn't realize in moving this fast military force into the island he now committed
his successors and successive governors in the island to securing this province because the
initial areas overrun were the areas of belgium civilization cornwall wales the northern territories
the brigantes those were brought into the brigantes brought were brought into alliance with their queen
cartoma um cartomandua uh the ascene in east anglia were brought into alliance but the welsh
tribes the cornish tribes they were outside the roman control they uh proved to uh offer stiff
resistance uh um caractacus uh the uh uh dispossessed king of the catawilani the older brother he
actually escaped and incited the welsh tribes to fight the romans he wasn't captured until 51 uh so
the romans found themselves now drawn in these very difficult guerrilla wars into western britain
and through the 40s 50s um uh these these wars just continued uh they climaxed in 60 ad with a very
ambitious effort to break the resistance of the welsh tribes by sacking the major druid um sanctuary
on the island of mona uh that is off the northern shore of wales uh the then governor gaius suetonius
polinus was brought in because he was probably a specialist in guerrilla warfare he had fought
against the north african tribes of mortania today morocco uh he was leading general this is uh in
the reign of nero and he marched uh essentially a legion and a half deep into wales and captured
the island and there's a very dramatic discussion of this island and the siege in tacitus uh and
these uh german axiliaries patavians the dutch fellows i've mentioned before they actually
swam the channel in full armor to gain the bridgehead and allowed the legions these were the 14th
and the 20th legions to cross over and to defeat uh uh the druids and their um their um soldiers
and eventually torched the grove the grove and and wipe out this nest of druids well the uh
bulk of the roman army was dispersed uh over uh the province and engaged in putting down
guerrilla operations and the removal of so many of these forces uh resulted in a major rebellion
erupting while the the bulk of the roman army was uh was attacking this druid settlement
and this is a uh revolt very well known today uh because it was led by queen buddhika she's
sometimes called bodicea uh which is a rendition from the 19th century which isn't quite correct but
she's frequently known under that name and she's been immortalized as a um a british heroine who
opposed the uh uh the roman oppression uh she was the uh wife of the king of the asenii
presutakus who had come to terms with the emperor claudius and ruled as a client king for claudius
and nero and in 60 ad he died and the emperor nero sent in his procurators and freedmen to
convert this region into part of the province uh the queen was mistreated uh her daughters uh
were raped uh the queen was publicly whipped and humiliated uh in came the roman tax collectors
there was a census the asenii were to be disarmed and buddhika rallied her tribe against this roman
oppression just at the time that the romans were engaged in wales and furthermore this uh uh
insurrection didn't remain localized but spread across much of southeastern britain many of the
tribes uh the trinovantes the cattualane um uh joined buddhika's insurgents and their complaints
were very similar to the compliance that we encountered when arminius raised the germans
against the romans or the rebellions in the balkans um roman tax collecting uh the the way the
romans took the census this was very unnerving to traditional society the romans have a passion for
counting and taxing everything uh the britains had been ordered to disarm themselves uh which was
seen as uh interfering with traditional notions of hierarchy and rank in a warrior society uh the
romans had established already a military colony at uh colchester uh kamaludonam uh there was an
imperial cult set set up there uh roman veterans were discharged and settled this was seen as um uh
a uh onus on the local population who were taxed to support the roman colony land had been distributed
as i mentioned in an earlier election lecture this would have involved centuriation that is the
parceling out of large sections of land it's almost as if the why uh the romans had this huge
waffle iron they imposed on their empire with all these grid patterns so that land could be
distributed to military colonists um and all of this resentment and also military service that is
there are cases of of britains being forced into the roman auxiliary army all of this exploded
the insurgents swept over the southeastern portions of the island they burned uh colchester to the
ground uh and there are a number of monuments that have been found there and remains of romans who
were butchered uh colonists uh by the enraged insurgents they eventually took also st albins
and other important roman colony and london which was emerging as the main uh commercial center of
of the island uh swatonius pollinus uh who heard news of this rebellion uh left wales and by force
march within two weeks got back to london just in time to evacuate the civilian population and draw
the british insurgents into a set battle somewhere in the midlands probably on what's known later as
the watling way or road uh one of the major roman highways through the uh the midlands of england
and there um the two legions reputedly took on a british force five or six times their size uh
provoked them to make a frontal assault uh across a plane where the roman flanks were protected by
woods on either side and the romans just just cut these forces to pieces uh most of the british army
went down in defeat uh trampled to death in the panic queen bouta boutica committed suicide uh
nero at the time emper made the smart move of pulling uh swatonius pollinus he had gotten too
much reputation and putting in uh administrative types as governors thereafter but it's but but
the revolt collapsed this meant that the island's frontiers had to be completely rebuilt and the
reason that didn't occur immediately is the romans were consolidating their control over
that belgic heartland and that took a good 20 years now there was a civil war uh that interrupted
this progress which we're going to talk about in the next lecture and this is the great civil war
69 that followed the the suicide of nero that plunged the roman empire to turmoil
britain wasn't immediately affected by that civil war the alliance structure among the bregantes
fell down queen cartoumandua friend of rome was actually run out by her husband because the queen
took up with uh the husband's armor barrier and her husband when newtius took power as king and
ran his wife out who found refuge with the romans and now posed a menace in the north
but on the whole uh what uh the civil war did was force the new dynasty that came to power in 6970
the flavian emperors uh vespasian and his son's titus and demission to settle the issue of britain
and that was done by sending in tough professional governors three of them who undertook the conquest
of wales uh northern britain and eventually most of scotland uh the third of these governors was a
man named ganayas julius uh agricola and the roman historian cornelius tacitus was his son-in-law
and wrote a very uh intriguing biography on his uh father-in-law agricola which is sort of a model
of what a roman governor should operate like uh in a province uh tacitus attributes to his his um
father-in-law uh the conquest of the various uh northern tribes it climaxed in a great battle
over the caledonians that is the northern tribes of kelts from scotland uh calgacus is the leader
it's the battle of mount graupius and in 84 ad uh he also uh commended his uh father-in-law for
constructing the road systems that ran up the east and west coast of england uh into lowland
scotland uh he was seen as a model governor in promoting romanization tacitus goes on in great
length uh about how he courted uh the sons of the leading caltic tribes uh but this great push to
the north to conquer the hull of the island was cut short because the third flavian emperor demission
had concerns closer to home on the danube and the garrison of four legions in britain was
permanently reduced to three one of the legions was withdrawn uh the second adutrix it was sent
to the danube and the uh advance was halted the romans eventually um decided on a frontier that
is pretty close today to the frontier of england and scotland and constructed the famous wall
in the reign of the emperor hadrian which is really the work of two of hadrian's governors
hadrian's wall is often misunderstood of what its purpose was and it's very similar
to the types of fortifications i described in north africa and the types of fortifications
the romans will build in germany uh it runs 77 miles there was a there was a farther northern
wall a couple of times the romans occupied but the main the main official boundary was going to run
between uh the tine soloway line this is 77 miles uh more or less than marking the northern limit of
of england today the wall was built 15 feet high 10 feet thick it's from local concrete uh it
acted as a barrier a political barrier but also a platform for very aggressive patrols along four
major highways emanating from the forts along the wall deep into lowland scotland and the
various tribes in scotland were subjects of roam they were friends and allies of roam um
uh they um were actually paid subsidies and so the romans exercised political control well
beyond the wall essentially up to the scottish highlands uh the wall had behind it a foce or
a moat a barrier which people think is very odd you know why is the moat behind the wall
and the reason for that was that if any british group of you know group of raiders got it into
their head of crossing the wall and attacking and cattle wrestling uh that moat wouldn't stop them
from coming in but if the these raiders were coming back with loot and cattle which were the two
main items um it would be an absolutely remarkable feat of of of athletic ability for these cattle
to leap this moat they weren't going to do it you were able to stop the raiders uh and collect the
loot and punish them so the wall was much more for patrolling and maintaining uh what one author
would call low intensity threats the legion was based back in york or in chester in northern wales
there were two legions they acted as a strategic reserve and if there was ever a major threat of a
some type of coalition of the Celtic tribes of lowland scotland renouncing the roman loyalty
and attacking the wall the legions would move in and handle it but the 15 000 auxiliary soldiers
along the walls were very very well placed uh there was a series of gates uh there were major
forts along the wall at every five to seven mile intervals there were signal towers this this system
secured the northern limit of the island now briefly in the 139 140 they advanced the wall
north to a much shorter line about 45 miles across this is the so-called antonine wall
the romans decided it wasn't worth it and to some extent um it probably was just a a sensible
economic decision which we'll come back to when we're talking about the romanization the provinces
the military forces along the wall 15 000 exhilarations plus 5 000 men in york the legion
they could be fed from the agriculture and the towns of belgic britain but if you push those guys
up to the antonine wall they would be well behind well behind them were people who essentially
engaged in stock raising and didn't have the agricultural surplus to feed a huge military
garrison up in northern britain and so to some extent all of these roman frontiers in northern
europe stopped because of the accidents of political expansion and military operations
but also the romans are very just sound about provisioning their forces the wall the hegeonic
wall proved a great success it was never breached there is a report of a major attack in 367 ad and
there are raids coming out of ireland and eventually uh from scotland but essentially
the northern frontier of britain was secured through the hull of the second third fourth
into the early fifth century uh there were a couple of attempts to send punitive expeditions
against the caledonian tribes done in 208 211 by the empress of temus severus but essentially the
limit of roman power had been reached and behind that wall developed a rather successful and and
and significant uh romano-british civilization based on that old belgic core the threat would come
not from the northern tribes most of them who were in some kind of symbiosis economic and military
with the romans but rather from a threat to the east across the north sea that no one could envision
and that would be the dramatic tribes the so-called anglo-saxons of the early middle ages which were
a coalition of tribes from the danish peninsula and the northern shores of germany who had crossed
the sea and assault the island at the end of the third century ad and eventually would move
into the island once the roman military structure and administrative structure collapsed as for the
wall it simply was abandoned it was never assaulted there wasn't some sort of uh vast
barbarian coalition that moved over it in fact um as far as can best be told the wall was still
more or less functioning after the last roman field armies had withdrawn in 410 and it was just a
matter that there wasn't the money to pay to garrison the wall and eventually the soldiers
just drifted away and merged and merged into the local population uh and the wall had become
irrelevant anyway because the main threat was coming from the east it was coming from those
nasty germans uh who will appear on the scene in later lectures
