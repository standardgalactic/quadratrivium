Hello. In the last two lectures, we've been talking about genes in the abstract. We've
been talking about units of heredity that are transferred from parent to child that
were first imagined by Mendel. But Mendel and none of the scientists that followed
him for the next 70 or 80 years actually understood the material substance that was associated
with these abstract genes. Today we're going to begin to explore the material substance
in which genes exist and how people came to understand the process of sexual reproduction
by looking at the chromosomes and seeing how the chromosomes segregated just like genes
from parents through gametes to their children. And once again, Aristotle's vision is here
because what we've been doing for the last two lectures is looking at the form, the information,
that aspect of genes. And today we're not looking at the form as much as we're looking
at the material substance in which the information is contained. And in the next lecture, we will
go even further into the material substance when we look at the DNA. So in this slide,
you see in brilliant detail with modern technology what chromosomes look like inside of a typical
cell. Now these particular cells have been stained with a particular fluorescent tag so that you're
looking at the cytoplasm which is in green and the chromosomes are in red in the middle. And the
chromosomes exist inside the nucleus. Most of the time this is what cells are like. They have a
cytoplasm which is separate from the nucleus and inside the nucleus are the chromosomes. And without
this modern technology, it would not have been possible to get any kind of resolution inside of
the nucleus as we can do today. But it's certainly a lot easier to figure out what's going on with
new technology than it was with the old kind of microscopes which gave you black and white gray
images. Nevertheless, scientists were able to look through the microscope and discover
chromosomes that are not very apparent in the greater portion of the cell's cycle in life. But
they are and they become apparent during a particular phase of the cell cycle when the cell
divides and passes on equivalent copies of each chromosome to each of its daughter cells. And
this picture you can see the different phases of this division process taking place inside
of human cells that are being grown in the laboratory. We start at the top and go counter
clockwise. At the very, very top we see a cell that still has an intact nucleus and then we move
to the left a bit and we go down and the chromosomes begin to take form and shape.
Each of the chromosomes is now condensing and we go all the way down to the bottom
and you can see the red lines lined up in the middle of the cell. There's no evidence of a
nuclear boundary between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and then on the right at the bottom you
can see that the the red figures have shifted. They've moved apart from the center. We go up
along the right side and you see the cells pinch off from the mother cell and we go up to the top
and we have two cells that arose out of what was originally one cell. Now the question is and
scientists have been looking at cells for hundreds of years the question that scientists
could answer only at the beginning of the 20th century is how can one cell divide into multiple
cells that have the same hereditary information as the as the parent cell and the answer they came
up with was the chromosomes. The chromosomes are what contain genetic information and it's the
chromosomes that make copies of themselves to be placed into two daughter cells. Now again with
modern technology you can see in this picture each of the chromosomes stained with a different
fluorescent tag so even inside the nucleus which is what you're looking at over here you can see
all these different colors those are the different chromosomes we can now pick them out because we
can use modern biotechnological techniques that distinguish the chromosomes from each other
and each chromosome is numbered as you can see on the right side there so we have much greater
resolution to be able to look inside cells see the chromosomes in this picture you see a scanning
electron micrograph of chromosomes and you see the classic x-like shapes that the chromosomes take
chromosomes actually only take this shape after each strand after each portion of each
chromosome has replicated and what you're looking at when you look at the x is the two sides of the
x are actually identical copies of the same chromosome now the the terminology for looking
at chromosomes and describing the chromosomes in a particular species is the karyotype a karyotype
is a species typical picture of the chromosomes in that species and it's not just a count of the
chromosomes it's also the shapes and the black and white bands that you can see in the chromosomes
each species has a typical number of chromosomes and each chromosome has a typical shape this happens
to be the karyotype of my son Ari and what you can see looking at this is that there are a total
of 46 chromosomes 23 pairs and each chromosome is numbered except for except for 2 which we'll
come back to in a moment so you have 22 numbered chromosomes they're numbered from 1 to 22 according
to their size there are two chromosomes that don't have a number they're identified by a letter
and the two chromosomes are equivalent in a general sense to the two copies of the gene
that Mendel postulated back in the in the 19th century and this is a normal human karyotype
and this is an example of how similar chromosomes are between different people the two on the left
are my son's chromosomes the two on the right come from a different man
and you can see the banding pattern the pattern of black and white areas and the length of the
chromosome and how similar they are between one person and another so we can look at the
chromosomes and get a sense of how reproduction occurs and there's two forms of reproduction
there's asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction now actually inside of our bodies
asexual reproduction is occurring all the time asexual reproduction is how a single cell
makes two copies of itself they're called daughter cells and the two daughter cells
have the same genetic information as the single parent cell and so in our development from a
single cell embryo at each point in time the cell grew then it divided then those two cells
grew and they divided so through a process of growth and division through asexual reproduction
we produced over a trillion cells which make up the human body now the newly formed cell a newly
formed daughter cell has a single copy of each chromosome and this example here just to make
things simple is illustrating a hypothetical organism with just two chromosome pairs and
so one chromosome pair you see in dark and light green and there's a gene on this chromosome pair
called a one has the big a allele the other has the little a allele the other chromosome pair is dark
in and light red and there's a big b and a little b allele on those chromosomes and during the middle
of the generation time of the cell what happens is that each of these copies now there are two
copies that are different from each other to begin with ones from the father ones from the mother
those are the two copies and each of those copies gets replicated so that there are two identical
copies of each copy of the chromosome and this gives you the iconic x-like shape of the chromosomes
and the x's the different sides of the x's are identical and so you have two x-like shaped
chromosome for for green those are ones the paternal ones the maternal and the same thing
for the red so now you have replicated the complete genetic information inside of this cell
and now you can separate the two copies of the genetic information into the two daughter cells
this is a video that shows you a visualization of the chromosomes coming apart being pulled into
the two daughter cells there are components of the cell called centrioles that pull the
chromosomes apart into the two daughter cells and then the two cells separate from each other
and they each have the same chromosome identity so to continue through with mitosis mitosis is
what this process is called when the cell divides into two the chromosomes will pull apart so you
will end up with two daughter cells after the division which each have single lines as representing
their chromosomes and those cells will grow and eventually they'll divide and the process will
go on and on towards the generation of a whole human being for example now chromosomes undergo
a different process during sexual reproduction and this process is called meiosis what happens
during meiosis and this is the the material equivalent of what Mendel explained what happens
during meiosis is you actually get a reduction in the genetic information in the gametes and the
production of the gametes so on the left is a man again we're looking at a simplified organism
he's starting out with just two chromosome pairs there's the green pair and there's the
red pair and each of those chromosomes molecules there's four of them each one of them replicates
and so you get the traditional x-like shape of each of those chromosomes and then through
more complicated process the chromosomes actually get separated from each other
so that you end up with gametes sperm from a man that carry just one of the two original
green chromosomes and just one of the two original red chromosome they've reduced their genetic
information so they only have one allele of the genes associated with each of those chromosomes
and the parallel process occurs during the woman's reproductive development as well
she produces eggs and the functional egg also has only one chromosome of each pair
and then the egg and the sperm come together and that recreates each pair of chromosomes
with one coming from the mother and the other one coming from the father
in each case for each pair now i told you previously that the chromosomes are all numbered
except for two and all of the other pairs of chromosomes there are 22 numbered pairs of chromosomes
the members of the pair are pretty much indistinguishable from each other at the level of
resolution that you can see in a microscope but there are two chromosomes that you can distinguish
in the microscope and these are the sex chromosomes and in men they look very different from each
other the larger chromosome is called x the smaller chromosome is called y all men have one x and one
y women are different in this particular realm they have two x chromosomes and no y chromosome
now it was the transmission of the x and y chromosome in parallel with the determination
of the sex of a child that really demonstrated the association between chromosomes and genes
so the trait here that we're looking at is the sex of the individual whether the individual
is a male or a female and the mother in this case as i said has two x chromosomes the father has
an x and a y and whenever a baby boy is born it receives a y chromosome from its father and if
the baby is a girl instead it's because she has received the x chromosome from the father
which gives her two x chromosomes one from her mother and one from her father it was this strict
association between these these particular chromosomes and the trait of sex that demonstrated
the association of chromosomes and and genes and allowed scientists the beginning in the 20th century
to rediscover Mendel's laws and to understand the process by which genetic information is transmitted
from parent to child now there's a particular notation that scientists especially medical
geneticists use to describe the karyotype and to describe alterations or deficiencies
in the karyotype of a human being and the notation has three parts there is the number
which represents the number of chromosomes and every single cell in an individual's body
has the same karyotype and has the same number of chromosomes in the same shape of chromosomes
because the process of asexual reproduction reproduces whatever karyotype was present
in the original cell of the embryo so the notation first has the number the number of
chromosomes in each cell's nucleus then it has the sex chromosomes which in a normal person are
xx or xy and then the third part is in people who have an extra piece of chromosome or an extra
chromosome or a missing chromosome so it's those three components that make up the karyotype
notation and this notation served very well when chromosomes could only be analyzed through a
microscope and so you saw big changes now of course with new biotechnology we have a much
greater resolution and we have to use a much more sophisticated system to understand the different
chromosomal defects that that that we can see so this is an example of a chromosomal defect
and this particular karyotype is 47 means it has an extra chromosome 47 x y plus 21
that means that the 21st chromosome is present in an additional copy compared to what it should be
and this resulted from a problem of chromosome movement during meiosis in either the mother or
the father so that a gamete each gamete's supposed to get just one copy from each chromosome pair
but one of the gametes that formed this child got two chromosomes so two chromosomes get put
together with one chromosome for chromosome 21 and you have three copies of chromosome 21
now unfortunately if you have such an overabundance of genes because there's a lot of genes on
chromosome 21 as we'll discover in the next few lectures if you have an overabundance of
genes or you have an underabundance of proper genes it mucks up the system of development
and children born with an extra chromosome 21 have a condition called down syndrome which
affects their their mental abilities and has other effects on on the way that they look at their
lifespan most of the chromosomal abnormalities most of the time an extra chromosome or a missing
chromosome doesn't actually come forward into a child that is born most of the time if you have
an extra if a embryo has an extra chromosome or a missing chromosome it's going to spontaneously
miscarry and there won't be any baby born but chromosome 21 is pretty small which is why
sometimes there's not so much genetic information on it that sometimes the baby can be born
and there are some other chromosomes that can also be present in a greater number than they should
be these are two other examples of trisomies these are examples of children who have an extra
copy of other chromosomes besides chromosome 21 the sex chromosomes are different than the
other chromosomes and the why chromosome in particular is kind of odd because it doesn't
have very many genes on it it doesn't really do very much except make an embryo turn into a male
rather than a female and because there's not very much that it does if you have an extra copy of the
why chromosome it doesn't have very much of an effect on the person people with an extra copy
of the why chromosome are a little bit taller than they would be otherwise but they have a normal
mentality and otherwise they are quite normal in their development the other kind of sex chromosome
deficiency is called 45 x o and the o is used to indicate the absence of a second sex chromosome
so this is an individual who has just one sex chromosome which is an x she is missing the y
and you'll see here that I said she because if you don't have the why chromosome the embryo
develops in a ground state which happens to be female in all mammals this condition is called
turner syndrome and the main problem because the why chromosome doesn't do very much the main problem
that these people have is one of fertility they're unable to produce eggs and go through the
reproductive process that way this is a picture of a fully developed karyotype where you can see
diagrams that are drawn for each of the chromosomes and each of the chromosomes is divided into
black and white bands and each of those bands is given a number and a letter to distinguish it for
other scientists for all scientists to know what they're talking about when they publish
papers concerning the results of analyses of particular human karyotypes in recent years
the the analysis of chromosomes has become much more sophisticated than was possible
with just the old-fashioned light microscope there's a technology which has been created
which is called fish which stands for fluorescent in situ hybridization in situ means in place
and the way this technology works is you can take a particular probe that you know will bind to a
particular chromosomal region and you tag it with a little fluorescent molecule and the fluorescence
can be observed under the microscope by shooting a laser beam at the sample and then the chromosomes
that have bound a particular probe will light up with a particular color and this is an example
in which each of the chromosomes has been probed with a molecule that gives a different color
so you can see each of the chromosomes there's two copies of each of the chromosomes
in this particular karyotype and the nice thing about the fish technology is that you can automate
so a machine driven by a computer can look through the microscope and count the number of
chromosomes and make sure that there are two of each chromosome to make sure that the that
the karyotype is normal and that's possible because each one of the chromosomes is lighting up
with a color a different color that the computer can can recognize as being different if you use
the fish technology you can see other kinds of defects that arise sometimes during reproduction
and here is an example of a defect called translocation where chromosomes have broken
apart and then rejoined in the wrong orientation and you'll see a chromosome which has two different
colors the two different colors represent the two different chromosomes that have come together
um to cause this particular defect and again an automated machine is able to read and to see
this kind of result and be able to identify this result to the physician who's taking care of a
particular patient now the fish technology plays an important role and is a very powerful tool
for looking at the evolution of the human karyotype in relation to other kinds of animals
and in this particular example here we have an actual micrograph where you can see the human
chromosomes and they've been tagged with fluorescent probes from the gibbon and what
you see is each of the human chromosomes has multiple colors and that means that the human
chromosome a particular human chromosome is equivalent to fragments of a gibbon chromosome
and then in the diagram you can see the gibbon fragments that have been stitched together
during the evolution apart of humans and gibbons from each other and the longer the time that has
passed since the common ancestor of two individuals the more different these patterns are going to
be the more breaks there are going to be in individual chromosomes in one species relative
to the other so you can go both ways you can look at the human chromosomes the gibbon probe as I
just showed you you can take a human probe and look at the gibbon chromosomes you can see how
these chromosomes have broken apart and and stitched themselves together in different ways
during the evolution apart of our common ancestor with the gibbon this is another interesting example
of the fish technology looking at the chromosomes of the aardvark aardvark doesn't have very many
chromosomes and people wondered whether or not the aardvark actually had the same content of genes
as human beings have and the answer is yes it's just that the different human chromosomes are the
the material is all there but it's stitched together in in bigger compendiums in in the aardvark
now one of the most fascinating uses of the the fish technology and the most fascinating result
is in a comparison of human and chimpanzee to each other and in this particular picture here
the chromosomes are not all the same color to get better resolution what the scientists did
is they have probes for different parts of the chromosome each chromosome in different colors
and the reason they did this is because it turns out that the chimpanzee karyotype and the human
karyotype are almost identical every one of the chromosomes in the chimp and the human are
indistinguishable at this level of resolution except for one situation you can see here that
there is a single human chromosome that formed by two chimp chromosomes coming together so that is
the only karyotypic change that has occurred in the evolution apart of a chimpanzee and a human
from a common ancestor and the the technology the fish technology is very very powerful it can
detect not just chromosomal regions but individual genes in this particular example it allows scientists
to automatically determine the absence of a gene which causes the george syndrome in other words
this is a trait a disease which is caused by the absence of genetic material which we'll talk more
about in a later lecture so today we focused our discussion on chromosomes first in terms of the
entities that are visible under a traditional light microscope objective and then we talked about
modern technologies like fish which allow us to look more deeply at chromosomes to see features of
the chromosomes that you can't see just with microscopy alone and in the next lecture we're
going to turn our attention to DNA which is in the chromosome and actually contains the genetic
information and it's not just a question of going to a higher resolution of analysis once we get to
the DNA and we discover the structure of the DNA we get tremendous insight into the essence of life
itself
