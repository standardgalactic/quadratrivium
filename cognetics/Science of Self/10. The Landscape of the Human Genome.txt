Hello. In the previous lecture, we looked at the technologies that have been developed
over the last couple of decades that gave rise to the field of biotechnology, which
allows us to look inside cells and see DNA sequences and RNA sequences and see how all
the different molecules interact with each other. What I'm going to do today is, at this
lecture, is to talk about how the organism actually interprets the sequence in its genome.
The raw sequence information by itself doesn't give you a clue to what the sequence is actually
doing, but if you have some knowledge of how the cell and how the cell's proteins interact
with different sequences and you give that knowledge to a computer, a computer can decipher
different parts of the landscape of the genome and provide scientists with an understanding
of what these different parts of the genome do, what parts code for proteins, what parts
don't code for proteins, but do something else. The landscape metaphor is a very useful
one in this particular lecture because it really is like looking at the landscape of
a town, a village, or a forest and being able to zoom in and see things much more clearly
than you can from further away. So that's what we're going to do now is to zoom in to try to
look at the details that are encoded within the DNA sequence and the details are all
within informational elements. Remember the genome is an informational entity, it's not
a material entity. Now before we get to the genome, I want to go back through the history
of our understanding of the gene, the classic gene and the evolution that has occurred in
our way in which we look at the gene and actually I'll reach the point later in the lecture
where I'll tell you that a gene really is not a unifying entity anymore, that its indivisibility
has been dismantled and it's served a good purpose to help scientists, but it's really
more of a science human creation than a real entity. But let's go back and see how we've
evolved to that position today. The first conceptualization of the gene was by Mendel,
of course in the 19th century and Mendel envisioned the gene like an atom and this is a really
good analogy because when atoms were originally described by the early chemists in the early
19th century, there was the notion that atoms were indivisible, atoms were the fundamental
particles of matter and the term really goes back to the Greeks who imagined that there
are certain Greek philosophers, imagined that there were fundamental units of matter and
they gave the word atom to describe those units and just like the atom being not fundamental,
the atom can be divided into protons, neutrons and electrons, in the same way Mendel's atomic
view of the gene has undergone a revision because we now know the gene certainly can
be divided into at least smaller units which are the base pairs that go into the gene.
But Mendel's view of an atomic gene was very useful for a long time for geneticists to
use to build their models of how heredity worked and at the beginning of the 20th century
is actually when scientists rediscovered Mendel's laws and they did it through the conceptualization
of genes being on chromosomes and so there was a bit of a revision of the Mendelian view
of genes.
Genes were now like beads on a string and that's the way that early geneticists looked at them
because genes that were on the same chromosome were more likely to travel together from parent
to child talking about the alleles now than genes that were on different chromosomes which
would travel independently of each other.
So that was the chromosome view which held forth in the beginning of the 20th century
and one of the other important sources of input into genetics was the discovery and
the understanding of inborn errors of metabolism and this was done by medical geneticists who
realized that there were simple genetic traits one of them is called PKU that act as recessive
diseases so there are two parents who are carriers when there's a child born with this
disease and the disease is caused by a defect in a particular enzyme and there were a number
of diseases like this that were recessive diseases and it led scientists to believe correctly
so that genes coded for enzymes there was a connection between the gene and the enzyme
now enzymes are primarily proteins although we now know today that RNAs sometimes can
be enzymes but primarily the protein class of organic molecules is what gives rise to
enzymes so by the 1930s there was a notion that genes were encoding proteins which carried
out functions in the cell and the whole organism and that there were mutant alleles which caused
a defective enzyme or the lack of the of the enzyme in people who had disease and so that
was the first inkling that there was a connection between genes and proteins and also with the
discovery of the connection between genes and chromosomes it there was a clear concrete
link that was placed between information from the genes and the chromosome which you can
actually see under the microscope now one of the problems throughout the 20th century conceptualization
of the gene is the word the gene was being used in a number of different ways it was used to
describe a unit of heredity a unit of evolution a unit of biological function and it wasn't
necessarily true and it isn't necessarily true that those units are absolutely overlapping each
other the unit of heredity or evolution might be different than the unit of function but the
thinking during the 20th century for the most part is that these were the same they were a
single kind of unit that was the unit for all of these all of these purposes but the this became
much more questionable at the end of the 20th century but from the 1953 to 1975 the central
dogma held forth the central dogma was a hypothesis created by Francis Crick one of the
discoverers of the double helix of DNA and the hypothesis was that the code goes in one
direction that one gene codes for one RNA transcript and that RNA transcript is translated into one
protein and the information can only flow in one direction from digital code in DNA to RNA to
proteins so there was still the notion that there was one gene one protein even though by the
1950s and 60s we realized that single genes that made single proteins could have effects on many
different systems so Mendel imagined one gene one trait already by the 60s and 70s we knew that it
could be one gene that controlled many different traits then starting in 1980 there was another
revolution in our understanding of of the gene what happened is molecular biologists discovered
that there wasn't a one-to-one correspondence between the DNA sequence and the ultimate messenger
RNA sequence that was translated into a protein this was a real shock to molecular biologists
instead what appeared to be happening is a region of the DNA would be transcribed so there would be a
DNA sequence transcription would occur and then the cell pulled out spliced out pieces of the RNA
inside the nucleus before it got to the cytoplasm and spliced together what was left and that
smaller spliced RNA is what was passed into the cytoplasm and used for translation of the protein
so it was surprising that there was so much of the genome that wasn't being used and scientists
have terminology to describe each of the parts of the genome that are involved in producing a protein
the region of transcription first that that is a contiguous region and that's the transcribed
region and the transcript is said to have exons and introns and the introns are the parts of the
RNA that get spliced out and the exons are the parts of the RNA that are present in the mature
messenger RNA molecule that is in the cytoplasm so the exons get spliced together the exons are
in sequence with each other and from the exons the the protein gets translated so that means that
if you look at the protein sequence it's no longer completely corresponding to the the DNA
sequence the protein actually has bits that come from different parts of the genome scientists
thought that was okay because the parts of the genome that coded for the protein were supposed
to be near each other but it turns out that even that was an oversimplification of what was really
going on before I talk about the next part of the landscape of the human genome I just want to give
you some some pointers to where you yourself can go and and look into this data in in a much more
detailed way the U.S. government maintains a website at the National Center for Bioinformation
Technology NCBI and anybody could go on this website and probe the different regions of the
genome click around and have printouts of your favorite gene if you'd like to so let me give
you an idea of how we can look at the genome from the top going down to a more detailed level
I'm going to use chromosome 11 as an example chromosome 11 has a group of genes called the
hemoglobin beta gene family and these are genes that code for the protein components of hemoglobin
which is a very important protein that's used to transport oxygen around the body
and this particular part of the of the complex of proteins in hemoglobin is called beta
and it's encoded by the beta gene which is on chromosome 11 so if you take a grand view from
far away of chromosome 11 we have the entire DNA sequence and computers have looked through
the DNA sequence and identified the regions of DNA that encode proteins and you can get a grand
view and look across the genome and in this view of the genome all of the genes are displayed in
as green boxes you can see that there are regions of the genome where there are more genes or less
genes there are what scientists refer to as gene deserts where there is a whole piece of DNA and
there's nothing there coding for anything but let's zoom in a bit from the hundred million bases
which is the length of chromosome 11 and let's zoom way down to 35 000 bases so here's 35 000
bases or base pairs whenever I say either I mean the same thing and here is a region where you can
see five genes and these are the members of the beta-globin gene family and then there's a couple
of things that you can see at this level of resolution the first thing you see is that most
of the genome doesn't code for proteins we'll talk more about what it does later and later in the
course but the regions that are transcribed in this version are in green you can see the
transcription units in green and then the regions that are spliced out of the RNA are lighter color
purple darker purple it shows you the the exons of each of these genes each of these genes is
actually very similar to to the other they all code for a version of the beta-globin protein
which is used at different times during human development now let's zero in go even closer
and we're going to look at 1400 bases which is the size of one of these genes and here you can
you see that the the green area is the transcription area where we have across the entire region
and the region that's transcribed here now in blue you can see the exons that are spliced together
to give you the mature RNA and then ultimately the region of the RNA that gets translated into
a protein is in red and finally we can go to the highest level of resolution which is the
DNA sequence itself and here we can look along the sequence and see the DNA bases that code for
particular amino acids this was just an arbitrary stop along or stops along the way through chromosome
11 the software exists for anybody in the world to look in here in more detail with a particular
gene to zoom in or zoom out as much as you want and to get an enormous amount of information
about anything in the genome i'm going to give you an example of another gene which i've found
very interesting and this is a gene that has been named OCA2 it's called that because mutations in
this gene cause a certain kind of albino like feature but the interesting thing about this
gene for most people is it's a pigmentation gene so it's involved in producing pigment in your skin
and your eyes and your hair and there's a particular allele of this gene that causes blue eyes so this
particular allele is actually not in the gene itself and this is going to give us some information
about what alleles actually mean the allele that causes blue eyes to occur is off on the side of
the OCA2 gene and what it does is it affects the expression of the gene so that people who have one
version of the allele at this particular locus this particular gene do not produce the pigment
properly in their eyes and so instead of having brown eyes which is normal they have blue eyes
the interesting finding here which has been repeated over and over again and calls into question
our classical notion of genes as units of information on a chromosome is that this particular
difference this particular allelic difference it's a single base that changes from one allele to the
other it's present in another gene nearby which is called HERC2 but it actually controls the
expression of OCA2 and it controls the expression of OCA2 the pigment gene only in the eyes not
anywhere else this is interesting to me because I happen to be a heterozygote at this particular base
there's an A and a G allele and with the G allele you're not going to get expression
of this particular gene in in the eyes and you have blue eyes but I have an A allele which is
dominant so that gives me brown eyes on yet I can have a blue eyed daughter because my wife also
has the G allele and so our daughter received the two G alleles the defective alleles that allow
blue eyes to form in the absence of brown pigment so that is the kind of information that we are
getting now from from our analysis of the genome and one of the other things that scientists have
discovered is that we thought previously that transcription occurred and then exons were
particular regions of sequence that the cell spliced together but now we've discovered that in fact
splicing can occur differently in different cells or even in the same cell so in this particular
example there's one kind of splicing which takes a particular transcript splices out two introns
and brings together the three exons but then you can also find mature messenger RNA
that has just the outer two exons together and not the inside one so that produces a different
protein it's missing a bit of genetic information in the middle and you can get much more complicated
splicing alternatives that bring together different pieces of DNA to form different exons
and ultimately from a single region of DNA you can get an enormous number of very different
proteins and in fact from the same region you can actually get proteins that are not related
to each other because the exons are interspersed with each other and have no sequences in common
the the possibilities are enormous and in in 1980 we thought it was possible that one gene
might be able to produce hundreds of proteins from different splicing reactions by 2008
we can see that the the number of different ways in which the cell can put together information
and create exons where they didn't exist before is enormous so that you actually can get millions
of proteins out of a single gene in theory the cell has decided through evolution how it's going
to use this information and where it's going to use this information to to create proteins
but there's no longer this one-to-one correspondence between DNA a DNA region and a protein
all the different regions can be mixed together and the cell can decide by itself anthropomorphically
how much of each kind of transcript it's going to produce so in one case there might be a cell
that produces 80 percent of its transcripts including a middle axon and 20 percent that
skips the middle axon and there might be another cell where the cell has decided it's better to
to skip the middle axon more often than not and that's all regulated in a complex system
by by the cell so the DNA is not changing from cell to cell but the coding regions are which
we didn't have a clue about just 30 or 40 years ago now with more intensive study of the genome
we can look at regions and a region that i've shown here as an example there are three
genes each one was thought to have a single transcript originally and you can see in this
diagram the large boxes represent the exons they're going to be sliced together but because it's
become so inexpensive and easy to look at more and more RNAs and more people and tissues you find
out that in fact there are many different kinds of splicing events in this just this one little
region of the genome producing thousands of different kinds of transcripts each of which has
a different function so it makes an organism much more complicated than we thought and it also means
that the ultimate unit of both heredity and evolution is actually not the gene but rather
genomic regions that might be as small as a single base pair or as large as a unit that's able to
produce many different kinds of proteins when it comes to blue eye color for example the unit of
heredity and the unit of evolution is a single base and in a later lecture i'll tell you why
the base for blue eyes has been selected through evolution but the unit of function the biological
function is this whole gene that that this one base change controls so scientists use the term
locust to describe a region of DNA that is not necessarily corresponding with a transcribed
region or a region coding for for a protein it's just much more difficult to to talk about a system
that's so complicated now gene expression is fine tuned to the binding of a whole diverse set of
proteins to the DNA so the DNA makes RNA it codes for RNA and the RNA is translated into proteins
some of those proteins actually function by going back into the nucleus and binding to the DNA
and it's through the binding to the DNA of these proteins of these specialized proteins that the
initiation of transcription occurs in a particular region of the genome and using very high resolution
analysis it's possible to actually look at the protein see how it interacts with the DNA
and this is an interesting supplement to the view that genes and genetic information is all
defined by the proteins it codes for because here are other important regions of the genome
that don't code for anything and where the information isn't digital what's happening here
is that the protein is actually recognizing the three-dimensional structure that is formed by a
particular sequence of bases and binding to that three-dimensional structure and that binding is
taking place and then that's going to cause transcription of a region of DNA that is nearby
but this piece of DNA itself is important it plays a role it has a function that is not the
classical function of coding for a protein now a large part of the genome we now know
is actually involved in the control and regulation of transcription and splicing
and translation so a much smaller part of the genome actually makes the protein sequences
which can come together in many different ways and more of the genome is involved in determining
which pieces of the rest of the genome get expressed or don't get expressed and these
regions which determine whether a coding protein coding region is going to be expressed or not
are called cis regulatory elements cis means nearby regulatory tells us that this particular
piece of DNA is involved in the regulation of gene expression and that this particular piece of
DNA functions through its three-dimensional structure as opposed to its just its digital
sequence we it's possible now to look very uh at a very high resolution at the DNA and here
we're going going to go back to the beta-globin region of chromosome 11 and you can design experiments
that will look along this region and see where there are DNA sequences that bind to particular
proteins involved in regulation and we can look along the sequence in every place that you
underneath the genes that you see a dark line is where there's binding to a particular regulatory
protein that's involved in in regulating the expression of one of the genes that is shown
in this region and you can see that one of the proteins involved in regulation
binds to a lot of places along this just this small region of DNA there's another protein
it binds to fewer places both of these proteins are involved in regulating the the expression
of the beta-globin like genes turning them on and off and we can see in a three-dimensional
diagram again how the actual atoms associated with the amino acids in the protein will interact
with the atoms associated with the backbone and the bases of the DNA molecule so the the level
of understanding that we now have is enormous compared to what we had just just very very recently
in time and i'm going to tell you one more finding that occurred just within the last
seven years of a functional genomic element involved in in regulation in a way that that
wasn't expected and this is called micro RNA is is the term of the product being made by these
genomic elements and the process is called RNA interference and what this involves is certain
sequences of DNA are turned on and they actually produce an RNA transcript that doesn't make a
protein what the RNA transcript does is it's complementary to messenger RNAs the cell has
previously made and the RNA transcript will bind to particular messenger RNAs and in the binding
process it'll cause the destruction of the messenger it's a way that the the cell has evolved
to tune down the translation to tune down the amount of protein being made from certain
genes evolution does not take place in a in a logical way evolution takes place with whatever
you've got and this sounds like a bizarre way to regulate gene expression to let the gene be
expressed and then to knock down the messenger RNA later on but it evolved and it's very useful
and the really useful thing about RNA interference is that it provides a really
powerful way to do gene therapy in in people because what we would like to do as as biomedical
scientists is develop a particular piece of genome that has a not that will code for or
were transcribed into an RNA that is complementary to a transcript that we don't want to see produced
with Alzheimer's disease with sickle cell anemia these are both examples of genes we would like to
turn off with sickle cell anemia we want to turn off the sickle cell gene and with Alzheimer's disease
we want to turn off the genes that form plaques in the brain and and this could provide RNA
interference could provide a method for doing this by giving by putting into the cells into the
person pieces of genome that will do this at the translation level so those are a few of the
findings about the landscape of the of the genome that have come about through studies over the last
decade or two and in the next lecture I want to go much deeper into the idea of gene regulation how
the cell goes about regulating turning its genes on and off and this is really critical to being
able to control disease because many diseases are caused by an aberration in gene regulation
genes are not working properly as they should and that is what causes cancer so if we can understand
the the defects in regulation that occur in cancer cells then we'll have a better chance
of producing therapies to overcome that so that's in the next lecture
