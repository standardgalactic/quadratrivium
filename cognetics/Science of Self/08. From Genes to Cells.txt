Hello again, in the last lecture we talked about how DNA holds genetic information within
bases basic chemical units and how this information is replicated by the cell and how it can be
replicated because the information is redundant within the double helix. The DNA molecule has
two strands and one strand completely defines the sequence of the second strand and vice versa.
And within these strands there are bases. Each strand has a sequence of bases and when the
strands come together you get base pairing and it's the sequence of bases that holds the
information that tells an organism how to develop and how to carry out all the functions of life.
Now we just talked last time about how an organism is able to replicate its DNA and the
fact that the genetic code is digital. In this lecture we're going to focus on the second aspect
of what the genes have to do. It's not just that they have to get themselves replicated so that you
can reproduce an organism but the genes actually have to carry out the functions in the organism to
keep the organism alive and doing what it's supposed to do. So that's the focus of our lecture today.
We're going to look at how the digital code within genes within the DNA is transformed into an
animated analog form of life. Now the first important point to think about is the fact that the cell is
the fundamental unit of life. Every living thing on earth is made up of one or more cells and some
organisms are just single cell organisms like paramecia and other bacteria. Other organisms are
more complex. The human organism begins during development with an embryo that has only one cell
and those cells will replicate and early on it's just a mass of cells, a ball of cells that is going
to develop into a whole human body. Now during the development of our body those cells develop,
differentiate into very specific kinds of cells some of which will carry out brain function. These
are the neuron cells and others are going to be blood cells that carry oxygen through the blood
stream to all of your tissues and organs. In every one of these cases though the fundamental unit
is the cell. The cells can come in many forms and shapes but the basic metabolism, the basic process of
bringing in energy and carrying out the functions of making the molecules that make things alive,
that all occurs inside of the cells. Now there is no such thing as a standard cell but most cells have an
anatomy that is pretty similar one from another. If you look at a cell, this is a cell from an
advanced organism like a human being, the cell can be divided immediately into a nucleus which is
somewhere in the middle of the cell and the cytoplasm which surrounds the nucleus and then around the
outside of the cytoplasm is a membrane which holds the whole thing together as a unit and that
particular membrane is called the plasma membrane. There are other membranes inside the cell. In this
particular picture you can see green and orange showing you some of the subunits inside of the
cytoplasm of the cell and the cell is very structured actually. It has membranes that escort proteins to
different places inside the cytoplasm. The limit that cannot be broken without killing the cell is the
plasma membrane on the outside. Now the nucleus main role is to hold the DNA. It holds the chromosomes
and inside the chromosomes is the DNA and it turns out that the DNA actually doesn't do anything in
the sense of actually carrying out a reaction or having any function per se. All it is is a store of
information. It's kind of like the hard drive on your computer. It sits there, information gets read
from the hard drive and then your computer uses that information and in the same way the cell reads
the information inside of the DNA molecules and then it uses that information to carry out various
processes. One little difference from your computer is that your computer actually can write to its
hard drive and in the cell the DNA that you get is the DNA that you always have. The DNA doesn't
change although the cell can use the DNA in different ways as we're going to explore today.
So the basic principle of molecular biology, how the cell works, is that genetic information is
stored in the double helix of DNA and there are segments of the sequence which are called genes
by scientists and these segments of DNA have information that allows the production of a
particular protein and that's the basic idea. Genes code for proteins and proteins can take
on many many forms and chemical properties. So unlike DNA, DNA is the same in every organism,
in every cell, everything on earth. If I gave you a test with DNA you could not tell me where it came
from but proteins are different. Proteins are made up of multiple amino acids as I'll show you
during this lecture and each amino acid has different chemical properties and the amino
acids are put together in a way to give you a large protein which will do what it's evolved to do.
So at the very very basic level we're going to go from an easy level to more difficult and more
difficult and deeper into to how the cell works during this lecture. At the very basic level you
have segments of DNA that have a sequence that codes for a protein. Now let's look in a little
more depth at what's going on here. In the nucleus there is the DNA and what the cell does is if it
needs a particular protein then it has a mechanism to transcribe the DNA into a molecule called RNA.
Now right away let me tell you that molecular biologists have a lot of words with very special
meanings that are metaphorical. So transcription is a word that comes from the common language
in molecular biology. When you're working in a molecular biology laboratory transcription has
a very specific meaning and its meaning is for a cell to take information in a particular segment
of DNA and take that information and create an RNA molecule which is basically a facsimile
of the DNA information. Very very similar to DNA in that an RNA molecule is also made up of basis.
It has C and A and G and instead of a T it has a U in its place but that's one of the small
differences. It also has a different backbone and so it's chemically much more sensitive to
being broken down. DNA is very stable chemically its backbone is constructed so it can stay around
we now know for tens or hundreds of thousands of years we can find it in fossils. RNA is purposely
structured during evolution so that the cell will make an RNA molecule and that if it doesn't
continue to make the RNA molecule the RNA will quickly break down or to be chemically
dissolved so that the that particular protein that that RNA molecule is going to make
is not going to be made anymore. So the RNA which is made by the cell by scanning a particular
region of DNA that RNA molecule comes out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm and here's where a
second transfer of information occurs the RNA molecule is translated into a protein molecule.
So the information in the DNA went into the RNA basically unchanged and then from the RNA
the RNA information has to be read in a special way to make proteins and we're going to talk about
all those details in in a moment. And the building block of the protein is a amino acid
and there are 21 different amino acids and they're strung together during translation
and then once the strand the strand of protein is made it then folds into itself to take on
the structure that gives it the function that it has. Okay so let's look a little more deeply at
gene expression. Gene expression is another metaphor and scientists use it to describe
when a cell is reading the information in a DNA sequence and making a product from it making an
RNA transcription product which will go on to make a protein. Now not all of the DNA is coding for
proteins the DNA is broken down into segments just like a book is broken down into sentences
and then it's broken down into words which are separated by spaces and the same thing kind of
holds for DNA coding as well. There are particular points along the DNA sequence which the cell
recognizes as a place where it should begin transcription and next to that point upstream
is what scientists call it. There's a region of DNA that doesn't code for anything but it has a
structure that will bind to a protein that is involved in transcribing the DNA into RNA and
we're going to talk more about that particular aspect of molecular biology in a later lecture.
Right now I just want to focus on transcription and what is actually happening during the process
of transcription and what is happening is that if you look at the double helix which is a series of
letters on one strand and the other strand is complementary during transcription each of the
letters in one of those strands is placed into a molecule of RNA one by one with the exception
that the T becomes a U in the RNA but there's a one-to-one relationship between the sequence of
the RNA and the DNA and so transcription will begin transcription means the cell will start
at a particular point to make this RNA sequence we also call this a transcript or a messenger RNA
because it's a messenger from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and then once the RNA gets into
the cytoplasm there's another mechanism that the cell uses to translate the RNA sequence
into a protein sequence and translation usually begins somewhere upstream of the of the end of
the RNA 10 20 or even more 10 20 30 40 bases upstream of the RNA the translation can begin
and at the point at which translation begins the cell is reading the RNA sequence now it's
different than transcription because it's turning the the base sequence which just has four units
into a protein sequence where the units are amino acids and there's 21 different amino acids
now a single base of DNA can't code for an amino acid because it's only four different bases
and so what evolution has done did a long time ago because most organisms operate this way
is it takes three bases in at a time right after each other and the three bases are used
code for an amino acid now within three bases there are four by four by four possible sequences
because there's four potential bases in each place one two three and that gives you 64 possible
three base codes which is more than enough to code for all of the amino acids that can be
put into a protein so part of the DNA is transcribed a smaller part is read by the cell
into protein during the process of translation and then the protein will will fold and and take on
a function now let me show you a molecular diagram of how this works and there's a molecule called
RNA polymerase and the cell uses RNA polymerase when it wants to transcribe a particular
region of DNA the RNA polymerase grabs on to the double helix of DNA and it opens it up
pulls the strands apart and then other enzymes and proteins of the cell will read the DNA bases
along one of the strands a specified strand and in the same way that base pairing takes place when
the DNA molecule is replicated base pairing is used to build an RNA molecule that's complementary
to one of the DNA strands so one base by base the cell is building up an RNA molecule and again as I
said uh instead of a t complementary to the a in DNA the RNA molecule uses a u in place and that
also has the ability to pair with a so it it scans along the DNA molecule the RNA polymerase that is
until it gets to a spot where there's the end of a sentence just like in the English language
there's a period wow and the DNA code there are periods as well and at that point the RNA polymerase
comes off of the DNA it releases the RNA molecule again it's called a messenger RNA
which is also abbreviated mRNA and it's also called a transcript those are all the same thing
so now you have an RNA molecule and the RNA molecule will go out into the cytoplasm the
transcription is an ongoing process when a gene is very heavily transcribed the there can be a whole
row of RNA polymerase is scanning the gene simultaneously and lots of RNA is being made
from this gene when the cell needs a lot of that product this is what it's going to do the cell can
decide how much RNA it wants to make it can make uh levels of RNA that are orders of magnitude
different from each other it can control it very very finally um now the RNA is translated into
protein and the translation occurs through what is called the genetic code the genetic code is the
particular amino acid that is represented in the DNA sequence by three base letters and here we see
a view of the of the genetic code this was the genetic code was discovered in the 1960s from the
1950s from the discovery of the structure of DNA scientists realized that there had to be a code
to be able to convert the DNA sequence into a protein sequence and during the 1960s they
developed the technology to figure out what the code is so there are 64 different possibilities
of three bases that can be put together and in a typical genetic code table you read the first
base on the left and the second base on the top and so if we wanted to look at what is being encoded
by the sequence of three bases c a g we would look along the left side and see the the row of c
for the for the first base and we look along the top and we see the a which is in the third column
and then at the intersection of those two columns you see four triads for different three base
sequences and you see their c a g and that codes for an amino acid named glutamine each of the
amino acids has a three letter abbreviation and if you're a molecular biologist you know these
abbreviations by heart and so you can look at a DNA sequence and we can have computers look at
DNA sequences now and from the DNA sequence you can read a series of amino acids and the amino
acids will will give rise to the to the to the protein when they're attached to each other
another way to to look at amino acids and proteins and represent them in the on the computer is what
scientists call the one letter code it's just to make it easier for computers even if it makes it
difficult for scientists to learn it and so each of the amino acids also has a single letter
that describes it and so for example the letter v describes an amino acid called valine and if
you look at a sequence of amino acids chemically they're being attached to each other through
amino bonds and what differs from one amino acid to the next is a group which is represented as an
R in a diagram of amino acids and so you have a backbone of amino acids and then coming off of
the backbone are these different chemical groups each amino acid has a different chemical group
with different properties some amino acids are hydrophilic which means they like to be in water
some are hydrophobic which means they don't like water some have a positive charge some have a
negative charge and when you put it all together in a large protein of thousands of amino acids
the protein will fold up in a particular way based on what amino acids are present where
plus and minus will will come together they're attracted to each other if it's in a an aqueous
solution then the hydrophilic amino acids will be on the outside of the protein and the hydrophobic
the amino acids that are afraid of water will be on the inside of the protein and so the amino
acid sequence will define the the structure of the protein so the structure of the protein is
commonly looked at at three different levels first there is the primary structure and the primary
structure is really just the order of amino acids so the primary structure you can read directly
from the sequence the DNA sequence gives you an RNA sequence which gives you a primary protein
structure that's absolute absolutely determined in that way and then what happens is as the primary
protein is being created it will begin to fold up in into what we call a secondary structure
and this is kind of a localized structure there are two very common secondary structures in
in proteins one is called an alpha helix where the backbone of the protein
circles around this is not the double helix this is just a simple alpha helix discovered by Linus
Pauling and another common structure is the beta pleated sheet in which the strands of the protein
go back and forth but there are many many other ways in which proteins can form localized structure
and then after the secondary structures are formed and once the entire protein is is finished
it takes on a much more complicated tertiary structure and in this particular image you see
two different diagrams representing the antibody protein or immunoglobulin and in one way of
diagramming this protein you can actually see these the beta pleated sheet you can see the
the parallel lines next to each other representing a strand of amino acids in in in that kind of
direction now these proteins have millions of atoms with inside of thousands or tens of thousands
of amino acids and so you really can't see all of that in a picture but scientists have designed
computer programs that will give you a sense of the of the properties of each of these proteins
and this is a protein that binds to antigens antibody molecules are what you make when you
become infected with a foreign object and the antibody will bind to the foreign object and
try to eliminate it from your system and by looking at the structure of the antibody molecule
on a computer you're able to see how anybody's bind to foreign objects and cause this this kind
of reaction these are some other proteins just as examples in one of these proteins you can see
very clearly regions of alpha helix and they're colored so that you can see different parts of
the protein and again this is a very low resolution you're not actually looking at the atoms you're
not actually looking at the amino acids here but a molecular biologist can look at this diagram
and get a sense of what the chemical properties of this protein are it sounds amazing but it's true
and also there are computer programs that allow you to look at a protein at this level and then
you click and then you can zoom in on a particular part of the protein and look at the atomic structure
if you like now proteins each protein has a particular function some of the functions are
enzymatic in other words the protein will carry out a certain chemical reaction the protein also
other proteins function in structural ways they they build up structures of your body including
your hair your hair is pure protein and so proteins can function in thousands and thousands of
different ways and the the protein itself i've talked about how it takes on a particular structure
but the structure of the protein can change in response to different environments that
that it's present in scientists call this the dynamic personality of proteins where it'll come
into contact with a with an ion or some other kind of molecule and the whole protein shape will
change to take on a a new a new function there are proteins present everywhere in the cell
some very important proteins are present in the plasma membrane of the cell which which defines the
extremity of the cell and they're represented in this picture as these globular things that are
that are go into the membrane and are out on the surface and these proteins of this kind are used
to transport ions and to transport small molecules into and out of the cell the cell has to have this
constant ability to bring things in and take things out if it wants to survive if it wants to stay alive
so essentially the entire cell is a dynamic system of proteins interacting with each other
and sending signals to each other and we're now at the stage where we're we're beginning to see
all of the different interactions that take place inside of a cell and we could look at one little
part and this gives you just the sense of how complex the whole picture is and we can draw
arrows between the different proteins that interact with each other it's a system that is constantly
dynamic constantly feeding on information that it gets from the outside world constantly
being rebuilt by new RNAs making new proteins and then old proteins get broken down so it's a system
that doesn't stand still it's amazingly complex and more amazing still that scientists have the
ability to actually decipher what's going on inside of the cell given this in in this incredible
level of complexity so the the question that we'll answer in the next lecture is how do scientists
do that today we just did a general overview of the basic molecular biology of the cell
and the different components and how genes are expressed how the information in genes gets out
and gets the cell to work and to carry out the functions of life how did scientists figure this
all out well in the next lecture we're going to find out we're going to see the kinds of tools
that scientists have developed to be able to look at living systems and understand the ingredients
of living systems
