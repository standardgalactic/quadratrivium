Processing Overview for From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos
============================
Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L01.24 - Thinking Theoretically.txt
1. **Mimetic Theories**: These theories focus on the relationship between a poem and the universe or external reality. Mimetic theorists believe that poetry imitates or reflects the world around us, much like a mirror does. They are interested in how well a poem captures and portrays reality.

2. **Pragmatic Theories**: This orientation looks at the relationship between a poem and its audience. Pragmatic theories consider what a poem does to or for its readers, listeners, or viewers. The focus is on the practical effects of poetry, including its ability to inform, persuade, or entertain.

3. **Expressive Theories**: Expressive theories are rooted in the Romantic view that poetry is an expression of the poet's psyche. They believe that a poem encapsulates the inner workings of the poet's mind and emotions. Poetry, from this perspective, serves a personal function and often has a prophetic rather than didactic role. The question of what a poet is is almost synonymous with what a poem is.

4. **Objective Theories**: Objective theorists focus on the poem as an object in itself, separate from the universe, the audience, or the poet. They treat the poem as a self-contained, self-referential artifact with its own internal structure and laws that govern it. This approach emphasizes the study of poetry for its own sake.

5. The course will cover these four orientations in detail, exploring how each contributes to our understanding of poetry and its various functions and effects. Literary theory is a rich field with many branches, and this overview sets the stage for deeper exploration into the nature of poetry and its interpretation.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L02.24 - Plato - Kicking out the Poets.txt
1. Plato's defense: In the "Republic," Plato argues that poetry can be both harmful and beneficial, and he challenges poets to defend their art by proving its usefulness in a well-ordered state and ensuring it does not deceive but enhances our knowledge of truth. This challenge sets the stage for literary theory, as subsequent theorists aim to either justify a separate sphere for poetry with different criteria or to integrate poetic wisdom into philosophy itself.

2. Literary Theory's Response to Plato: Nearly all literary theory can be seen as an attempt to answer this challenge posed by Plato. Theorists either argue for the separation of poetry and philosophy, suggesting they serve different purposes but are both valuable, or they integrate poetic wisdom into the highest form of philosophical inquiry, proposing that poetry and philosophy should coexist and inform each other.

3. The Impact of Plato's Challenge: Plato's challenge forces literary theory to adopt a more rigorous and disciplined approach, elevating the discourse around poetry from simple personal enjoyment to one that must be philosophically and sometimes theologically sound.

4. Upcoming Topic (Lecture 3): The next lecture will explore how Aristotle responds to Plato's concerns about mimesis (imitation) in his work, offering a different perspective that values poetry as a means of understanding reality and cultivating virtue.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L03.24 - Aristotle's Poetics - Mimesis and Plot.txt
1. **Aristotle's View on Tragedy:** Aristotle believed that a well-constructed tragedy should have a beginning, middle, and end that are necessary, probable, and inevitable. This means that the resolution of the plot should arise naturally from the events themselves, rather than relying on a contrived Deus ex machina (a god intervening to resolve the plot).

2. **Deus ex Machina:** Aristotle disapproved of the Deus ex machina because it artificially resolved the plot and did not arise naturally from the events. This approach suggests a belief in a rational, ordered universe where everything has its place and reason.

3. **Plot vs. Character:** Aristotle emphasized that the plot is the most crucial element of a tragedy, even more so than character development. This contrasts with many modern viewers who often prioritize strong characters over a compelling plot.

4. **Catharsis:** Although we will delve deeper into this in the next lecture, it's worth noting that Aristotle believed that tragedy should evoke a cathartic emotional response from the audience—a purgation of emotions such as fear and pity.

5. **Realism vs. Contrivance:** Aristotle valued realism and logical consistency in his tragedies, preferring that the plot unfold in a way that feels natural and believable within the narrative's context.

6. **Cultural and Philosophical Context:** The preferences of playwrights like Euripides or Molière for using Deus ex machina reflect their different views on the universe and their audiences' expectations, demonstrating that artistic choices are often influenced by a writer's philosophical beliefs and cultural context.

In summary, Aristotle's idea of tragedy is one where the narrative unfolds in a way that is organic and necessitated by the events within the story itself, rather than relying on external or supernatural interventions to resolve conflicts. His emphasis on plot over character reflects his belief in the importance of a coherent and logical narrative structure to achieve the cathartic experience he associated with tragedy.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L04.24 - Aristotle's Poetics - Character and Catharsis.txt
1. **Aristotle's Organic View of Poetry**: Aristotle saw tragedy as a living organism that must adhere to its own laws and couldn't be altered without affecting the whole work. This concept of an organic unity in poetry is crucial for understanding how a piece should be cohesive and interrelated.

2. **Unity in Tragedy**: Aristotle believed that all parts of a tragedy should be related organically, and everything within it should contribute to the overall integrity of the work.

3. **Synthesis of History and Philosophy**: According to Aristotle, poetry combines the concrete particulars of history with the universal truths of philosophy, making it superior to both in some ways. This synthesis allows poetry to be both specific and general, or as he calls it, a "concrete universal."

4. **Influence on Critical Theory**: Aristotle's "Poetics" has profoundly influenced various critics and theorists throughout history, including Kant, Coleridge, and the New Critics.

5. **Linguistics in Poetry**: Aristotle also touched upon linguistics within his analysis of poetry, which later became more prominent in modern critical theory's focus on language.

6. **Importance of "Poetics"**: Had Aristotle not written "Poetics," the course of critical theory might have been very different, as it is considered one of the most important works in critical theory.

7. **Riddle of the Sphinx**: The riddle posed by the Sphinx, which Oedipus solved, symbolizes human life's stages—crawling as an infant, walking as an adult, and relying on a cane in old age. This riddle is emblematic of human nature and the cyclical nature of life, themes that resonate with Aristotle's views on tragedy.

8. **Upcoming Lecture**: The next lecture will cover neoclassical theory, which emerged as an interpretation and extension of Aristotelian principles during the Renaissance and the 17th and 18th centuries.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L05.24 - Horace's Ars Poetica.txt
1. **Horace's "Epistles"**: In Book I of his "Epistles," Horace offers advice on the role of the poet in society, navigating between pleasing the masses and maintaining artistic integrity. He addresses the challenges poets face, including financial stability without compromising their art.

2. **Artistic Integrity vs. Popular Appeal**: Horace acknowledges that poets must cater to a variety of audiences, from the wealthy to the common folk, without letting the pursuit of money corrupt their work. This is reminiscent of the tension between the muse and the marketplace.

3. **Contrasting Views of Poets**: Horace presents two contrasting views of poets. The negative view portrays them as unkempt, possibly mad individuals who are driven by their poetry and can be bothersome to those around them—akin to Plato's notion of the possessed poet. The positive view, on the other hand, sees poets as civilizers and moral guides, who shape society through their art and imagination, akin to the myth of Antheon and his harmonious piping that led to the construction of Thebes.

4. **Poets as Civilizers**: Horace argues that poets are not just creators of poetry but also of civilization. They establish moral rules and societal norms through their work, which has a civilizing influence on humanity.

5. **The Poet as Oracle**: Horace suggests that poets are like oracles, speaking for the gods, and thus deserve honor and fame. This is a subtle jab at Socrates' claim that philosophers should be supported by the state as public servants.

6. **Historical Influence**: The ideas presented by Horace regarding the role of poets have had a lasting impact on Western thought, influencing later defenses of poetry by figures such as Sir Philip Sidney and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

In our next lecture, we will explore these themes further and examine the concept of the sublime in poetry as discussed by Longinus.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L06.24 - Longinus on the Sublime.txt
inus L., writing in a time he perceives as lacking sublime art, expresses a sense of belatedness, lamenting that his age is not conducive to producing such art. He feels that he was born too late to witness or contribute to a golden age of poetry and art, much like Aristotle and Horace felt in their times.

Longinus' treatise "On the Sublime" aims to revive sublimity in literature and art. He identifies the qualities that kill the sublime, which he initially suggests is primarily tyranny, implying that without freedom, sublime expression cannot flourish. However, Longinus reveals a deeper truth towards the end of his essay: materialism and hedonism are even greater enemies of the sublime than political oppression. He argues that an excessive focus on material wealth and sensual pleasures leads to base and ignoble thoughts, vanity, and insolence, effectively extinguishing the sublime spark within the soul.

Longinus posits that even under political slavery, one's soul can be free to achieve sublimity. Conversely, a society consumed by materialism and hedonism is spiritually impoverished. He implies that true sublime poetry or art uplifts the human spirit and has a moral elevating effect on society, contrasting with Plato's view that poetry could be harmful to morals. Longinus suggests that poetry, not philosophy, is the key to moral improvement and the creation of a more perfect society.

In essence, Longinus' work serves as a call to artists and writers to transcend the mundane and base desires of their time to create works that are sublime and spiritually ennobling, thereby contributing to the betterment of humanity.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L07.24 - Sidney's Apology for Poetry.txt
1. **Sidney's Defense of Poetry**: Philip Sidney, in his "Apology for Poetry," defends poetry against Plato's criticism that poets corrupt the morals of society by their portrayal of gods committing immoral acts. Plato believed such stories should not be taught to guardians who would rule his ideal state.

2. **Imitation of Truth**: Sidney argues that poets like Homer were merely imitating existing stories about the gods, which were already present in society. He suggests that these stories, despite their scandalous nature, contained elements that prefigured Christian truths.

3. **St. Paul's Endorsement of Poetry**: Sidney points to St. Paul in Acts 17, who, in addressing the Athenians and their idolatry, quotes pagan poets as having come close to foreseeing the truths of Christ. This indicates that poetry can contain profound truths and can even pave the way for understanding Christian doctrine.

4. **Virgil and Christianity**: Sidney notes that Virgil, a poet who lived just before Christ, is often seen as a proto-Christian due to themes in his work "The Aeneid" that resonate with Christian virtues. This shows that poetry can reflect divine truths, even outside of Christianity.

5. **Plato's View on Poets**: Sidney reminds us of Plato's belief that poets speak by divine inspiration, suggesting that their work might have intrinsic value worth considering.

6. **The Fate of Poet Haters**: With a touch of wit, Sidney concludes his essay by cursing those who despise poetry, wishing them to never find love through a lack of sonnets and to be forgotten without an epitaph—highlighting the importance of poetry in human expression and memory.

7. **Neoclassical Wit**: The entire essay demonstrates the neoclassical tendency to blend serious philosophical argument with wit and humor, which is characteristic of the period's literature.

In our next lecture, we will explore further the theories of John Dryden and Alexander Pope, two other significant figures in the neoclassical movement who contributed to the defense and refinement of poetry and its role in society.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L08.24 - Dryden, Pope, and Decorum.txt
1. **Neoclassicism in Art and Nature**: Neoclassicists believe that art should imitate nature, not just in a superficial sense but in a deeper, more principled way—by following the principles of decorum found within it. This is an extension of the idea that nature is organized and that its organization can be understood and replicated by humans.

2. **Alexander Pope's Essay on Criticism**: Pope argues that the rules of art are not invented but discovered, and that these rules are embodied in nature. He suggests that nature is a touchstone for art because it is unchanging, providing a stable measure against which art can be evaluated.

3. **The Great Chain of Being**: Pope's essay on man introduces the concept of the great chain of being, which posits a hierarchical structure in the universe where every entity has its proper place. This chain reflects an ordered worldview that was prevalent during the time and is a key component of the neoclassical philosophy.

4. **Humanity's Place**: According to neoclassicism, humans must accept their place within this hierarchy and not strive to be something higher (like an angel) or lower (like a beast). This acceptance of one's proper place is seen as a cornerstone of human decency and rationality.

5. **Decorum in Poetry**: Pope emphasizes that poets should follow decorum, with restraint being crucial to the art form. While occasional deviations for dramatic effect are accepted, they should not become the norm. This approach contrasts with romantic art, which often breaks away from formal constraints.

6. **The Role of Restraint**: Pope contends that it is precisely the adherence to decorum and restraint that defines both our humanity and our role as poets. The ability to follow rules and maintain form is what distinguishes neoclassical art from other forms, including romanticism.

7. **Upcoming Lecture**: The next lecture will explore the philosophical roots of Romanticism, which emerged as a reaction against the rigid structure and order of neoclassicism. It will contrast the neoclassical emphasis on decorum with the romantic celebration of emotion, nature, and individual expression.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L09.24 - Burke on the Sublime and Beautiful.txt
1. Edmund Burke's theory of the sublime and the beautiful is rooted in an epistemological approach, focusing on the perception and mental experience rather than intrinsic qualities of objects.
   
2. The sublime is characterized by feelings of terror that evoke a state of astonishment and a sense of being overwhelmed, leading to a temporary suspension of thought and emotion. This experience is not limited to vision or hearing but can be triggered through taste, smell, and touch as well.

3. Importantly, the sublime must provoke an intense emotional response without actual danger; it's about the experience of being in the presence of something vast, powerful, and possibly dangerous, without being in real harm's way.

4. The beautiful, on the other hand, elicits sentiments of tenderness and affection. It is experienced as softening or relaxing of the body, often associated with domesticity rather than the martial connotations of the sublime.

5. Beauty, like the sublime, can be perceived through all five senses, encompassing beautiful sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile experiences.

6. Burke's "A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful" is a comprehensive work that delves into the nuances of both concepts, providing an exhaustive analysis of what each entails.

7. For those interested in exploring these ideas further, reading Burke's original text is highly recommended to appreciate the full scope of his arguments and insights into aesthetics.

8. In the next lecture, we will explore how Immanuel Kant refines and expands upon Burke's ideas, particularly in his "Critique of Judgment," where he offers a more systematic understanding of the aesthetic experience.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L10.24 - Kant's Critique of Judgment.txt
1. **The Sublime and Displeasure/Pleasure**: In Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Judgment," he discusses the experience of the sublime, which initially causes a sense of displeasure due to a mental disharmony between the imagination and reason when faced with objects that are overwhelming in size or power.

2. **The Turn from Displeasure to Pleasure**: Kant argues that this initial displeasure transforms into a profound pleasure because it reveals a fundamental truth about our nature as beings endowed with both sensibility and reason.

3. **Supremacy of Reason**: The moment of the sublime experience demonstrates that reason is supreme over sensation, indicating that we are more than just physical beings subject to nature; we are also rational and spiritual entities capable of transcending the limitations of our physical senses.

4. **The Kantian Catharsis**: This revelation—that there is something within us greater than nature—can be seen as a catharsis, a moment of clarity that suggests our purpose extends beyond the natural world. It is a dazzling insight into our higher nature and potential.

5. **The Enlightenment Context**: Although Kant emphasizes reason over imagination, he lays the groundwork for romanticism by suggesting that our highest emotional experiences come from recognizing our rational capacity. This places him firmly within the Age of Reason, even as his ideas pave the way for later romantic thinkers who will elevate imagination above judgment.

6. **Transition to Romanticism**: In subsequent lectures, we will explore how later theorists like Schiller and Hegel will take Kant's ideas and further develop them within the context of romanticism, shifting the balance towards valuing imagination and synthesis more highly.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L11.24 - Schiller on Aesthetics.txt
1. **Schiller's Aesthetic Theory**: Schiller builds upon Kant's critical philosophy but emphasizes the unity of sensibility and understanding, aiming to overcome the disunity between the empirical and the rational. He argues that beauty and art are key to achieving this unity because they reconcile our feelings with our thoughts, allowing us to rise above nature and our fears without abandoning the physical world.

2. **Overcoming Fear**: Schiller uses the example of a child overcoming fear of a shadow through aesthetics. This demonstrates how art can help us handle and transcend our deepest fears by transforming potential threats into an aesthetic form, which is safe to engage with.

3. **Education and Art**: Schiller believes that education in beauty and art is more effective than philosophy in healing the disunity within human beings and in forming ideal citizens for an ideal republic because it fosters a harmonious integration of body and soul.

4. **The Role of Poetry**: According to Schiller, poetry is the art form most capable of achieving this synthesis. It is through the experience of beauty and engagement with poetry that we can recover the original naive unity of human existence that has been lost.

5. **Value of Beauty**: In line with C.S. Lewis's thoughts on friendship, Schiller suggests that while beauty may not have direct survival value, it gives intrinsic value to life itself. It is what makes living worthwhile.

6. **Transition to Hegel**: In the next lecture, we will explore how Hegel continues the romanticization of Kant's ideas by further integrating the aesthetic into a comprehensive worldview, leading us to understand history and culture as expressions of the Absolute Idea or Spirit (Geist).

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L12.24 - Hegel and the Journey of the Idea.txt
1. **Dialectic in Hegel vs. Marx**: Karl Marx adapted the dialectical method from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, but their uses of dialectics are fundamentally different. Hegel's dialectic is idealistic and deals with the progression of ideas or logic within a transcendent realm, whereas Marx's dialectic is materialist and focused on the historical and economic forces that shape societies.

2. **Marx's Materialism**: Unlike Hegel, who saw history as a conflict of ideas moving towards greater freedom, Marx believed that the progression of history was driven by the material conditions of human existence. He was an atheist who rejected spiritual explanations for historical events and instead emphasized economic factors.

3. **Eschatology in Both Bible and Marx**: Marx's vision of a future classless society is similar to the Christian eschatological vision of the New Jerusalem. However, while the Bible attributes this progression to divine intervention, Marx attributed it to the natural development of human societies under material conditions.

4. **Critique of Blaming Hegel for Marxism**: It's a misunderstanding to blame Hegel for the ideas that led to Marxism, as Hegel's philosophy was about the progression of ideas and freedom, while Marx's was about historical determinism. Similarly, blaming Richard Wagner for Adolf Hitler's actions is unfair because Wagner's work, particularly "Der Ring des Nibelungen," critiques the very power dynamics that Hitler embraced.

5. **Platonic vs. Hegelian Dialectic**: The Platonic dialectic involves questioning and uncovering truth through dialogue, aiming to strip away illusions and reach an understanding of reality. In contrast, the Hegelian dialectic involves the resolution of opposites into a higher synthesis, moving towards a complete system or reality.

6. **Closing Remarks**: The lecturer hopes the listener has understood the complex relationship between Hegel's and Marx's use of the dialectical method. In the next lecture, the discussion will shift to British Romantic poetry, starting with "Lyrical Ballads" by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

7. **Call to Action**: For more information or to order additional courses, listeners can call 1-800-TEACH-1-2 or visit www.teachco.com. The lecturer thanks the listener for their attention and hopes they find these lectures enlightening.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L13.24 - Wordsworth, Coleridge, and British Romanticism.txt
1. **Romanticism vs. Solipsism**: The romantic belief that the world is a reflection of the poet's perceptions can dangerously lead to solipsism, which is the idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist. This perspective can be problematic as it suggests the external world might not truly exist outside our perception.

2. **Christian Science**: Christian Science, founded by Mary Baker Eddy, posits that disease and sin are manifestations of bad perception. The real doctrine holds that physical ailments are not real but are instead psychological issues that can be resolved through spiritual understanding and mental discipline.

3. **Poetry as Self-Expression**: In the new epistemology of literary theory, poetry is seen as an expression of the individual poet's unique perceptions rather than as an imitation of nature or adherence to strict rules of decorum. This shift places emphasis on the poet's inner world and personal experiences.

4. **Subject Matter**: Lyrical Ballads by Wordsworth and Coleridge broke from 18th-century neoclassical norms by considering previously unserious subjects—like those of rustic or simple characters—as worthy of tragic hypms. This challenged the decorum that dictated what could be considered serious subject matter in poetry.

5. **Real vs. Ideal**: Romanticism often blurred the lines between the real and the ideal, the supernatural and the natural, which was a departure from the strict separation of these elements in neoclassical literature.

6. **Innocence and Wonder**: The romantics privileged the fresh and innocent perspective of children over the refined urbanity of 18th-century court life. They sought to rediscover the world with a sense of wonder, rejecting the artificial and unnatural elements of their predecessors' works.

7. **Next Steps**: In the following lecture, we will delve into Wordsworth's preface to "Lyrical Ballads," which further explains these shifts in poetic sensibility and sets out the manifesto of romantic poetry.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L14.24 - Mr. Wordsworth's Preface.txt
1. **Egotistical Sublime**: This concept, as discussed by Coleridge, refers to a mode of experience where the individual mind is so powerful and pervasive that it absorbs everything into its own perception. It's not about being arrogant or selfish, but rather about the intensity with which an individual experiences and colors their surroundings through their own perspective. In Wordsworth's poetry, this is evident as he often writes from his own point of view, allowing readers to see the world through his eyes.

2. **Wordsworth's Perspective**: Wordsworth's personality and approach to poetry are characterized by the egotistical sublime. He draws all things into himself and interprets them through his own perceptions, which is why readers often feel a deep connection with him and his experiences.

3. **Beyond Empathy**: Coleridge noted that even in his attempts to empathize with others, Wordsworth remained an observer from the outside, not fully merging with the subjects of his poetry. This observation highlights a key difference between Wordsworth's and Coleridge's approaches to poetry and human experience.

4. **Negative Capability**: Keats' concept of negative capability is the opposite of the egotistical sublime. It involves an acceptance of not understanding everything, coexisting with uncertainties, and being comfortable in this state of mystery or ambiguity. This approach allows the poet to move beyond self-consciousness and enter a realm where they can experience the world more directly without being overwhelmed by their own perceptions.

5. **Romantic Irony**: The romantic belief that things are as they are perceived often leads to over self-consciousness, which is an ironic outcome for a movement that sought direct, unmediated experiences of the world. This self-reflexive consciousness can interfere with the capacity to simply feel and experience life.

6. **Anti-Romantic Turn**: In Unit 5, we will explore how some poets and critics reacted against the romantic struggle between conscious and unconscious, and sought a more impersonal and objective approach to poetry. Keats' idea of negative capability would influence this shift away from the introspective self-consciousness characteristic of much Romantic literature.

7. **Future Discussions**: We will delve deeper into another aspect of Keats's negative capability in Lecture 16, and in the next lecture (Lecture 15), we will examine Coleridge's "Biographia Literaria," which is a significant work exploring literary theory and criticism.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L15.24 - Coleridge - Transcendental Philosopher.txt
1. **Allegory vs. Symbol**: John Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" is an allegory where characters and events can be substituted with other symbols without altering the story's meaning. In contrast, a symbol like the Lord's Supper in Catholicism (where wine and bread are seen as the blood and body of Christ) is a powerful example of a mystical reciprocal relationship between the physical and the divine, where the concrete image embodies an abstract idea and vice versa.

2. **Coleridge's View on Symbol**: Samuel Taylor Coleridge privileges symbol over allegory because of their ability to fuse specific and general, temporal and eternal, concrete and universal aspects in a nearly mystical way, as seen in the incarnation of Christ.

3. **Concrete Universals**: These are the highest forms of organic symbols and holes, which fully realize a universal idea in a concrete form within the microcosm of the artwork. Coleridge's concept is influenced by Aristotle and Kant, and it aims for a full fusion of abstract non-physical ideas with specific physical images.

4. **Christian Metaphor**: Coleridge's aesthetic theory is deeply intertwined with his Christian beliefs, particularly the idea of the incarnation, which he sees as a model for the concrete universal in art.

5. **Mystical Reciprocal Relationship**: The concrete universal achieves a timeless relationship where the universal descends and dwells within the concrete image while the concrete simultaneously moves up and loses itself in the universal, much like the dual complementary journey of the natural philosopher and transcendental philosopher meeting at their metaphysical union.

6. **Next Lecture**: The next lecture will conclude British Romanticism by examining Percy Bischelli's "Great Defense of Poetry," which further explores the value and impact of poetry as an embodiment of these ideals.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L16.24 - Shelley's Defense of Poetry.txt
1. Percy Bysshe Shelley's "A Defence of Poetry" is a seminal work that provides a high view of poetry, elevating it to a central role in society and human development. It's an extension of the ideas presented by previous theorists like Plato, Wordsworth, and Sydney, but it takes these concepts to new levels.

2. Shelley argues that poetry is a reflection of the divine within us, a creative force that gives rise to all aspects of human culture: language, art, architecture, religion, and law. He sees poets as divine figures who are the true legislators of society.

3. According to Shelley, poetry is an essential tool for understanding the nature of reality because it connects our imagination with nature and thus allows us to perceive truth. Poetry synthesizes factual knowledge with human experience, giving it meaning and significance.

4. Poets are considered by Shelley as the greatest inventors and innovators in history, capable of rejuvenating language, thought, perception, and aspiration. They have the power to influence society and change the world by inspiring and guiding humanity.

5. In his view, poetry is a transformative force that continuously purges and renews our language, thoughts, and dreams, keeping them fresh and alive. It is through poetry that humanity can reach its highest potential and understand its deepest truths.

6. Shelley concludes by stating that poets are the "unacknowledged legislators of the world," emphasizing their profound influence on society and culture, even if this role often goes unrecognized.

7. In the next lecture, we will explore Objective Theory with Matthew Arnold and T.S. Eliot, who offer different perspectives on poetry and its role in society and human understanding.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L1724-~1.txt
1. **Objective Correlative**: This is a concept introduced by T.S. Eliot, which refers to an external object, situation, or chain of events that correlates with an internal emotional experience, thus providing a concrete representation of that emotion in the artwork.

2. **Eliot's Definition**: Eliot explains this idea in his essay "Hamlet and His Problems," where he defines it as the means by which the 'emotion' of the poem finds its expression in some objective form, whether it be a phase in a lover's affair or the flight from Wien of an archduke with a brown mustache directed against a white one.

3. **Artistic Fusion**: The artistic process involves fusing internal emotions with external objects or situations to create a tangible representation that can be experienced by the audience. This fusion is central to the creation and understanding of poetry and other art forms.

4. **The Poet's Role**: In Eliot's view, the poet acts as the medium where this fusion occurs—the poet is both the catalyst and the site for this confluence of internal and external elements.

5. **Example from Homer's Iliad**: The wrath of Achilles, a central theme in the Iliad, is exemplified through an objective correlative when Achilles lets out a terrifying battle scream that causes several Trojans to kill themselves. This scream serves as a physical manifestation of his rage, demonstrating how an emotion can be made tangible and visible to the reader or audience.

6. **The Concept's Reception**: Eliot likely anticipated the ongoing discussion and analysis of the objective correlative, embracing the concept of negative capability by allowing readers to interpret and explore its meaning over time.

7. **Future Lecture**: The next lecture will move on to discuss the American School of New Criticism, which further explores the idea of finding deeper meanings within literature through close reading and analysis.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L18.24 - The Status of Poetry - I.A. Richards and John Crowe.txt
1. **The World's Body**: In this essay from 1941, John Crow Ransom argues that poetry should be appreciated as a form of democratic expression, drawing a parallel between the functioning of a poem and the workings of a democracy.

2. **Democratic State of Poetry**: According to Ransom, a poem is akin to a democratic state in that it allows for individuality and personal expression, unlike totalitarian regimes where citizens are assigned fixed roles and functions.

3. **Freedom within a Poem**: In a poem, each detail (what Ransom calls the "structure") can function independently, contributing to the poem's meaning in a unique and individual way. This is in contrast to prose, which demands a one-to-one correspondence between words and fixed meanings.

4. **Criticism as Hedonism**: The true critic, in Ransom's view, should approach poetry with a sense of enjoyment, savoring its richness and complexity like a gourmand enjoying fine cuisine.

5. **Political Implications**: Ransom's essay is situated within the context of 1941, a time when totalitarianism was on the rise. His championing of poetry as democratic and free-expression can be seen as a political statement in favor of freedom and against the constraints imposed by authoritarian regimes.

6. **Respect for Autonomy**: Ransom emphasizes that critics should respect the autonomy of a poem's texture, avoiding the imposition of a strict, regimented core of meaning. This approach is seen as akin to respecting individual rights and freedoms within a society.

7. **New Criticism's Mission**: The New Critics, of whom Ransom was a leading figure, were advocating for a form of literary criticism that valued the autonomy of the text and emphasized the intrinsic values of a work, much like the philosophical advocacy for freedom and self-determination during this period.

In the next lecture, we will explore these ideas further by examining the contributions of two significant New Critics: Allen Tate and Cleanth Brooks.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L1924-~1.txt
1. **New Criticism Overview**: New Criticism emerged in the early 20th century as a literary movement that emphasized the self-contained nature of literature, focusing on the text itself rather than external factors like the author's intent or historical context. It was democratic and public in its approach to reading and interpreting literature.

2. **Key Principles**: The new critics believed in the aesthetic integrity of a work of literature, which should be understood as an independent object of appreciation. They valued ambiguity, paradox, irony, and complexity within the text itself. Their readings were close and detailed.

3. **Influence on Education**: New Criticism significantly influenced education by introducing creative writing classes, making the study and creation of literature more accessible to the public, rather than an exclusive pursuit of the elite.

4. **Democratic Ideals**: The movement was democratic in its approach, aiming to democratize literary criticism and creativity, allowing for a wider range of voices and interpretations.

5. **Relationship with Postmodernism**: While New Criticism opened doors to broader participation in literature and creative expression, postmodernism has paradoxically created a divide between academic theory and the public, making highbrow critical discourse less accessible.

6. **Irony and Contradictions**: The new critics would engage with their audience, explaining the ironies and complexities of modern art or literature, rather than dismissing laypeople's inability to understand as inherently incapable.

7. **Teaching Company Philosophy**: The teaching company model, exemplified by Khan Academy, aligns with the new critical ethos by making education accessible and empowering students to learn independently.

8. **Future Discussion**: In the next lecture, we will explore the archetypal theories of Northrop Frye, another significant figure in literary theory who expanded upon the ideas of New Criticism with a more comprehensive approach to understanding literature through mythic and symbolic patterns.

1. **I. A. Richards and the Archetypal Approach**:
   - I.A. Richards, along with his son, Cecil, developed a method of reading poems in their entirety, emphasizing that each poem is part of a larger literary universe.
   - This approach suggests that poets often contribute to this universe without being aware of it, and it is the critic's role to reveal these connections.

2. **Matthew Arnold and the Study of Poetry**:
   - Matthew Arnold viewed poetry as a critique of life, providing a standard against which we can measure our own lives.
   - Arnold believed that poetry could be moral and instructive, offering insight into human nature.

3. **T.S. Eliot and the Historical Context**:
   - T.S. Eliot's approach to poetry emphasized its historical context and the need for the poet to be aware of tradition.
   - Eliot believed that poets should acknowledge their debts to predecessors and that the meaning of a poem could evolve over time.

4. **F.R. Leavis and the Social Role of Poetry**:
   - F.R. Leavis argued that poetry serves a social function by shaping the moral and spiritual sensibilities of society.
   - He emphasized the importance of evaluating poems based on their quality and their contribution to this shaping role.

5. **Cleanth and Mary McCarthy and the Archetypal Approach**:
   - The McCarthys extended I.A. Richards' archetypal approach, which posits that all great poems are part of a self-contained literary universe.
   - They believed that this universe is transcendent and that the critic's role is to reveal its hidden center through an apocalyptic process.

6. **Northrop Frye and the Literary Universe**:
   - Northrop Frye saw poetry as part of a larger, self-contained literary universe with a controlling factor that transcends history and nature.
   - He believed in the absolute transcendent meaning of poetry, similar to the Kantian idea of aesthetic purity above natural forces.
   - Frye's approach represents one of the last strongholds of faith in poetry's ability to rise above its historical and natural contexts.

7. **Transition to Modern and Postmodern Theory**:
   - As we move forward, we will explore how modern and postmodern theories challenge or problematize the notion of an absolute transcendent meaning in poetry.
   - These theories often reject the idea that poetry can rise above its historical and natural contexts, focusing instead on the complexities and contingencies within those contexts.

In summary, this unit outlined the approaches of several key literary critics from the early 20th century up to Northrop Frye, each contributing to our understanding of poetry's role in society and its relationship to history and nature. The next unit will introduce more contemporary perspectives that question or redefine these traditional views.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L21.24 - Origins of Modernism.txt
1. Friedrich Nietzsche's contributions to art and philosophy are significant, especially in challenging traditional notions of truth and meaning.
2. Nietzsche's early work, such as "The Birth of Tragedy," focuses on the tension between the Apollonian (order, reason) and the Dionysian (chaos, instinct), but leans more towards valuing the Dionysian experience.
3. However, Nietzsche's later work, particularly in "Truth and Falsity in an Ultramoral Sense," presents a more radical perspective that is truly modernist. He argues that absolute truth, beauty, and even God are human constructs that we have forgotten we created.
4. Nietzsche's concept of the "death of God" signifies that traditional religious and metaphysical frameworks no longer hold sway over human understanding and behavior.
5. In the absence of absolute truth or meaning, Nietzsche posits the will to power as a fundamental driving force behind human actions and creations.
6. The next lecture will delve into structuralism, another influential school of modernist thought that sought to understand and analyze human cultures and art through a focus on underlying structures and patterns rather than surface phenomena or absolute truths.

1. **Discursive Formations**: According to Foucault, discourses are not just constraints or frameworks that limit what can be said; they are productive and formative, creating knowledge, practices, and even realities within a society. They are systems of knowledge and power that shape our understanding of the world and ourselves.

2. **Role of Discourse**: Discourses tell us what to believe, what to create, and what to do, influencing both individual behavior and societal norms. They are not merely negative, prohibiting certain actions or thoughts, but also positive, enabling and guiding social practices.

3. **Examples of Discourses**: Foucault's theories can be applied to various social phenomena, such as the American democratic discourse that emphasizes the authority of the people's will, and the medieval medical discourse that labeled female herbalists as witches, threatening the male-dominated practice of medicine.

4. **Foucault as a Critic**: Foucault's role is to uncover and analyze the complex web of power and knowledge that constitutes our social reality, revealing the often invisible mechanisms by which discourses exert their influence. He does not aim to overthrow these discourses but to make society aware of them so that individuals can recognize how they are shaped and influenced by them.

5. **Truth and Ideology**: For Foucault, absolute truth is just one possible way of organizing knowledge and reality among many others. He argues that our understanding of truth is deeply intertwined with power relations and societal norms, and thus it is not the ultimate arbiter of what is real or true.

6. **Implications for Critique**: Foucault's approach to critique involves exposing how discourses function and change over time, rather than seeking a definitive or absolute truth. This perspective challenges the idea that there is one objective truth, suggesting instead that multiple discourses can structure reality differently.

In the next lecture, we will delve into post-modernism, which builds upon and sometimes critiques these modernist ideas about discourse, truth, and knowledge.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L23.24 - Jacques Derrida on Deconstruction.txt
1. **Positive Affirmation**: Jacques Derrida's concept of deconstruction is not just a critical tool but also has a positive aspect that celebrates the free play of meaning and the absence of fixed truths or origins, which he sees as liberating. This is similar to Nietzsche's idea of the joyous affirmation of the world as it is.

2. **Freedom from Boundaries**: Deconstruction sets us free from being bound by fixed truths, origins, or any authoritative meanings. It also frees us from guilt associated with the absence of meaning, encouraging an acceptance and embrace of the world in its complexity and ambiguity.

3. **Existentialist Influence**: Derrida's philosophy resonates with existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre who argue that the lack of a higher plan or purpose makes our choices even more vital, emphasizing human freedom and responsibility.

4. **Deconstructive Reading of Oedipus Rex**: In Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, when Oedipus and Jocasta believe they have escaped their fate, it can be interpreted either as a moment of liberation (deconstructive reading) or as a terrifying realization of chaos (traditionalist reading). Derrida would likely see this as a positive moment of freedom, emphasizing the potential for human agency in a world where everything is not predetermined.

5. **Comparison with C.S. Lewis**: While both Derrida and C.S. Lewis recognize the shadowlands or the absence of a definitive meaning in the present, Derrida finds this to be a good state because it allows for human freedom, whereas Lewis sees it as a temporary condition that is ultimately reconciled with divine order in an afterlife.

In the next and final lecture, we will explore the different strands of postmodern theory and their implications for understanding culture, society, and the world.

Checking From Plato to Postmodernism.- ... Role of the Author - Louis Markos/L24.24 - Varieties of Post-modernism.txt
1. **Essentialism vs. Anti-Essentialism**: In the context of gender, anti-essentialists argue against the idea that there are inherent biological differences between men and women. They believe that societal constructs shape gender roles rather than innate differences. This perspective is reflected in the preference for using the term "gender" over "sex."

2. **Postmodernism and the Concept of 'Text'**: Postmodernists extend this anti-essentialist view to texts, considering all forms of writing as 'texts' without hierarchical value. They reject the idea that certain texts are inherently more valuable or aesthetically superior (the canon) because they believe all texts are culturally produced and have no separate aesthetic existence on their own.

3. **Impact on Literary Study**: Postmodernism has led to a reevaluation of the literary canon, suggesting that what we consider the most important or beautiful works of literature are simply products of historical and cultural contingencies rather than inherently superior art forms.

4. **Irony in Postmodern Stance**: The postmodern stance, which questions the existence of a timeless truth or beauty in literature, is paradoxically presented as a definitive viewpoint within literary theory, illustrating its own principles by becoming part of the academic canon it challenges.

5. **Invitation for Engagement**: The lecturer encourages listeners to consider the impact of literary theory on their understanding of literature and the world. He invites those interested to visit Houston Baptist University or call The Teaching Company for more information on their courses.

6. **Conclusion**: The lecturer emphasizes that the study of literary theory is not confined to academia; it affects our perceptions of ourselves, our world, and even our beliefs about God. He concludes by thanking the audience for their attention and engagement with the series on literary theory.
