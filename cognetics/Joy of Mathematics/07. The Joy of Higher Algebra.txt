Well, in this lecture we're going to see more magical applications from the joy of
algebra. We're going to see how we can apply the foil technique that we just learned to see how
to mentally square numbers and multiply numbers that are close together. We're going to see how
to solve quadratic equations using the infamous quadratic formula and we're going to discuss
equations of higher degree, third degree and so on. But let's begin by looking at the last
equation that we had at the end of our last lecture, namely x plus y times x minus y equals x
squared minus y squared. Now you might look at that and say okay that's nice but so what? What
can that do for me? Alright, let me show you something that I think you'll enjoy. I'm going to
teach you a way of squaring numbers in your head that you'll be able to do these problems faster
than you ever thought before. Now if you remember in a previous lecture I showed you how to square
numbers that end in 5. That was in the joy of numbers. Remember how that went? Like to square
a number like 65. We said well we know the answer ends in 25 and how does it begin? It begins by
taking 6 times 7. 6 times 7 is 42 and there's our answer, 42, 25. I know you thought that was
pretty easy. I'm going to show you a way of squaring any number, not just numbers that end
in 5 and in fact the trick that we learned earlier will turn out to be a special case of what I'm
going to show you now. Okay, let's start off with a easy small number. Let's square the number 13.
You might know the answer to that already. 13 squared is 169 but let me show you how you could
do that in your head if you didn't know it already. Now 13 is not such a bad number to multiply
but what number close to 13 is even easier? 10, right? Okay, so what we're going to do is we're
going to go down 3 to 10. Now whatever comes up must come down. If I go down 3 to 10 I then have to
go up the same distance to the number 16. Okay, so instead of doing 13 times 13 I'm going to do 10
times 16. Notice 10 and 16 add up to the same thing as 13 and 13 so it seems like a reasonable
first thing to do. 10 times 16 is what? 160, right? Okay, almost done. All we have to add to this is the
square of the number we went up and down. We went up and down 3. 3 squared is 9 and that's your answer.
160 plus 9 is 169. Let's do a few more examples so you get the hang of it.
Let's say you want it to square the number 18. Okay, now what's the nearest easy number?
20. So we go up 2 to 20. If I go up 2 to 20 I have to go down to what? 16, right? So we do 20
times 16. Now 2 times 16 is 32. So 20 times 16 is 320. Almost done. We've got 320 and what do we add
to this? 2 squared 4, right? We went up and down 2. 2 squared is 4. 320 plus 4 is 324 and that's the
answer. All right, let's do a problem that ends in 5 and you'll see it turns out to be the same
as what we did before. 35 squared, okay? So what's the nearest easy number? Well, that's sort of a
trick question. 30 and 40 are both easy and they're the same distance apart but that makes it super
easy, right? We go down 5 to 30. Up 5 to 40. 30 times 40 is 1200 and what do we add to that?
5 squared which is 25 to get 1225. 1225. Okay, now it's your turn. Try and do this one in your head,
okay? Try and square the number 99. Think of what you'll go up to. Think of what you'll go down to.
All right, and think of what you add to that. We went up to 100, down to the number 98. 98 times 100
is 9,800 and what do we add to that? 1, the square of 1. Did you get 9,801? Congratulations. Okay,
so why does this work? Now let me show you. It's all based on algebra. For, let's start with the
equation x squared equals x squared minus y squared plus y squared. It looks messier than it is,
right? I've got a minus y squared and a plus y squared. Those cancel. Those leave us with an x
squared. But remember, x squared minus y squared, we saw at the end of last lecture, that's equal to
x plus y times x minus y. So that says that the square of x is equal to x plus y times x minus y
plus y squared. Why does that matter? Well, when you're squaring a number, let's take the last
problem that you just did, like 99 squared, okay? 99 squared, that would be a mess to do on paper.
But if you let y equal 1, then you have 99 squared is equal to 99 plus 1
times 99 minus 1 plus 1 squared, right? So that's 100 times 98 plus 1. Multiply them together
and you get 9,801. Okay? We don't have to think about this algebra anymore. It's just
the justification for the method, or as I like to think of it, the secret behind the magic.
Now, if you like that one, let me show you something that's, I think, even more magical
based on similar algebra. All right. This works any time you're multiplying numbers that are close
together. And it's especially nice when those numbers are near a really easy number like 100.
So I'm going to start with that kind of problem. Say you want to multiply 106 times 109.
Okay? Quick question. How far is 106 from our easy number 100? Six away. How far is 109 away from
109 away? Okay. Now take 106 plus 9 or 109 plus 6. Either way, you'll always get the same answer.
What do you get? 106 plus 9 is 115. Now take 115 and multiply that by our easy number 100.
All right? 115 times 100 is 11,500. 6 times 9 is 54. Add those together and you get
11,554. Another way to say that, maybe even looking more magical, is 106 plus 9 is 115.
Write it down. 6 times 9 is 54. Write it down. Put them together. What do you have?
115,54. And believe it or not, that's the answer. Maybe that went too fast. Let's try another one.
How about 107 times 111? Okay. How far is 107 away from 107? Seven. How far is 111 away from
111? Now take 107 plus 11 or 111 plus 7. Either way, you get 118. Write it down.
Now 7 times 11 is 77. Write it down and you're done. 11877 is the answer. How on earth does that work?
Algebra. Here's, let's suppose I'm multiplying two numbers. I'll call them z plus a and z plus b.
Think of z as a number that has lots of zeros in it. That's why I chose z to remember it.
Okay. So z plus a times z plus b. When you multiply them using foil with different letters,
we have z squared plus z a plus z b plus a b. Okay. z squared plus z a plus z b plus a b.
Notice those first three terms in them all have z's in them. So I can factor a z out
to give me z times the quantity z plus a plus b. And then you're still left with that a b at the end.
Okay. That's the algebra behind it. Look at the last example. 100 plus 7 times 100 plus 11.
According to our algebra, when z is 100, that would be 100 times 100 plus 7 plus 11. Remember,
that's what I said, add 107 plus 11 or 111 plus 7. Either way, you get z plus a plus b.
Okay. That's when you added them together to get 118. 118 times 100 is 11,800.
And then what do you add to that? Seven times 11 is 77. When we were smooshing them together,
what we were really doing was 11,800 plus 77 to get 11,877. Let's do another example.
Let's say the problem was 94 times 91. These numbers are both close to 100,
but they're less than 100. So how far is 94 away from 100? Minus six. How far is 91 away from 100?
Minus nine. So now you do 94 minus nine or 91 minus six. You'll always get the same thing.
That's 85. Take 85 times 100 and we have 8,500. Almost done. What do we add to that? We add
negative six times negative nine, which is positive 54. So there's our answer. 8,500 plus 54 is 85,54.
All right. What if one of the numbers was above 100 and one of them was below 100?
Let's say 97 times 106. So 97 is three below 100. 106 is six above 100. How do we start?
We take 97 plus six. That's 103. Multiply that by your easy number,
which is 100 to get 10,300. Now what we add to that is negative three times six,
which is to say we're subtracting 18 from that number. So 10,300 minus 18 is 10,282.
You can do these problems. They don't have to be close to 100. In fact, any numbers that are
close together will work nicely with this method. Here, let's bring the problem down a bit. If I
lost you in the last few minutes, here's a good time to come back. Let's try a simpler problem,
14 times 17. Now, one way that I like to think of these is, what do 14 and 17 add up to? They add
up to 31. What's the nearest easy number? 10. So what's the other number that I can add to 10 to
get 31? 21. So instead of doing 14 times 17, we're going to do 10 times 21. 10 times 21 is
210. Almost done. All we add to that is four times seven. Because we were four away from 10
and seven away from 10. 210 plus 28 is 238. And that's the answer. It takes a little bit of time
to get used to. Let's do one more problem here. Say 23 times 28. Those numbers add up to 51.
So my magic numbers will be 20 times 31. 23 plus 8 is 31. 20 times 31 is 620.
What do we add to that? Three times 8, which is 24. 620 plus 24 is 644. And that's the answer.
It's especially magical when the two numbers at the end add up to 10 because then the multiplication
becomes so easy, you almost don't even have to write down your zeros. 62 times 68. 6 is going to
turn into 62 plus 8 is 70. So we do 60 times 70 to get 4200. 4200. What do we add to that?
Two times 8, which is 16. So there's your answer. 4200 and 16. Remember earlier when I said about
squaring numbers at end in 5? That's the same thing that we're doing here. 65 squared. Now,
how far are we away from 60? We're five away. So 65 plus 5 is 70. So we do 60 times 70,
which is 4200, plus the square of 5, which is 25, to get 4200 and 25.
Okay. So I hope you've seen that there's some nice applications of foil that you could use
in your everyday life. But let's go on to something more advanced.
We're going to go to solving quadratic equations. But before I do, let's do one quick refresher
on solving linear equations. Okay. We'll do a couple of them really fast. For instance,
let's say you have the equation 9x minus 7 equals 47. Remember the golden rule of algebra? We add
7 to both sides and we get 9x equals 54. Now divide both sides by 9 and you have x equals 6.
Here's another linear equation. 5x plus 11 equals 2x plus 18. Subtract 11 from both sides,
we get and subtract 2x from both sides. After a while, you can do several steps at once, right?
Put all the x's on the left, all the numbers on the right, you have 3x equals 7.
Solving that, we get x equals 7 thirds. Okay. And you could always verify these
solutions. I recommend doing it when you start solving algebraic equations, right?
That is, in the first equation, when 9x minus 7 is 47, plug in x equals 6. Make sure you really
do get 47. In the second equation that we just did, 5x plus 11, that would be 35 thirds plus 11
is 68 thirds. 2x plus 18, that's 14 thirds plus 18, 14 thirds plus 54 thirds is 68 thirds.
Shoot, that still works. Okay. Now that we've gotten linear equations out of the way,
let's do a quadratic equation. Here's a typical quadratic equation, x squared plus 6x plus 8
equals 0. Now, I'm going to apply a technique that's called completing the square. The way that
works is, I look at x squared plus 6x plus 8. And because of the x squared plus 6x, I notice
that the quantity x plus 3 squared, that is x plus 3 times x plus 3,
soil would tell us is equal to x squared plus 6x plus 9. And I go, ooh, so close. Boy, if only
that were x squared plus 6x plus 9, I'd have a perfect square. I'd be able to solve that so much
easier. So let's apply the golden rule of algebra. Let's turn it into a perfect square by adding
1 to both sides. When I add 1 to both sides, I now have the equation x squared plus 6x plus 9
equals 1. And now I see x squared plus 6x plus 9 is the quantity x plus 3 squared. So x plus 3
squared is 1. Now, let me ask you a question. What number when squared gives you 1? There are
two answers to that, right? 1 or negative 1. So that says in order for there to be any hope of x
solving that equation, it must be the case that x plus 3 is equal to 1 or negative 1. And if x plus
3 is 1, that means that x is equal to negative 2. And if x plus 3 is negative 1, that means that x is
equal to negative 4. And so recapping, we started with the equation x squared plus 6x plus 8 is 0,
and we found out that it was necessarily true that x had to equal negative 2 or negative 4. Now,
especially when doing a problem of this type, I find it very helpful to verify your answer,
just to be sure. So let's see, if we plug in x equal negative 2, then when I square that,
add 6 times that add 8, what do we have? Let's see, negative 2 squared is 4 plus 6 times negative 2,
that's minus 12, plus 8, 4 minus 12, plus 8 is 0. If I plug in x equal negative 4, look,
negative 4 squared is 16, plus 6 times negative 4, that's minus 24, plus 8 is 0. So those answers
work and by the algebra above, they are the only solutions that will work. Now, the good news is
we don't have to go through this completing the square procedure every time we want to solve a
quadratic equation. Essentially, using the logic that we just went through, we can derive what's
known as the quadratic formula. So the quadratic formula says that any equation of the form
ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0 has the following solutions. And by the way, oftentimes,
I advocate not memorizing things in mathematics, but this is one of those equations that I really
feel you should memorize, you just have to burn this one in your brain, you don't want to go
through the derivation every time. So the solutions to that equation is x is equal to negative b
plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac divided by 2a. Okay, let's take a look at that.
Negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac over 2a. Okay, let's look
at the last equation that we had, x squared plus 6x plus 8 equals 0. Take a breath, x squared plus
6x plus 8 equals 0. It says the coefficient behind the x squared, that's a, is equal to 1.
The coefficient behind the x, that's b, is equal to 6. And the constant term, c, is equal to 8.
Plug that into the equation and it says that x is equal to negative 6 plus or minus the square root
of 6 squared minus 4 times 1 times 8 divided by 2 times 1. That is equal to negative 6 plus
or minus the square root of 36 minus 32 over 2. That is to say x is equal to negative 6 plus or minus
the square root of 4 over 2. That is to say x is equal to negative 6 plus or minus 2 over 2.
But that's saying that x is equal to negative 4 or x is equal to negative 2.
Takes a few steps the first time you do it, but with some practice it gets easier. Here's one more
example. Say we were solving 3x squared plus 4x minus 5 equals 0. Here a, b, and c are equal to 3,
4, and negative 5 respectively. So the quadratic formula says that x will equal negative 4
plus or minus the square root of 4 squared minus 4 times 3 times negative 5 over 2 times 3.
When you do the arithmetic, that's negative 4 plus or minus the square root of 76 divided by 6.
That's equal to negative 4 plus or minus 2 root 19 over 6, which simplifies to negative 2 plus or
minus root 19 over 3. I think you'll admit that's not an answer you just would have guessed. I won't
subject you to the verification of that, but that one also works. I should warn you, by the way,
when you solve a quadratic equation, what if you were to plug in, let's try the equation
x squared plus 1 equals 0. Now that one, before we go on any further, like x squared plus 1 equals
0, that means you're squaring a number, adding 1 to it, and getting 0. That's impossible. When you
square a number, you get something positive. How can squaring a number plus 1 give you 0? Well,
what does the quadratic formula say about that? So x squared plus 1 equals 0, a is 1, b is 0,
c is 1. When you plug that into the formula, you have x is equal to 0 plus or minus the square root
of negative 4 over 2. When you say the square root of negative 4, that's impossible. That's just as
impossible as solving x squared plus 1 equals 0. So that has no solutions. At least it has no
solutions that are real numbers. In a later lecture, we'll actually talk about things called
imaginary numbers, where there actually are solutions to that equation, and things like the
square root of negative 4, though imaginary, have real meaning. Okay, here's another application
of quadratics, one that doesn't look like something quadratic in the first place. We call these things
continued fractions. Bear with me on this for one minute. Suppose we look at the fraction
1 plus 1 over 1. Why would we want to write it that way? Well, 1 plus 1 over 1 is 2,
which you can write as 2 over 1. Let's do that one more time. Let's look at 1 plus 1 over 1 plus
1 over 1. That's 1 plus 1 over 2, which is three halves. Let's do that again. Let's look at 1 plus
1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1. Ah, what's that? That's 1 plus 1 over the last thing we saw,
which was three halves. So that's equal to 1 plus the reciprocal of three halves is two-thirds.
1 plus two-thirds is five-thirds. Where am I going with this? Well, if I'm looking at this
series of ones, we're getting the fractions 2 over 1, 3 over 2, 5 over 3. Let me dare do it
one more time. Let's do 1 plus 1 over the last messy thing we had. That's 1 plus 1 over 5-thirds,
but that's 1 plus 3-fifths, which is 8-fifths. Now, take a look at those fractions. We see 2 over 1,
3 over 2, 5 over 3, 8 over 5, 2, 3, 5, 8. Who do you appreciate? Fibonacci, of course. Now,
I claim that this is going to continue. That's why we call it continued fractions,
that this is going to continue to produce Fibonacci fractions. Why? Well, at the moment,
so imagine what we have is 1 plus 1 over some other messy term. And if that messy term reduces to,
say, the n-th Fibonacci number divided by the n minus first Fibonacci number,
then that simplifies to 1 plus Fn minus 1 over Fn. Now, I'm going to add 1 to that fraction.
How do you add fractions? We put them over a common denominator. You can't stop me from
replacing 1 as Fn divided by Fn. When we add those fractions together, we have Fn plus Fn
minus 1 over Fn. But what's the definition of Fn plus Fn minus 1? By definition, that's equal to
Fn plus 1, the n plus first Fibonacci number. In other words, once you have the ratio of Fibonacci
numbers and you do this process again, you can't help but get a new ratio of Fibonacci numbers.
So we're doomed to continue to get Fibonacci numbers forever. Now, what does this have to do
with quadratics? Okay, suppose I were to continue this process forever. Let's say I wanted to look
at 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1. What do you get? I don't know.
Let's call that number x, okay? And I'm going to solve for x. I'm going to solve for this ratio
of Fibonacci numbers. Now, this, by the way, is a brilliant, beautiful trick, all right? The first
time you see it, it's called a trick. The second time you see it, it's called a technique, okay?
1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 equals x. Do you agree that x is equal to 1 plus 1 over
what? It's that infinite mess again. 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over. In other words,
x is equal to 1 plus 1 over x, right? x is the bottom part of that equation. So if we want to
solve for x, all we have to do is solve the equation x equals 1 plus 1 over x. That doesn't
look like a quadratic equation now, but now let's do on to both sides by multiplying both sides by
the number x. When you do that, you get x squared equals x plus 1. Ah, x squared equals x plus 1.
I like to have my quadratic equations with a 0 on the right side. So let me subtract x
and subtract 1 from both sides. Now I have the equation x squared minus x minus 1 equals 0.
So the quadratic equation is easy to do as A, B, C. Here A equals 1, B equals negative 1, C equals
negative 1, and when you solve it, you get two solutions. Namely, x is equal to 1 plus or minus
the square root of 5 over 2. When you let x equal 1 plus the square root of 5 over 2,
we get our old friend, the golden ratio, 1.618. When you look at x equal 1 minus the square root
of 5 over 2, we get negative 0.618. And here's where it's helpful to verify your solutions,
right? One of these solutions is going to work, right? The answer has to be just one of those
numbers, which is the right answer. It's the positive one, right? The second term is negative,
negative 0.618. There's no way you can add a whole bunch of positive numbers like that
and wind up with something negative, and therefore that one can't be the solution.
The only possible solution is the one on the left. And incidentally, we have now proved we
fulfilled the promise of showing that the ratio of Fibonacci numbers in the long run gets closer
and closer and closer to the golden ratio. All right, so that's enough about solving
quadratic equations. This method had been known even by the ancient Greeks.
But what the ancient Greeks had not done was come up with a way of solving
equations in a higher variable, in a higher degree. Let's say a cubic equation. Is there a formula
to solve any cubic equation? Ax cubed plus bx squared plus cx plus d equals 0. The Greeks did not
know how to solve that. In fact, it was centuries later, over 1,000 years later, before mathematicians
had solved any problem that the ancient Greeks couldn't do. And this was that first problem.
This is the problem that was discovered by a mathematician and gambler, a rather shady past,
a fellow by the name of Cardano. He, through various means, discovered this formula for solving
the cubic. As you can see, it's a big mess. I don't even want to attempt to go through that one.
Okay, search went on for a formula to solve any quadratic equation. That is, something of the
form ax to the fourth plus bx cubed plus cx squared plus dx plus e equals 0. Is there a formula for
that? Yes, there is, but it's a mess. It was determined by an Italian mathematician named
Ferrari. I think they were so impressed with his solution they gave him a car, but don't quote me
on that. And so then the search went on for hundreds of years to try and find a solution to the
Quintic equation. That's an equation of fifth degree. And many prominent mathematicians attempted to
solve this problem. Lagrange tried to solve it. Euler tried to solve it. Descartes, Newton,
all of them tried to find a formula, even a messy one, for the Quintic equation.
They all failed. And it wasn't until a Norwegian mathematician named Abel, Niels Abel, actually
showed that, in fact, the solution to the Quintic equation was futile, that it was impossible to
find a single formula that used nothing more than adding and multiplying and taking roots of the
coefficients that you had, that would find a solution to that. So he actually proved that
that was impossible, which leads me to the following riddle. Why did Isaac Newton not prove that solving
the Quintic was impossible? And the answer was, he wasn't Abel.
