In this lecture, I'll talk about the joy of prime numbers. Prime numbers, as we'll
see, are the building blocks for all the integers around us. We'll restrict our attention in
this lecture to positive integers. So, let's start by asking a simple question. What are
the divisors of the number 12? Which numbers divide evenly into the number 12? Sometimes
we call divisors factors. The factors or divisors of 12 are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.
Similarly, the divisors of the number 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30. If we look at what those
lists have in common, we see they've got some divisors in common, namely 1, 2, 3 and 6. Our
divisors of both of those numbers, we say the greatest common divisor of those numbers is 6.
So, 6 is the largest number that appears on both of those lists, and so we say the greatest common
divisor is 6. The notation we use for that is GCD of 12 and 30 is 6. Now, there is a nice way for
calculating, figuring out the greatest common divisors without having to write out the lists very
long. For instance, suppose we wanted to find the greatest common divisor of, oh, two big numbers,
1, 323 and 896. Offhand, I don't know what the factors of those numbers are, and yet there's a
clever way to figure out what their greatest common divisor is. Here's the basic idea, very clever
idea. Any number that divides 1,323 and 896 has to divide 896, because I just said so, and has to
divide 1,323 minus 896. Do you agree? If I have a number that divides x and a number that divides y,
then that number has to divide x minus y, right? So, anything that divides 1,323 and 896 has to
divide their difference, 1,323 minus 896. By the way, how would you do that subtraction in your head?
I would do it by subtracting 900, then adding back 4 to get 427. And vice versa, any number that
divides 896 and 427 has to divide 896, because we just said so, and their sum, 896 plus 427, which is
1,323. So, in summary, what we've shown is that any number that divides our first two numbers, 1,323 and
896, will also divide the next two numbers, 896 and 427. In particular, the greatest of those numbers,
the largest of those common divisors, the GCD, has to be the same. That is, the GCD of 1,323 and 896 is equal to the
GCD of 896 and 427. Now, you're saying, well, so what? I don't know how to factor 427 either. Well, no problem,
but we've made the problem smaller. Instead of, we've replaced the large number, 1,323, with a smaller number,
427. This clever idea goes back to Euclid. Euclid was an ancient Greek who lived thousands of years ago. Of course, we don't
have any pictures of what Euclid looked like, but I have my own little drawing. Since Euclid is famous for his geometry, I've
drawn him with a circle and a triangle and a pie and an infinity. Just my idea of what Euclid ought to have looked
like. Next to that is another more common artist's portrayal of him, but we don't really know what he looked like.
And Euclid's idea, not only did he do geometry, he also did number theory. Euclid's algorithm says the following, that if I want to
find the greatest common divisor of n and m, here's what you do. You divide n by m. You get a quotient and a remainder. So let's
say n is equal to q times m plus r. Then Euclid says that the greatest common divisor of n and m will be the same as the
greatest common divisor of m and r. So let's look at some real numbers. For instance, if I want to find the greatest common divisor of
896 and 427. Now, 896 is equal to twice 427 plus 42. When you divide 427 into 896, you get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of
42. And what Euclid's algorithm tells you is that the greatest common divisor of 896 and 427 is the same as the greatest common divisor of
427 and 42. And since 42 goes into 427 10 times with a remainder of 7, we can simplify that GCD to get the greatest common divisor of
427 and 42 is the greatest common divisor of 42 and 7. And now these numbers are small enough. I see that 7 actually divides into 42. So the
biggest number that divides into 42 and 7 is 7 itself. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of the original two numbers, 1, 3, 2, 3 and 896, which was shown to be the
greatest common divisor of the next two numbers, 896 and 427, goes all the way down to 7. So 7 is the greatest common divisor of those two
numbers. And this is nice. We didn't actually have to know what the factors were to begin with. And yet we were still able to figure out what
their greatest common divisor is. Okay, let's talk about prime numbers now. Suppose I asked, what are the divisors of the number 13? You'd say, well, 1 and 13.
That's it. That's what makes 13 a prime number. A number is prime if it has exactly two divisors, namely one and itself. We say that a number is composite if it has three
or more divisors. Okay, so a number like 030 is 2 times 3 times 5. That's a composite number. Actually, 30 has more than three divisors. It has eight divisors, but we'll see that
later. How about the number 1? Is 1 prime or is the number 1 composite? The answer is neither. 1 is not a prime number. It's not prime because a prime has to have two
divisors, one and itself. And one only has one divisor, namely one. So it's not prime. It's not composite. If you insist on giving it a label and calling it something, we'll call that number a unit.
Okay, here are the prime numbers all the way up through 101 just so you can get a sense as to what they are. These are, as I said, the building blocks of all of the integers. And that's expressed in what's called the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic. So with a name like that, you know it has to be important. Fundamental theorem of arithmetic, sometimes called the unique factorization theorem, says that every number greater than one can be written as the product of primes in exactly one way.
So let's look at an example, say 5600. So if I said factor that number for me, well, you might say, well, 56 is 8 times 7. So 5600 is 8 times 7 times 10 times 10. That's a factorization, but it's not a prime factorization.
Let's break up these numbers until they can't be broken down any further. So 8 can be broken into prime factors 2 times 2 times 2. 7 is prime. We'll leave that as such. 10 is 2 times 5. 10 is 2 times 5. So we have a bunch of 2s, a couple of 5s, and a 7. All together, 5600 is 2 to the 5th times 5 squared times 7 to the first.
That is, it's prime factorization. You could throw in other primes there and raise them to zero power, like 3 to the 0 or 11 to the 0. That wouldn't change it. But still, if you ignore those zero exponents, this would be its unique prime factorization.
How many divisors does 5600 have? Well, in order for a number to be a divisor of 5600, the only prime factors that it would be allowed to have would be the numbers 2, 5, and 7. If it was a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 11 or something, there's no way it would divide into 5600.
Also, what's the largest power of 2 that would be allowed to be in my divisor? Well, the largest the power of 2 could be would be 5, because if it was 2 to a higher power, like 2 to the 6th or 7th power, then it wouldn't have any way of dividing into 5600.
In other words, any divisor of 5600 will have to be of the form 2 to the a times 5 to the b times 7 to the c, where a could be as little as 0 or as big as 5, b could be as little as 0 or as high as 2, c could be as little as 0 or as high as 1.
So, for example, if we let a equal 3, b equal 1, and c equal 0, then we're going to get the divisor 2 to the 3rd times 5 to the 1 times 7 to the 0. 8 times 5 times 1 is 40, and that would be a divisor. Suppose I chose all zeros.
Well, then I'd look at 2 to the 0, 5 to the 0, 7 to the 0, and that's 1 times 1 times 1, that would be the divisor 1.
So, the question I asked earlier was how many divisors does 5600 have? Well, it's going to be of the form 2 to the a, 5 to the b, 7 to the c, and how many choices do I have for a? Any number between 0 and 5?
There are 6 possibilities for a. Similarly, there are 3 possibilities for b and 2 possibilities for c, and therefore 5600 will have 6 times 3 times 2, 36 divisors.
Now, let's switch gears from greatest common divisors to the complementary concept of least common multiples. Let's take the numbers we looked at before 12 and 30.
Now, what are the multiples of 12? Well, those go on forever. We've got 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and so on and so on.
30 has multiples 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and so on. What is their least common multiple? In other words, what is the smallest number that appears on both lists?
Well, if you examine those lists, you'll see that 60 is the smallest number, the smallest multiple of 12 and 30. So, we say its least common multiple is 60, or the notation we use is LCM of 12 and 30 is 60.
Now, you may recall we saw that the GCD of 12 and 30 was 6, and if we multiply 6 times 60, we get 360. If we take our original numbers, 12 and 30, and multiply them together, we also get 360.
Is that a coincidence? No, it's not. And that's a consequence of the following theorem that says that for any numbers A and B, the greatest common divisor of A and B times the least common multiple of A and B is going to be nothing more and nothing less than the product of A and B.
Okay, let's talk about factorials. That's not a concept that we're going to use frequently throughout these courses. The number n factorial, which is n with an exclamation point after it, is defined to be n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 all the way down to the number 1.
So, for example, 3 factorial is 3 times 2 times 1, which is 6. 4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1, which is 24. 5 factorial is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1, which is 120, and so on.
Notice that n factorial can be defined recursively as n times n minus 1 factorial. Okay? How about 0 factorial? How should we define that? Well, I claim 0 factorial is 1, and one reason to do that is if I want that last equation I gave you to be true, I need it to be 1.
1 factorial is 1 times 0 factorial, right? And 1 factorial, we admit, is 1. 1 times 0 factorial. If I want that to be 1, then 0 factorial has to be defined as 1. And it kind of makes sense that if you're taking the product of nothing, then I claim that should be 1.
If you're taking the sum of nothing, that should be 0. You know, you're just sitting there waiting for something to add to it. Whereas, if you want the product of nothing, I claim that should be 1. You're just sitting there waiting for something to multiply by it.
Okay, 10 factorial, that's a bigger number, is 3,628,800, an enormous number. But that pales in comparison to something like 100 factorial, something huge. How huge? I'll tell you later. We're not ready to answer that just yet.
But I can answer this question. How many zeros will be at the end of the number 100 factorial? I can answer that question even though I don't know what the number is or how large the number is. I can tell you how many zeros will be at the end of it.
Alright, here's how to figure that out. The number 100 factorial is a number, so it has a prime factorization. It could be written in the form 2 to the A times 3 to the B times 5 to the C times 7 to the D. How many zeros are going to be at the end of that number?
Well, what creates a zero? And what is it that, how are zeros manufactured? They're manufactured by twos combining with fives, right? Every time we have a 2 being multiplied by a 5, that creates a 10, which creates a zero at the end of your number.
So 100 factorial, the only things that matter in terms of creating zeros are going to be the power of 2 and the power of 5. And whichever of those numbers is smaller, A or C, that's going to be the number of zeros, because those two and fives will pair up to create zeros.
Well, what are there going to be more of? Powers of 2 or powers of 5? There are going to be more powers of 2 when we look at 100 factorial. So the smaller exponent, the one we're interested in, is the power of 5, that's the exponent C.
So, the number of zeros at the end of 100 factorial is just going to be this exponent C. Now, how do we figure out the number of fives in the factorization of 100 factorial?
Well, if we look at all the numbers 1 through 100, we could focus our attention on the multiples of 5. What are those multiples of 5? We've got 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. How many multiples of 5 up through 100? 20 of them.
So those are each going to contribute a factor of 5 to the prime factorization. Are we done? Almost, but not quite. There's one thing we forgot. Some of those multiples of 5 have more than one factor of 5 in it, namely 25, 50, 75, and 100.
Those are each going to contribute an extra factor of 5. So the total number, the total contribution to fives to 100 factorial is going to be 20 plus 4, which is 24. Let's see if you understand this. Let's try 200 factorial.
200 factorial, how many multiples of 5 are there going to be? 40 of them. Each of them contributes a 5 to the 100 factorial. But some of them contribute an extra factor of 5, namely all those multiples of 25. How many multiples of 25 are there up through 200?
There are 8 of them. Are we done? Almost. There's one more number. There's one holdout, 125, which is 5 cubed, 5 times 5 times 5, which contributes even one more factor of 5. So the total number of zeroes at the end of 200 factorial will be 49.
If we get back to that 100 factorial number, we see, there it is, an enormous number, 9.3 times 10 to the 157th. And if you don't trust me, you can actually count the number of zeroes at the end of that, and we see we have exactly 24 of them as promised.
Let's take a look at the prime numbers one more time. Here they are. Here are the prime numbers up through 101. And if you count them, you'll see we have exactly 25 primes that are under 100. Here's another list for you. Between 100 and 100, there are 25 primes.
Between 101 and 200, there are 21 primes. Between 201 and 300, there are 16 primes. Those numbers seem to be going down. But 301 to 400 still has 16 primes. 401 to 500 has 17 primes. 501 to 600 has 14 primes. The upshot is, as numbers get bigger and bigger, it becomes a lot harder to be a prime number.
The primes become a little bit more scarce because there's more numbers beneath them that could possibly divide them. You might even wonder, maybe the primes die out completely at some point. Maybe there's a point after which every number is composite.
It seems possible, and yet we can prove that the number of primes, in fact, is infinite. There are infinitely many primes. This proof goes all the way back to Euclid, and it's as beautiful today as it was then. Here's how the proof goes.
Suppose there were not infinitely many primes. Suppose not. Then there would only be a finite number of primes. That would mean that there would have to be out there some prime number that was bigger than all of the other prime numbers.
Let's call that number P, big P, for the big prime. That would mean that every number out there would be divisible by either 2 or 3 or 5 or P. Every number would be divisible by some number between 2 and P.
Now I want you to look at the number P factorial. You thought P was big. Imagine how big P factorial is going to be. P factorial is going to be divisible by 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and everything up through P because it's equal to the product of all those things.
That's not going to give me my contradiction. Now look at the number P factorial plus 1. Can 2 divide into P factorial plus 1? No, because 2 goes into P factorial. If 2 goes into P factorial, it won't be able to divide into P factorial plus 1.
It will divide into P factorial plus 2 and P factorial plus 4, but it will skip over P factorial plus 1. How about 3? 3 goes into P factorial, so it can't divide P factorial plus 1. In fact, all the numbers between 2 and P will divide P factorial and therefore none of them will divide P factorial plus 1.
And that is a contradiction because it was supposed to be the case that all numbers were divisible by something between 2 and P. Here let me illustrate that argument a little bit better. Let's just suppose you thought that 5 was the biggest prime.
Of course it's not, but if you thought that 5 was the biggest prime, then Euclid's argument would say look at the number 5 factorial plus 1. 5 factorial plus 1. We know that that will not be divisible by 2, 3, 4 or 5 and therefore 5 could not have been the biggest prime.
Does that mean that 5 factorial plus 1 is prime? No. In fact, 5 factorial plus 1 is 121, which is 11 times 11. What we've done is we've encountered a bigger prime. 11 is bigger than 5. So 5 was not the biggest prime because P factorial plus 1 will either be prime or it will be divided by a prime that's bigger than P.
Now, because they're an infinite number of primes, you might then say well maybe every so often we have to encounter a prime. Is it possible that we can find 99 consecutive composite numbers? I claim the answer is yes.
I'm going to show you how to create on the spot 99 consecutive composite numbers. Not only that, the same argument will show that we can come up with a million consecutive composite numbers. Here's how the argument goes. I'm going to just give them to you right now.
Look at the number 100 factorial plus 2, 100 factorial plus 3, all the way up to 100 factorial plus 100. First of all, how many numbers have I just shown you there? 99 of them. Everything from 100 factorial plus 2 up to 100 factorial plus 100, those are 99 consecutive numbers.
I claim they're all composite. Why? Well, let's look at the number. We know that 100 factorial is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, all the way up to 100, right? So that means 100 factorial plus 2 will be divisible by 2.
Because 2 goes into 100 factorial, so it'll go into 100 factorial plus 2. And 3 divides into 100 factorial, so it will go into 100 factorial plus 3. And etc. 100 goes into 100 factorial, so it will divide into 100 factorial plus 100.
Therefore, all of those numbers are composite. Because the first ones are divisible by 2, the second ones are divisible by 3, the last ones are divisible by 100, they are all composite. Replacing the number 100 with a million will give us a million or rather 999,999 consecutive composite numbers as well.
There are a lot of questions. People are constantly asking questions about prime numbers. And here's one of them. What is the largest known prime number? Even though there are infinitely many primes, what's the biggest one we can find?
The biggest one that's been found so far, discovered in 2006, is 2 raised to an enormous power, what, 32,582,657 minus 1. So when you take 2 to that enormous power minus 1, you get a prime number that's over 9 million digits long.
In fact, that prime number was discovered by a mathematician, co-discovered by a mathematician named Curtis Cooper, who's the editor of the Fibonacci Quarterly, and you'll hear more about Fibonacci numbers later.
Here's some other nice questions about prime numbers. A perfect number is a number that's equal to the sum of all of its proper divisors.
For example, the number 6 has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3. If you add up all the numbers 1 plus 2 plus 3, you get 6. Hey, that's what makes it perfect. Let's do another example.
28 is the next perfect number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. By the way, proper divisors are all the divisors except for the number itself, so we don't put 28 on the list.
When you add those numbers together, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14, you get 28 again. That's perfect, too.
The next few perfect numbers are 496 and 8128. Those numbers may not look very interesting to you, but now look at their factorizations.
6 is equal to 2 times 3. 28 is 4 times 7. 496 is 16 times 31. 8128 is 64 times 127. The first number I'm giving is a power of 2, right? 2, 4, 16, and 64.
The second number I'm giving you, two things to notice about it. It's almost twice the power of 2. It's one less than twice the original number, and those numbers are also prime.
In fact, the great mathematician Leonard Euler showed that if P is a prime number, and if 2 to the P minus 1 is a prime number, then the number that you get when you take 2 to the P minus 1 times 2 to the P minus 1 is always going to be perfect.
Every even number has that form that Euler showed us. Every even perfect number looks like 2 to the P minus 1 times 2 to the P minus 1.
You may ask, well, that's true for all the even perfect numbers. What about the odd perfect numbers? Are there any odd perfect numbers?
The answer to that is nobody knows. Nobody knows if there are any odd perfect numbers. If you discover that, you will be famous.
Here are a couple of other unsolved questions pertaining to prime numbers. We say that twin primes are two prime numbers that differ by two.
So like 3 and 5 are twin primes. 5 and 7 are twin primes. 101 and 103 are twin primes. They're both prime numbers that differ by two.
We have found twin primes with over 50,000 digits. And yet, even though we know that there are an infinite number of prime numbers, nobody knows if they're an infinite number of twin primes.
I'll end with one last unsolved problem. Gold box conjecture. Gold box said that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
Here, let's look at some examples. 6 is 3 plus 3. 8 is 5 plus 3. 10 is 7 plus 3. 12 is 9 plus 3, but 9 and 3 aren't prime. 12 is 7 plus 5.
1000 is 997 plus 3. This problem has been verified up through the zillions that these numbers, every even number that we've looked at, is the sum of two primes.
But we don't have a proof that it's going to be true for all even numbers. It has been proved, by the way, that every even number is the sum of at most 300,000 primes.
But that's a far cry from two. Another thing that's been proved is that if your number is large enough, there comes a point where everything out there is of the form p plus qr, where p, q and r are prime.
Prime numbers have all kinds of applications, by the way. They are used for testing the performance and accuracy of computers. They're used for computer security.
Even communication security, financial transactions often depend on the security of very hard mathematical problems that usually pertain to prime numbers.
But since I think I've gone over a little bit of time, I think this would be a prime time to stop. Thank you very much.
