so that's a quick summary of the story we've told in this course
the story i've just told is a highly condensed summary of the best modern scientific attempts
to understand origins to understand how everything around us was created it's our best shot at
explaining origins just as every traditional creation story also represented the best attempt
given the available knowledge to answer all the fundamental questions about origins
now it needs to be said that the story told in this course that i've just summarized is far from
perfect like all previous creation stories it will be eventually superseded indeed important
details have changed or been clarified just in the decade or two since i began teaching
big history when i started teaching for example the best date available for the origins of the
universe was somewhere vaguely between 10 and 20 billion years ago i have to say as a teacher
it's much more satisfying to be able to say to students 13.7 billion years ago rather than vaguely
between 10 and 20 billion years ago at that time no planets had been detected beyond our
solar system we still had no certainty that planets existed anywhere else in the universe
we now know that they do and genetic dating techniques were just beginning to revolutionize
the study of human evolution we've seen that those techniques have completely changed our sense
of the timing of human evolution especially exciting at the moment is the use of genetic
comparisons to track human migrations in recent millennia perhaps in 10 years time
if i'm still teaching this course we'll be able to describe these migrations in much more detail
even for times when we have no written records within decades the story i've told will also
undergo pretty significant renovation where well here is just a preliminary list of some of the
areas in the story where we might expect to see significant changes cosmologists will continue
to try to push back their understanding of the origins of the universe at the moment they're
within a fraction of a second of the origins at the moment of creation but they're going to push
the story back the holy grail will be a theory that explains why the universe popped out of nothing
or perhaps that explains what it popped out of at the moment it has to be said there are lots of
theories lots of ideas but the main problem is finding evidence that could test them cosmologists
will also look for a better understanding of the significance of dark matter and dark energy
now you may remember when we talked about star formation astronomers are pretty confident
astronomers and cosmologists are pretty confident that we know a lot about the universe
but they also know and this is a kind of deep dark secret of astronomy that there's a lot of stuff
out there that they don't understand anything about they know it's there because it's clearly
exerting a powerful gravitational pull and you can detect it by the movements of galaxies and
clusters of galaxies and the pull is powerful enough that this stuff may make up 95 percent of the
stuff the matter and the energy in the universe but we have no idea what it is now that's extremely
odd and if the problem is solved say within the next 10 or 20 years it could revolutionize our
understanding of cosmology and it could end up changing quite a few of the details of the story
as i've told it another area where there may be significant breakthroughs is the understanding
of the origins of life on earth now here it's probably as if we're very close and we're going
to just fill in some final pieces of a puzzle at present it looks as if we have most of the story
most of the jigsaw and we're just looking for the last pieces and the last pieces will probably
tell us how dna evolved and how the very elaborate and precise mechanism of reproduction
that's present in all living organisms today itself evolved when it comes to human evolution
anthropologists will seek new evidence on the origins of our own species the early stages
of our species history are still a bit fuzzy and what we need above all is more data from africa
more archaeological data above all so this story may be may get clearer particularly if archaeologists
do more work in africa where our species evolved another area where that could could add a lot
to our understanding of human evolution is a better understanding of how symbolic language
evolved and that will probably come from studies in neuropsychology uh understanding of the brain
and theory of language but that would contribute a lot to our understanding of how our species evolved
and why language played such a crucial role in our history but finally and this is a problem that
appears particularly clearly within a course on big history we need a better understanding of complexity
complexity we've seen is a is an issue that crosses all the disciplines touched on in this course
it's something that's approached in different ways within different disciplines mathematics
mathematicians approach it in one way sociologists approach it another way but what we really need
is an understanding of complexity that crosses all of these disciplines and that can simultaneously
illuminate our understanding of stars and of modern human societies and that can also show the many
links between these different types of complexity this is one of those fields where the fragmentation
of modern knowledge seems to be the main barrier plenty of ideas there what we really need to do
is bring them together into a coherent transdisciplinary understanding of what complexity
means across all these disciplines and that's an area where big history itself may have a
significant contribution to make so the story we've told has limitations nevertheless it's a story
we really need to know in fact telling it backwards as i've just done is a pretty good way of showing
how such stories can provide meaning they provide meaning by providing sort of maps
of time and space telling the story backwards shows how the modern the modern world of humanity
fits into the largest story of human history how human history in turn fits into the largest
story of the history of life and how all these stories fit into the largest story of all that
of the universe as a whole like the different parts of a russian matryoshka doll you remember
these dolls you have a a tiny doll in the center which is in a slightly larger doll in a slightly
larger doll and so on each of these stories is nested in a larger story and each of the stories
can help illuminate the stories both at larger and at smaller scales so each part of this story
can illuminate the other parts of it and in this way what these stories can do these collections
of stories is help each of us identify our place within time and space our place within the space
time of our universe and knowing where we fit in in other words mapping ourselves onto space time
already tells us a lot about who we are so this story even if we think of it simply as a sort of
mapping is full of meaning are there other meanings in it well scientists are for the most part
reluctant to look for the meanings of the story as they tell most scientists just want to get the
story right and let other people worry about its meaning but of course for ordinary human beings
for you and me it's impossible not to look for meaning indeed our need for meaning may be closely
related to our ability to think symbolically and to use symbolic language and to exchange ideas
with each other the very idea of meaning is symbolic and that means there's very good
reason to think that chimps however clever they may be don't seek out meaning in their universe
chimps just deal with the universe we try to seek out meaning now i've suggested that the map of
space and time provided by big history is the first form of meaning that this story offers
but what other forms of meaning can we find now here i'm sort of going to go a bit beyond what most
scientists would say and offer an answer that has to count as largely personal and it's based on
20 years of teaching big history and also responding to the questions of my students
so here's one possible meaning
think of the story i told in the last lecture of the eventual death by tedium of our universe
that story suggests something very interesting about the time in the universe's history when
we're alive what it suggests is that we live at perhaps the most exciting and interesting period
in the universe's history we live in a sort of spring time of our universe we live in a period
when there existed the perfect balance of energy space and stuff to make complex things such as
ourselves there's lots of energy in the universe there's also lots of space there's not too much
energy so you can create complex things eventually in the future it'll be impossible in the very
early universe everything was too violent to create complex things so so that's one form of
meaning it tells us about the period of the universe's history that we live in now here's
a second possible meaning lurking within the story we saw in a very early lecture that humans
seem tiny on the scales of space and time but we've also seen since that modern human society
may be in some sense the most complex thing we know indeed we've hinted at the possibility
that it may be the most complex thing to be found within our galaxy so how complex is complex are
we perhaps the most complex thing in the milky way strictly is modern human society the most
complex thing in the milky way now there's a powerful reason for saying this may be true
and the main reason is that despite searching for signs of extraterrestrial life for several
decades through the SETI project the search for extraterrestrial intelligence no signs have been
found if intelligent life or to be more precise life capable of collective learning is fairly
common in the universe then that is distinctly odd if intelligent civilizations that adapt
through collective learning are common there ought to be many perhaps millions in our galaxy
and lots of them in our part of the galaxy and surely many of them are likely to be much more
sophisticated than us with much more powerful means of communication and transmission of
signals for example yet our civilization is already pumping episodes of I love Lucy out into
the cosmos if we're already doing it we should expect that at least some of the others would
be indiscreet enough to have been pumping similar signals out into space for much longer and in
much greater quantities but so far we haven't picked up a thing zilch so that may suggest that
we are alone we represent a sort of pinnacle of complexity so does modern human society this
astonishing product of just the last few centuries in our corner of the universe represent perhaps
the most complex thing in our part of the galaxy or in the galaxy as a whole well if so it makes us
rather interesting and here's a third possible meaning within the story we've seen
we're not just the most complex things we know of so far we're also the only creatures we know of
that are capable of seeking meaning and purpose in the universe of looking for meaning in the
scientific view of the universe we've seen there is no deity and no conscious creator
and that means that we become the universe's bearers of conscious purpose and meaning
modern science rejects the idea of a creator deity or deities so it's left with the vision of
a universe constructed by blind natural laws that when repeated over and over again billions of
times can slowly construct very complex and interesting things but it's all done without
purpose just because that's the way things are now this is an astonishing image of the
universe itself and for many people it's it's it's also a quite satisfying one but there's
something even more astonishing about it out of these apparently blind algorithmic processes
repeated billions of times over billions of years there has emerged at least once in the universe
a group of beings that do have a sense of purpose and do want a sense of meaning indeed
beings that have the astonishing ability to figure out how and when the universe was created
we can easily take it for granted but if you think about it it's an astonishing achievement
these are beings who can construct a history of the entire universe so we are in a sense the
eyes and ears of the universe its way of knowing itself and that's where we'll end
I hope you've enjoyed this telling of our modern creation story our modern scientific creation
story and I hope you will want to encourage others to become acquainted with it if they're young
enough they may be the ones who will eventually help construct a new and perhaps better story
