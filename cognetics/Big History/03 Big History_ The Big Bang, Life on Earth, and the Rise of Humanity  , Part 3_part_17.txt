investment and the thing was so large that it also meant rearranging the house that we never
got the britannica but today i can access it with a few keystrokes through my university library
and i can access a whole series of other computer other encyclopedias and i can even
summon up and print vast numbers of scholarly articles now of course it's also true that
others can dip into my computer that's perhaps the downside of all of this but what seems to be
happening in some way is that humans are now so networked this process of exchanging information
is becoming so powerful that we're beginning to form a sort of vast global brain now i should
add that global integration has also been painful for many because what it's done is it's forced
communities with very different ethical and social attitudes into very close proximity they've been
driven together they have to deal with each other in a way they didn't before and the discomfort
felt by many traditional communities for example when they encounter western television for the
first time is matched in the western world by worries about the world that children can find
as they surf the net it's a scary world out there and where such conflicts are felt to undermine
deeply cherished values they can lead to violent and painful conflicts about issues of symbolic
importance such as the wearing of headscarfs by muslim women in christian countries you may
remember that in 2004 the french national assembly banned the wearing of headscarfs
in public schools it was it was a difficult and highly contentious issue and similar issues
are cropping up in many countries of the world so globalization has also been for many painful
so one way of thinking about the significance of global integration is to say that in the
modern world the basic type of human community now is one single community of six billion people
and this is one of the most remarkable properties of the modern world now i want to talk about a
third striking property of of modern communities they're very different life ways we've already
mentioned in general terms the significance of the fact that the traditional peasant life ways
are gone most people are no longer self-sufficient rural dwelling peasants most people including
surviving peasants earn wages and are deeply integrated into market systems and increasingly
they live in towns and cities this transformation has had a rather profound impact on gender
relations we've seen that throughout the agrarian era peasants typically saw having as many children
as they could as the key to prosperity and protection in old age for wage-earning families
this is no longer true particularly in wealthier regions of the world and the result is that women
are not so closely tied to their role as child bearers and rearers in modern societies and that
amongst other things has allowed women to enter more specialized professions including politics
in far greater numbers and these changes have begun to undermine deep traditions of patriarchy
though many inequalities remain for example female participation in the paid labor force
rose significantly in the late 20th century but even in 2006 there were only 67 women in
paid employment for every hundred men and they were normally paid about 90 percent of what men
received for similar work the extraordinary material wealth generated by modern societies
has led to some remarkable improvements in living standards average levels of health have probably
changed very little throughout the agrarian era today at least in the wealthier parts of the world
though levels of health vary greatly within and between societies more people eat well and live
healthily without chronic pain or suffering than at any other time in human history so here is a
clear gain from innovation and another clear gain is increasing life expectancy lives have got longer
average global life expectancies in 1700 and probably throughout the agrarian era were probably
about 30 years by 2000 they had doubled to 65 years the change was represented above all
a decline in infant mortality in the number of children who died and once more this represents
a momentous change in the nature of life itself and it may prove the foretaste of future extensions
in the life of a single human a sort of stretching of the span of human life now here's another fourth
a fourth striking feature of modern communities and that is the very different role of coercion
in modern societies in some ways the changes have been paradoxical in the later agrarian world
we saw that coercion was a fundamental mechanism for controlling behavior and you can see that
by looking at the pervasiveness of slavery for example as a teacher in a tribute-taking society
i would have been expected to regularly beat my students a striking example of what this
meant for daily life can be found in the 16th century russian manual of household management
known as dama's story which means organization of the household in dama's story we can read the
following have you sons discipline them and break them in from their earliest years that's prompted
by ecclesiastica 724 do not withhold discipline from a boy take the stick to him and save him
from death if you take the stick to him yourself you will preserve him from the jaws of death
if a wife does not obey says dama's story and if she doesn't manage her household correctly
then and i quote the husband should punish his wife beat her when you are alone together
then forgive her and remonstrate with her now i've quoted dama's story because in some ways it
represents the norm in this world a world in which coercion was regarded as a normal way
of steering behavior i should say that this world took a long time to vanish i went to an
english public school where corporal punishment was still regarded as the norm now in this respect
the modern world is fundamentally different behavior is steered much more by market forces
rather than by coercion so modern states generally frown on the use of violence
indeed the german sociologist max vapor regarded this sort of monopolization of violence by the
state as a key feature of modern states here's how charles tilly describes this process disarmament
of the civilian population took place in many small steps general seizures of weapons at the
ends of rebellions prohibitions of duels controls over the production of weapons introduction of
licensing for private arms restrictions on public displays of armed force so we now live in a world
that is increasingly hostile to the use of violence in personal relations both slavery and domestic
violence still exist but they are widely regarded as illegitimate and that is surely a game yet there's
another side to this it is that modern states when they choose to do so can wield coercion far
more effectively than most agrarian era states even the most democratic of states maintain
large prison populations in the usa for example according to department of justice statistics
more than 2.4 millions were incarcerated in prisons and jails at the end of june 2006 which
represents an astonishing 0.8 percent of the population almost one percent it also represents
one of the highest incarceration rates in the world now it's safe to say that no later agrarian era
state would have had the resources to keep so many people incarcerated we also seen that modern
states have levels of military power that seriously threatened the future of human society despite the
end of the cold war the us and russia may have 4 000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert today
they could be launched within 15 minutes in 2005 a plea signed by 32 noble laureates and
parliamentarians around the world asked that these be removed from hair trigger status noting
that there was still enough of them to destroy civilization there have been several instances
recently as this petition pointed out when individuals seemed to have stopped what was
looking like a process leading to an exchange of nuclear weapons here's just one in january the
25th 1995 russia prepared to launch retaliatory strikes after identifying the launch of what
looked like a us trident missile they postponed the launch only when the missile landed in the
sea and turned out to be a norwegian research rocket studying the northern lights the russian
government had been informed but the information had not been passed on to the radar crew now let
me end with some very brief comments about how we can assess all of this does all of this represent
progress or betterment it's a question we've raised several times in this course for example with
reference to living standards in the paleolithic era or in the early agrarian era and each time
the answers were contradictory well here are some possible answers for the modern world
the modern world has solved what was the fundamental problem of the pre-modern world
that is how to produce enough stuff to support everyone and that is a great achievement and it
explains the high living standards of so many people today that's a remarkable achievement and
it's something entirely new yet this achievement itself has raised new questions first it raises
the question of whether material living standards can keep improving the quality of life by raising
material standards over and over again can we keep raising the quality of life that's one question
or will we have to start looking for other ways of improving the quality of life and a second question
is whether modern society is sustainable given its extreme complexity and the breakneck pace of
change can this thing be sustained that's something we'll tackle in the next two lectures thank you
lecture 45 human history and the biosphere
in the previous lecture we began to widen the lens once more by surveying the major structural
changes of the modern era as we've done with previous eras but we deliberately skipped one
very large and important group of changes changes in the relationship between our species and the
biosphere and these these issues have a direct bearing on the question of the sustainability
of modern society so to see these changes clearly what i want to do is widen the lens further to
include all of human history and i want to survey our changing relationship with the biosphere
in the 20th century it became apparent for the first time that humans were beginning to have a
huge and perhaps disruptive impact on many aspects of the biosphere now let me begin by
defining this term biosphere clearly what is the biosphere the term was invented by the austrian
geologist edward seuss who lived in the 19th century and died in 1914 he used it in 1875
to refer to and i quote the place on earth's surface where life dwells incidentally we've
met seuss before in this course as the inventor of the term gondwana land and a precursor of
some of the ideas of alfred vegner the term biosphere was popularized by the russian biologist
v i van adsky whose dates are 1863 to 1945 and he popularized it in a book he published in the
soviet union in the 1920s he used it on the analogy of other geological terms such as
atmosphere the sphere of air or hydrosphere the sphere of water to refer to the spherical
layer of earth water air and living organisms at the earth's surface that sustains life on
this planet so the biosphere didn't include just living things it included the context
in which they existed and this is a large complex system of exchanges of energy and resources the
place of life now we've seen that the major turning points in human history and i'm thinking
really here of the turning points that introduce what i've called the great eras of human history
including the initial appearance of our species the introduction of agriculture and even the
appearance and spread of agrarian civilizations are all associated with increasing control over
or new ways of controlling the resources the energy the space the material resources of the
natural world each new era seems to begin with a sort of acceleration in human control over over
the biosphere now we've seen that increasing control of the energy resources and space of the
biosphere can be tracked in several ways and one is an expansion in the range and the numbers of
our species and we can track it from the paleolithic to the present day each new era marks an
acceleration in growth rates now let's let's take population growth rates to illustrate this point
if you take the best available estimates of human populations throughout the course of human history
and you do some rough calculations on them you find that in the later paleolithic era
after about 50 000 years ago human populations seem to have doubled roughly every 10 000 years
every 10 000 years that in the agrarian era they seem to have doubled about every 1500 years
this is a very significant increase in rates of population growth and in the last 300 years
they have doubled about every 75 years so each of these gear shifts in human control over resources
represents increasing human power ecological power if you like increasing human power
over the biosphere now this is what when human particularly economic historians talk about
these processes they tend to use a word like growth but we need to remember that this is a very
anthropocentric or human-centered view it may be growth for us because it means we have more
resources and our populations can grow but is it growth for the biosphere not really
what was really going on in each case was that the same amounts of energy were entering the
biosphere from sunlight but more and more of them were being diverted to the use of one species our
own in the 20th century it became apparent that our increasing ecological power was beginning to
have a massive impact on the natural world some scholars anticipated this earlier there are one
of the best known scholars in the in the in the usa was george perkins marsh whose dates are 1801
to 1882 he's one of the first to understand clearly the scale of human impacts on the biosphere
vernadski was another and this realization is also one of the main drivers of modern
environmental movements so massive have been these changes in recent history that and here
i want to quote from a wonderful recent environmental history of the 20th century by
