of these pistons the faster they move the wheels the coals which are its oats were under the bench
and there was a small glass tube affixed to the boiler with water in it which indicates by its
fullness or emptiness when the creature wants water which is immediately conveyed to it from its
reservoirs and then what she does is she describes the journey and this gives a wonderful sense of
how new the experience was a bit like one of us being invited to fly in the space shuttle i suspect
the snorting little animal she writes which i felt rather inclined to pat was then harnessed to our
carriage and mr stevensson having taken me on the bench of the engine with him we started at about
10 miles an hour later the engine having received its supply of water the carriage was placed behind
it for it cannot turn and was set off at its utmost speed which was 35 miles an hour swifter
than a bird flies she says for they tried the experiment with a snipe i think this conveys
very well how utterly new this phenomenon was by the early 19th century innovation was raising
productivity in many sectors of manufacturing including textiles coal and metals building
and consumer goods between 1770 and 1830 the value of cotton production rose over 40 times that of
coal almost nine times that of iron about five times and that of the building industry by more
than 11 times now the english industrial revolution provides a very good illustration of the model
of innovation proposed in lecture 31 it suggests that once societies emerged that were highly
commercialized capitalistic in their social structures and well connected to global markets
new incentives would begin to stimulate an acceleration in innovation and that we've
seen as the key to the modern revolution but the innovations themselves mattered above all
the discovery of a massive new energy source fossil fuels the steam engine followed by technologies
that exploited oil and natural gas allowed humans to tap into the vast reserves of fossilized energy
that had been laying down in the previous several hundred million years this is what we mean by the
fossil fuels revolution it was a wholly unprecedented energy bonanza for our species before the steam
engine the most powerful prime mover available was probably a windmill which could deliver about nine
horsepower what steam engine delivered 134 horsepower which was a very very significant increase
and just the beginning a modern bowing 747 for example can deliver about 80 000 so by the early
19th century the changes were so striking in britain that some contemporaries began to notice
them and in 1837 the french revolutionary blankey described the changes in britain as
an industrial revolution now the question is how far and how fast would the british industrial
revolution spread elsewhere thank you
lecture 42 spread of the industrial revolution to 1900
do you remember the near industrial revolution of song china in the 11th and 12th century c e
we saw how in an environment that was suddenly more commercialized more competitive than in the past
innovation suddenly increased and a huge amount of innovation occurred in agriculture in industry
in economic organization and so on but then what happened was that it all fell away again
from the end of the 13th in the 14th centuries what made the modern revolution so different
is that instead of dying away like this the process of innovation continued and spread around the
entire world and it's still continuing today more than two centuries later now why the difference
between the outcomes of these two periods of very rapid almost explosive growth partly the
difference is that the world of the 19th century was so much more integrated and interconnected
than the world of the 12th century remember the world of the 12th century the world of song china
was still a world divided into four main world zones and even connections between the different
parts of eurasia between say china and the Mediterranean were slow it took several centuries
for chinese innovations to diffuse through eurasia now we look at this later industrial
revolution how rapidly did the changes we have observed during the british industrial revolution
spread to other parts of the world and how great was their impact well the short answer is that
within just two centuries industrialization had transformed the entire world for better or worse
no earlier transformation in human history had ever been so rapid or so far reaching just remember
in the paleolithic era the first era of human history it took humans almost 200 000 years
to spread around the entire world so what i what i want to do in this lecture is to describe the
impact of industrialization up to about 1900 to get a clear overview of these changes it might
help to think of four main waves of change before 1900 the real processes of course were much more
intricate much more complicated but this idea of four main waves provides a very helpful
broad sketch of the main changes so we'll we'll we'll survey in each of these waves
the region it affected the period it occurred and the distinctive technologies associated
with that wave so let's begin with the first of these four waves wave one
the first wave begins in the late 18th century and we described some aspects of it in the previous
lecture it mainly affected britain it also touched the western edge of europe and in some
senses touched even the eastern seaboard of the united states new technologies in this wave included
a much more productive agrarian sector improved steam engines steam engines that were now
efficient enough to be taken up widely in other other industries and therefore allowed humans
to tap into the immense reserves of energy stored in fossil fuels the mechanization of cotton textile
production and increased production of coal and iron we saw also that changes occurred in a large
number of other sectors as well but these are the main sectors the ones where the changes are most
striking the cotton gin incidentally cotton gin or engine was a particularly important american
contribution to this phase invented by elie whitney in 1793 it was a mechanical device for separating
cotton seeds from cotton fibers now here in this case we can measure the resulting increase in
productivity very easily it now took one person to do what had previously taken 50 people working by
hand unfortunately as with many of these innovations the initial impact of this was simply to increase
the scale of sweated labor or in the case of the states of slavery now wave two wave two took
place in the early 19th century innovation accelerated in many parts of western europe
including belgium france and germany and also along the eastern seaboard of the newly independent
united states technological changes in the second wave included the increased use of
steam engines in manufacturing and the spread of railways and steamships railways spread rapidly
in europe and in the usa the first commercial steamship was a paddle ship designed by robert
falton which traveled between new york and albany beginning in 1807 it used a watt steam engine
the first ocean going steamship was called the great western it was designed by the great
british designer isambard kingdom brunel and it was launched in 1837 it crossed to new york the next
year in 1843 he launched another steamship known as the great britain this was the first large iron
ship in the world and the first to use a screw propeller it's made in voyage to new york took
14 days it had a it had an interesting subsequent history it ended its days as a coal bunker on
the foreland islands but then in 1970 it was finally refloated towed to england and it's now
been renovated as a museum that we see in in bristol steam transportation was immensely important
it speeded up commercial exchanges and it cut transportation costs which stimulated commerce
and manufacturing now this was particularly true in very large countries such as the usa or canada
where cheaper land transport had a revolutionary impact on commerce in general by 1917 there were
about one million miles of railways throughout the world and about one third of them were in north
america now why was the railway so revolutionary well here's one way of looking at it throughout
the agrarian era transportation by land had been slower and more expensive than transportation by sea
that explains incidentally why regions such as the mediterranean where a lot of exchanges
could take place by sea or those connected by great river systems such as egypt and mesopotamia
flourished economically it's at least one of the important factors in their economic growth
with the railway for the first time in human history transportation by land became as cheap
and as rapid as transportation by sea and this provided a massive stimulus for economic development
particularly in regions such as north america where most transportation had to be by land
so that's the second wave and it's dominated by railways the third wave we can assign
roughly speaking to the middle of the 19th century it dominates the middle decades of the 19th century
industrialization accelerates within europe particularly within germany and germany
since the 20s has been united economically within a common custom zone that solverine
and by 1871 it would also be united politically change is also rapid in the eastern usa
technological innovations in this period include the industrial production of chemicals such as
dyes and artificial fertilizers which revolutionized agriculture fertilizers would be immensely
important in supporting in supplying food to the rapidly growing populations of the modern era
and the ability to produce artificial fertilizers greatly cheapened the use of fertilizers
steel making was made more effective with the introduction of the besamer process
and this is the era also in which the industrial use of electricity began
domestic lighting began to revolutionize patterns of work and leisure by lighting up the night
all previous forms of lighting had severe limitations electricity could provide a
sort of brightness that had no parallel elsewhere and and for some purposes obliterate the distinction
between day and night so the humble light bulb transformed life and transformed urban life in
particular its inventor was of course thomas eddison eddison eddison is remarkable he took
out patents on more than a thousand inventions and these included the light bulb and also the
phonograph and the first motion picture camera warfare was revolutionized in this period railways
made it possible to transport large numbers of troops and equipment and material and new and
more powerful weapons such as machine guns began to greatly increase the killing power of those who
are armed with them so the american civil war is widely regarded as the first major war of the
industrial era the telegraph and telephone revolutionized communications but today it's
all too easy to take for granted this revolution in communications but we need to remind ourselves
what a strange phenomenon it was the idea of instantaneous communication over huge distances
transformed the possibilities for what we have called in this course collective learning
the first forms the telegraph and early telephones transmitted messages along electric cables
the electrical telegraph was invented in britain in 1837 and the morse code
at the same time in the states within just 25 years most of the world was linked by telegraph
communication the telephone was invented in 1876 by alexander bell but its reach would soon be
extended by improvements introduced by the ubiquitous thomas eddison who in 1878 made a call
from new york to philadelphia but it was possible to communicate even without cables and this was
a possibility explored by an italian julielmo marconi by 1895 he had found he could send a
message over a few kilometers without wires and on december the 12th 1901 he sent the first
wireless transmission across the atlantic now while we're on the subject of modern communications
here's an anecdote about the wonder of instantaneous broadcasting around the world chronologically it
belongs strictly to a later period but i i can't resist a cricket story and i promise it's the only
one in this course international cricket matches are called test matches and they began to be
broadcast live in the 1920s now you have to understand that broadcasting cricket was a
challenge because a test match can last five days and for much of that period particularly
if there's bad weather not much is happening in the 1940s test matches began to be broadcast around
the world and australian commentators began to commentate on test matches proceeding going on
on on in britain and what they what they did was they used to receive streams of cables from britain
detailing what what happened each ball they would sit in their studios and they would tell the
stories if they were watching the match themselves complete with vivid sometimes largely imaginary
details about the scene and they'd also use special sound effects such as tapping the microphone to
simulate the stand sound of a bat hitting a ball the australian audiences i'm told were spellbound
now that little story i hope just is a reminder of how recent these changes are and how remarkable
they are now let's move on to the fourth wave the late 19th century strictly we should probably
say the late 19th century and early 20th century the fourth wave dominated that period and in this
period industrialization we can say spreads for example it spreads to russia and japan and it
spreads west within the united states and canada in russia railway building particularly the building
of the trans-siberian railroad which was completed in 1904 and ran from mosco to the pacific coast
stimulated iron production and manufacturing and it made it possible to export grain more cheaply
and also stimulated internal trade now this is an example of one of the early phases of state
driven industrialization the initiative came largely from the state so did much of the
initial financing this is the age when a second fossil fuel oil begins to be used the oil age
launched a second phase of the fossil fuels revolution with the invention of the internal
