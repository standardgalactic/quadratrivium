we can perhaps pose slightly more seriously and it's this what new things will we learn
now let me attempt to list some areas where it's not unreasonable to think that there could be
profound scientific and technological breakthroughs in the next millennium
quite soon we may find evidence for the existence of planets very similar to the earth this could
happen very quickly within a decade or two within just a few years within a century or so will we
have also found evidence for the existence of life elsewhere in the universe will we perhaps find
that the universe is in fact crawling with life that this is not the only corner of the universe
with living organisms at present given what we know of the speed with which life appeared on
our earth that is not an unlikely scenario now think of the odds we have been able to observe
life on just a single planet so far and what we've seen is that on that planet life appeared
life in the form of simple single celled organisms almost as soon as the planet was cool enough to
sustain life about 3.8 billion years ago now what that seems to imply is that whenever promising
environments are created for life and presumably there'll be on planets in the vicinity of stars
but not too close otherwise they'll be too hot and not too far away otherwise they'll be too cold
as soon as wherever these conditions have appeared this suggests life is likely to appear
life at least in the simple form of single celled organisms may therefore turn out to be
quite a robust form of complexity that is spread throughout much of the universe
but what about the chances of finding creatures like us creatures capable of collective learning
now perhaps they don't need to look like us but let's define the crucial feature of humans as
this ability this capacity for collective learning
that we shouldn't ruled it out the chances of finding such organisms seem a lot less
likely and here are some of the reasons one reason is that on our earth it has taken almost
four billion years to evolve such a species and we also know that a lot of luck was evolved
for example the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs now imagine that it had been on a
trajectory just a few minutes earlier or a few minutes later it would have missed the earth
the dinosaurs would have continued to flourish and mammals as a group of organisms would have
probably remained in their existing niches as small burrowing shrew-like nighttime organisms
they wouldn't have flourished in the way they did after the removal of the removal of dinosaurs
and we are part of that massive adaptive radiation of mammals after the removal of the dinosaurs
then even once our species had appeared what are the chances of it surviving
there are genetic hints as we've seen that our species that our numbers dwindled to just a few
thousands perhaps as recently as 70 000 years ago at that time the survival of our species
hung on a thread now if these hints are correct does that mean that we've come perversely close
to extinction and of course we also need to add that like all evolution events the appearance
of our species depended to a large degree on genetic chance on the appearance of a mutation
that happened to spread amongst a small founder population to create our species how likely
was such an event Stephen J. Gould who I've mentioned before wrote a famous book on the Burgess
Shale the Burgess Shale is a rich source of fossils from the Middle Cambrian era
that was found in the Canadian Rockies and in his book Gould argued that many of the forms
found in the Burgess Shale are so strange that they proved that evolution on earth
could have followed many different pathways so what he's suggesting is that
if you start life on earth and you just tweak the condition slightly you'll find
that the path of evolution runs along completely different lines the story we told
that evolution of life on earth would be very different indeed and the organisms you'd end up
with would be completely different from those we know if he's right the line of evolution that
led to us is perhaps vanishingly unlikely to be repeated elsewhere on the other hand if so
we're extremely unlikely to encounter species anything like us and perhaps unlikely to encounter
any other species capable of collective learning yet there are evolutionary biologists and one of
them is Simon Conway another scholar who's worked on the Burgess Shale who've taken a very
different line what Conway and others who think like him have argued is this they've argued that
there are a limited number of evolutionary pathways and what they're talking about is
the chemistry of biology there are a limited number of ways in which organisms can be created
in which they can evolve to multicellularity and so on so he's argued that evolution is not as random
or as open-ended as Gould supposed there are a limited number of ground plans as it were on
which you can build living organisms if this is true then it follows that given a reasonable amount
of time and given multiple planets on which life evolves it's quite likely that on at least some
of them evolution is going to follow fairly similar paths to those on earth and in some of them
they may eventually stumble upon the idea of a large-brained dexterous organism such as ourselves
that's capable of collective learning if so we might expect that wherever life gets going
on a reasonably long-lived planet that means a planet orbiting a small to middling star
creatures a bit like us might appear perhaps even Conway has argued with similar sensory organs
including eyes and perhaps with brains and a capacity to manipulate their environments and
share information about it if Conway is right then we may not be quite so rare in the universe
so if so what are the chances of actually meeting such creatures well they're not good
if Walter Miller is right in Canticle for Leibovitz and all these creatures always reach a certain
limit and then blow themselves up now here's another scenario let's imagine that we've
survived the various disaster scenarios that are waiting out there for us where will our
history as a species take us are there perhaps new thresholds of complexity out there waiting to be
crossed one intriguing possibility is that like eukaryotic cells in the Cambrian era we may become
so interdependent that there comes a point where we'll start turning into a single earth spanning
species linked in complex ways with many other species of the biosphere we've already seen
that we're now so networked that we're beginning to function as if we are parts of a huge global
brain and of course if James Lovelock's idea of Gaia is correct then like it or not the biosphere
as a whole is already well on the way to being a single organism and one that may feel of course
that our species needs to be removed like a sort of cancer cell okay here's another scenario
and this is migration humans we've seen are travelers and explorers and if we survive the next millennium
our descendants will surely start migrating beyond the earth as our ancestors migrated beyond the
savanna lands of east Africa and as ancestral Polynesians migrated throughout the vast
archipelagos of the pacific ocean how likely is the scenario well this is reasonably plausible
many of the necessary technologies already exist for migration to the planets and moons of our
solar system and of course humans have already reached the moon and within a decade or two it's
very likely that humans will walk on Mars so even today we have some of the technology needed say to
mine asteroids or to colonize the moon for some period of time or to build artificial space colonies
in fact there's one already orbiting our earth the international space station there's even been
some reasonably serious talk although this is probably on the borderline between serious science
and science fiction of the possibility of terraforming Mars to make it more habitable to humans
that would probably involve a sort of artificial global warming beginning perhaps with massive
nuclear explosions so as to create on Mars a breathable atmosphere and and seas if this would
happen it would probably take the best part of a thousand years or more but we could think of it
as a sort of domestication of an entire planet
but at present we have none of the technologies needed to go further than our solar system
none of the technologies needed to migrate to other star systems remember it takes light more
than four years to travel to the nearest star and at present we have no idea how you might
propel a spaceship fast enough to even begin to match the speed of light so for humans such
journeys would presumably take many generations if they occur they will be spectacular recreations
of the journeys that Polynesian migrants made when they settled Rapa Nui or Hawaii
and here's one more thing if our ancestors if our descendants rather do migrate to distant star
systems we will create a vast archipelago a bit like the colonies of Polynesia
collective learning will now start occurring at stellar scales but the distances between these
colonies rather like those between Polynesian islands will be so huge that these communities
will certainly or at least some of them will certainly become isolated culturally
and even eventually genetically slowly our species will start to split through some form
of allopatric speciation a bit like the Galapagos finches they'll split into species that are very
very similar but gradually over time they'll become less and less similar they'll become
distinct species that will that mark the end of our species and will that mark perhaps in some sense
the end of human history okay now let's confess that most of this has been pure speculation
at larger scales though we can return to scientifically solid ground or at least reasonably
scientific speculation so now let's move forward to the remote future the rest of time
at scales beyond those of human history we return to slower and simpler processes such as the evolution
of the earth the sun and the universe and these processes we can discuss with a bit more confidence
so let me go through some of the predictions we can make first about the geography of the earth
studying the movement of tectonic plates is something we can now do with great precision
using satellites we can tell exactly how fast plates are moving and exactly what in what direction
so these studies hint at what the earth may look like in a hundred or two hundred million years
and there are some things we can say the Atlantic will widen and the Pacific will narrow
bringing Asia and North America together and eventually a new supercontinent will emerge
remember we've seen in the last billion years supercontinents have formed at least twice
radinia perhaps six or seven hundred million years years ago and pangea about 200 to 250 million
years ago so eventually a new supercontinent will emerge as it does so Los Angeles will slide north
and it will become part of Canada this will be a world that will very different from the world of
today what of the future of our earth our sun we've seen is about halfway through its life
in three to four billion years the sun will run out of hydrogen then it'll collapse in on itself
as it does so it'll generate much higher temperatures in its core and it will expand
again to form a red giant it'll be much larger than it is at the present it'll include mercury
and venous and the earth will be sterilized of life and the oceans will boil away there'll be no
more life on earth we should certainly have got out by then eventually when the sun has burned up
all the helium in its core it'll collapse again temperatures will rise once more they'll become
much higher than they were even in the helium burning era and the sun will get larger than
it was before this time it'll reach the earth's outer orbit and our earth will be evaporated
by then we need to have seriously got out of the inner solar system and preferably out of our solar
system then what will happen the sun will expel its outer layers and what's left will cool down
and shrink it'll become a black dwarf it'll be a retired star an x star and now what'll it do
in its retirement it'll do nothing but keep cooling for countless billions of years it won't
shine any longer it won't do anything useful for its surroundings that's the fate of our sun
and the future of our galaxy well we can say something even about the future the milky way
the milky way is on a collision course with its neighbor the andromeda galaxy
and at about the time that our sun enters its death throes the two galaxies will collide
what'll happen well it's not going to be a violent collision they will glide gracefully
through each other though gravity will in introduce some turbulence as they do so
but we won't be around to see the spectacular night skies that that will produce
and finally the universe what is the fate of the universe we've seen the beginning of the story
do we have any idea about the end actually cosmologists have some reasonably clear ideas
about what is possible one idea was very popular in the late 20th century and it was this it was that
all the matter in the universe and all the energy in the universe we've seen exerts a gravitational
pull so the idea was that this gravitational pull would eventually be so powerful that it would
slow down the expansion of the universe and then come a time when the expansion would slow it would
grind to a halt and eventually the universe would start shrinking again rather like a vast
solar nebula that includes the entire universe uh steven hawking perhaps slightly with tongue
in cheek argued that at that point time might start reversing and all sorts of processes will
go into reverse so the universe will start shrinking over many billions of years it'll
shrink until eventually it'll shrink away to nothing this will be the big crunch as opposed to
the big bang oh what'll happen then well now here things do get seriously speculative but many
