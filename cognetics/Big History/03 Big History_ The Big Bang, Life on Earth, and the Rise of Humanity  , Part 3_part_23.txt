scientists seriously speculated that out of the big crunch might come another big bang so this is
the scenario of bouncing universes universes appear they expand then they contract again into nothing
and then they expand again and perhaps there's a sort of larger multiverse that is full of these
expanding universes but since the late 1990s cosmologists have learned that the rate of expansion
of the universe is actually increasing it's not slowing we don't clearly know why but what this
suggests is that the more likely scenario is that the universe will keep expanding forever and ever
and what will that mean well here are some of the things that'll happen eventually every star in
the universe will have used up its fuel and died they'll all be retired the universe will darken
over countless billions of years black holes will graze on the remaining bits of matter
and when i say countless billions of years i'm talking about gazillions of billions of years
i said earlier we imagine we can imagine in the universe that there are as many stars as there are
sand grains on all the all the deserts and beaches of the earth will now start thinking
that many billions of years in the future the universe will keep expanding the space between
remaining objects will increase temperature differentials will narrow with smaller energy
differentials there are no stars for example to drive complexity the universe will become simpler
and more boring any complex things will slowly simplify the universe as a whole will become
simpler the second law of thermodynamics will have triumphed over complexity and this is what
was known in the 19th century as the heat death of the universe and what'll happen next well
the universe will continue to get more and more uninteresting for as many billions of years as
there are sand grains on all the beaches and deserts of the earth and so on forever and ever
where does that leave you and me what's our place in this huge story
the last lecture in this course will touch on some of these large issues of meaning
and will also briefly recapitulate the story of big history thank you
lecture 48 big history humans in the cosmos
early in this course i said that one way of thinking about big history might be to imagine
a community of people old and young around a campfire as i say this i'm actually thinking of
some wonderful holidays that my wife and i spent with our children and friends of ours who also
had children and we spent them at a lake in australia north of sydney each evening we would build a fire
and because all children are natural pyromaniacs we would sit around it till late at night and
they poke sticks into it and eventually we could look up and see a wonderful stylet southern hemisphere
sky i'm sure you can think of similar occasions and it's not at all hard to imagine that most people
perhaps throughout most of human history have had similar experiences now we can imagine that the
youngest people in the group start asking questions they start asking questions about the meaning of
life and about where things come from so they say why are there so many people in the world for
example or how big is the world really and imagine that we try to give them the best
and most intelligent answers we can our answers might take the form of the story we've been following
throughout this course but played in reverse so here's how it might sound if i told this to an
adult audience let's begin with human history today's society is the the largest and by far the most
complex human society that has ever existed today there are more than six billion humans
and though they live in distinct societies with different states that are often in conflict with
each other all these communities are linked through trade travel and modern forms of communication
into a single global community this modern global community which is the world we live in today
was created very recently just during the last 300 years about 300 or 400 years ago human beings
initially in some parts of the world and then eventually throughout the world crossed a sort
of threshold human societies became more interconnected and as commerce was becoming
more important than ever before people in some regions began to innovate faster than ever before
now these changes are often described as the industrial revolution what they did
was to lay the foundations for today's vast and rapidly changing societies by suddenly
introducing a whole new wave of new ways of dealing with the environment and getting energy
for several thousand years before this most people had lived in the large powerful communities
that we describe as agrarian civilizations they had cities with magnificent monumental architecture
they had powerful rulers and these these state systems were sustained by large populations of
peasants who lived in the countryside and produced most of society's resources innovation was much
slower than today and that's why things tended to change much more slowly the pace of history was
slower and there were far fewer people than today than today 2000 years ago for example there were
probably only about 250 million people on earth where did the agrarian civilizations come from
well the first agrarian civilizations appeared in regions such as Mesopotamia Egypt and China
and they appeared about 5 000 years ago during the previous 5 000 years an increasing number of
humans lived in small relatively independent communities of small farmers that were governed
by local chiefs but there also existed many people who lived not by farming but by foraging that is
to say by gathering the resources they needed as they migrated through their territories agriculture
appeared about 10 or 11 000 years ago before the appearance of agriculture all human beings
were foragers they all lived like foragers or hunter-gatherers what agriculture did was to greatly
increase the amount of resources that human communities could extract from a given area
and the result was it led to rapid population growth and eventually that led to the creation
of the very large human communities that were the first agrarian civilizations so that's why the
appearance of agriculture counts as the most important threshold in history before the appearance
of the modern world for the 200 000 years or so before agriculture all humans had lived as foragers
and that means they lived in small family-sized nomadic communities of perhaps less than 50
people for the most part sometimes with links with their neighbors for most of this time
there were very few humans on earth probably little more than the numbers of great apes in
the world today so that's a period of about 200 000 years the first members of our species homo sapiens
appeared about 200 to 300 000 years ago we don't know exactly when but we're pretty sure they
appeared somewhere in Africa their appearance counts as the most important threshold before
the appearance of agriculture what made these first humans different from all other animals
and what accounted for their ability to explore so many different environments was their ability
to exchange and store information about their environments humans could talk to each other
and they could exchange information with a speed and efficiency that no other animal could match
and that means they could store information in addition unlike any other animals they could
ask about the meaning of existence humans were probably storytellers from the very beginning
of their history now that's a brief history of how human societies developed into the remarkable
global community of today but how were the first human societies created humans after all are
living organisms so to explore the origin of humans of our species we must describe the
history of living organisms and that's the next stage in this story our species evolved in the
same way as all other species by natural selection tiny changes in the average qualities of each
community slowly accumulated over many generations until the nature of each species slowly changes
and this is the process that created the huge variety of species today our ancestors evolved
from highly intelligent bipedal ape-like ancestors known as hominins the first hominins appeared
about six million years before the appearance of homo sapiens our species the hominins in turn
were descended from the mammals known as primates they were related most closely of all
to the gray tape such as the chimpanzees and gorillas but the primates as a group were
tree dwelling mammals they had large brains they had dexterous hands they had stereoscopic
vision these are all the things you need to live in trees and as a group they had appeared
about 65 million years ago the primates were mammals mammals were a type of animal that had
first evolved about 250 million years ago they in turn the mammals in turn were descended
from large creatures with backbones whose ancestors had learned to live on the land about 400 million
years ago all amphibians and reptiles are also descended from these ancestors large multi-cell
organisms like ourselves had only been around since about 600 million years ago that's the
first time during the so-called cambrian era that you get very large animals made up of billions
of individual cells before that all living organisms on earth were single-celled most would
have been invisible to a human eye the first living organisms on this planet seem to have appeared
as early as 3.8 billion years ago that's just 700 million years after the formation of our earth
they were the remote ancestors of all living creatures on earth today including you and me
what's remarkable is the speed with which they appeared
just 700 million years after the creation of our planet and our early planet was not a very
hospitable place for life so the speed with which they appeared suggests that life is likely to appear
in our universe wherever the conditions are right and that means wherever we find planets
that are bathed in the light from nearby stars but far enough away for liquid water to form
because liquid water water in liquid form that is provides an ideal environment for complex
chemical reactions like those that formed living organisms the other crucial ingredients
of course is a is a rich mixture of chemicals so it seems that wherever you get a hospitable
environment for life in our universe it's very probable that life will appear so the formation
of life itself as we move back in time is the next most important threshold before the appearance
of our species that we've also seen lots of minor thresholds as life evolved
life in turn was only possible where the conditions were right so to understand the
appearance of life we need to understand the appearance of planets of stars and of chemical
elements that takes us to the history of geology and into astronomy our earth was formed about
4.5 billion years ago and it was a formed it was formed along with all the other planets moons
and asteroids and comets of our solar system all of them were formed as a byproduct of the processes
that created our sun what happened was that debris left over bits and pieces if you like
orbiting the sun smashed together within the earth's earth's orbit slowly accumulated into
larger and larger lumps until eventually they all aggregated into a single large lump which was our
early planet the formation of our planet therefore is the next important threshold in our story as
we move back in time now how common was this process well solar systems may have formed countless
billions of times in the history of the universe but this happens to be the only solar system whose
origins we know much about at present our planet like the living organisms that inhabit it is made
up of many different chemical elements in fact in in our body you can probably find traces of
elements from across the periodic table so neither our planet neither our earth nor you and me could
have been formed if the chemical elements had not been manufactured they were manufactured
in the violent death throes of large stars in supernovae or in the dying days of other stars
we don't know when the first stars died and scattered new elements into space but it's
very probable that it happened within one billion years of the creation of the universe so this new
threshold the creation of chemical elements takes us back more than 12 billion years close to the
beginnings of the universe since then billions upon billions of stars have died scattering new
elements into interstellar space now obviously stars could not have died if stars had not been born
stars were born like our sun as clouds of gas clouds of matter collapsing under the pressure
of gravity heated up in their centers until eventually hydrogen began to fuse and at that
point they lit up they turned into stars though star formation has occurred has continued ever
since the first stars appeared that's why as i said in an earlier lecture there are probably more
stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches and deserts of our earth
the first stars may have been formed more than 13 billion years ago quite soon within 200 or 300
million years of the origins of our universe so as we move back in time the creation of stars
counts as one more great turning point in the story so we've looked at human societies life
the creation of planets and stars and that takes us back to the beginning obviously nothing could
obviously nothing could have existed if the universe itself had not been created the universe
we now know was created about 13.7 billion years ago stars were formed from great clouds of hydrogen
and helium atoms which like the force of gravity itself were created at the moment of the creation
of our universe this is the first turning point of all the first threshold of all
and in many ways it's the most mysterious our universe began as a tiny hot expanding ball of
something that popped out of nothingness like an explosion and the explosion which cosmologists
call the big bang has continued ever since you and i and the planet we live on are simply part of
the debris that's the very beginning of the story and we can't go further back in time
