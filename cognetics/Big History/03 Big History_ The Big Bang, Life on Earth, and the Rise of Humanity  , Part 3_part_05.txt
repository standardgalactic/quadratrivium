these may be comparable perhaps with the political systems of afro-eurasia in the second millennium
bce here's one reason for saying that you remember ryan target peras estimates of the areas incorporated
within major states well he estimates that the inca and the asthec controlled empires extended
extending over about two megameters and you'll remember that a megameter is about the size of
modern egypt this is considerably less than the size of the achaemenid empire of the first millennium
bce but it's larger than the largest empires of the second millennium bce in afro-eurasia about
3000 years earlier so again there's a rough correspondence between the asthec and the inca
and the larger empires of the second millennium bce in afro-eurasia there are also many other other
minor minor differences between them there are there are cultural differences differences in
ritual practice differences in the way calendars are used and so on yet there are also many striking
similarities in both zones agriculture appeared independently in several regions and when it
appeared it led to population growth increasing exchanges and the evolution of towns cities
states and empires as these large communities evolved and got denser and denser and denser
new problems had to be faced and in both regions and in all these regions they seem to have led
to similar solutions so the result was in both world zones within about two millennia of the
first appearance of agrarian civilizations in about 1500 CE in the case of the americas it is likely
that agrarian civilizations had come to include most of the populations in their respective world
zones within about two millennia of appearing agrarian civilizations include most people in
the world zones in which they've appeared furthermore in both zones agrarian civilizations shared the
same basic emergent properties and we've seen this list before they include cities militarized states
writing systems monumental architecture in fact one of the most striking of these emergent properties
is the fact that pyramids appear in the americas as early as the Olmec period
there are also tribute taking systems and extensive networks of exchange
there's also evidence as we've seen particularly spectacular from the Maya collapse or the collapse
of the of Moche civilization may represent the same phenomenon of long-term patterns of rise
and fall reminiscent of the Malthusian cycles of Afro-Eurasia so there's a good reason to think
that the Malthusian cycle is a pattern we find in both these world zones and that suggests that
in the americas as in Afro-Eurasia though there was clearly innovation on a long trend nevertheless
it was too slow to avoid eventual periodic demographic ecological and political collapses
so what do these similarities suggest they suggest that similar drivers are operating in both
zones collective learning drove innovation leading to population increase which generated a common
set of problems and opportunities and eventually yielded parallel solutions and outcomes if this
is true there is indeed a long-term shape to human history and the comparison between these regions
illustrates that fundamental truth about human history so we've seen that despite many important
differences there were striking similarities in the histories of these different world zones
in which agrarian civilizations evolved and this suggests that in all zones similar forces were
at work even if the pace of historical change was significantly different now we start to explore
how these forces shaped what i'll call the modern era of human history thank you
lecture 38 threshold 8 the modern revolution
let's clamber back on board our combined space and time machine orbiting the earth
we used it to survey the 4 000 years of the later agrarian era and what we saw from the machine
was the slow expansion of agrarian civilizations and we also saw their characteristic rhythm
of rise and fall this pattern of malthusian cycles and we noticed one other crucial thing we
noted the the strange parallels between the histories of different world zones as well as some
of the significant differences in the pace of change now what we're going to do is to take a
quick look at the next thousand years for a few centuries it's pretty much plain sailing it all
looks fairly familiar though in several regions both in afro-eurasia and the americas we can see
population expanding quite rapidly and some large and powerful empires appearing particularly
striking are the mongol empire which reached in the mid-13th century from korea to eastern europe
and in the americas the aztec and inka empires then things seemed to suddenly go very strange
from 1500 onwards the pace of change accelerates suddenly the isolation of the different world
zones is broken in the first phase of what today we call globalization the world suddenly comes
together it's interlinked for the first time in human history then from about 1700 changes appear
that within 300 years will have transformed the entire world population numbers go crazy
now it's tempting to think that if the appearance of the first cities and states parallel star
formation the modern revolution is like a supernova it's breaking down existing structures and
it's scattering new elements into space but even this image doesn't really capture the creative
aspects of the modern revolution here are some of the more astonishing things we'll see some of
the more astonishing changes that we'll see from our time and space capsule one of the most
astonishing is changes in the number of human beings on planet earth in 1000 ce there are 250
million humans on earth by 1700 there are almost 700 million by 1900 there are 1.6 billion and by
2000 there are 6 billion of us in my own lifetime human populations have increased by 3.5 billions
and remember just a thousand years ago the total population on earth was just 250 millions
as lin margulis and dorian sagan put it humans have become a sort of mammalian weed and carlo
chipola comments that a biologist looking at the diagram showing the recent growth of world
population in a long-range perspective is almost bound to say faced with this graph
that what they're seeing is the curve of a microd population in a body suddenly
struck by an infectious disease and chipola ends by commenting the basilis man is taking over the
world we see huge cities begin to light up around the world and by some estimates total global output
of goods and services may have increased by a hundred times in just 250 years that it helps explain
why despite rapid population growth somehow most of these people are still being clothed fed and
housed and though many live in dire poverty considerable numbers live at higher material
living standards than ever before this is the world we live in today now what is it about this
new world that allows it to support such staggering numbers of human beings clearly by now we're no
longer in the agrarian world we've crossed a new threshold we've crossed the eighth and final
threshold of this course and i will call this threshold the modern revolution what this lecture
does is introduce the idea of the modern revolution and try to suggest how we might begin trying to
both understand it to grasp its essence and to explain how it happened so what is the modern
revolution well the modern revolution is a simple answer is that the modern revolution is the series
of explosive changes we saw from our time and space machine but can we get a slightly more
precise grip on this astonishing phenomenon well let's begin with chronology let's clarify
chronology first the modern era is the third of our three great eras the first two being
the paleolithic era which lasted about 200 000 years and the agrarian era which lasted about
10 000 years the modern era has lasted so far remember it's still continuing just a few hundred years
of course all periodizations are somewhat arbitrary but for the sake of clarity let
me set out the periodization that i'm going to use in the lectures that follow i'll suggest
that we define the modern era as having started about 300 years ago in 1700 now that's of course
a slightly symbolic date but i pick 1700 because that is when we first begin to see in some regions
of the world a transition to radically different types of society that are capable of extraordinarily
rapid rates of innovation and change however the roots of change lay in the previous millennium or
so so our explanations of the appearance of the modern era era will begin almost a thousand years
earlier sometime in the first millennium c e as for the period after 1700 i'm going to divide it
into two main sections the first extends approximately from 1700 to 1900 in this period parts of the
world particularly in europe and the atlantic region were transformed and as a result of that
transformation they acquired unprecedented wealth and power the second period begins in about 1900
and it embraces the 20th century and the early years of the 21st century in it modernity began
to transform the rest of the world as well so what we've seen is that within just 300 years the entire
world has been transformed the speed and comprehensiveness of this change is itself one of the most
striking features of the modern revolution remember it took 200 000 years for paleolithic
populations to spread around the world it took 10 000 years for agrarian civilizations to transform
transform much of the world the impact of the modern revolution has been felt within just three
centuries okay definitions now let's try and zero in on what we mean by this phrase the modern
revolution let's begin with the reality that today's world is simply radically different from the world
of 1000 years ago now i could pick a million examples let me just pick one random but spectacular
and i think rather important example of what i mean we've seen that our unique ability to adapt
and change as humans depends on what i've called collective learning this is the ability to swap
information with great efficiency and i've argued that this is fundamental to our ability to adapt
and change 800 years ago the fastest way of transporting information from community a to
community b of transporting information over a large area was along the courier systems established
throughout the mongol empire marco polo gives a wonderful description of these they were one of
the major political projects of the of the mongol empire and the rulers of the mongol empire regarded
this post-war system as extremely important marco polo estimated that couriers could travel if
necessary as as fast as 250 miles a day changing horses perhaps every 25 miles but frankly this
was really no faster than the post-war systems of the achaemenid empire which we heard herodotus
describing the thought that just a few centuries after marco polo an ordinary citizen might be able
to communicate instantaneously with another citizen anywhere in the world or even if they really
wanted to that they might be able to fly to the other side of the world in less than 24 hours
would have seemed the purest fantasy yet that's the world we live in today it's a world in which
exchanges on a global scale of information collective learning in fact can take place
instantaneously around the entire globe i've called the modern revolution one of our eight
main thresholds and this is because it does indeed count as a revolution in complexity and we've seen
already eric scheson's calculations of energy density flows carry the implication if they're
accurate that modern human societies may be one of the most complex things we know so we're
describing the modern revolution we're watching the creation of this astonishingly complex phenomenon
in what ways does this count as more complex well first modern society has more structure
than any earlier types of human communities just one illustration is the huge variety of roles
that are available to individuals in this world it's much greater than it was in the agrarian world
where the majority of people were peasants and the structures of the modern world now are not
just local or regional they're global they extend across the entire world think of the
astonishing organizational and technological challenge of keeping a modern city going like
new york or beijing or Mumbai it's staggering there's nothing like it in the agrarian era
so first the simply more structure the modern world involves more complex components more
components and they're linked together in more complex ways second modern societies mobilize
and use energy flows many times greater than those typical of earlier eras of human history
now here's just one calculation that tries to give some feeling for this
Ian Simmons estimates that humans today may be using on average per capita
almost 10 times as much energy as his calculation for humans who lived a thousand years ago
yet in the same period human populations have risen by about 24 times from about 250
millions to about six billions now what that suggests is that total energy use today if these
figures are right is about 10 times 24 or about 240 times what it was just 1000 years ago and of
course the key to this is the use of fossil fuels third we've seen there's more structure we've seen
there are far greater energy flows third associated with the modern revolution is a spectacular range
of new emergent properties this is where the analogy with the super supernova works quite
nicely supernova we saw spilled new chemical ingredients into the universe these properties
we could spend a long time listing them they include the ability to fly to communicate instantly
across the globe they include the existence of cities of 20 million people they include also
weaponry capable of obliterating these same cities in a few minutes so we can also say
there are new emergent properties now what about stability the fourth element in complexity how
stable are they now that's an interesting question which we're going to have to leave
hanging in the air because all of this change is so rapid that as yet we don't really know the
answer to that question okay can we pin down these changes can we define their essence now the
trouble is there've been so many of them they're so various they've transformed human life in so
