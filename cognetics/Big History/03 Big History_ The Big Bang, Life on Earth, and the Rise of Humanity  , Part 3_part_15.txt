measures have increased in the 20th century faster than other measures of productivity
another feature of the era of the 20th century is that capitalism emerges as a dominant social
and economic system but capitalism also began to evolve in the 20th century in striking new
ways and i want to try and describe these carefully i've argued that capitalism that is to say a
particular distinctive type of social structure with entrepreneurial elites and a mass of the
population that depends on wage wage earners linked through market activity i've argued that this
type of social structure was a fundamental driver of the modern revolution that conclusion looks
even more plausible after the collapse of the communist societies that had seemed for a time
to offer an alternative to capitalism yet the impact of capitalism was contradictory for
while it generated unprecedented material wealth it also generated new forms of poverty
and there's a very good reason for this this is because in capitalist societies
innovation is driven by the gradient in wealth and power between entrepreneurs who own significant
capital resources and wage earners whose main asset is their own labor now there's a striking
parallel here to what we saw when discussing entropy where we saw that in the natural world
change is driven by energy gradients that can do work on a level level playing field not much
can happen the same is true in some sense of capitalism without significant degree of inequality
without some inequality capitalism cannot work in the wealthiest capitalist societies 20th century
capitalism evolved into a new form that we can describe as consumer capitalism and this constitutes
i think one of the most important and fascinating transformations of the 20th century so let me
try and describe very clearly what i mean by consumer capitalism let's go back to carl marx's
analysis of capitalism he and his disciples had argued roughly speaking that as capitalism developed
increasing numbers of people within capitalist societies would be impoverished and their declining
living standards would generate revolutionary movements that would eventually overthrow
capitalist societies throughout the world and now writing as he did in the 1840s and 50s and 60s
this was not a completely implausible picture of the world and his his good friend friedrich engels
remember wrote an astonishingly bleak account of working class life in manchester but from the
perspective of the early 21st century it's clear that his prediction was wrong despite the spread
of communist societies in the middle decades of the 20th century his prediction has proved improved
wrong why what happened what went wrong with it well what happened i think was this as 20th century
capitalist societies developed instead of impoverishing their own working classes as marx had expected
the most successful capitalist societies began to raise the living standards of their own populations
and we can think of this as a sort of learning curve for the managers and rulers of capitalist
societies it's as if they were slowly learning the best ways of managing this new type of society
consumer capitalism raised the living standards of many in the richer capitalist countries rather
than depressing them why well marx had missed something that eventually would become very clear
to industrialists such as henry ford to economists such as john maynard canes
and to politicians such as franklin delano roosevelt and it was this
as productivity rose as it began to outstrip population growth producers found they had
to work harder and harder to find markets for all the stuff they were producing
this is like the sorcerers apprentice they're producing so much stuff that eventually for the
first time in human history the problem of marketing that stuff becomes the fundamental
problem rather than the problem of producing enough stuff early 20th century pioneers such as henry
ford began to perceive that if you're looking for for new markets wage earners themselves
provided a huge potential market but they could only purchase goods if their wages rose
so what this meant was instead of making profits by cutting wages and that's the model of capitalism
that marx had in mind perhaps the way to ensure future profits was actually to raise wages
to ensure that wage earners in your society could purchase all the goods you were producing
with their labor and this meant that if this was true it was in the interests of capitalists to
raise wages and increase consumption now similar arguments were tested in the american new deal
which put money into people's pockets through for example unemployment pay or huge state projects
it these arguments were also developed in the work of economists such as john maynard canes and
we can see all of this as part of this sort of learning curve of learning how to manage modern
capitalism in the most developed capitalist societies led by the usa average consumption
levels began to rise in fact in the u.s you can see this already in the late 19th century creating
not the impoverished working class that marx had expected but instead a large affluent class of
of wage earners and professionals and what that affluence did was to deflect the revolutionary
zeal that marx had expected to develop amongst wage earners as wage earners became more and more
prosperous they became more contented supporters of a flourishing capitalism in other words the
high living standards of flourishing capitalist societies which is made possible by their rapidly
increasing productivity have effectively deflected the revolutionary impulse that marx believed would
bring them down so what we're saying is the consumer capitalism means a capitalism in which
wage earners are not just a source of profit they are also an important market with the result
that consumer capitalism generates increasingly high material living standards for a larger and
larger percentage of the population in flourishing capitalist societies but this more mature form
of capitalism generated some odd new phenomena for the first time in history major economic crises
and the most major economic crisis of all was the depression of the 1930s began to be caused
not by underproduction not by not producing enough but by overproduction and this is one of the most
distinctive features of consumer capitalism what this has done is to create created an entirely
new rhythm of rise and fall we saw that crises in the era of agrarian civilizations were caused
largely by underproduction by the failure to produce sufficient resources that led to famine to
disease to conflict over scarce resources and eventually to the sort of crash that you find
regularly at the end of a Malthusian cycle the major crises in the capitalist heartland
have been caused by the opposite phenomenon by the fact that production was outstripping
population producers found it harder and harder to market goods profits began to fall and leading
to widespread bankruptcy and the whole system threatened to break down this is commonly known
as the business cycle but to emphasize the parallel with the Malthusian cycle of the later
agrarian era we might perhaps christen it the Keynesian cycle after John Maynard Keynes the
economists who analyzed the causes of crises such as the Great Depression and suggested ways of
dealing with them by helping consumers to consume more through for example the provision of unemployment
payments Keynesian cycles in their turn generate a whole series of new phenomena one of which is
massive advertising if the main problem of keeping the economy going is not to produce enough but to
sell enough then advertising clearly has to play a crucial role in a sense I sometimes feel that
the advertiser today plays the role of the medieval preacher but what the advertiser preaches is
consume because if you don't there'll be a crisis that of course is a message diametrically
opposite to the messages of thrift that were offered to most people except members of the
ruling elite throughout most of the agrarian era consumption in the era of consumer capitalism
has become a virtue and that we will see may prove to be a problem if we discover that there is in
fact a limit to how much we can consume yet on a global scale the gap between the rich and poor
continued to widen as some areas of the world became astonishingly rich between 1913 and 1992
the gap between average income levels in the poorest and the wealthiest countries
grew from 11 to 1 to 72 to 1 the gap began to widen between regions here's just one extreme example
in 2000 per capita national income in the usa was about 34 000 in bukina faso in west africa
a landlocked country with a largely peasant population it was about 210 about one 150th of
the u.s. level poverty in third world countries affected health and life expectancies in 2000
life expectancies in the u.s. were 74 for men and 80 for women in bukina faso there were 45 for men
and women land shortage provides a powerful illustration of the destructive power of capitalism
in more traditional agrarian societies the british journalist paul harrison in the in the 1980s
met and interviewed a 60 year old farmer called mumuni in bukina faso and mumuni had lived through
several stages in the growing crisis that's ruined much of the traditional croplands across the
southern borders of the sahara here's what mumuni told harrison populations had grown
but the amount of land available had not so as populations grew the amount of land available
to each household and each individual had declined very very sharply mumuni remember that when he
was a child only 12 people lived in his father's compound now there were 34 with five young men
working away from home on the ivory coast mumuni eventually took paul harrison out to show him
his land and what harrison saw was that mumuni and other farmers like him were being forced to
cultivate land in ways that even they knew were completely unsustainable because they had to keep
land in crops when it needed to be in fallow and this is what this is what harrison saw even
close into the compound the soil looked poor enough stony and dusty without a trace of humus
and this was the only area they ever fertilized with the droppings of a donkey and a couple of
goats outside a circle of about 50 yards diameter around the houses the ground was a dark red
baked hard it had been cultivated the year before but had yielded very little mumuni said
he didn't think anything would grow there this year so we've seen that the pace of change continued
to accelerate in the 20th century and many did very very well with the flourishing of consumer
capitalism but there was another side this this flourishing capitalism could also be
profoundly destructive particularly to those continuing to live in traditional ways is this
widening gap between the very rich and the very poor sustainable that's one of the questions we'll
start tackling in the next lecture thank you
lecture 44 the world that the modern revolution made
where are we where have we got to we've surveyed the rapid and turbulent changes that created
the modern world now as we did with the era of agrarian civilizations we need to try and
stand back and get a sense of the overall shape of the world that was created by the modern revolution
how different is our world from that of 1700 how different was it from the world of the preceding
5000 years that had been dominated by agrarian civilizations before we can seriously tackle the
question of how sustainable modern society is we need to try to get a clear idea about some of its
basic structures and we've described a number of distinct types of human communities in this course
we've described the foraging communities of the paleolithic these tiny nomadic kin organized groups
of the paleolithic we've described the village communities of the early agrarian era we've
described nomadic pastoralist communities and we've described the large communities of the
agrarian civilization so very broadly that gives us already four quite distinctive types of human
societies now can we sort of describe modern society in the same way can we identify some of the
key distinguishing features of today's world can we look at this new world as it were from a distance
and see what are the key distinguishing features of it now in fact doing so is extraordinarily
difficult it's much more difficult than doing so for earlier communities part of the problem is that
we're in the middle of change we still can't see the overall shape of the modern revolutions we've
seen so we're in the middle of it and because of that also we don't have the detachment that we might
have when we look say at agrarian civilizations we're in the center of it we it's very hard to
stand outside and pick out its main features besides the modern world has evolved so rapidly
that it's very hard in the in the extreme flux and complexity of this world to pick out those
features that are likely to be most durable so having said that we still have to try to get a
grip on the main features that distinguish modern society from those of earlier human history so
here goes here's my attempt now the first feature i'm going to focus on is the speed of change
i've argued that at the center of the modern revolution is an extraordinary acceleration
in rates of innovation in what i've also referred to as the synergy of collective learning and this
extraordinary acceleration in innovation has meant a sort of speed up it's meant a sharp increase
in the pace of history now let's try and try and see some aspects of that speed up what the speed
up means is that our world the world created by the modern revolution the world we live in today
is exceptionally changeable as constant innovation constantly undermines existing structures and
creates new structures so history itself moves much faster in the modern era now here's here's one
way of seeing this we've taken the symbolic date of 1700 for the beginning of the modern era
and if we accept that date what it implies is that so far the modern era has lasted
just over 300 years that's about a third of a millennium now because so much historical
scholarship is about the modern era it's all too easy to forget how short a period this is
