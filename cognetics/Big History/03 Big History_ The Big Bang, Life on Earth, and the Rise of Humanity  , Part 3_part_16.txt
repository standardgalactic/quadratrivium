now if you think about it one third of a millennium is about one thirtieth of the length
of the agrarian era and it's about one six hundredth of human history as a whole if we
go to the scales of big history we've seen that if we collapse the history of the universe into 13
rather than 13 billion years the modern era counts for no more than six seconds six seconds in
13 years so it's just an instant yet in this instant human societies have been utterly transformed
around the entire earth and that's why the modern revolution counts as one of the eight
great thresholds in this course the remarkable pace of change in this era contrast sharply with the
relative stability of most earlier types of human community and the pace of change this
acceleration in the pace of historical change has also had a profound impact on ways of thinking
and we could even say on ways of experiencing the world in looking at the paleolithic world
or the world of agrarian civilizations it was possible to pick out features that persisted
over many thousands of years in the case of paleolithic societies we could pick out features
such as the existence of nomadic kinship communities that may have lasted for 200 000 years these
features in agrarian societies include the rhythms of peasant life or the basic structures of tributary
states or the malthusian cycles over the last five thousand years or the fundamental ideas of some
of the great religions they lasted for centuries some of them lasted for millennia now think of
asking the same question about today is it possible to identify any feature of today's world that will
certainly be present in say 500 years time now there may be features that will be present in 500
years time but it's extraordinarily difficult to pick them out with any assurance another aspect
of the pace of change is that now probably for the first time in human history major changes
radical change radical changes occur within the limits of a single lifetime and this changes
radically the way they're perceived what it means is that we can perceive large changes
as individuals not just through collective memory or through distant memory of changes in the past
but as individuals in my lifetime the world's population has grown by three and a half billions
communism has collapsed the computer revolution has transformed how we communicate with each other
and use information the world i live in today is a very different world for the world i was grown up in
so unlike all earlier communities we know the future will not be the same as the past and we've
experienced these changes this changeability affects our personal sense of both time and history
and in many ways it's one of the things that's shaped our idea of history and certainly shaped
our sense of big history we've seen many times in this course that before modern times most cosmologies
that is to say most descriptions of how the universe was tended to assume that there were many things
that were permanent eternal and unchanging the skies perhaps the landscape perhaps the heavens
the modern vision of a universe in which every aspect has a history including the universe itself
maybe one product of the now universal experience of constant change so the speed of change affects
how we experience the world and how we understand it it also means something else
it means that today's world is extremely unstable what some see as progress others may see as a
colossal accident waiting to happen things are changing so fast it's extraordinarily difficult
to know where they're going so the pace of change itself raises some deep questions about the
sustainability of modern society so that's the first broad feature about modern life the
quite exceptional pace of change the speed up in the last 300 years
now this speed up driven by acceleration in innovation has meant both destruction
and creation let's look at the destructive aspects first
above all above all what it's meant is the root and branch destruction of all previous human
life ways now this is not something that had happened before we saw that during the agrarian
era forages survived for the entire era so did communities of the early agrarian era one of
the first things the modern revolution has done is to destroy all previous life ways the
life ways of the paleolithic era the life ways of the agrarian era and also the tribute taking
political structures of the agrarian era even a century ago viable communities of forages
and early agrarian villages could be found in Papua New Guinea in the amazon in much of Australia
in South Africa and in other areas today it's reasonable to say that none exist outside a
modern state and what that means is even if they maintain some of their traditions some of their
cultures some of their beliefs they pay taxes they engage with modern markets they use modern
technologies after all why shouldn't 21st century australian aborigines hunt kangaroo using rifles
with telescopic lens lenses and four-wheel drive vehicles but perhaps most striking of all
is the destruction of peasant life ways peasant life ways we saw dominated the last 10 000 years
if you were dropped into the agrarian era randomly the odds are you would have been a peasant
roughly speaking we can assume that nine out of ten of all people in that era were peasants
and that meant that peasant life ways dominated the life experience of most people for the last
10 000 years what's happened in the last two or three hundred years is that a combination of factors
once again driven by innovation has undermined sapped and eventually is destroying that peasant
world the factors are a combination of overpopulation leading to land shortage as we saw in the case of
mumuni who lived in bukina faso competition from modern commercial agriculture is another
crucial factor now many many peasants of course still survive today but more and more of them
are being driven off the land often to end up in the huge shanty towns that surround many major
cities and in those shanty towns what do they find they find cities without sewerage clean water
electricity or police environments as dangerous and probably as disease-ridden as ancient uruk
the modern revolution has not just destroyed life ways a whole traditional way of living
it's also destroyed the political structures of the agrarian era the traditional tribute
taking states that dominated that era and one of the fundamental reasons is that we saw that
tribute taking states although they didn't rely exclusively on coercion did rely very heavily on
coercive methods of rule and now coercion simply no longer works in a highly commercialized world
as the fundamental way of managing entire societies i'll give just one illustration of this that seems
to me peculiarly powerful we also know that if you try to rule today as a traditional dictator
simply using ruling by brute force and skimming resources of the population you're probably
not going to survive long but a more powerful example is the collapse of the soviet command economy
and i've argued already that that can be interpreted in part as a result of the fact that
the communist command economy deliberately stifled commerce entrepreneurial activity
but by doing so it unwittingly stifled innovation in his book perestroika which he wrote in 1987
Michael Mikhail Gorbachev put it vividly the wheels he said seemed to be turning but nothing much
was happening this is these are the words he used something strange was taking place the huge fly
wheel of a powerful machine was revolving while either transmission from it to workplaces was
skidding or drive belts were too loose so here we see a modern state behaving in many ways like a
traditional tributary state and it's as if it can't quite get a purchase on the modern world and that's
why it collapsed so that's the second thing the destructive feature of modernity it's extraordinary
capacity to destroy traditional types of society but rapid change has also been extremely creative
so now i want to look at the creative aspect and above all i want to look at the way the modern
revolution has created new types of community and new power structures now here's the first
striking thing about the communities of the modern world this is the first thing that i think that
that someone surveying uh surveying human history over 200 000 years very fast and looking at the
size of communities is going to see they're going to see that modern communities are extraordinarily
large vastly larger than earlier communities here's just some illustrations of that
politically the modern world is organized into 194 sovereign states the united nations had 192
members in 2007 two states were missing which that's a great trivia question and the answer is the
Vatican city and taiwan so 194 distinct polities of these some were tiny some like lichtenstein were
very very small indeed but of these the most populous was china and in 2007 china had a population
of about 1.3 billion india's population at the same time was 1.1 billion so here we have a single
single states ruling more than a billion people and to put that in perspective remember that in the
year 1000 ce the total population of the entire world was about 250 millions that is to say it was
about one fifth of the population of a single state today modern china granted it's the most
popular state in the world these states also cover much more territory than the states of the agrarian
era in fact they cover the entire land mass of the earth with the exception of antarctica
though even control over antarctica is partitioned among a number of different states let's go back
to the figures of ryan target perot whose calculations we've used before even 1000 years ago he calculated
states and we're in the tribute in the later agrarian era when we say this states controlled as
little as 13 percent of all the territory controlled by modern states and the reason for this is that
vast areas including all of australia most of the americas syberia much of africa were not
within the control of tribute taking states now if these figures are correct what they're telling us
is that in the last thousand years modern states have taken control of the remaining 87 percent
of the earth's surface so the state system now covers the entire world and the result is that
unless they're islands like iceland or australia or britain or japan modern states tend to be
contiguous they're they're squashed together in a crowd so unlike most states of the agrarian era
which had borders that tended to be extremely fuzzy and porous and and could change from
year to year or even month to month as a result of varying military successes or failures
modern states have precisely defined and carefully policed and fenced off borders
now this what we've said about modern states also applies to modern cities estimates of the size
of the world's largest cities vary depending on varying definitions of city limits but roughly
speaking there may be 20 or 30 cities today with populations of more than 5 million now that remember
is the total population of the world 10 000 years ago so what we're saying is 20 or 30 cities today
contain what would have been the entire population of the world 10 000 years ago
and several cities today have populations of more than 10 millions mumbai the largest
may be approaching 20 millions and remember that 5 000 years ago cities such as ur
seemed remarkable with their populations of 20 to 50 000 so we're talking about cities
almost a thousand times as large as the first cities in the later agrarian era so size and scale
the scale and size of modern cities modern communities is extraordinary and again that
reflects innovation and the huge resources and populations of the modern era now a second
striking feature of modern communities is that they are to a remarkable extent integrated across
the entire world through exchanges of ideas of goods of diseases and people and what this suggests
is that the modern form of community let's rephrase this if we want to define the distinctive
community of the modern world one way of putting it might be to say that the modern form of community
is in reality a single global community of six billion people that is the modern equivalent
of the tiny foraging communities of the paleolithic era that global community is even to some extent
even though so far in a fairly rudimentary way organized politically the united nations is
just one of many political organizations that provide a modern equivalent of the meetings that
were held periodically between paleolithic communities so even politically modern societies
are to some extent organized at the global level you could mention many other forms of integration
including migration patterns cultural exchanges and so on at the the use of english as an international
diplomatic language one of the most striking aspects of this global integration is the fact
that collective learning now takes place globally modern forms of transportation and communications
allow real-time communication as we've seen between people at opposite sides of the earth
and what this means is that in principle the exchanges of information that have been the
main driver of human history are now taking place throughout the entire world within a very diverse
and often very well educated population of six billion people now if we add to this the ability
of sort of intellectual prosthetics such as computers to multiply the power of human thought
the effects are even more spectacular furthermore entirely new institutions have emerged to store
generate and disseminate in innovations they include universities the institution of mass
education in the 19th century and technologies such as the computer when earlier we compared humans
and their close relatives the great apes i argued that the difference between us and them was the
difference between a standalone computer which is limited by its own computing power and memory
and a networked computer which in principle has access to the computing power and memory
of millions of other computers a modern human with a networked computer has instant access to
much more information than were contained in the very largest of pre-modern libraries i remember
as a child lusting after the encyclopedia britannica but buying a set was a major financial
