that the sheer numbers of humans put pressure on the biosphere this is very positive because
what it suggests is that by the middle of the century global populations may level out at
eight or nine or perhaps 10 billion people you'll find different estimates but nothing like the
estimates of 15 or 16 or 18 or 20 billion people that were being checked around in the middle of
the 20th century now here's another trend a positive trend since the 1960s ecological awareness
has increased significantly one can be cynical about this but it's worth noting that in the
first half of the 20th century ecological issues were barely on the agenda of any government or
any significant international organization now today most governments have agencies concerned
with environmental issues there are many non-governmental agencies concerned with the issue
and there have been two international environmental summits in Rio in 1992 and in Johannesburg in 2002
now again one can be cynical about these but it's striking that these were the largest gatherings
of heads of state in recent years that's a sign of considerable seriousness
they've also been some notable successes one of the most spectacular was the 1988 international
agreement to reduce production of cfcs which damaged the ozone layer that protects the earth
from ultraviolet radiation the cfcs chlorofluorocarbons were invented in the 1920s it was not until
the 1970s that it was realized that they were beginning to have a damaging impact on the
environment this is an issue where the united states took the lead and one of the reasons was
was that by the 1980s alternatives had developed that could replace cfcs despite international
resistance to reform in 1988 for the first time very good scientific evidence came in
to show that there was a massive hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic and this provided
the wake-up call that enabled the international community to act seriously on the banning of
cfcs their production has declined very drastically and the best evidence at the moment is that the
hole in the ozone layer is at least not growing and may be even shrinking that's a good story and
it's a sign that international cooperation on some issues is possible and can be successful
and here's another good story despite the existence of nuclear weapons since 1945
we have avoided a global nuclear war this is one of those things it's hard to see because it's a
negative fact it's not something that that happened it's something that didn't happen
but we need to take it very very seriously indeed the world may have been close to an
all-out nuclear war two or three times the cuban missile crisis was the clearest example
and we need to congratulate those leaders who avoided that crisis
now what is the relationship between capitalism and all of this now here's a positive aspect
of capitalism capitalism may turn out to be part of the solution as well as part of the problem
recent centuries have shown capitalism's astonishing capacity to adapt to change
to mature to take new forms and to find social and technological solutions to new problems
and capitalism is particularly good at reacting to scarcity so as resources become scarce their
prices tend to grow and that tends to shift investment to enter to into alternative sources
of supply already now we see investment shifting towards technologies that may reduce dependence
on fossil fuels by improving alternative sources of energy such as wind power and it's possible
therefore that there's going to be a sort of economic bonanza in sustainable sustainable
technologies and capitalism has the flexibility as a driver to shift resources very quickly in
that direction it's interesting to watch the behavior of the large oil companies as they
increasingly present themselves as green organizations and some of them apparently quite
seriously are beginning to position themselves for the role of energy producers in an era of
sustainability and of course we shouldn't forget collective learning the collective brain of modern
humanity armed with the prosthetic brains we call networked computers counts as the most
powerful problem-solving intelligent entity we know of if there's a solution to the problems
that face us and that face Gaia the exchange of ideas between six billion and more humans
is surely likely to generate that solution which leaves the problem of politics whether or not
when we've seen the solution we will implement it many would argue that we can see the solutions
already we know what needs to be done but will we actually take the hard decisions needed to
implement them and will we be able to take them on a global level so though there are ominous
trends in our relationship with the environment and a real threat of a global Malthusian crisis
yet there's also glowing awareness of the dangers and of what needs to be done so perhaps there are
prospects that this is a maze which we can see our way through collectively as a global community
avoiding the fate of the islanders of Rapa under we thank you

lecture 47 the next millennium and the remote future
now the lens through which we view history is going to begin to widen and it's going to begin to
widen very very fast indeed as fast as you like in fact in this lecture we're going to look at a
larger chunk of time and a larger chunk of space than in any other lecture in this course so the
lens is widening very very fast we return now to larger scales like the ones we considered
early in this course in the first part i'm going to consider the next millennium then the second part
i'm going to consider the rest of time and we're going to ask about the future of the earth the
galaxy and the universe as a whole and we'll find that oddly when we look at this larger scale
it's possible to speculate scientifically about it in a way that's probably impossible
in thinking about the next millennium okay so first let's look at the next millennium the next
thousand years what can we say about the future at the scale of a thousand years well the first
thing we're going to see is on this scale we have far more questions than answers
we've seen that modern human societies are amongst the most complex things that we know of
and they're also extremely volatile and changeable and this means that though we can identify some
trends we know of none that are guaranteed to continue for more than a few decades so really
all we can do in looking at the next thousand years is to play with some different scenarios
and that's what i'm going to do some are scenarios for disaster for humans and perhaps for the entire
biosphere and some are scenarios for a more optimistic future at least from the perspective
of humans and also perhaps from that of the biosphere there's a wonderful novel that was
published in 1959 called Canticle for Libervitz and it was written by Walter M Miller here is
a wonderful disaster scenario what Miller did was imagine a world remember this is this is not
long after world war two Miller imagined a world in which societies evolved to the point where they
developed nuclear weapons at which point they used them the novel begins in the utah desert
in a world that should remind the reader of the european dark ages after the fall of the roman empire
this is a post holocaust world and the people of that world describe the holocaust as the flame
deluge a monk brother francis gerard discovers what the reader will recognize as a bomb shelter
from the 20th century and inside it he's going to discover some documents which turn out although
they can't be deciphered at the time to contain important information about nuclear physics
later segments of the novel take us forward several centuries two eras in which knowledge
is slowly building up again as it did in the european middle ages and through the renaissance
and the era of the scientific revolution until eventually we enter an era in which there is
sufficient scientific knowledge to once again build nuclear weapons and they are used again
so what happens is they hurl the world back into a new dark ages and what's clearly implied by the
novel is that this process is going to repeat itself over and over again now it's a it's an
intriguing scenario is this perhaps the fate of all species capable of collective learning
is there a limit to collective learning or at least the sort of bottleneck of some kind
beyond which it's hard to move is it that species capable of collective learning becomes so clever
that eventually they are inevitably going to do something really dumb like explode nuclear weapons
now if that's true if millers science fiction scenario actually has some relationship to
what's happened in the universe that might explain why we fail to detect other talkative
species like ourselves despite many decades of looking for them is it possible that the
dangerous knowledge that accumulates within a species like ours that's capable of collective
learning is bound to eventually outweigh the more creative knowledge that such species generate
or is it simply that such a species is eventually bound to construct societies of such complexity
that they're not sustainable now here's a second type of disaster scenario
and this is a non-human type of disaster geologists now understand that the earth's history has been
punctuated by periodic impacts from meteorites or asteroids such as the asteroid impact that
that wiped out most species of dinosaurs about 65 million years ago that this is what happened
was established actually quite recently in the 1980s and it was established largely through the work
of Walter Alvarez an American geologist who proved that at least one major extinction event in the
earth's history had been caused by massive asteroid impact this went against the grain of
current geological thinking so it was a very significant achievement to establish the truth of
this we now know that this can happen we saw that in the in the planet's early history
asteroid impacts were very common but they then became rarer as various objects moving around the
solar system was sort of swept up into into planets astronomers today are keeping a close
eye on any objects that could stray too close to us as we've seen before but it's by no means
certain that we have the technological capacity yet to deal with such a crisis despite the 1998
Bruce Willis film Armageddon so there's a natural disaster scenario now some scenarios
are more optimistic so let's look at some of those perhaps there's a whole cluster of scenarios
that go like this perhaps what will happen is that there'll be a sort of wake-up call it may take
the form of a near brush with disaster we can imagine perhaps a regional nuclear war
that will shock the world into a realization of the dangers it faces that scenario is described
very nicely in two good histories of the future one is by Warren Weigar a scholar of the work
of HG Wells and it's called a short history of the future and the other is a fascinating book by
Brian Stableford and David Langford called the third millennium in both these books you have
a human community that's deeply divided and then shocked into some sort of unified action on behalf
of its future by nuclear war and what that scenario suggests is that this shock may provide the
political will and the insight needed to avoid the fate of Easter Island humans will perhaps
deliberately start slowing consumption levels they'll find ways of living that can be satisfying
without putting too much pressure on the environment and they'll learn to live sustainably
within the biosphere they will redefine the good life so that increasing material consumption is
not an essential part of that dream of course doing so will require the rapid development
not just of the technological knowledge needed to generate energy and resources more sustainably
and to limit waste but even more importantly it will require the rapid development of mechanisms
that can enable humans throughout the world to coordinate what they do it'll involve turning
the embryonic human community of today into a more politically organized community that can act
with some sort of unity in dealing with major global issues now if we do indeed evolve in this
way the modern era as we've described it may turn out we just the prelude to an entire new epoch of
human history innovation may generate sustainable technologies that we can barely imagine they
may include new energy sources perhaps the taming of hydrogen fusion they may involve biotechnologies
that create new food sources that can eliminate most forms of ill health and that can prolong
human life that last scenario is worth thinking about because we've already seen the beginnings
of it in the 20th century what would it mean if each of us knew that we might live for a thousand
years or more or even indefinitely would the possibility of a sort of pseudo immortality
change our attitudes to ethics presumably so or to issues like suicide
if we knew that most people alive today will not die in the near future will it follow
that we should stop producing more human beings perhaps the having of children will cease to be
a normal human experience and what will that do to our sense of biological family clearly
a radical extension of life spans will mark a revolution in our understanding
of what a good human life means now we can imagine also the emergence of new social structures that
include improved mechanisms for reducing violent conflict and rely less on increasing consumption
on other more sustainable notions of progress and well-being as we've seen so these are all
optimistic scenarios now if we're trying to be just slightly more realistic we probably have to
agree that it's the in-between scenarios that are most likely to occur a real future which
will fall between these extremes being like all of human history a tale of both triumph and tragedy
of creation and destruction but exactly what form it'll take is anyone's guess now here's a question
