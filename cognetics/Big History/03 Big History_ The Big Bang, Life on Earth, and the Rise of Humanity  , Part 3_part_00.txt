Lecture 35 Long Trends, Disease and Malthusian Cycles
In the previous lecture, we saw that there was actually significant growth in the era
of agrarian civilizations and significant innovation, and that lecture showed that
there were several features, several structural features of agrarian civilizations
that encouraged innovation and growth. If that's true though, there's a problem
that a modern economist or economic historian will naturally stumble over.
If there was so much growth and innovation going on in the later agrarian era,
why didn't ancient societies innovate at the same rate as modern societies?
Why didn't they generate the astonishing material wealth of the most productive of
modern societies? What was wrong with them, frankly? Why were there such regular famines?
And why did civilizations seem to periodically collapse?
What we'll see in this lecture is that there were also important features of agrarian
civilizations, and often they were the same features operating in slightly different ways
that tended to retard growth. And it's these factors that help explain why no ancient
society showed anything like the productive dynamism of the most productive of modern
societies. So considering this question about the era of agrarian civilizations,
why growth wasn't faster will eventually help us understand better what is so distinctive about
the modern era. Because one of the things we'll see is that eventually in the last few centuries
it's as if the breaks were taken off. So why was growth so slow in the era of agrarian civilizations
by modern standards, and why was it so often followed by catastrophic crashes?
Now it may seem as if in the last few lectures I've been offering a story of progress, an
ever-onward and upward story of unending progress as collective learning leads to constant increases
in productivity. And we need to remind ourselves that the very large view of big history is capable
of hiding things as well as the small view. And what we've been focusing on is such large chunks
of time that we've missed the middle-range trends that are so familiar to what we can call the
rise and fall school of historiography. Many traditional historians saw history fundamentally
as cyclical, and this is because what they were aware of was the periods of decline as well as
the periods of growth. And we too need to take those periods seriously. A cyclical view of history
probably represented quite well the experience of contemporaries,
most of whom were peasants remember, for whom the cycles of the seasons or the
eras of feast and famine were by far the most striking rhythms of life.
What the large view of big history brings out more clearly is that despite these cycles
there were long-term increases in scale and productivity. But this long trend was not
necessarily apparent at smaller scales. In many eras and for many individuals decline it must have
been more apparent than growth. So why? What factors tended to slow innovation and growth,
and why did civilizations periodically break down? In this lecture we look at some of these
factors that tended to break down to nibble away at the complexity of the agrarian world.
We're looking in effect at the workings of the social equivalent of entropy.
So what we're going to look at now is these large cyclical trends and in particular what we're going
to look at is the causes for the decline, for the decline and fall of Rome or the rise and fall of
Chinese dynasties. Why these cycles? Now let's begin with with Shelley's poem Ozymandias.
It captures poetically this sense of decline, of periodic decline, of nothing being durable
in this era. Let me just quote Shelley's poem. Here's how it goes.
I met a traveller from an antique land who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert. Near them on the sand half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things the hand that mocked them and the heart
that fed and on the pedestal these words appear my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my
works ye mighty and despair nothing besides remains round the decay of that colossal wreck
boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away it's a wonderful evocation of the
decline of the greatest tributary rulers and the civilizations they built now as it happens
we know more or less who ozymandias was. Shelley wrote the poem in 1817 after hearing of the
imminent arrival in the british museum of a bust of pharaoh ramesses the second ramesses the great
ozymandias is probably a greek rendition of his egyptian throne name
ramesses the great ruled egypt for much of the 13th century bce the figure had been taken from
the tomb known as the ramaseum the temple that ramesses built for himself outside of thieves
which is modern luxor and you can still see the ramaseum now how can we explain these periodic
crashes what was it that consigned the glory of so many different ozy ozymandias to dust
apart from the periodic crashes of entire civilizations there's also a demographic
oddity about this era that needs to be explained we saw in an earlier lecture that our very very
rough estimates of world populations suggests that in the four thousand years of the agrarian
the era of agrarian civilizations world populations grew at about the same pace as in the early
agrarian era or possibly even more slowly they grew from about 50 millions to about 250 millions
this means they multiplied by about five times in four thousand years in comparison with the
multiplication of about 10 times in five thousand years during the early agrarian era indeed the
available evidence suggests that there was hardly any growth at all in the first millennium c e that's
the era after the decline of the roman and han chinese empires now if these figures are conveying
the right impression and they're so rough that they could well be deceiving us but if they're
conveying the right impression we have to ask why despite the innovation that undoubtedly occur
occurred in the later agrarian era and it included i'd remind you such things as the spread of the
secondary products revolution plough agriculture and the spread of irrigation why didn't populations
grow any faster okay let's look now at some of the factors that slowed growth and there were
doubtless many more factors than than the ones i mentioned but what we're going to see is that one
of the curiosities of this era is that some of the factors that encouraged growth in this era
were also responsible in different forms for checking growth now let's begin by looking at
the nature of tribute taking states and the political structures associated with tribute
taking states incidentally i'll be using the term tribute taking states and tributary states
more or less interchangeably tribute taking states we've seen could encourage growth
in several ways but they could also discourage it so the overall impact on growth was rather
contradictory they stifled growth in many subtle and not so subtle ways and here's the first
normally tributary rulers tribute taking rulers the kings and emperors of this world
were more interested in capturing wealth than in producing it a successful war
could generate wealth much more quickly and much more effectively than investment in infrastructure
and there's a very basic and simple reason for this this is an era in which rates of growth are so
slow that if you invest in growth you may have to wait several generations before you gain something
from it so the slowness of growth itself encouraged rulers to think of wealth as something to be seized
rather than to be generated or invested in now seeing themselves as capturers rather than
producers of wealth tribute taking elites as we've seen generally despised those who produced wealth
the peasants and the merchants of their societies and they took very limited interest in how goods
were produced and traded this is why we get so little so little work on economics from this period
the literate elites weren't terribly interested in such activities so these attitudes discouraged
policies that might have actively stimulated production and commerce the following quotation
illustrates these attitudes very very nicely indeed it comes from just over 1000 years ago
from a state at the very beginning of its career and that's the state of Kievan Rus the first great
state of Russia it's a chronicle account of a conversation that was overheard by Grand Prince
Vladimir whose dates are 958 to 1015 he was the prince who converted the early Rus to Christianity
now here's how it goes on one occasion after the guests were drunk i have to remind you that
the early rulers of ruse came from Viking ancestors and you can still see some of the
traditions of a Viking lord with his retinue in this account so on one occasion after the
guests were drunk his retinue began to grumble against the prince complaining that they were
mistreated because he allowed them to eat with wooden spoons instead of silver ones
when vladimir heard of this complaint he ordered that silver spoons should be molded for his retinue
to eat with remarking that with silver and gold he could not secure a retinue but that with a
retinue he was in a position to win these treasures even as his grandfather and his father had
sought riches with their followers so i hope you see the logic of this very very clearly the point
of the quote is that for vladimir as indeed for most rulers throughout the era of agrarian
civilizations for most tributary rulers force was the essential means of getting wealth that's the
reverse incidentally of today's world in which wealth is the means of buying force so that the
first priority of governments today is to encourage growth innovation in the agrarian era wasn't crucial
in an environment where rulers saw wealth as something to be captured by military power rather
than through the deliberate stimulation of economic growth now there's another aspect to this stifling
of growth by the structures of tributary societies and this concerns not the people at the top of
tribute taking states but the people at the bottom the peasants who were the foundation of all
tribute taking states as marx pointed out in his analysis of pre-capitalist states
tribute taking states had to ensure that peasants had access to land this was where all the wealth
came from so they needed peasants to be farming the land but what this did was to limit wage
earning employment it severely limited wage earning and he did one more thing it deprived peasants of
any incentive to raise productivity and the reason was they knew that any surpluses would be skimmed
by their overlords so imagine you're a peasant in one of the great agrarian civilizations you have
another child on the way last year's crop was small you suddenly have this feeling that you
really need to build up your economy and you've heard of a new crop you introduce it you work
very hard and you increase your crops what's going to happen well it's perfectly clear what's
going to happen is your overlords they may be the state they may be a private landlord as simply
going to say wonderful the peasants are producing more let's skim more often this is a world remember
in which the taking of wealth is much more arbitrary than it is in our world today where it's fenced
about with far more legal controls so in summary those who produce society's wealth
generally lacked the education the capital and the incentive to innovate while the elites who had the
education and the wealth generally despised productive or commercial activities and preferred
to take wealth rather than generate it outside the specialist domains of warfare and administration
this means tribute taking rulers took little interest in improved efficiency or innovation
so in both these ways the structures of tribute taking states could stifle innovation and growth
now let's look at the second major factor that could stifle innovation and growth
and that's disease leading to periodic sharp population declines patterns of disease frequently
checked the population growth that itself could be a major driver of growth in the later agrarian
era there are two interesting ways in which this could happen first cities are one cause of
population decline through disease now we've seen that cities could stimulate growth
they were they were huge centers for commerce they drew in commerce they attracted commerce
in this way they could encourage innovation and growth but they like tributary states could also
dampen growth and they did so by checking population growth and the reason is this
all towns in pre-modern societies in all agrarian civilizations were lethal places
death rates were much higher in most pre-modern cities than in the countryside and this means
that their populations had to be constantly replenished by immigrants from rural rural areas
now why was this so we've already seen some hints of this you think of the environment of a typical
pre-modern city diseases spread very rapidly in filthy crowded city streets human and animal
wastes accumulated in public places and waterways as no there's no sewerage system so where do these
ways go you tip chamber pots into the street or you tip them into the nearest river rivers were
treated as sewers and dumps but they were also sources of drinking water they were where people
washed and city air was often polluted by fires and manufacturing processes such as smelting or
tanning and remember this is a world in which people didn't understand how diseases were
communicated so systems of quarantine were very rudimentary and this means that the mere
existence of cities could dampen population growth now here's a second mechanism that could
dampen population growth through the spread of disease and that also is a mechanism that earlier
