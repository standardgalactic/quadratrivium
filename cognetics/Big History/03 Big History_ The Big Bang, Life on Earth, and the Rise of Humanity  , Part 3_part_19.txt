on landscapes in his environmental history of the 20th century which i've mentioned already
john mcneill has estimated that in that century humans became for the first time the single most
significant movers of earth with a greater impact on the reshaping of the landscape than all natural
forces including glaciation mountain building and natural erosion the main factor here was in fact
mining it had the largest impact and here's just one statistic to illustrate the spectacular
increase in mining in the 19th century coal production increased by about 77 times and in
the 20th century it increased by almost another seven times so that in a mere 200 years it increased
by more than 500 times and coal production means of course moving a lot of earth however other
factors including the building of roads and the spread of cities and their suburbs have also had a
significant impact on landscapes we also had a huge impact on other species if the megafaunal
extinctions of the paleolithic era have deprived the world of a large number of presumably beautiful
exotic and interesting organisms today our impact is vastly greater as we consume more resources
obviously less are available for other species so rates of extinction have accelerated very rapidly
during the last two or three centuries and here's a description by lester brown and he's describing
the situation in 1999 he writes of the 242 000 plant species surveyed by the world conservation
union in 1997 14 or some 33 000 are threatened with extinction of the 9600 bird species that
populate the earth two-thirds are now in decline while 11 percent are threatened with extinction
of the earth's 4400 species of mammals 11 percent are in danger of extinction
and of the 24 000 species of fish that occupy the oceans and freshwater lakes and rivers
one-third are now threatened with extinction now it's all too easy to let such figures just
just wash over you and that's very understandable but it's very important just to come away with a
sense of how huge our impact on other species are even our closest relatives the chimps are
perilously close to extinction and one way of getting a sense of the this impact is to note
that the rates of extinction today are comparable with the rates of extinction during the five or
six most spectacular extinction events of the last 600 million years paleontologists can see
these events in the rocks in the sudden disappearance of whole groups of fossils so we do have a
benchmark to compare what's going on today and human impacts are comparable for example to the
effects of the asteroid that wiped out most of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago our impact in
other words to put it dramatically is as significant in its way as that of a massive asteroid colliding
with the earth we've also had an impact on bacteria john mcneill points out that our relationship
with the bacterial world has been transformed in the 20th century indeed for much of the 20th century
humans engaged in a violent war with disease bacteria in which one of the most important
weapons was antibiotics the war was waged across the planet for many decades and it's still going on
but as he points out the outcome is not yet certain and the reason is that bacteria are fighting
back and they're using the techniques of natural selection and their rapid rates of reproduction
to outflank us and develop new disease resistant strains such as the strains of gold and staff
increasingly found to be immune to antibiotics and we saw that in the past we had an impact on
the atmosphere our impact on the atmosphere now has grown by leaps and bounds above all
through the massive use of fossil fuels now there's much debate over the details of this
process but there are some figures that are not in serious doubt and one concerns changes in the
amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere during the last ice age carbon dioxide accounted for
about 200 parts per million of the atmosphere by 1800 the level had risen to about 280 parts
and currently it stands at about 350 parts per million in other words since the beginning of the
modern era levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have doubled and if current trends
continue they're likely to double again to almost 600 parts per million by 2050
now there's very little disputing this some of this dispute is merely about the exact impact of this
increases in the amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide tend to raise atmospheric
temperatures because they absorb sunlight and retain it rather than allowing it to be reflected
back into into space and it's already been predicted that by the middle of the century
the north pole may be ice-free throughout the year so global warming is it increasingly
looks as if global warming is itself a direct consequence of human impacts on the environment
so in summary evidence is accumulating rapidly that we are now using more resources than the
biosphere can keep supplying and we're using them in ways that are having a massive impact on the
environment will this lead to the sort of ecological breakdown that we've seen many times in human
history except on a global rather than the local scale attempts to estimate our footprint that is
to say the amount of energy we use suggest that we're now using far more energy and resources
than the planet as a whole can sustainably reproduce this looks very dangerous indeed
so such conclusions show us starkly that human history is not separate from the history of the
earth because we are part of the complex global film of life that James Lovelock has called Gaia
Lovelock's controversial but influential idea is similar to the idea of the biosphere
Lovelock argued in a book published in 1979 and called Gaia that the entire biosphere can
usefully be thought of as if it were a single organism so Gaia in Lovelock's account is a
single organism that covers the entire surface of the earth and what Lovelock argues is that Gaia
has the capacity to regulate its environment and to make that environment life-friendly for example
he points out that that the sun has the temperature of the sun has increased over four and a half
billion years and yet at the surface of the earth the temperature has remained at about the level
necessary for liquid water to exist so his argument is that Gaia is more or less preserving the earth
in a form necessary for life to persist now Lovelock's been accused of a sort of mysticism
but his argument is that this is simply natural selection that what Gaia will do through natural
selection is remove those organisms that threaten its future so this is a view of evolution
in which the Gaia the biosphere is a single huge organism that has the power to expel
members of the biosphere that threaten its future this is a view of evolution
in which cooperation seems most of the time to be more important than competition between
species and that's where the warning comes for our species if indeed in our aggressive pursuit of
more and more resources we're inflicting great damage on the great super organism of Gaia
will Gaia eventually expel us as the white corpuscles of a healthy organism may be able to expel disease
bacteria we've seen that in the course of human history humans have used more and more resources
at accelerating rate is this a story of triumph or a sign of danger where is this all going
in the next two lectures we'll try to answer this question by peering into the future
lecture 46 the next 100 years
after surveying 13 billion years can we resist peering into the future i think not
indeed i'm going to argue that it's appropriate and necessary to do so in a course on big history
i began attempting lectures on the future in in this in this course when i first began teaching it
because of comments from some of the students i first taught big history to
some of the best students i taught told me at the end of the course that they felt that in a
course that surveyed 13 billion years it seemed very odd to refuse to look at the next 50 or 100
years how could we just stop on a dime in the present moment after all they argued we were
looking at such huge trends that surely some of them are going to continue into the future i mean
this is a bit like an oil tanker turning around an oil tanker is not going to stop suddenly so if
we look at these trends we ought to be able to say something about the future in any case some of
them felt that i'd left humanity hanging by a thread at the edge of a huge possibly malthusian
cliff and they felt i owed them some insights into where the story might be going next
once i thought about what they'd said i soon realized that they were absolutely right
because of its scale because of the scale on which big history looks at the past big history
cries out for discussion of future scenarios in a way that no other approach to history does
so now we had to try and think how i could lecture about the future as a historian i had been trained
in the idea that historians never think about the future they think about the past that's what
historians do and in fact some famous historians have argued that if you find a historian thinking
about the future you know that something's gone seriously wrong so in order to prepare these
lectures on the future i had to wrestle with my conscience as a historian and i had to try to
break some very old habits and i also had to try to ask some new questions why should we take the
future seriously and how should we think about the future as i worked on these lectures i soon
realized that historians seem to be more or less the only people who refuse to think seriously about
the future many human societies have taken the future very seriously indeed do you remember
the mayan calendars which were so accurate partly because a lot of politics depended
depended on predicting exactly the right day to do certain things or perform certain rituals
and even within modern society there are many professions that take the future very seriously
for example this is what the futures markets are all about and some of them even make pots of money
by doing so and after all money is the key test of seriousness in our society so one
reason for thinking about the future is that it really does matter all human societies have tried
to predict the future and many professionals in our own society from stockbrokers to gamblers
make a pretty good living by doing so now there's another reason why we need to think very clearly
about the future and that i guess is political it's that what we think about the future is going
to affect what we collectively do today now this means we need to be very clear what our ideas
are about the future where we think the world is going because the conclusions we reach may affect
what we do today and that could itself shape the future should we be so worried about global warming
that we begin slapping huge taxes on fuel consumption or should we be much more worried
about the possibility that such taxes will stifle growth these are the sort of questions
that we need to think about and they all involve predictions i also realized that in some sense
thinking about the future is something we do all the time in fact all living organisms
or all living organisms with sensory systems and brains think about the future and they do
so a lot of the time they have to and so do we every time you act you have to predict the outcome
of your action so whenever we act we have some idea in our mind about the likely consequences
of what we're doing and sometimes it's very important that we get these predictions right
so natural selection has designed organisms so that they're reasonably good at predicting let me
just give a trivial everyday example if i cross a busy road i move when i predict that no car is
moving so fast that it will hit me if i get it wrong i'll pay a very serious price for it so
there's nothing odd about trying to predict the future it's just that we need to think very clearly
about how we go about it so all of these arguments persuaded me that in fact it was perfectly
legitimate for a historian particularly in a course on big history to be thinking about the
future so now the question was how how should we think about the future well i formulated a number
of rules and i think they're very familiar to anyone who's in a position where they do have
to think seriously about the future here's the first it is that the future really is unpredictable
there are no sure bets now it may seem obvious but i have to say it because in the 19th century
there was a widespread belief amongst physicists that in some sense the universe was deterministic
if you knew the exact position of every particle in the universe and its exact movements
from then on you could predict the entire future of the universe we now know that this is wrong
and it's wrong at a very deep level 20th century quantum physics showed that at the very small
levels of subatomic particles and photons of light the world is not deterministic at all
in fact at that level there's a fair bit of wriggle room it's impossible sometimes to determine
exactly where a particle is and it may be that in some sense it doesn't have a precisely
defined position so indeterminacy unpredictability is built into the universe so that's why we
have to take very seriously the fact that the future really is open-ended and that means any
prediction we make is a sort of percentage game there are no guarantees rule two and rule two
is a rule rule that stop brokers and professional gamblers know very well
those who think carefully about the future are more likely to get it right more often
and as a result earn more money than those who don't so this is something worth thinking about
and very carefully and rule three is related to that the way to think about the future
is very often to begin with existing trends which is the point my students made to me right at the
beginning if you're betting on the horses a horse's form its track record what it's done over the last
year or two is not a perfect guide to performance but it's better than nothing it's a lot better than
nothing i once had a friend who made a living for many years betting on horse races this was his
