captain known to have circumnavigated the globe was Juan Sebasti√°n del carno he was a commander
in the fleet of ferdinand majelin and he returned to spain with the remnants of the fleet in 1522
majelin's fleet traveled around south america around caporn then across the pacific to the
philippines and it was here in the philippines that its commander ferdinand majelin was killed on
the island of cebu in battle with a local chief called lapu lapu now after these voyages for the
first time in history the world is united this sudden expansion of world markets stimulated
commerce and capitalism very very significantly even carl marx regarded this as a fundamental
turning point in the history of capitalism and that's why he writes world trade and the world
market date from the 16th century and from then on the modern history of capital starts to unfold
a lot of things happen these exchanges were significant almost immediately in the 16th
century they took the form or at least one form of these exchanges was what the historian alfred
crossby has called the columbian exchange a massive exchange of goods and people and diseases
between the americas and the afro-eurasian zone here are some of the things that exchanged american
crops such as maize potatoes manioc and tomatoes were quite soon being grown in many parts of
eurasia including china europe and africa and here they soon stimulated population growth because
they could often be grown in regions that were unsuitable for local staples so the effect of
introducing these crops was to widen the area that could be farmed and to increase total output of
food and other produce between 1400 and 1700 the populations of china india and europe all doubled
increase in trades stimulated commerce and capitalism in most of the old hub regions of
eurasia the eastern mediterranean the the the muslim world northern india and in china
as china's population and economy expanded it began to suck in silver for coinage and the 16th
century chinese governments began to demand that taxes be paid in silver and this had a huge impact
on the world economy that incidentally is a measure of how huge the chinese economy was
and what a significant driver it was of world economic change but this also benefited european
middleman who extracted the silver by force from american minds where did the silver come from
well much of it came from a single place potosi in modern bolivia the city was created when it was
discovered when when uh spanish colonists discovered that the region region around potosi
included a virtual mountain of silver and they discovered this in 1545 within 30 years potosi
had a population of 120 000 and it was certainly one of the largest cities in the world by then
in 1650 its population may have been 160 000 but after that it began to decline with a decline in
silver output at its height potosi was a brutal and violent place and potosi illustrates very well
the brutal some of the brutal sides of of of what i've called the columbian exchange this was
not a peaceful process indians were forced to labor in the mines and died in huge numbers from
overwork exposure and brutal treatment particularly children but they also died from mercury poisoning
the silver ore extracted from potosi was crushed then it was mixed with mercury
after which workers were forced to tread it into a compound with mercury
the mixture of mercury and silver ore was then heated to drive off the mercury leaving pure
silver and deadly fumes as locals died in huge numbers they were often replaced with african
slaves this is not a pretty story increasing commercialization began to transform the lives
of peasants in many areas now here's just an illustration from china and i've gone back
to mark elvin's book the pattern of the chinese past for this this quotation and here's elvin's
account of of how chinese peasants were increasingly sucked into markets and let me remind you that
what's going on here is that people who had been peasants are slowly slowly being transformed
into wage earners and that's a process that will continue and is continuing today in the early 21st
century increased contact with the market he writes made the chinese peasantry into a class
of adaptable rational profit-oriented petty entrepreneurs a wide range of new occupations
opened up in the countryside in the hills timber was grown for the booming boat building industry
and for the construction of houses in the expanding cities vegetables and fruit were
produced for urban consumption all sorts of oils were pressed for cooking lighting waterproofing
and even to go in hair creams and medicines sugar was refined crystallized and used as a
preservative fish were raised in ponds and reservoirs to the point where the rearing of
newly hatched young fish for stock became a major business growing mulberry leaves for silk making
did become a major business now once again what i hope that what that passage does is
illustrate the huge number of different ways in which peasants could find themselves slowly
sucked into market activities and on the slippery slope of becoming eventually wage earners
the emergence of a single global network of exchanges began to transform the global
geography of wealth and power and this is one of the major changes of this period
for most of the agrarian era we've seen the atlantic region was marginal to world history
in afro-eurasia the major centers were in the eastern mediterranean north india and china in
the american zone they lay in mesoamerica and the andes suddenly europe now finds itself at the center
of the first global world system and this is largely because of the role that european
merchants and european mariners have played in weaving the four world zones together european
merchants not only pioneered the first trans oceanic exchange networks but they also managed to
maintain control of them for several centuries europe itself is becoming more distinctive in
this period it's an odd world a durable pattern emerges in europe very different from that in
china at the other end of eurasia not of large unified empires that encourage the patterns of
tribute taking of traditional tributary states but something really rather different in europe what
you get is a durable pattern of small or medium-sized states that seem to be engaged in constant
competition this world ought to remind you slightly of the world of the song dynasty that i described
in the last lectures european rulers are ruling medium states they don't have colossal resources
available if they try to survive merely by exacting tributes from peasants and yet they face constant
warfare a very very competitive international political situation so they have to seek commercial
sources of revenue and the result is that european rulers find themselves generally more supportive
of commerce than the great empires of the muslim world or china someone like venice or genoa is
an archetype of a mercantile state but many of the cities of europe are sort of somewhere between
the two we have rulers whose attitudes very much look like those of traditional tributary rulers
but in fact they are becoming increasingly dependent on commercial revenues and increasingly
supportive of commercial activity with supportive governments and a central position in global
commercial networks european societies become increasingly capitalistic and their governments
become increasingly supportive of entrepreneurial activity above all on the international stage
of which europe now finds itself at the center in britain the slow transformations of society
that go on as a result of this increase increasing commercial pressure are evident from the remarkable
statistics assembled by greggory king who lived in the late 17th century his dates are 1648 to 1712
greggory king king is a fascinating figure and he's one of the pioneers of modern statistical
studies we're surrounded by statistics today we often forget how recent this barrage of statistics
is and greggory king is one of the crucial figures he worked for many years in the college of arms
it still exists it was founded in in the middle ages and what it does is it keeps records of the
coats of arms of british families and it may have been this position that gave him access to a lot
of important government information at the end of the 17th century in 1696 king compiled a manuscript
called natural and political observations upon the state and condition of england in it he
estimated the population and wealth of england and wales he also offers statistics on demographic
facts such as the numbers of those in different classes the numbers of people of different ages
the percentage of those who are married and so on as an aside he also attempted to calculate the
amount of beer drunk each year king statistics are a wonderful treasure trove for modern uh
historians of 17th and 18th century britain and here are some of the things that come out of these
statistics according to king in 1688 43 percent of the british population consisted of and i quote
cottages and paupers or of laboring people and out servants it may not be immediately obvious why
this is so striking but what king is really saying here is that almost half of britain's population
had no land and had to survive entirely from wage labor cottages and paupers laboring people and
out servants these are not fully viable peasants who are supporting themselves from the land these
are people who might look like peasants but they're really at the margins and most of their
income has to come from wage labor of some kind now that's very striking if you remember our rule
of thumb that roughly speaking nine out of every ten people in agrarian civilizations were probably
peasants here we have a society in which 40 to 50 percent seem to be wage earners of some some type
in modern studies many of them using some of king's statistics suggests that in the late 17th
century more than half of british national income came from commercial activities of various kinds
by the early 18th century most of the revenues of the british government came from commercial
sources and this ensured that the british government would aggressively back commerce
and the importance of commerce was evident also from the many merchants in the british
parliament of the 18th century so here we have a society which in many ways still looked like a
traditional tributary society but if you start looking more closely at flows of wealth sources
of revenue and so on you find a society that is becoming increasingly commercialized increasingly
capitalistic so at least in some areas of the world we find capitalist social structures are
becoming more dominant commercial activity is spreading widely and in the world as a whole
we've seen global networks have stimulated exchange and commerce on a huge scale now
if indeed these drivers capitalism commerce expansion of state of exchange networks
are flourishing are more and more visible in this era shouldn't this be stimulating innovation
shouldn't there be there being a sharp acceleration in global rates of innovation
is there well here the evidence really is ambiguous there were significant improvements
in shipping in this period and in military technology this is after all the era of the
gunpowder revolution also in mining and in instrument building of various kinds and you
could list a number of other fields but in general global rates of innovation appear to have remained
fairly sluggish populations grew less because of significant innovations than because of other
changes such as for example the introduction of American crops or government backing for the
settlement of new lands from Siberia to South America in the early modern period there's a
mass of government activity designed to support migration to new areas the Russians are supporting
emigration to Siberia the Chinese are supporting emigration to underpopulated regions of China
the Europeans are supporting emigration to the Americas
it may seem that the European scientific revolution is an exception
so we need to consider this the European scientific revolution itself may well have
been a product in part of the torrent of new information that flowed through European societies
as Europe found itself at the center of the first global network of information
after all think of the implications of this suddenly Europe finds itself a sort of clearing
house for information from around the world no society in previous human history has actually
had access to information from around the world information about new cultures different technologies
different religious beliefs different types of people different types of societies and this
is what's happening in Europe in the 16th and 17th century suddenly this is torrent of new information
much of it completely unexpected it's almost as if new planets had been discovered
what's the impact of this bound to be well the main impact seems to have been
to encourage European thinkers philosophers natural scientists even theologians to start
questioning authority so many of the things that traditional knowledge had said about the world
have turned out to be wrong that increasingly European natural philosophers find themselves
saying well where's the evidence and this is what bacon says loud and clear where's the evidence
so this is the start of what we've seen throughout this course this commitment to knowledge based
not on authority but evidence so this is an immensely important transformation yet the
crucial thing is that as yet and probably not until the 19th century science had very little
impact on technological innovation only the 19th century for the first time you start getting
factories for example setting up labs to research innovation so for a surprisingly long period
science had a rather limited impact on technological innovation now let's look at the smaller the
other world zones outside afro-eurasia what was the impact of this global unification on them
and the short answer is it was catastrophic we've seen that there are ways in which the
afro-eurasian zone flourished as a result of this unification of the world in other regions the
