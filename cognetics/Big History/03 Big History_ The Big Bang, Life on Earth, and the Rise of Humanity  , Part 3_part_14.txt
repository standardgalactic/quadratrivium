and continues into the early 20th century so we've already met this wave it began to transform
regions well beyond the new atlantic core region notably in russia and japan this is the era in
which russia and japan both begin to industrialize very very rapidly in russia as in north america
railways and above all the trans-siberian railroad completed in 1904 played a critical role in
integrating societies in integrating above all the economy over a vast region remember the russian
empire was by far the largest united state unified state on earth both japan and russia in this period
underwent revolutionary transformations and they became major industrial and military superpowers
now that's the fourth wave and we've already looked at it then something slightly odd happens
there's something was slowed down that affects global growth for much of the first half of the
20th century it's as if the engine of growth that seems to have been fired up in the last two
centuries suddenly seems to stall in an era of global wars and global depression global
rates of growth of growth slow the international trading system which had been one of the main
drivers of growth in the late 19th century begins to break break down as states begin to try and
carve out their own economic zones in the fate in the era of imperialism
exactly why the slowdown occurred is not entirely clear but here's just one possibility
it is that capitalist rulers had to learn how to manage capitalist states after all
this is very new now we saw that tributary rulers had to learn the best ways of managing
tributary states and it took them a long long time the rulers of capitalist states are on a
similar steep learning curve and in the late 19th century it's as if they were still operating with
at least some of the habits of the tributary era and one of them was the habit of thinking that
there was only so much wealth to go around and that they better get their share by military force
if necessary and that may explain the burst of imperialism in the late 19th century during which
major capitalist states carved up much of the world in a vicious competition for control of new
colonies it illustrates this increasingly coercive or militaristic attitude it illustrates an attitude
that sees force like the tributary era as the key to growth rather than effective
economic competition it will see that in the 20th century capitalist states began to slowly
realize that in the modern world under modern conditions economic competition could often
stimulate growth more effectively than military competition but that was in the future meantime
there's no doubt that globally growth slowed global wars would dominate the first half of
the 20th century slowing growth rates particularly in the european hub lands the wars incidentally
demonstrated the extent to which what we can call perhaps the productivity of weaponry had also
increased as a result of the modern revolution 19th century military innovations ensured that
world war one would be particularly bloody new weapons included machine guns tanks airplanes
and chemical weapons such as mustard gas which could effectively burn out the internal organs
of its victims and ironically improved medical systems kept more troops at the front only to
be slaughtered in the thousands by machine guns or artillery in often futile raids on enemy positions
however the second world war in many ways was even more destructive about 60 million people
may have died in world war two and what world war two introduced to warfare was the refinement of
systematic bombing of civilian targets most casualties of world war two were civilians
as the aerial bombing of cities became for the first time a recognized weapon of modern warfare
the extreme brutality of the war and the extreme potential and the potential for brutality of
modern states found the most potent symbol in the systematic murder by hitler's nazi party
of almost six million jews in what has come to be known as the holocaust the war ended of course
with the use of the first atomic weapons in japan the first atomic bombs were dropped on the japanese
cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 colonel paul tibetz jr the pilot of the b29 bomber
that dropped the first atomic bomb had named the plane inola gay after his mother the bomb itself
was named little boy so we have a period of slowdown in much of the first half of the of the 20th
century then growth takes off again in what will call the fifth wave of modernity roughly
speaking the fifth wave runs from 1945 to 1990 and it begins after world war two the modern global
engine of growth seems to fire up again and this wave sees the most sustained era of global economic
growth ever known growth built in part on wartime innovations as some of the crucial
innovations included atomic power rocket technology and the electric transistor
the organization of commerce also changed during both wars states had become extremely good at
mobilizing entire economies mobilizing entire economy entire populations and also mobilizing
the skills of their of their of their scientists and engineers after the second world war some
private corporations began to operate on a scale almost as large as that of states and multinational
corporations such as oil companies in particular began to become as powerful as medium-sized states
so these new economic juggernauts that we call multinational corporations began to play an
increasingly important role in economic development another crucial feature of this era was that the
world was divided into two large blocks this is a sort of deglobalization that shaped the
history of much of the 20th century it was divided into a capitalist block and a communist region
each of which sought to influence the rest of the world which came to be known as the third world
communist countries included highly industrialized societies in eastern europe such as soviet
russia and after 1949 much of east europe which was brought within the soviet block
by force at the end of the second world war and after 1949 it also included china with russia
china much of east europe within the communist block almost half of the world's population
found themselves within communist societies now in terms of the logic of this course what
is striking about the communist world and their command economies is that they preserved many
of the elements of tributary societies one of the most striking of these elements is a fundamental
hostility to commerce so like traditional agrarian civilizations the elites of the
communist societies rejected entrepreneurial activity they called it capitalism and they
actively suppressed commerce and tried to organize economies in which the entire workings of the
economy and society were planned from above given the model i set up in an earlier lecture
of the link between entrepreneurial activity and innovation it should come as no surprise to find
that the problem that eventually led to the collapse of these societies
was the sluggishness of innovation nevertheless unlike traditional tributary states of the later
agrarian era those of the communist world the states of the communist world actively encouraged
industrial growth in an environment without markets and to a remarkable extent they were
quite successful they were able to achieve rapid industrialization but the fact that most
innovation depended on state activity or technologies that had evolved elsewhere mostly
in the capitalist world limited the pace of change and also limited the possibility that
innovations might diffuse throughout society in societies where commerce was largely suppressed
there was really no incentive for anyone to try and take up and make use of some of the
innovations pioneered by state activity so that's the fifth wave the sixth wave
began at the end of the 20th century and we're living through it today
computerization and the internet transformed communications they transformed business and
they transformed information exchanges genetic engineering also promised to transform medicine
and agriculture and we may not have seen much more than the beginnings of the impact of both of
these technologies communist societies collapsed most of them now china of course
still flourishes but it flourishes because most of the distinctive features of the communist era
are being slowly abandoned and china is turning rapidly into a successful capitalist society
with the result that capitalism is now the dominant form of the the dominant way of
organizing societies economically socially and politically in the modern world
so this change the collapse of the communist world and its planned economies
counts as a sort of economic reunification of the globe after 70 years of division into distinct
economic blocks entrepreneurial activity within capitalist social structures now shapes the economies
and societies of most of the world accelerating globalization allowed instant global transfers
of information and money but it also generated new cultural conflicts in which powerful but easily
accessible weaponry enhanced the power of small guerrilla armies resisting the power of the great
capitalist juggernauts this is one aspect of military innovation that the increasing power
of modern weaponry and its mini miniaturization has empowered small groups this is the technological
reality behind what we know as the war on terrorism the other reality is cultural as more
traditional communities attempt to defend traditional values against what they see as the onslaught of
western or modern values and attitudes as increasing globalization forces true traditional
communities and value systems into sort of a closer and more uncomfortable cohabitation
with the most successful capitalist societies many feel obliged to resist
another feature of this era has been the revival of asian economies we saw that the great asian
economies were the dominant economic powers probably for most of the last 2000 years of
the later agrarian era and we saw that their economies were deeply undermined in the 19th
and early 20th centuries until their contribution to global production shrank very very rapidly
indeed in the late 19th century and early 21st century in the late 20th century rather and the
early 21st century these economies have been reviving and beginning to challenge the dominance of
the atlantic hub zone watch this space now let's look at some general features of the 20th century
one is acceleration the pace of change accelerated between 1900 and 2000 here are just some figures
that illustrate this world populations quadrupled rising from 1.6 billions to more than 6 billions
it had taken 100,000 years to reach 1 billion people it took just 100 years to add another
billion people the urban population multiplied by 13 times and by the end of the century almost
half the world's population lived in communities of more than 5,000 people so the pace of change
has accelerated to an extraordinary degree population increases were made possible by
increasing industrial and agricultural production indeed by accelerating production global economic
output increased by about 14 times and industrial output by about 40 times
how were all these people fed well they were fed because global grain production rose
five times in the 20th century from about 400 million tons to about 2,000 million tons
now this is one of the great achievements of the modern revolution in general and of the 20th
century in particular feeding this rapidly growing population agricultural productivity
tripled in this period for various reasons one was increased irrigation the irrigated area increased
by about five times in the 20th century a second was the increasing use of artificial fertilizers
first produced as we've seen in the 19th century and also of pesticides and the other crucial
innovation was the introduction of more productive genetically engineered crops
because food production outstripped population growth in the 20th century we've not yet seen
a global Malthusian crisis now the last time I said that I touched wood and I'm going to do so again
what we've not seen yet is a crisis caused by underproduction that affected the entire world
though there have been many regional famines during this period energy use in the 20th century
increased by about 16 times mainly through increased use of the three main fossil fuels coal
oil and natural gas in the early 21st century these account for almost 80 percent of energy use
and nuclear power counts for about six six percent but in this period I think we can argue that the
lethality of weapons increased even more rapidly than productivity here are just some indicators of
this a world war one artillery shell could perhaps kill hundreds of people if it landed in the right
place the bomb dropped on Hiroshima on august the 6th 1945 killed 70 000 people and a similar number
would die over the next few decades from wounds or radiation sickness now if you want a measure of
increasing productivity of weaponry that is extraordinarily powerful
in the 1950s the usa and the ussr developed even more powerful bombs that used hydrogen fusion
the energy that drives all stars the result is that humans now have the power to destroy
most of the biosphere within just a few hours whereas just two centuries ago the most lethal
weapon available could have killed at most a few hundred people the first H bomb based on fusion
power was tested on november the first 1952 on an island in the pacific for the first time
our species had learned to tap into the power at the heart of the sun
one of the great technological ambitions of the 21st century will undoubtedly be to find a way of
taming this astonishing source of energy so that it can be put to creative rather than just destructive
uses the challenge is to find a container for fusion reactions they're simply too hot to be
contained by solids so most current work seeks ways to confine them magnetically within powerful
magnetic fields but the point is that the increased productivity of weaponry made by some
