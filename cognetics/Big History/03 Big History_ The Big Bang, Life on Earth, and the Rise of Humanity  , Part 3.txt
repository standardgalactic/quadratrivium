Lecture 35 Long Trends, Disease and Malthusian Cycles
In the previous lecture, we saw that there was actually significant growth in the era
of agrarian civilizations and significant innovation, and that lecture showed that
there were several features, several structural features of agrarian civilizations
that encouraged innovation and growth. If that's true though, there's a problem
that a modern economist or economic historian will naturally stumble over.
If there was so much growth and innovation going on in the later agrarian era,
why didn't ancient societies innovate at the same rate as modern societies?
Why didn't they generate the astonishing material wealth of the most productive of
modern societies? What was wrong with them, frankly? Why were there such regular famines?
And why did civilizations seem to periodically collapse?
What we'll see in this lecture is that there were also important features of agrarian
civilizations, and often they were the same features operating in slightly different ways
that tended to retard growth. And it's these factors that help explain why no ancient
society showed anything like the productive dynamism of the most productive of modern
societies. So considering this question about the era of agrarian civilizations,
why growth wasn't faster will eventually help us understand better what is so distinctive about
the modern era. Because one of the things we'll see is that eventually in the last few centuries
it's as if the breaks were taken off. So why was growth so slow in the era of agrarian civilizations
by modern standards, and why was it so often followed by catastrophic crashes?
Now it may seem as if in the last few lectures I've been offering a story of progress, an
ever-onward and upward story of unending progress as collective learning leads to constant increases
in productivity. And we need to remind ourselves that the very large view of big history is capable
of hiding things as well as the small view. And what we've been focusing on is such large chunks
of time that we've missed the middle-range trends that are so familiar to what we can call the
rise and fall school of historiography. Many traditional historians saw history fundamentally
as cyclical, and this is because what they were aware of was the periods of decline as well as
the periods of growth. And we too need to take those periods seriously. A cyclical view of history
probably represented quite well the experience of contemporaries,
most of whom were peasants remember, for whom the cycles of the seasons or the
eras of feast and famine were by far the most striking rhythms of life.
What the large view of big history brings out more clearly is that despite these cycles
there were long-term increases in scale and productivity. But this long trend was not
necessarily apparent at smaller scales. In many eras and for many individuals decline it must have
been more apparent than growth. So why? What factors tended to slow innovation and growth,
and why did civilizations periodically break down? In this lecture we look at some of these
factors that tended to break down to nibble away at the complexity of the agrarian world.
We're looking in effect at the workings of the social equivalent of entropy.
So what we're going to look at now is these large cyclical trends and in particular what we're going
to look at is the causes for the decline, for the decline and fall of Rome or the rise and fall of
Chinese dynasties. Why these cycles? Now let's begin with with Shelley's poem Ozymandias.
It captures poetically this sense of decline, of periodic decline, of nothing being durable
in this era. Let me just quote Shelley's poem. Here's how it goes.
I met a traveller from an antique land who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert. Near them on the sand half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things the hand that mocked them and the heart
that fed and on the pedestal these words appear my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my
works ye mighty and despair nothing besides remains round the decay of that colossal wreck
boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away it's a wonderful evocation of the
decline of the greatest tributary rulers and the civilizations they built now as it happens
we know more or less who ozymandias was. Shelley wrote the poem in 1817 after hearing of the
imminent arrival in the british museum of a bust of pharaoh ramesses the second ramesses the great
ozymandias is probably a greek rendition of his egyptian throne name
ramesses the great ruled egypt for much of the 13th century bce the figure had been taken from
the tomb known as the ramaseum the temple that ramesses built for himself outside of thieves
which is modern luxor and you can still see the ramaseum now how can we explain these periodic
crashes what was it that consigned the glory of so many different ozy ozymandias to dust
apart from the periodic crashes of entire civilizations there's also a demographic
oddity about this era that needs to be explained we saw in an earlier lecture that our very very
rough estimates of world populations suggests that in the four thousand years of the agrarian
the era of agrarian civilizations world populations grew at about the same pace as in the early
agrarian era or possibly even more slowly they grew from about 50 millions to about 250 millions
this means they multiplied by about five times in four thousand years in comparison with the
multiplication of about 10 times in five thousand years during the early agrarian era indeed the
available evidence suggests that there was hardly any growth at all in the first millennium c e that's
the era after the decline of the roman and han chinese empires now if these figures are conveying
the right impression and they're so rough that they could well be deceiving us but if they're
conveying the right impression we have to ask why despite the innovation that undoubtedly occur
occurred in the later agrarian era and it included i'd remind you such things as the spread of the
secondary products revolution plough agriculture and the spread of irrigation why didn't populations
grow any faster okay let's look now at some of the factors that slowed growth and there were
doubtless many more factors than than the ones i mentioned but what we're going to see is that one
of the curiosities of this era is that some of the factors that encouraged growth in this era
were also responsible in different forms for checking growth now let's begin by looking at
the nature of tribute taking states and the political structures associated with tribute
taking states incidentally i'll be using the term tribute taking states and tributary states
more or less interchangeably tribute taking states we've seen could encourage growth
in several ways but they could also discourage it so the overall impact on growth was rather
contradictory they stifled growth in many subtle and not so subtle ways and here's the first
normally tributary rulers tribute taking rulers the kings and emperors of this world
were more interested in capturing wealth than in producing it a successful war
could generate wealth much more quickly and much more effectively than investment in infrastructure
and there's a very basic and simple reason for this this is an era in which rates of growth are so
slow that if you invest in growth you may have to wait several generations before you gain something
from it so the slowness of growth itself encouraged rulers to think of wealth as something to be seized
rather than to be generated or invested in now seeing themselves as capturers rather than
producers of wealth tribute taking elites as we've seen generally despised those who produced wealth
the peasants and the merchants of their societies and they took very limited interest in how goods
were produced and traded this is why we get so little so little work on economics from this period
the literate elites weren't terribly interested in such activities so these attitudes discouraged
policies that might have actively stimulated production and commerce the following quotation
illustrates these attitudes very very nicely indeed it comes from just over 1000 years ago
from a state at the very beginning of its career and that's the state of Kievan Rus the first great
state of Russia it's a chronicle account of a conversation that was overheard by Grand Prince
Vladimir whose dates are 958 to 1015 he was the prince who converted the early Rus to Christianity
now here's how it goes on one occasion after the guests were drunk i have to remind you that
the early rulers of ruse came from Viking ancestors and you can still see some of the
traditions of a Viking lord with his retinue in this account so on one occasion after the
guests were drunk his retinue began to grumble against the prince complaining that they were
mistreated because he allowed them to eat with wooden spoons instead of silver ones
when vladimir heard of this complaint he ordered that silver spoons should be molded for his retinue
to eat with remarking that with silver and gold he could not secure a retinue but that with a
retinue he was in a position to win these treasures even as his grandfather and his father had
sought riches with their followers so i hope you see the logic of this very very clearly the point
of the quote is that for vladimir as indeed for most rulers throughout the era of agrarian
civilizations for most tributary rulers force was the essential means of getting wealth that's the
reverse incidentally of today's world in which wealth is the means of buying force so that the
first priority of governments today is to encourage growth innovation in the agrarian era wasn't crucial
in an environment where rulers saw wealth as something to be captured by military power rather
than through the deliberate stimulation of economic growth now there's another aspect to this stifling
of growth by the structures of tributary societies and this concerns not the people at the top of
tribute taking states but the people at the bottom the peasants who were the foundation of all
tribute taking states as marx pointed out in his analysis of pre-capitalist states
tribute taking states had to ensure that peasants had access to land this was where all the wealth
came from so they needed peasants to be farming the land but what this did was to limit wage
earning employment it severely limited wage earning and he did one more thing it deprived peasants of
any incentive to raise productivity and the reason was they knew that any surpluses would be skimmed
by their overlords so imagine you're a peasant in one of the great agrarian civilizations you have
another child on the way last year's crop was small you suddenly have this feeling that you
really need to build up your economy and you've heard of a new crop you introduce it you work
very hard and you increase your crops what's going to happen well it's perfectly clear what's
going to happen is your overlords they may be the state they may be a private landlord as simply
going to say wonderful the peasants are producing more let's skim more often this is a world remember
in which the taking of wealth is much more arbitrary than it is in our world today where it's fenced
about with far more legal controls so in summary those who produce society's wealth
generally lacked the education the capital and the incentive to innovate while the elites who had the
education and the wealth generally despised productive or commercial activities and preferred
to take wealth rather than generate it outside the specialist domains of warfare and administration
this means tribute taking rulers took little interest in improved efficiency or innovation
so in both these ways the structures of tribute taking states could stifle innovation and growth
now let's look at the second major factor that could stifle innovation and growth
and that's disease leading to periodic sharp population declines patterns of disease frequently
checked the population growth that itself could be a major driver of growth in the later agrarian
era there are two interesting ways in which this could happen first cities are one cause of
population decline through disease now we've seen that cities could stimulate growth
they were they were huge centers for commerce they drew in commerce they attracted commerce
in this way they could encourage innovation and growth but they like tributary states could also
dampen growth and they did so by checking population growth and the reason is this
all towns in pre-modern societies in all agrarian civilizations were lethal places
death rates were much higher in most pre-modern cities than in the countryside and this means
that their populations had to be constantly replenished by immigrants from rural rural areas
now why was this so we've already seen some hints of this you think of the environment of a typical
pre-modern city diseases spread very rapidly in filthy crowded city streets human and animal
wastes accumulated in public places and waterways as no there's no sewerage system so where do these
ways go you tip chamber pots into the street or you tip them into the nearest river rivers were
treated as sewers and dumps but they were also sources of drinking water they were where people
washed and city air was often polluted by fires and manufacturing processes such as smelting or
tanning and remember this is a world in which people didn't understand how diseases were
communicated so systems of quarantine were very rudimentary and this means that the mere
existence of cities could dampen population growth now here's a second mechanism that could
dampen population growth through the spread of disease and that also is a mechanism that earlier
we saw as a mechanism that could stimulate growth and that's the expansion of exchange networks
we saw that as exchange networks developed for example through the silk roads they could encourage
the exchange of technologies ideas innovations of various kinds but they could also stimulate the
spread of disease and this could take catastrophic forms so here too we have a structural feature
of agrarian civilizations that had a contradictory impact on growth rates here's how it worked
here's how it worked William McNeill explored this aspect of Eurasian history in his wonderful
study plagues and peoples he showed that as exchange networks expanded there would come a
point where regions which had previously had very little contact would have enough contact
that they would start swapping disease vectors now once this happens if diseases move into areas
where people have no immunities the results can be catastrophic a disease which is not terribly
dangerous amongst populations used to it can be like a plague in another region so what he showed
is that as Eurasia began to get more integrated you get more and more of these exchanges of diseases
indeed he argues that one component in the demographic and political decline of both the
roman and han empires about 1500 years ago may have been precisely the exchange of diseases
between these two regions as contacts between them became more common as he points out the
Mediterranean region and China being at the edges of Eurasia were more likely to have populations
that lacked immunities to diseases from other parts of Eurasia so this may be why when smallpox
for example arrives in the Byzantine Empire it can be so catastrophic in its effects
so by 2000 years ago there was increasing evidence of diseases such as smallpox and
eventually the bubonic plague spreading across Eurasia as the silk roads flourished and eventually
the black death may have spread in a similar way from the far east to the western end of Eurasia
in the 14th century so that's a second mechanism both the disease environment of cities and the
exchanges of diseases through exchange networks could dampen population growth by causing periodic
or in the case of cities quite regular decimations of populations now here's the third mechanism
they'll call it ecological overreach or over exploitation we've seen that humans
are brilliant at finding new ways of exploiting their environments what we are not so good at
is making sure that in applying these new methods we don't undermine the environments on which we
depend time and again agrarian civilizations overreach they over exploited their natural resources
to the point where entire civilizations collapsed one of the most spectacular examples comes from
the population history of Mesopotamia estimates of population in Mesopotamia over 7 000 years show
two periods of sudden decline we've already mentioned the sudden collapse at the end of the
third millennium early in the second millennium BCE which was almost certainly caused by over
irrigation which led to salination and declining harvests Sumerian civilization collapsed and the
region's center of gravity shifted permanently to the north according to one estimate Mesopotamian
populations fell from about 630 000 in 1900 BCE to about 270 000 by 1600 BC that's more than 50
percent and they wouldn't rise again for at least a millennium then the same patterns repeated again
new forms of irrigation are developed including new devices for lifting water they allow populations
to build up again and then in the early centuries of islamic civilization while populations are
built up then a few centuries later early in the second millennium CE once more you have a collapse
so ecological overreach as a third crucial way in which agrarian civilizations could dampen growth
now i want to ask what is the impact of these checks to growth and we'll see that it's profound
and it explains one of the most striking and common structural features of agrarian civilizations
and i'm going to call that feature Malthusian cycles a very distinctive pattern of evolution
and change let me explain what i mean these and other factors that checked growth
functioned alongside the positive feedback cycles that drove growth
so you have positive feedback cycles that encourage growth but you also have what we can call
negative feedback cycles and it's this balance between the two that shape the fundamental
rhythms of historical change throughout the later agrarian era let me remind you what a negative
feedback cycle is a positive feedback cycle is a cycle of causation in which one cause encourages
another which in cause encourages a third and round the circle so positive feedback cycles
lead to runaway change very rapid change a negative feedback cycle is the opposite the
the classic model is a thermostat in a heating system the heating system works the thermostat
eventually is triggered it switches off the heating system the temperature cools down again it reaches
a point where the heating system is switched on again and so on so negative feedback cycles
tend to dampen down growth they limit change they lead to stability
a typical negative feedback cycle in agrarian civilizations would begin with innovations
that stimulated population growth these in turn would stimulate growth in other sectors
they might stimulate commerce urbanization as more and more people became wealthy they might
start funding the arts new buildings and so on so you see growth in many sectors of society
eventually though populations begin to press against ecological constraints
shortages appear there's growing evidence of malnutrition as more and more peasants don't
have quite enough to feed themselves this encourages disease you very often find states begin to fight
increasingly or warlords over scarce resources and finally through warfare disease or famine
populations crash if you graph the populations of major regions of Eurasia say Europe China and
India over 2000 years you can see these rhythms very very clearly they are rhythms of rise and fall
but they're on a long-term trend that is rising now this rhythm the Malthusian cycle dominates
the history of the later agrarian era do you remember Malthus by the way we last met him as
one of the inspirers of Darwin's idea of natural selection he was also as we saw then one of the
pioneers of the science of demography that's the study of the evolution of populations
and one of Malthus's central ideas was that the capacity of societies to reproduce
and he's thinking here of both human and animal societies would always be greater than their
capacity to innovate or to find new resources eventually he argued population growth would
always overtake growth in resources and there would be a crash now this is a pretty good description
of the characteristic rhythms of agrarian civilizations that's why it's fitting to describe
these typical cycles of agrarian civilizations as Malthusian the economic historian Robert Lopez
has described these cycles as an alternation of crest trough and crest that can be observed
not only in the economic field but in almost every aspect of life literature and art philosophy and
thought he writes politics and law were also affected though not all to the same extent
and the great French historian Leroy Ladurie one of the great historians of the Annales school
who wrote a wonderful account of population rises and falls in the south of France over many
centuries writes of these cycles that they were like the respiration the in breaths and out breaths
of an entire social structure so Malthus's mechanism what Malthus actually said by the way
was that populations increased geometrically by multiplication whereas resources increased
arithmetically by addition and this is why population would always outstrip resources
so this is the key mechanism now what's the explanation for it why over and over again
in agrarian civilizations do we see the same Malthusian cycles the explanation in in fact
is very simple indeed and it takes us right to the heart of the issue the nature and rate of
innovation in agrarian civilizations the fact that there was innovation in this era but never
quite enough to keep pace with population growth is what explains the persistence of this depressing
rhythm over several millennia in other words the Malthusian cycle must be explained fundamentally
by the fact that innovation existed in the agrarian era but it was never quite fast enough
to keep up with population growth and that's why we get these periodic crashes so that's the
explanation for Malthusian cycles that dominate the history of the later agrarian era and that
create this sense of long-term cycles of rise and fall even beyond the rise and fall of particular
rulers such as Ozymandias so what we've seen is that some of the same factors that stimulated
growth in agrarian civilizations including the functioning of tribute-taking states the role
of cities and the expansion of exchange networks could also stifle innovation and growth or they
could cut population growth and in combination this balance of forces between factors encouraging
growth and factors limiting growth explains why eventually each phase of expansion ended in collapse
now in the last three lectures we've concentrated on Afro-Eurasia on how agrarian civilizations
worked in Afro-Eurasia now we need to ask how typical was the history of the Afro-Eurasian zone
of humanity as a whole how typical of the rest of the world and to answer that question we're going
to shift our focus to the other three world zones the Australasian Pacific and American World
Zones and find out what was happening there thank you
lecture 36 comparing the world zones
we often take the geography of our earth for granted but in this course we've seen that the
earth's geography too has a history like the universe like the planet like life on earth like
human beings and we saw that about 200 million years ago most of the earth's continents were
joined together in a huge supercontinent pangia that ran from north to south that's the supercontinent
that Wagner proposed must have existed at some time it's worth asking the question how different
would human history have been if all humans had lived throughout their history on the single continent
of pangia and one difference is surely that once humans had started constructing large and powerful
agrarian civilizations however long it took and wherever it happened on pangia all those civilizations
would eventually have contacted each other as there were no seas to separate them many of the
processes of global history would have been similar to some of the processes we've seen
in the history of afro-eurasia human history would have taken place on a single stage but our world
is very different we happen to live in an era in which continents are separated by huge seas
so that as a matter of fact human history took place on a number of quite separate stages which
i've called the world zones so we spent several lectures looking at what happened in afro-eurasia
from our combination spaceship time capsule orbiting the earth now we need to ask questions
about the earth as a whole were similar changes occurring elsewhere how typical was afro-eurasia
did agrarian civilization expand elsewhere as well did states become more powerful
did exchange networks expand linking different regions into large world systems
is the evidence of the innovation or of malphusian cycles if there were differences between the zones
then to what extent and in what ways were those differences shaped by the different
geographies of each world zone so what we do now is we try to look at the other world zones
and get some feeling for how different the trajectories of human history were in each
zone and some of the reasons why they might have been different the comparison between these regions
between the various world zones is important for two main reasons the first is that the differences
really mattered we'll see that they they mattered most and most obviously during the last 500 years
when at last the world zones were joined the history of each of the world zones since that time
has been very much shaped by the trajectory of history in that zone before the unification of
the world so these differences really mattered but secondly there's the theoretical point that
we've touched on already if we find important similarities between the zones despite the lack
of significant contacts between them then these may hint at some deep patterns in human history as a
whole if we find just random variation if we find that the stories of each world zones are completely
different then we shouldn't be looking for any large directional trajectories for human history
so that's the crucial question behind all of this as jarrod diamond has suggested the contingent
fact that we evolved in an era when the world's continental plates were scattered across the
earth's surface has set up a series of revealing natural experiments as he calls them for it suggests
how human history could evolve from different starting points let me quote jarrod diamond on
this and this is from his bestseller guns germs and steel he writes well neither astronomers
studying galaxy formation nor human historians can manipulate their systems in a controlled
laboratory experiment they both can take advantage of natural experiments by comparing systems
different in the presence or absence or in the strong or weak effect of some putative
causative factor for example cultural anthropologists unable to provide human groups
experimentally with varying resource abundances i mean what he's saying here is you can't simply
you know take human groups put them in a lab give them certain conditions like
rats and then see what happens that's impossible the fact that you can't do this means we can still
study long-term effects of resource abundance on human societies by comparing for example recent
Polynesian populations living on islands differing naturally in resource abundance
so we can't deal with human history experimentally what we can do is look for natural experiments
set up by the fact that human history has taken place in a number of different environments and
we can see what happens so if we find no significant similarities as we've seen
we might conclude that human history is an entirely contingent process it's driven
by accidents of geography and the unpredictable choices of millions of individuals but if we
find significant similarities we may have to conclude that some powerful general forces
have steered human history down certain tracks despite the play of contingency
let's look at each of these zones and try and tease out some of the large general features
that shaped its history and its geography let's begin with how history began in each zone and
we'll see that human history seems to begin in rather different ways in each of these zones
now for some of this i'm going to be collecting information some of which we've already encountered
in earlier lectures on the early history of the various world zones but i want to put it all
together so we can see the contrasts quite clearly between them okay first the afro-uration zone and
just in summary the afro-uration zone was the oldest it was the largest in terms of land mass
and it was most varied of the world zones and it played a dominant role in world history
it was here that human history began some 200 000 years ago because our species evolved in Africa
and we've looked at the afro-uration zone now let's go on to a second zone the australian zone
as i've called it that was the second to be settled by human beings the ice age continent of Sahul
included modern Australia Papua New Guinea and Tasmania it was unified because lower sea levels
at the height of the last ice age filled the bridges between these areas so it was a single
land mass it was smaller in area much smaller than afro-uracia and smaller than the americas
and it was also for the most part less diverse with relatively arid climates and flat old
ancient landscapes with the exception of the northern rim that eventually would form modern
Papua New Guinea its soils for the most part were old and relatively infertile
Sahul had once been part of the supercontinent of gondwana land you'll remember that when
pangia broke up it broke first into two huge supercontinents laurasia and gondwana land and
gondwana land was in the south uh sahul had been part of gondwana land and it inherited the marsupial
fauna of gondwana land but it had separated from gondwana land almost 100 million years ago so its
plant life and animal life by this time were really quite distinctive had it had a very unique
flora and fauna the human history of sahul began 40 to 50 000 years ago during the last ice age
when it was still a single continent we saw that to reach sahul from outer eurasia humans had to cross
at least 50 to 60 kilometers of open sea even at the height of the last ice age
we now have some idea of where these humans came from excavations at jeremoly cave in east
timore by susan o'connor have shown that humans probably lived here about 40 000 years ago
the remains of tuner at these sites suggest that they were fishing and they were fishing quite well
away from the shores and that's a powerful hint that they had quite significant sea going skills
and sea craft that could go some way offshore
we saw that no other large mammal made the crossing to sahul so it provides very clear evidence of our
ancestors unique ecological adaptability and once they arrived they had to keep adapting
because they had to adapt to sahul's almost entirely novel flora and fauna
the encounter between newly arrived humans and indigenous species that had no experience of humans
and no understanding of how dangerous they could be may help explain the massive extent
of the die-off of large mammals in sahul in the millennia after the arrival of humans
megafaunal extinctions and the widespread use of fire stick farming suggests that even in australia
where agriculture did not appear before modern times humans nevertheless had a significant
impact on their environments and this is one of the reasons for thinking that this very general
trajectory that i've talked about driven by collective learning of a capacity to spread
into new environments is something that we can see very clearly certainly in the australian world
zone even if it doesn't take quite the same forms as elsewhere now let's look at the americas
and the beginnings of history in the americas the american world zone formed actually quite
recently it formed about three million years ago when a large fragment of loratia that fragment
we now call refer to as north america touched a large fragment of gondola land that we now
refer to as south america and they joined at the isthmus of panama creating a single united world
zone as a result this zone uniquely stretches from gondola land to loratia from the Antarctic to the
arctic and it spans all major ecological and climatic zones jared diamond has pointed out that
this north south orientation means that when humans arrived they found that
most long distance migrations would lead them into new and unfamiliar climatic zones
now his point is that this is very different from afro-eurasia afro-eurasia certainly the
uration part of it is sort of oriented east west the americas are oriented north south
and the significance for early humans is this if you're migrating over long distances in afro
eurasia a lot of those migrations can be done within a single climate zone and that tends to
minimize the amount of change you need to introduce climates at least change even don't change too
much even if topologies may so his point is that it was by and large easier to migrate over large
distances in afro-eurasia in the americas in contrast the major migrations north and south
were constantly taking you into new climatic zones so the amount of adaptation that had to be
done to migrate through the americas was significantly greater than in afro-eurasia and he's argued
that this difference in geographical orientation may have played a fundamental role in the history
of the americas here's how he puts it axis orientations affected the rate of spread of
crops and livestock and possibly also of writing wheels and other inventions this basic feature
of geography therefore contributed heavily to the very different experiences of native americans
africans and urations in the last 500 years it's at least an intriguing idea and it's
possible that this played a role in perhaps slowing down american migrations
through the americas though i have to say there's also counter evidence suggesting that
despite these difficulties americans travel through the early inhabitants of america travel
from north to south quite quickly we've seen that humans entered the americas from east
syberia they entered either across the bering straits land bridge which was exposed during the
last ice age or perhaps by short sea voyages around the coastline around the coastline from
eastern syberia around the bering straits past alaska and down to the northwest coast of north
america humans had certainly arrived by 13 000 years ago and genetic evidence hints that or at
least to put it more precisely there are those who've argued that there are genetic hints that
humans may have arrived as early as 30 000 years ago genetic evidence from some communities in
central america has been used to claim that these communities or their ancestors left syberia at
least 20 000 and possibly 40 000 years ago but as we've seen the consensus at the moment is that
humans had certainly arrived by 13 000 years ago and there's no hard evidence yet of earlier
arrivals now here as in sahul the entry of humans into unfamiliar territory unfamiliar terrain
facing new flora new fauna and the fact that local animals had no understanding of our species
may help explain the massive megafaunal extinctions that occurred here too
roughly at the time that humans first arrived if humans did indeed contribute to these extinctions
we must conclude that they had a substantial impact on their environments even before the
appearance of agriculture at jarrod diamond has also pointed out that the removal of these
species and in the americas they included for example the horse a species that evolved in
the americas and was then driven to extinction they also included many species of large camlids
and he argues that this may have had a very significant impact on the history of america
of the americas above all what it meant was that here in the americas there could be no
real equivalent of the secondary products revolution that had such an impact on communications
on the spread of plough agriculture on the emergence of pastoral nomadism in afro-eurasia
so that's a sketch of the very early history of the american zone now the pacific zone
the pacific world zone actually was the largest of all the world zones it covers most of the
pacific ocean the largest mass of water on earth nevertheless its actual land area was the smallest
because it formed a huge island archipelago so that communities were separated by hundreds or
thousands of miles of open sea each island had distinctive features and therefore a
distinctive history so here you get a wonderful natural experiment of the kind that jarrod diamond
described earlier and it's it's an experiment that he analyzes very very carefully in his book
collapse which is about how natural conditions may make it easier or harder for human societies
to live sustainably in a particular environment as he's shown the size fertility
and remoteness of each island could have a very powerful impact on its history
affecting its populations population densities and the stability of the societies that were created
some islands for example Easter Island or Rapa Nui which we will discuss later in this course
was so small that they required very delicate handling and any ecological overreach any failure
to maintain local resources could easily prove catastrophic the pacific world zone and this
is one of the most striking distinctive features of this zone apart from the fact that it was an
archipelago was not occupied until the later agrarian era and it was settled by migrants who
brought knowledge of farming and superb navigational skills in other words this world zone bypassed
the Paleolithic era entirely and it began its history with its own equivalent of the early
agrarian era the migrations that settled first Melanesia the islands of the east of Papua New
Guinea and then Polynesia the islands further to the west in the Pacific Ocean count as a
wonderful counterpart of the migrations of the Paleolithic era they're a sign of the astonishing
capacity of humans to seek out and explore new environments and find distinctive ways of exploiting
them so where did the migrants come from for a long time it was assumed that the pacific islands
had largely been settled from the americas this was the basic assumption that underlay Thor
Heyerdahl's famous expedition on the Contiki in 1947 you may remember that he built a raft
modeled on types of raft you could find in the pacific and he sailed it with a crew from Peru
to the Tuamotu islands but since he did that and what he did of course was to prove that it was
possible but since that time a large body of evidence has shown that the migrations actually
took place in the opposite direction from Asia and the west some of the crucial evidence can
includes the similarity of the austronesian languages of Melanesia and Polynesia to languages of
southeast Asia and the spread of a distinctive type of pottery known as Lapita where as a result of
these migrations and this evidence has shown that the pacific islands were settled in fact by
people whose ancestors probably came ultimately from the mainland of southeast Asia the islands of
Melanesia to the east of Papua New Guinea reaching as far as Fiji and Tonga were settled over quite
a large period of time the Solomon Islands may have been settled by as early as 35 000 BCE but
remota islands in Melanesia were settled as late as 1000 BCE 3000 years ago and the migrants who
arrived there traveled in huge ocean going double hulled canoes that and they carried with them
crops that included taro, yam, breadfruit, coconuts and sugarcane and they also carried
domesticated animals with them in particular chickens dogs and pigs and it's very likely that
rats traveled with them as hitchhikers the remota islands of eastern Polynesia were mostly settled
during the first millennium CE New Zealand one of the last regions to be settled was probably
colonized between 1000 and 1200 CE we now know quite a lot about how these migrations were conducted
and we know this a lot of this comes from experimental archaeology which is involved
recreating and sailing Polynesian ships and recovering some of the skills of their navigators
through interviews with surviving navigators and their families and what this evidence has shown
is that these astonishing migrations were the result of systematic well-prepared journeys of
exploration in ships that could carry sometimes as many as 200 people along with the with samples
of their crops and chicken and pigs and they were guided by navigators who sometimes memorized maps
of the stars or used special reed maps of Polynesia and could tell from signs such as subtle shifts
in currents or the presence of seabirds where to expect landfall one of the most remarkable
aspects of this is that when clouds obscure the skies navigators claim to be able to hunker down
within the ships close their eyes and feel from the subtler movements of the ship and the wind
where there might be land okay that's a sketch of the early history of these zones now let's talk
briefly about how the agricultural revolution played out in each of these zones let's begin with
the Australasian zone and it may seem at first as if there's not that much to be said about the
Australasian zone but I think in fact there may be quite a lot to be said agriculture appeared early
in Sahul remember but only in the far north in modern Papua New Guinea in Papua New Guinea
agriculture was based on root crops such as taro that did not store well as we've seen that may be
why no agrarian civilizations emerged here however they did emerge flourishing and highly competitive
early agrarian village communities some of which have survived to the present day and and they
flourished throughout the best part of 10 000 years without ever developing a fully grown agrarian
civilization in australian Tasmania foraging technologies survived to modern times now why
the difference between these two parts of Sahul one reason may be geological Papua New Guinea
provided a sort of snow plow as the plate on which Sahul rested drove north from Gondwana land
and that sort of snow plow drove it into the smaller plates of the complex tectonic system of
southeast Asia driving up mountains within Papua New Guinea so Papua New Guinea has accumulated
a much more varied ecology and topology than the rest of Sahul it has areas of rich soils
and a great variety of different ecological zones whereas most of australia is older flatter less
varied and has thin and far less productive soils so it could be just that agriculture
was intrinsically much more difficult in the mainland of australia rather than in the northern
regions that became Papua New Guinea however we shouldn't exaggerate these differences during
the last 5000 years there's plenty of evidence in the archaeology of australia of various processes
of intensification and of slow increases in population and even in some regions the appearance
of sedentary affluent foragers a bit reminiscent of the natufians now I say this just so that we
don't fall into the trap of thinking that somehow history stopped in regions like australia
we find evidence in the last 5000 years of more finely made more varied stone tools
we find evidence of population growth the dingo a semi domesticated dog appeared about 4000 years
ago probably across the Indian Ocean because it's very seems to be genetically closely related
to Indian species of dogs and in some areas people began to become more sedentary and this
happened along some of the coasts and regions where they depended on fishing one of the most
spectacular examples it comes from the state of victoria where people built elaborate eel traps
some incorporating canals up to 300 meters long as sort of holding tanks for eels these could be
harvested using special eel pots made from strips of bark or plaited rushes and once caught the
eels were killed I love this bit they were killed by biting them on the back of the head no thank you
so many eels could be stored in this way that people began to construct relatively permanent
settlements around them and in one case as many as 146 low stone huts were found at a single site
these were in fact villages and I hope you'll see the similarities with the natufians so this is
clearly evidence of a tendency towards forms of intensification even if the threshold to fully
developed agriculture is never quite crossed we can see other examples elsewhere in central
Australia for example 19th century European travelers observed communities harvesting wild
millet with stone sickles and storing it in large hay ricks given more time it's hard to think that
australia too would not have launched its own indigenous agricultural revolution now how significant
was the australian zone demographically by 500 years ago when the world zones would at last be
joined the population of sahul cannot have been more than about two millions it was tiny demographically
in the american zone agriculture evolved later than the afro-eurasian zone and in different ways
now i'm going to come back to the american zone later so i'll just summarize the evidence very
briefly crops such as maize and squashes may have been cultivated early but the earliest dated
samples of domesticated maize were grown about 3500 bce in the tehuacan valley southeast of
mexico city in south america guinea pigs lamas and alpacas were domesticated by 2000 bce think
incidentally how different the region's history might have been if they could also have domesticated
horses and large camelids species that had flourished just a few thousand years earlier
the relatively late development of cultivation in the americas may reflect the absence of easy
domesticates crops such as maize had to undergo significant changes before they could support
large populations besides as we've seen many potential domesticates were no longer available
now as for the population of this zone estimates of the populations of the americas 500 years ago
vary quite right widely from about 40 million to as high as about 100 millions this is a lot
larger demographically than australia but still nothing like as large as afro-eurasia
in the pacific zone migrants as we've seen brought agricultural technologies with them
there was no paleolithic era here though on some smaller islands including eventually
easter island agriculture eventually failed and populations began to revert to modified
forms of foraging so here we have an example of the possibility of human societies actually
becoming simpler particularly in regions with extremely limited resources and the populations
of this zone it's extremely unlikely that 500 years ago the pacific zone had more than one to two
millions for the sake of a comparison it's worth reminding you that the population of afro-eurasia
500 years ago was probably about 400 to 500 millions so this gives us a powerful idea of
the demographic imbalance between the different zones now in summary we've seen that there were
some striking differences and historical trajectories of these different zones these are very very
different stories those differences include a striking demographic imbalance with populations
ranging from 400 to 500 millions for afro-eurasia to 50 to 100 millions for the americas and to
a mere one or two millions for the australian and pacific zones so it's easy to assume that these
are completely different histories but i think that may be deceptive there are also beneath these
differences some striking parallels and above all we find intensification of some kind in all four
world zones in each zone human numbers tended for the most part to increase over large time scales
and they did so as a result of innovations that allowed humans to extract more resources from a
given area and we've seen this is true even in australia where there's plenty of evidence pointing
towards intensification and movements in the direction of a sort of agricultural revolution
here too humans occupy an increasing range of different environments from lush coastal regions
to the arid interior and they begin processes of intensification so these comparisons suggest
that the differences between the world zones and their histories
may have been more a matter of timing than of substance in each region we see evidence of
innovations that allowed the settlement of new areas and prepared the way for forms of
intensification here we may be seeing similarities that imply that everywhere collective learning
led to technological change of some kind and they suggest that the differences between the
histories of these regions reflect differences in their natural endowment their geography and
sometimes the size of their populations and therefore in what i've called the synergy of
collective learning now i want to explore these comparisons slightly more carefully by looking
at the second largest of the world zones the americas thank you
these lectures are part of the great courses series they are produced by the teaching company
these lectures are titled big history the big bang life on earth and the rise of humanity part four
lecture 37 the americas in the later agrarian era
in the last lecture we compared the early histories of the four world zones and we saw
that there were some striking differences between them but also some very interesting parallels
and we saw that this business of comparing the world zones can help us tease out some quite
deep issues about the driving forces of human history now what i want to do is look more closely
at the americas and that's the only other world zone apart from afro-eurasia in which agrarian
civilizations flourished so this gives us a chance to look more carefully at the different
trajectories according to which agrarian civilizations evolved in different environments
and remember once again these were areas without any significant contact between them so this is
the sort of natural experiment that jarrod diamond talked about so how similar was the
evolution of agrarian civilizations in these two zones and what were the crucial differences
and what can they tell us in the americas agrarian civilizations evolved in two main
regions in meso america in the south of mexico guatemala belize central america and also in
the andes region peru bolivia northern chile parts of ecuador in both these regions evidence of
embryonic agrarian civilizations the build up towards agrarian civilizations begins to
appear from about the second millennium bce now there's a third area in the americas where we see
the beginnings of this process but it never quite reaches the point of developing a flourishing
full-blown agrarian civilization and that's in parts of the usa along the mississippi valley
about 1000 years ago at sites such as kahokia in illinois which with a population of 10 to 20 000
may have been the largest pre columbian city of north america you find all the signs of powerful
chieftains of societies just on the verge of building up fully developed agrarian civilizations
the inhabitants the inhabitants of the regions region not only had quite large small towns they
also built huge artificial mounds but by 1400 c e this civilization the so-called mississippian
culture had largely broken down however given another millennium it's it's quite probable
there's a reasonable guess that a full-blown agrarian civilization might have also evolved
along the mississippi now what we'll do is survey the evolution of agrarian civilizations
in the two main regions of the americas in which they developed and flourished and let's begin
with meso america in meso america what we can call incipient civilizations first appeared after
about 2000 bce in the second millennium bce the earliest hints of something pointing towards
agrarian civilization appear amongst the olmec of southeast mexico near modern veracruz and the gulf
of mexico and they appear in the middle of the second millennium bce here in this region improved
varieties of maize beans and squash allowed rapid population growth in regions of heavy rainfall
where drainage was probably more important than irrigation but like irrigation regions this was
a region where farming would flourish but only if there was substantial investment of effort on
the part of whole communities eventually towns appeared based on the farming of these rich forest
soils towns such as lorenzo which probably had a population of about 2500 people so these are
these are not huge towns and la venta but what these towns did have was large ceremonial centers
with pyramid-like tombs that could be up to 33 meters high and they were apparently designed
as royal tombs the other thing about the olmec is that they made huge and distinctive basalt
stone heads most of us have seen pictures of these these wonderful very beautiful objects
with no large domestic animals these had to be transported by humans presumably under compulsion
so as in afro-eurasia monumental construction of this type implies that already there exist
quite significant hierarchies of power and wealth there probably exist regional rulers or chiefs who
can exercise at least some degree of coercion yet the relative relatively small size of these
towns suggests that they represented polities not quite at the level of a full-blown tributary state
yet the presence of obsidian remember obsidian is this this volcanic glass that can be used to
produce very sharp edges it's very important in all societies of the of the neolithic era
the presence of obsidian and other precious goods at olmec sites shows the existence of
quite extensive exchange networks we see in the olmec region some signs of a sort of collapse
la venta for example is destroyed violently in about 400 bce and this is an indicator of one
other component of agrarian civilizations moderately large-scale warfare finally an inscribed stone
found in 2006 in veracruz suggests that the olmec had already developed a writing system
though it's not yet been deciphered if this is true then this is probably the first writing system
to be developed in the americas in short by 500 bce and probably earlier the olmec despite the
smallness of their polities show many of the features we expect to find in incipient or embryonic
agrarian civilization so on a reasonably small scale so after about 1000 bce during the first
millennium bce large communities evolved in the oaxaca valley of south mexico and here we start
to find evidence of of significant craft specialization an extensive division of labor we see signs
of canal building of markets and also writing systems emerge and by 500 bce we have in the
oaxaca region a cluster of city states that certainly echo the early city states of sumer
by 500 c e a thousand years later oaxacan civilization is flourishing and the largest city
montielban may have had almost 20 000 inhabitants indeed it may have been the first large city to
flourish in the americas carved stone engravings found in montielban depict slaughtered enemies
and they show that warfare was on a significant scale here we certainly have a flourishing
agrarian civilization with large populations cities warfare writing trade and monumental
architecture on a large scale i hope by now you're getting very familiar with this sort of
checklist of the things that we expect to pop up once we get agrarian civilizations
olmec and oaxacan civilizations created many durable features of mezzo-american civilizations
by the first century c e the first century of the modern era towns cities and states could be found
also to the north in modern mexico city here the largest city teotihuacan which is about 25
miles northeast of modern mexico city may have had a population of at least 100 000 people now
this is getting a huge huge this is a huge city they lived amongst colossal pyramids which still
survive today and archaeology has shown that teotihuacan also included migrants who came from
many other parts of mezzo-america and you can show this by the the distinct distinctive styles of
their buildings in different suburbs to the east in the yucatan peninsula the mayan civilization
flourished as well market relations and warfare seem to have linked all these areas of evolving
agrarian civilization into a large network of exchanges and warfare so it may be appropriate
to talk of a mezzo an evolving mezzo-american world system you'll remember the label world
system refers to large areas of agrarian civilization linked through trade and other
exchanges into into a large exchange network here's one just tiny illustration of the sort
of links between them in 378 we know an army from teotihuacan conquered tical in modern guatemala
one of the major cities of the maya and probably killed its king and installed a new dynasty
distinctive features of mezzo-american civilizations include religious beliefs that required the
letting of blood and calendrical systems that were of great religious and political significance
and were probably more accurate than any that were developed in afro-eurasia
i'd like to spend a little time talking about the maya and the reason is that the maya are
particularly interesting and particularly now since it's been possible to decipher their
writing system and the result is that the maya are now probably better known than any other
american civilization before 1500 mayan civilization emerged as early as about
1000 bce and it began to emerge that early in the lowland rainforests of the yucatan
peninsula in the region on the border between south mexico bellies and guatemala here villages
initially practiced forms of sweden agriculture but by the end of the first millennium you find
large temple complexes appearing in the region with pyramids large causeways and public squares
these are getting quite grand in the so-called classical period of mayan civilization in the
middle of the first millennium c e the maya seem to have been organized in a large number of
competing city states which may have linked with each other in complex and shifting alliance systems
here we have very strong echoes of sumer perhaps in the time of gilgamesh
eventually the maya developed remarkably accurate calendars their their calendar
had several different cycles one was a sacred year of 260 days that may have been linked to the
movements of venus and there's also a secularly year of 365 days and in addition to that a long
historical calendar the long count so in effect three overlapping calendars and as in china the
calendars seem to have had great political significance it seems that that power figures in
this region were extremely concerned that things happen on auspicious auspicious states so the
calendars were extremely important political tools the maya also developed a hieroglyphic script
it appears to have evolved in conjunction with the development of the calendar and it was used
from the start to record political and religious events and to keep records of royal lineages so
as this gets deciphered we can begin to construct in considerable detail the political history
of the maya in the classical era now note that here writing doesn't appear to evolve from the
sort of accounting systems that we saw in sumer nevertheless the process seems to have been
quite similar in several ways it did evolve from the task of keeping track of something in this case
what was being kept track of was dates that had ritual significance and there's another striking
similarity with the sumerian cuneiform and that's the use of the rebus principle we've already
encountered this in looking at sumerian cuneiform you remember the principle just as in english for
example i could use a picture of an eye to represent the personal pronoun i so in mayan the symbol of
a torch which sounded like the word for torch sounded like tar sounded the same as and could
be used to represent the preposition at which was also tar in mayan so you can sound use the picture
of a torch to represent something much more abstract a preposition at so here we see some
quite striking similarities in the evolution of language though as always of written language
though as always we also see interesting differences okay the decline of mayan civilization
is quite striking mayan civilization declined rapidly in the eighth and ninth centuries CE
the causes are still hotly debated but it seems almost certain that ecological collapse played a
very significant role and all the various theories about collapse suggest to me very
powerfully that what we're looking at is a typical malthusian collapse in which ecological factors
increasing military competition overpopulation perhaps breakdowns of political order all play
a similar similar role so here we have the classic pattern of societies under stress overpopulation
larger mayans mayan cities may have had populations in some cases of as many as 120,000 people
and these are based on forest soils which aren't that fertile unless you farm them very very
carefully using elaborate techniques such as terracing many more lived in the surrounding
settlements so population densities were very very high in the mayan heartland around the
city of tikal in this region it's been estimated that population densities may have been greater
in 800 than they are today now this sort of overpopulation particularly if agriculture is not
quite fertile enough to support populations can very easily lead to conflicts overland
to sustained warfare between neighboring city states eventually it can lead to a breakdown of
agricultural systems particularly if you need to maintain irrigation structures or in this case
probably terraced agricultural on hillsides or the building of reservoirs and eventual collapse
so this whole complex in some ways looks very familiar indeed bringing together
climatic problems ecological overreach political overreach overpopulation
and growing political crisis here's a quotation from a scholar of this region that captures this
well co writes the classic maya population of the southern lowlands had probably increased
beyond the carrying capacity of the land no matter what system of agriculture was in use
there is mounting evidence for massive deforestation and erosion throughout the central area only
alleviated in a few favorable zones by dry slope terracing in short overpopulation and environmental
degradation had advanced to a degree only matched by what is happening in many of the poorest
tropical countries today the maya apocalypse he writes for such it surely was surely had ecological
roots but this was not the end this was this was a malthusian collapse followed by a subsequent
malthusian revival mezzo-american civilizations would revive by 1492 when columbus reached the
caribbean there existed in central mexico a huge imperial civilization based on the capital city
of tenoc titlan now mexico city which was built built on lake tezcoco the aztec rulers of tenoc
titlan exacted tributes from neighboring regions and cities using pretty coercive methods they were
they were a very they had a very powerful army and by this time tenoc titlan was probably
one of the most magnificent cities in the world with nearby towns it may have had a population
of two million people now as it happens we have a wonderful description of it in the writings of
courtes lieutenant bernaldias who first saw it in 1519 so i'd love to quote from bernaldias
description of first seeing tenoc titlan next morning he writes we came to a broad causeway
and continued our march towards east apalapa tenoc titlan was built on lake tezcoco so it was built
out on the lake and this is this is the meaning of the of the causeways when we saw all those
cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land and that straight and
level causeway leading to mexico tenoc titlan we were astounded these great towns and buildings
rising from the water all made of stone seemed like an enchanted vision from the tale of amades
indeed some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream it was all so wonderful
that i do not know how to describe this first glimpse of things never heard of seen or dreamed
of before it's it's a lovely description of some of the astonishment felt when the different world
zones came together and people learned of the existence of civilizations whole populations
they'd never known of before okay now let's move on to the andes region in the andes region
agrarian civilizations evolved in modern ecuador peru and chile and also parts of modern bolivia
the main crops here were maize potatoes and quinoa a plant grown mainly for its edible seeds
and the main animal domesticates were llama alpaca and guinea pig along the pacific coast
substantial communities emerged in the second millennium bce so here as in mezzo america
the critical period in which agrarian civilizations are being built up seems to be the second
millennium bce here populations build irrigation systems and ceremonial pyramids now by now you'll
be alert to the fact that this ought to be telling us that we're beginning to see the appearance of
at the very least quite powerful chieftains even if we're not yet talking about agrarian civilizations
the first are sancipian agrarian civilizations and that's really a way of ducking the question of
whether they exactly are or not emerge in the first millennium bce the crucial basis for agrarian
civilizations in this area according to a fairly broad consensus amongst anthropologists
is the ability of emerging states to exploit different ecological zones that extended from
the coast with its arid climates and its rich fishing to the mountain highlands with their
crops of peanuts potatoes cotton and beans towns began to appear some of them with populations of
more than 10 000 each and large public buildings so this is looking a bit like olmec civilizational
olmec chieftains a millennium later the moche state centered near the coast of northern peru
integrated highland and lowland regions of northern peru it organized irrigation
it managed exchanges between the coast and the highland regions using human human porters
lama and alpaca images carved images show evidence of class hierarchies and of warfare
once again as we've seen over and over again once again we find these ubiquitous pictures
of rulers inspecting prisoners and apparently executing at least some of them and we also see
lots of evidence of organized labor at the moche state collapsed sometime in the seventh
century c e this is at about the same time as the maya after a series of spectacular natural
disasters ruined irrigation systems well el el nino systems ruined the rich anchovy fisheries of
the shore and once again it's it's very tempting to think that what we're dealing with here is a
regulation malthusian crisis no writing is known from these early states however by 1500 c e are
a later imperial power the inka had developed a system of communication or accounting based on
knotted strings or kipu the kipu system is slowly being deciphered and what's very clear is you can
use it to convey quite a lot of information of an accounting type but also political
information about instructions to officials for example so this worked pretty well for politics
and accounting we have no evidence that it was still that it was rich enough to work well for
the recording of history or literature but clearly it's evolving in that direction now
were these two major agrarian zones of agrarian civilization these these two major american
zones linked we've seen that in afro-eurasia by the time of marco polo there are quite substantial
exchanges of of people of trade of religions even of diseases right across the eurasian
landmass from china to the mediterranean so what's the evidence in the americas well there
was certainly some evidence of of diffusion and contact between these two zones maize appears to
have diffused to south america from mezzo america by about 2000 b c e and there's one more sign that
there were exchanges going on though they're below the radar of the historians when the spanish arrived
some of the diseases they brought with them appeared to have reached peru
before any of their soldiers did so there were clearly contacts of some kind nevertheless
these contacts were much less intense than those that linked different regions of afro-eurasia
through the silk roads so here we have an area of agrarian civilization or two areas of agrarian
civilization that cover less territory include less populations than those of afro-eurasia but
they're also less interlinked than those of afro-eurasia and one of the crucial reasons may be that with
few animal domesticates transportation systems were less developed in the americas here humans
were the primary beasts of of burden and this is a reminder incidentally once again of how
important the secondary products revolution was in eurasia now let's try and summarize some of this
discussion and try and get a feeling for some of the similarities and differences between the
histories of agrarian civilizations in afro-eurasia and the americas the timing of major subordinate
thresholds is clearly different in the americas similar phenomena appeared but with a considerable
time lag and roughly speaking we can never even get a feeling for what that time lag was judging
by what we know of the political evolution of the americas it was about 3000 years now i don't
want to make too much of this this is not a this is again a very very rough date but here's the
reason for saying that we've seen that the city of montelban perhaps the first real city state in
the americas emerged late in the first millennium bce you'll remember that this is some 3000 years
after the first state structures had appeared in afro-eurasia in sumer similarly by 1500
by 1500 ce much larger imperial structures had appeared such as those of the inca or the asthec
these may be comparable perhaps with the political systems of afro-eurasia in the second millennium
bce here's one reason for saying that you remember ryan target peras estimates of the areas incorporated
within major states well he estimates that the inca and the asthec controlled empires extended
extending over about two megameters and you'll remember that a megameter is about the size of
modern egypt this is considerably less than the size of the achaemenid empire of the first millennium
bce but it's larger than the largest empires of the second millennium bce in afro-eurasia about
3000 years earlier so again there's a rough correspondence between the asthec and the inca
and the larger empires of the second millennium bce in afro-eurasia there are also many other other
minor minor differences between them there are there are cultural differences differences in
ritual practice differences in the way calendars are used and so on yet there are also many striking
similarities in both zones agriculture appeared independently in several regions and when it
appeared it led to population growth increasing exchanges and the evolution of towns cities
states and empires as these large communities evolved and got denser and denser and denser
new problems had to be faced and in both regions and in all these regions they seem to have led
to similar solutions so the result was in both world zones within about two millennia of the
first appearance of agrarian civilizations in about 1500 CE in the case of the americas it is likely
that agrarian civilizations had come to include most of the populations in their respective world
zones within about two millennia of appearing agrarian civilizations include most people in
the world zones in which they've appeared furthermore in both zones agrarian civilizations shared the
same basic emergent properties and we've seen this list before they include cities militarized states
writing systems monumental architecture in fact one of the most striking of these emergent properties
is the fact that pyramids appear in the americas as early as the Olmec period
there are also tribute taking systems and extensive networks of exchange
there's also evidence as we've seen particularly spectacular from the Maya collapse or the collapse
of the of Moche civilization may represent the same phenomenon of long-term patterns of rise
and fall reminiscent of the Malthusian cycles of Afro-Eurasia so there's a good reason to think
that the Malthusian cycle is a pattern we find in both these world zones and that suggests that
in the americas as in Afro-Eurasia though there was clearly innovation on a long trend nevertheless
it was too slow to avoid eventual periodic demographic ecological and political collapses
so what do these similarities suggest they suggest that similar drivers are operating in both
zones collective learning drove innovation leading to population increase which generated a common
set of problems and opportunities and eventually yielded parallel solutions and outcomes if this
is true there is indeed a long-term shape to human history and the comparison between these regions
illustrates that fundamental truth about human history so we've seen that despite many important
differences there were striking similarities in the histories of these different world zones
in which agrarian civilizations evolved and this suggests that in all zones similar forces were
at work even if the pace of historical change was significantly different now we start to explore
how these forces shaped what i'll call the modern era of human history thank you
lecture 38 threshold 8 the modern revolution
let's clamber back on board our combined space and time machine orbiting the earth
we used it to survey the 4 000 years of the later agrarian era and what we saw from the machine
was the slow expansion of agrarian civilizations and we also saw their characteristic rhythm
of rise and fall this pattern of malthusian cycles and we noticed one other crucial thing we
noted the the strange parallels between the histories of different world zones as well as some
of the significant differences in the pace of change now what we're going to do is to take a
quick look at the next thousand years for a few centuries it's pretty much plain sailing it all
looks fairly familiar though in several regions both in afro-eurasia and the americas we can see
population expanding quite rapidly and some large and powerful empires appearing particularly
striking are the mongol empire which reached in the mid-13th century from korea to eastern europe
and in the americas the aztec and inka empires then things seemed to suddenly go very strange
from 1500 onwards the pace of change accelerates suddenly the isolation of the different world
zones is broken in the first phase of what today we call globalization the world suddenly comes
together it's interlinked for the first time in human history then from about 1700 changes appear
that within 300 years will have transformed the entire world population numbers go crazy
now it's tempting to think that if the appearance of the first cities and states parallel star
formation the modern revolution is like a supernova it's breaking down existing structures and
it's scattering new elements into space but even this image doesn't really capture the creative
aspects of the modern revolution here are some of the more astonishing things we'll see some of
the more astonishing changes that we'll see from our time and space capsule one of the most
astonishing is changes in the number of human beings on planet earth in 1000 ce there are 250
million humans on earth by 1700 there are almost 700 million by 1900 there are 1.6 billion and by
2000 there are 6 billion of us in my own lifetime human populations have increased by 3.5 billions
and remember just a thousand years ago the total population on earth was just 250 millions
as lin margulis and dorian sagan put it humans have become a sort of mammalian weed and carlo
chipola comments that a biologist looking at the diagram showing the recent growth of world
population in a long-range perspective is almost bound to say faced with this graph
that what they're seeing is the curve of a microd population in a body suddenly
struck by an infectious disease and chipola ends by commenting the basilis man is taking over the
world we see huge cities begin to light up around the world and by some estimates total global output
of goods and services may have increased by a hundred times in just 250 years that it helps explain
why despite rapid population growth somehow most of these people are still being clothed fed and
housed and though many live in dire poverty considerable numbers live at higher material
living standards than ever before this is the world we live in today now what is it about this
new world that allows it to support such staggering numbers of human beings clearly by now we're no
longer in the agrarian world we've crossed a new threshold we've crossed the eighth and final
threshold of this course and i will call this threshold the modern revolution what this lecture
does is introduce the idea of the modern revolution and try to suggest how we might begin trying to
both understand it to grasp its essence and to explain how it happened so what is the modern
revolution well the modern revolution is a simple answer is that the modern revolution is the series
of explosive changes we saw from our time and space machine but can we get a slightly more
precise grip on this astonishing phenomenon well let's begin with chronology let's clarify
chronology first the modern era is the third of our three great eras the first two being
the paleolithic era which lasted about 200 000 years and the agrarian era which lasted about
10 000 years the modern era has lasted so far remember it's still continuing just a few hundred years
of course all periodizations are somewhat arbitrary but for the sake of clarity let
me set out the periodization that i'm going to use in the lectures that follow i'll suggest
that we define the modern era as having started about 300 years ago in 1700 now that's of course
a slightly symbolic date but i pick 1700 because that is when we first begin to see in some regions
of the world a transition to radically different types of society that are capable of extraordinarily
rapid rates of innovation and change however the roots of change lay in the previous millennium or
so so our explanations of the appearance of the modern era era will begin almost a thousand years
earlier sometime in the first millennium c e as for the period after 1700 i'm going to divide it
into two main sections the first extends approximately from 1700 to 1900 in this period parts of the
world particularly in europe and the atlantic region were transformed and as a result of that
transformation they acquired unprecedented wealth and power the second period begins in about 1900
and it embraces the 20th century and the early years of the 21st century in it modernity began
to transform the rest of the world as well so what we've seen is that within just 300 years the entire
world has been transformed the speed and comprehensiveness of this change is itself one of the most
striking features of the modern revolution remember it took 200 000 years for paleolithic
populations to spread around the world it took 10 000 years for agrarian civilizations to transform
transform much of the world the impact of the modern revolution has been felt within just three
centuries okay definitions now let's try and zero in on what we mean by this phrase the modern
revolution let's begin with the reality that today's world is simply radically different from the world
of 1000 years ago now i could pick a million examples let me just pick one random but spectacular
and i think rather important example of what i mean we've seen that our unique ability to adapt
and change as humans depends on what i've called collective learning this is the ability to swap
information with great efficiency and i've argued that this is fundamental to our ability to adapt
and change 800 years ago the fastest way of transporting information from community a to
community b of transporting information over a large area was along the courier systems established
throughout the mongol empire marco polo gives a wonderful description of these they were one of
the major political projects of the of the mongol empire and the rulers of the mongol empire regarded
this post-war system as extremely important marco polo estimated that couriers could travel if
necessary as as fast as 250 miles a day changing horses perhaps every 25 miles but frankly this
was really no faster than the post-war systems of the achaemenid empire which we heard herodotus
describing the thought that just a few centuries after marco polo an ordinary citizen might be able
to communicate instantaneously with another citizen anywhere in the world or even if they really
wanted to that they might be able to fly to the other side of the world in less than 24 hours
would have seemed the purest fantasy yet that's the world we live in today it's a world in which
exchanges on a global scale of information collective learning in fact can take place
instantaneously around the entire globe i've called the modern revolution one of our eight
main thresholds and this is because it does indeed count as a revolution in complexity and we've seen
already eric scheson's calculations of energy density flows carry the implication if they're
accurate that modern human societies may be one of the most complex things we know so we're
describing the modern revolution we're watching the creation of this astonishingly complex phenomenon
in what ways does this count as more complex well first modern society has more structure
than any earlier types of human communities just one illustration is the huge variety of roles
that are available to individuals in this world it's much greater than it was in the agrarian world
where the majority of people were peasants and the structures of the modern world now are not
just local or regional they're global they extend across the entire world think of the
astonishing organizational and technological challenge of keeping a modern city going like
new york or beijing or Mumbai it's staggering there's nothing like it in the agrarian era
so first the simply more structure the modern world involves more complex components more
components and they're linked together in more complex ways second modern societies mobilize
and use energy flows many times greater than those typical of earlier eras of human history
now here's just one calculation that tries to give some feeling for this
Ian Simmons estimates that humans today may be using on average per capita
almost 10 times as much energy as his calculation for humans who lived a thousand years ago
yet in the same period human populations have risen by about 24 times from about 250
millions to about six billions now what that suggests is that total energy use today if these
figures are right is about 10 times 24 or about 240 times what it was just 1000 years ago and of
course the key to this is the use of fossil fuels third we've seen there's more structure we've seen
there are far greater energy flows third associated with the modern revolution is a spectacular range
of new emergent properties this is where the analogy with the super supernova works quite
nicely supernova we saw spilled new chemical ingredients into the universe these properties
we could spend a long time listing them they include the ability to fly to communicate instantly
across the globe they include the existence of cities of 20 million people they include also
weaponry capable of obliterating these same cities in a few minutes so we can also say
there are new emergent properties now what about stability the fourth element in complexity how
stable are they now that's an interesting question which we're going to have to leave
hanging in the air because all of this change is so rapid that as yet we don't really know the
answer to that question okay can we pin down these changes can we define their essence now the
trouble is there've been so many of them they're so various they've transformed human life in so
many areas that it's extremely difficult to pin down the essential nature of these changes
here with the modern revolution more than ever before in this course the challenge
is to see the whole elephant and not just the wrinkles on its skin now the result of this blur
of information and changes is that describing what we mean by modernity or the modern revolution
is extremely difficult we have to try somehow though to grasp the essence of modernity from a
big history perspective what does it look like from our time and space capsule there are other
difficulties one is that the changes continue today which makes it very difficult to grasp the
overall shape of change in the modern era that the changes are continuing we can't see the overall
shape of this era in fact that's why i've labeled it the modern era and i'm using the idea of the
adjective modern deliberately in a fairly empty sense to simply mean the era closest to us because
it's very hard to pin down its essence with agriculture you could say agriculture was the
essence of those changes with modernity it's not absolutely clear yet what is the essence of change
the result of all these difficulties is profound disagreement about what we mean by modernity
some will say it meant new ways of thinking new attitudes that these these began perhaps
during the european enlightenment some will stress economics some will even claim that
modernity is over that we now live in a postmodern era
the result of all these disagreements is that i'm going to have to
take some decisions about what we focus on and the discussion that follows represents an attempt
to pick out the crucial features of the modern revolution as seen through the wide lens of
big history and that's a lens that tries to see this threshold as one in a long sequence of thresholds
that reaches back to the very origins of our universe the approach i'll adopt builds however
on a long tradition of debate about modernity that includes major thinkers from adam smith
to carl marx and max vapor and up to many contemporary thinkers so we have plenty of ideas
once again though the problem is so many ideas it's hard to it's hard to decide which are the most
crucial ones and one more thing the big history perspective has certain consequences for how
we look at modernity the first is going to be and this is a sort of product warning that some
familiar landmarks such as the french revolution or the renaissance or the enlightenment may seem
to vanish entirely at these scales for example the renaissance is going to zoom past so quickly
it'll be a bit of a blur a bit like a passing train in the night what we're looking for are the very
large patterns of change a second consequence of the big history perspective is that we'll try to
see the modern revolution as a global phenomenon unlike many traditional accounts that have seen
it largely as a product of changes in europe or the west recent scholarship in world history has
shown very very clearly that the transformations were indeed global and they had global roots
modernity is not just a european or western phenomenon the americas for example played a
crucial role early on as suppliers of new crops and also as suppliers of vast amounts of silver
to the world economy and today of course the americas are the home of the most powerful and
richest nation on earth okay with those preliminaries out of the way i'm going to stick my neck out
and suggest four defining features of the modern revolution this is the first
and i'll argue later it's probably the most fundamental rates of innovation accelerated
sharply now let me remind you the word innovation is a modern economist term but it sort of overlaps
with the biologists term adaptation so we're talking about adaptation this is absolutely
fundamental it represents a sort of gear shift in the synergy of collective learning
this acceleration in innovation or adaptation had several consequences it increased the pace of
historical change we've seen it took 200 000 years for foraging lifeways to spread around the world
about 10 000 years for agriculture to do so and just two to 300 years for the modern revolution
and that's a direct consequence of this increase in the speed of innovation and change
innovation also increased human control over the energy and resources of the biosphere
because this is what innovation always does it always means finding new ways of extracting
resources from the biosphere but there are further aspects to this what's what's happened
is that innovation has become institutionalized in the modern era in modern institutions of
education and science that can that have constructed formal structures to encourage
and sustain innovation so we're now deliberately innovating in a way that has no parallel in
earlier epochs now here's the second the second crucial defining feature of the modern era it is
that innovations drove many other changes they increased available resources this allowed humans
to multiply creating larger denser and more complex societies than those of the agrarian era
the general pattern is one we've seen before innovations lead to intensification to increasing
population density creating greater social complexity we've seen the numbers already human
numbers rise from 250 millions a thousand years ago to about nine 50 millions in 1800 c e to about
six billions in 2000 c e what we're seeing is a 30 fold increase in human populations in a thousand
years as in the agrarian era larger communities meant new lifeways new types of power structure
wage earning replaced peasant farming as the normal way of earning a living and this is probably
one of those things that is less obvious but it's one of the changes that affected probably the
largest number of people in some european societies peasants became less than 50 percent of the
population as early as the 18th century globally this threshold had probably been reached by the
end of the 20th century the great british historian eric hobsbawm puts this almost at the center of
his account of the 20th century he writes the most dramatic and far-reaching social change of the
second half of the 20th century and the one which cuts us off forever from the world of the past
is the death of the peasantry as a part of this build-up of resources governments became larger
more powerful and more intrusive they had they they had the capacity to interfere in daily life
on a vastly greater scale than the rather clumsy tributary governments of the agrarian era but
they also became more responsive to the needs and capacities of their subjects and we'll see
that this was necessary simply to handle the complexity of modern societies and human society
became global since the 16th century this is the third great feature of modernity human society
becomes global it's it's globalization an early stage in globalization since the 16th century
human societies have exchanged goods ideas diseases and people within a single global network for the
first time humans meet each other not within the limits of these world zones but globally
improved technologies of communications and transportation have steadily tightened these
links over the last few hundred years that's the third feature globalization and the fourth
is that our species has begun to transform the biosphere by some estimates humans may now be
controlling or managing the disposal of 25 to 40 percent of all the energy that enters the biosphere
through photosynthesis this is staggering ecological power for a single species and there are other
ways of measuring this and these are just illustrative modern weaponry is now so powerful
that humans could if they chose destroy much of the biosphere within a few hours the bomb dropped
on Hiroshima on august the 6th 1945 was simply a horrifying demonstration of this power the
diversion of biospheric resources to human use has also had a profound effect on other species on
other parts of the biosphere through loss of habitat and increasing extinctions and as we now
know it's beginning to transform the global climate system mainly through global warming and here's
a quote from two Scott scholars Ravel and Seuss that captures this very night nicely they wrote
this as early as 1957 human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a
kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future within a few centuries
we are returning to the atmosphere and oceans the concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary
rocks over hundreds of millions of years the environmental historian John McNeill writes
for most of earth's history microbes played the leading role of all life in shaping the atmosphere
in the 20th century he writes humankind stumbled blindly into this role so here are four defining
features a sharp increase in innovation innovation had a large number of consequences in other areas
the globalization of human history and finally a sharp increase in human impacts on the biosphere
now let's start talking about the even more difficult problem of explaining this defining
the modern revolution is tough enough can we explain it what i want to do is it is is describe
the strategy i'm going to adopt for explaining the modern revolution i'm going to begin by
focusing on one of these four features and that is the first accelerating innovation
because this is really the key to most other aspects of the modern revolution
only a very sharp increase in innovation or adaptation can possibly explain how within
this period humans have found it possible to support so many other humans now if we focus on
this accelerating innovation this simplifies our task a bit it means we can focus on just
trying to explain one of our four features so now the challenge is can we explain why innovation
accelerated so sharply in the last few hundred years economists and historians have discussed the
main drivers of innovation at least since the publication 1776 of the wealth of nations by
adam smith and in discussing the agrarian era we already started looking at these discussions
and considering possible drivers of innovation and growth a short list of familiar drivers of
innovation that appear in the literature might include some of the following first the power of
states something we looked at in discussing the agrarian era we've seen that tributary states could
generate innovation but we've also seen that they could stifle it so this looks an unpromising
candidate for explaining the modern revolution here's a second we've looked at population growth
we saw that ester bosarup argued that population growth itself encouraged innovation
yet we've also seen that throughout the later agrarian era there were these malthusian crises
now if population is encouraging growth they ought to appear the fact that they did shows that
population growth does not always encourage growth so let's drop that one a third idea changing
ideas this has played a very important role in a lot of debates about modernity the german sociologist
max Weber argued that Protestantism encouraged the spread of capitalism the trouble is if he's
right how in turn can we explain the rise of Protestantism quite apart from the fact that
many scholars have shown that many aspects of Catholicism or Buddhism for that matter or
Confucianism could also be compatible with capitalism so though these drivers have been
discussed a lot i'm not going to treat them as the keys to explaining modernity instead i'm
going to focus on three other drivers which we've already met in slightly different guises the first
is commercialization and the spread of competitive markets the second is the spread of capitalism
and the third is the expansion of global exchange networks and let me describe each of these briefly
driver one increasing commerce adam smith argued that specialization raises productivity people
if they're highly specialized can do their work more efficiently efficiently than if they're
generalists and specialization he said depends on the extent of market competition
here's how he put it the greatest improvement in the productive power of labor and the greater part
of the skilled dexterity and judgment with which it is anywhere directed or applied seemed to have
been the effects of the division of labor that's chapter one of the wealth of nations in chapter
two he writes this division of labor from which so many advantages are derived is not originally
the effect of any human wisdom which foresees and intends that general opulence to which it can
occasion it is the necessary the very slow and gradual consequence of a certain propensity in
human nature which has in view no such extensive utility and that propensity is the propensity to
truck barter and exchange one thing for another what he's saying essentially is as market relations
spread as people are allowed to truck and barter more that will increase the division of labor
specialization and productivity so here's smith's key idea and this is what we've called smithian
growth now his driver to capitalism it sort of overlaps with the first driver carl marx whose
dates are 1818 to 1883 spent most of his life trying to overthrow capitalism but he was also
a great admirer of capitalism because he saw how powerfully capitalism could raise productivity
his ideas expand in important ways on those of smith he offered a social structure theory of
growth which implies that different social structures have different impacts on innovation
and we've already seen this in the agrarian era we've seen that neither peasants nor tribute
taking elites really have a sustained interest in innovation though both groups can occasionally
innovate capitalism marx argued is different the dominant groups are not tribute takers but
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs make their wealth by trading officially efficiently on
competitive markets they have to spend all their life thinking about innovation and the majority
class in a capitalist society consists not of self-sufficient peasants but of wage earners
who have to work hard and efficiently to market their labor so they too have to think about
productivity so here we have a social structure in capitalism in which both elites and the majority
of the population have to concern themselves with productivity all the time so the spread of
capitalism ought to encourage innovation driver three is the sudden expansion in the size of
exchange networks and therefore of collective learning the coming together of the four world
zones from the 16th century stimulated commerce and capitalism by simply expanding the scale
and intensity and variety of entrepreneurial activity and information exchanges throughout the
world and we'll see that this sudden rearrangement of global networks of exchange also shifted the
centers of wealth and power in the world away from their traditional centers in afro-eurasia
in the mediterranean mesopotamian persian indian and chinese zones to a region that had previously
been completely marginal the atlantic seaboard that would prove to be one of the most radical of
all the changes associated with the modern revolution so now let's take these crucial
drivers of innovation and see if we can use them to explain the slow build-up to the critical moment
at which modernity really took off in 1700 thank you
lecture 39 the medieval malthusian cycle 500 to 1350
so when did the modern revolution begin when and how was the explosion of the modern revolution
ignited what are the signs we should look for this is a question very similar to the one we've
asked about earlier thresholds such as the threshold leading to the appearance of human
beings or agriculture in the next two lectures i try to answer these questions to define and
identify the moment at which when the threshold was crossed and i'll do so using ideas sketched out
in the previous lecture what i'm going to do is to survey world history over roughly the last 1500
years through two malthusian cycles to see if we can detect elements of modernity falling into place
remember what we mean by malthusian cycles these are cycles in which population growth
may initially stimulate growth in other sectors of society economy even culture or the expansion
of political systems but eventually population growth outstrips growth in resources and that
leads to an eventual collapse of populations of states and sometimes entire civilizations
and that's why we call it a cycle this lecture describes what i'll call the medieval malthusian
cycle it begins roughly in the in the middle of the first millennium about 500 ce this is not long
after the decline of the roman and han empires and it continues to about 1350 the time of the black
death the second cycle we'll look at in the next lecture i'll call the early modern malthusian cycle
that begins at the time of the black death about 1350 and lasts until about 1700 in this first
lecture as we follow the medieval malthusian cycle will focus almost entirely on afro-eurasia
which was the largest and most significant of the four world zones but it was also the region
that probably drove most change in the early stages of the modern revolution so here's our strategy
we're going to focus on one key aspect of modernity accelerating innovation because as i argued in
the last lecture this seems to be the key to understanding all other or at least most other
aspects of modernity consequently we're going to try and keep our eyes on three
crucial drivers of innovation three factors that might have led to an acceleration in rates of
innovation and let me remind you these three are commercialism that is to say the spread
of competitive markets and of entrepreneurial activity associated with markets secondly the
spread of capitalism and thirdly a rapid expansion in the extent of exchange networks
so we'll ask can we detect any evidence of an increase in the importance of these drivers of
innovation that might help explain an increase in rates of innovation and we'll also try and find
if we can see in this period any evidence that rates of innovation are beginning to rise
so we'll be asking did commercialism commercialization raise productivity by encouraging specialization
this is smithian growth we'll ask did entrepreneurial activity and wage earning the two key key features
of capitalism become more important and if so did they tend to accelerate innovation and third
and third we'll ask did exchange networks expand and if so did they stimulate commercial activity
and information exchanges the other thing we're going to look for is signs of a shift in wealth
and power to a new hub region around the atlantic remember the great powers that is to say the
major centers of both of wealth of urbanization of high culture and of political power during
most of the later agrarian era could be found around the Mediterranean in the north of the
Indian subcontinent and in China the great powers of the modern revolution so far and I have to say
this because this could change within a generation or two have been located in the atlantic region
and that was a region that was completely marginal to world history before the last millennium
so can we detect the beginnings of this shift in wealth and power from the traditional centers
of Eurasia to the atlantic region a region that was completely marginal before northwest Europe
remember was an area of barbarians even in the time of the roman empire the eastern seaboard
of the usa had even less connection with major centers of agrarian civilization
and finally there's one more thing we must keep an eye out for or at least remember during this
discussion and that is the idea of accumulation during the 4 000 years of the later agrarian era
despite malthusian fluctuations we saw that on a long trend populations increased markets expanded
and new technologies emerged in much of the world without this slow accumulation of skills and
resources and technologies and experience the modern revolution could not possibly have occurred so
this was the foundation for it all the slow accumulation of wealth populations technologies
and organizational skills during the later agrarian era that was the foundation
okay let's look at the medieval malthusian cycle which ran i remind you from about 500 c.e. that's
a largely symbolic date i mean somewhere in the middle of the first millennium to about 1350 c.e.
the time of the black death let's begin with population figures because malthusian crises
malthusian cycles rather are most easily seen as patterns of rise and form fall in population
now i'm going to have to ask you to upload into your imagination a sort of graph drawing machine
i'm going to give you the figures and see if you can mentally draw the graph it's not that
hard and it's a fairly simple graph you'll need first to place dates along the vertical axis so
let me give you the crucial dates here are the dates the first is 600 c.e. now that's two centuries
after the fall of the roman empire the second date is 1000 c.e. that's when the vikings set up a
colony in newfoundland that didn't last long but it's the first contact that we know of between
the oration zone and the americas in recent millennia that's the second date 1000 c.e.
the third is 1300 c.e. marco polo has just been released from a genoese jail where with a fellow
convict a writer of romances from pizza called rousticello he's just completed an account of
his travels to china that's 1300 c.e. and the fourth date is 1400 in meso america the mexica
from their city in what is now mexico city ten octetlan
were beginning to build the aztec empire so here are the data you need to add to the graph and
remember our four dates are 600 1000 1300 and 1400 european populations rose from about 22
millions in 600 to about 30 millions in 1000 to about 70 millions in 1300 and then they dropped
to about 52 millions in 1400 there's the malthusian downturn but if you look at this sequence of
figures as a whole you'll also see something else and that is that the long trend is still
arise even after the collapse populations in europe are larger than they were at the beginning of
the cycle so that's why i argued that malthusian cycles for the most part seem to have been cycles
on a rising trend now here are the figures for china 49 million in 600 c.e 56 million in 1000 c.e
83 million in 1300 c.e and 70 million in 1400 you can see the same pattern you can see the
malthusian downturn and you can also see the general trend which is towards increasing population
and finally the figures for the indian subcontinent and once again we're going to see the same thing
here are the figures 37 million in 600 c.e 40 in 1000 100 in 1300 and 74 in 1400
so that is a kind of graphic sketch of this medieval malthusian cycle
now let's look at some of the things that happened during the cycle
what commerce develops very rapidly in fact so fast during the cycle that the historian
robert lo pez claimed that there was a commercial revolution in europe in the later middle ages
and robert lo pez and many historians of his generation have often been inclined to think
that this is the key to understanding modernity but since he wrote several decades of work by
world historians have shown a slightly different picture and that picture is that the commercial
revolution was not just a european phenomenon it affected all of eurasia as in all malthusian cycles
growth began with innovations that stimulated population growth new technologies included
improved strains of rice in china and improved plows and yolks in europe we've already met these
improved yolks they allowed you to harness a horse without choking it when it pulled too hard because
they were attached more to its shoulders than to its neck populations grew fastest in regions
such as south china or east europe that had previously been underpopulated frontier regions
population growth in turn stimulated growth in other sectors of society they stimulated commerce
as as villages and towns expanded there's more exchange between them they stimulated urbanization
the appearance of new towns of new villages of new major cities and they also stimulated cultural
efflorescence where there's a lot of money about you you find patrons and you find governments with
spare cash and they may invest it in things like gothic cathedrals so the number and size of cities
and the richness of the culture they could support increased throughout eurasia
and populations became very dense in this period according to asa briggs by the late 13th
century and i quote a bigger area was cultivated in england than at any period before the wars of
the 20th century bagdad and cairo were among the largest cities in the muslim lands that dominated
the eurasian heartland but by the end of the cycle it may have been that china was the most
urbanized region in the world by the 12th century china may already have been extremely
highly urbanized with well over 10 percent of its people in the towns hangzhou marco polo's
kinzai that's what marco polo called the city was the capital of the southern song dynasty
and it may have been the world's largest city with at least a million inhabitants
it it contained many different suburbs it contained working class suburbs with crowded
multi-story houses it contained foreign quarters with sections for christians jews and turks it had
a large muslim quarter with many foreign traders and it also had a wealthy southern region that
was dominated by government officials and rich merchants and we have some idea of the astonishing
variety of trades conducted in the town zha gianna's list of the guilds of hangzhou include
jewelers guilders glue makers art and antique dealers sellers of crabs olives honey or ginger
doctors soothsayers scavengers bootmakers bathkeepers and money changers so in this period
the largest cities in the world could probably be found mainly in china let me remind you that
that that wonderful list of different professions is what smith is talking about when he's talking
about the division of of labor people becoming more and more specialized in very highly specialized
professions or activities as the size of the market expands and can support more and more
highly specialized professions now let's look at trade networks we've looked at some of the
phenomena of expansion in this period now let's look at trade networks trade networks or networks
of exchange is another phrase i've used reached further in this era than they ever had before
muslims dominated the silk roads which were i suppose the sort of backbone of exchanges in
eurasia the extenders we've seen from from china through to the mediterranean and down into india
but europeans were increasingly active so europe which had been a marginal zone in the time of
the roman empire is becoming increasingly significant in international exchanges by 1300
vikings had reached iceland greenland and even north america where they established the short
lived colony of newfoundland in 1000 c e while venetian traders such as marco polo had reached
china indeed in in marco polo's time in about 1300 c e just after publishers began issuing
regular travel guides to travelers heading for china these are sort of medieval versions of the
of the sort of travel guides we use today except they're aimed primarily at merchants so they
tell you about prices where you find translators what sort of money to take with you what sort of
goods to take with you where you're going to make your best sales and so on as exchange networks
increased commercial activity and other exchanges between different regions capitalism flourished
and as capitalism flourished wage earning and entrepreneurial activity expanded let's begin
with wage earning wage earning is a crucial part of the story we saw that in agrarian civilizations
peasants as a rule of thumb probably made up 90 percent of the population uh they are not very
specialized and for the most part they have limited incentives to innovate so as the number of wage
earners expands in society this itself may be a very powerful index of commercialization
and of the emergence of more capitalistic types of societies what very often happened
is that peasants in many regions found themselves sucked into capitalist networks
government demands to pay taxes in cash could force them to try and find cash if governments
will no longer accept payment in kind in animals or in eggs or in in wheat you have to find cash
and you have to look beyond your peasant farm for it land shortage could also drive them to
see cash if they don't have enough land to support their household or so can indebtedness they run
into debt then they're going to have to pay their debtors in cash or the need to buy goods on markets
all of these forces could drive peasants to earn cash and that meant drive them on to markets in
various ways they could earn money by selling surplus produce but generally that was available
to the wealthier peasants or they could earn money perhaps by selling goods such as textiles
manufactured in the households now this of course means they're functioning not just as pure peasants
supporting themselves from the land they're also functioning as petty artisans they might be making
silk they might be making textiles but they're half in the peasant world they're half in the wage
earning world or finally if things get really tough peasants might send one or two members of a
household to seek wage work as laborers in nearby towns or on nearby farms so in all these ways
peasants could slowly find themselves getting sucked into networks of commerce and wage earning
and these are some of the very subtle ways in which peasantries slowly began to turn into
classes of wage earners in this sort of environment entrepreneurs also flourished
their power was particularly striking at the edges of the great empires in southeast asia
or in the Mediterranean where powerful small trading states flourished such as venice or
genoa in fact in in in those cases we are talking about states where mercantile activity is so
important that merchants actually rule them now to illustrate the power of some of these changes
to stimulate innovation i want to focus in on china between 960 and 1279 in the era of the song
dynasty because the history of china in this in this era illustrates very well the transformative
power of these changes first let's go back in time since china was first unified in 221 bce
by the by the uh the first unified emperor shihuang di china had been the very epitome
of a traditional agrarian era tribute taking empire its rulers controlled huge revenues
exacted mostly in the form of tributes from a vast peasantry and most of those tributes came
from the land and like most agrarian elite groups they tended to despise commerce even though markets
flourished in china and played a pretty significant role in its economy so here we have a very
conventional tributary state but then in the 10th century things start to change this is a pattern
that had occurred before as central government broke down and was then revived but the striking
thing about china is for how much of the last 2000 years it was ruled by unified governments and
also europe's very different in the 10th century north china was conquered by dynasties originating
in manchuria and in tibet suddenly china instead of being a unified empire is divided into three
large warring states and the song dynasty is now confined to the south its rulers find themselves
facing very serious military challenges from their rivals to the north and they also have
a shrinking tax base because they ruled a smaller area and this poses very severe problems you have
very severe military problems and you've got less revenue to deal with it so what happens
is the song rulers suddenly find that despite their distaste for mercantile activity they're forced
to start exacting revenue from commercial activity and that means they're forced to start working
with entrepreneurs with merchants and in fact behaving a bit like the entrepreneurial rulers
of commercial city states such as venice or genoa here's one piece of evidence of this
in just 200 years the share of chinese government revenues from foreign trade rose from just two
percent initially tiny share to 20 percent a quite substantial share not surprisingly the song
government began to back traders and to encourage trade including foreign trade now our model of
drivers of innovation predicts that if commercial activity becomes more and more important if
governments start supporting it actively we should expect innovation to accelerate does it
in a now classic study mark elvin the study's called the pattern of the chinese past
describes the remarkable acceleration of innovation in this era here are just some
illustrations of it there were innovations in agriculture new strains of rice from vietnam
led to rapid population growth in the south and it's striking that the use of these new
strains was was actively encouraged by government propaganda using woodblock printing so that they
could distribute leaflets to provincial officials telling them how to use these strains how to
encourage their use and so on in manufacturing government factories produce 32 000 suits of
armor each year in the 11th century in this period iron was produced in amounts that would
not be matched again until the industrial revolution in 18th century europe and copper production rose
so fast that ice cores taken from greenland glaciers today show a sudden increase in atmospheric
copper pollution in this era in weaponry this was the era when gunpowder first began to be used
in war so there's an astonishing range of innovations it really looks as if innovation is
beginning to take off so we have to ask was china song china perhaps on the verge of any of an
early industrial revolution as society and governments became more commercialized and
more capitalistic well foreign trade's a wonderful illustration of this
particularly striking in this period are advances in naval technology between 1405
and 1433 a muslim admiral and eunuch eunuch jung-her led seven huge chinese fleets with
up to 60 ships and 40 000 soldiers in voyages to india south west asia and east africa on the
coast of east africa you can still find the remains of ming vases left by these expeditions
and we know that at least one giraffe was brought back by these fleets to china
there's no good evidence incidentally that his ships reached the americas though they might
have had the ability to do so in theory jung-herr's largest ships were at least five times the
length of columbus's ships they had watertight internal compartments they used compasses to
navigate in all in all this is fantastically sophisticated navigation and it shows that song
china is not merely highly commercialized highly innovative but it's also beginning to reach out
to other parts of the world then what happens in 1279 a mongol dynasty which took the the the
chinese name of the yuan reunited china under a ruler named kubla khan he was the grandson
of jingis khan and in 1368 the yuan themselves were overthrown by a new chinese dynasty the ming
so now what you have is a reunited china many of the pressures on governments to engage more
seriously in commercial activities of various kinds are now off the pressure diminishes and
they can revert to the behavior of much more conventional agrarian tribute taking states
and they can fall back on the norms of of confucianism and traditional cultural attitudes
which despised commerce slowly government practice reverted to the anti-commercial
tribute taking methods of earlier times the amount of revenue from trade diminishes
governments stop backing commerce and trade and the ming even tried to ban foreign trade
it was in this period that the voyages of jung-herr are ended
so innovation slowed it slowed partly because reunited chinese governments had less need to
support commerce so the entire commercial activity of china instead of being backed by states
is now being stifled by state activity but the other reason why this did not lead to a sort of
not lead to a sort of takeoff was because the world as a whole was as yet too disconnected
for innovations to spread rapidly so what was happening in china didn't turn out to be the
starting point for a global industrial revolution some of the some of the changes some of the
innovations such as gunpowder and use of the compass did indeed diffuse slowly across eurasia
but it took a long time in the mid 14th century then the medieval malthusian cycle ended and it
ended in a crash that affected most of eurasia we find signs of ecological overreach in many
parts of of eurasia it's been particularly well studied in in europe you find overpopulation
you find increasing numbers of famines you find weakened populations more subject to disease
overpopulation and mal malnutrition becomes more common and then eventually in the middle
of the 14th century the plague spreads from china through central asia to the Mediterranean world
in many regions it killed off a third of the population what this crash suggests
is that rates of innovation though impressive in some regions was still not yet rapid enough
to match population growth so the malthusian pattern would continue in 1350 the main structures
of agrarian civilizations including tribute taking elites and peasant farmers remained firmly in place
and eurasia was still dominated by the traditional hub regions so the structures of the later agrarian
era still seem to dominate change in the history of the whole of eurasia the commerce capitalism
and international exchange is flourished during the medieval malthusian cycle and remember we
called it a cycle precisely because it doesn't lead to sustained growth they could not yet overcome
the technological inertia that was characteristic as we've seen of most agrarian civilizations
and this is why the medieval malthusian cycle for all its innovation for all the growth that occurred
during it should not count as a significant turning point on the road to modernity the next
lecture is going to survey changes during the early modern malthusian cycle which lasted from
1350 to 1700 and we'll ask the same questions is there any evidence here that we're on the verge
of a breakthrough thank you
lecture 40 the early modern cycle 1350 to 1700
so when did change become so rapid that we can no longer say we are still in the agrarian era
we asked this question of the medieval malthusian cycle that ran from 500 CE to 1350 and what we saw
was that though we can see an increase in the significance of our three main drivers of growth
which are commerce capitalism and the expansion of exchange networks
the population crash at the end of the cycle confirms the impression that we've not yet
left the agrarian age now we ask similar questions of the next large malthusian cycle which extends
from about 1350 the era of the black death to about 1700 and this i'll call the early modern
malthusian cycle let me first give you the population figures so we you get a sense of the
general shape of this malthusian cycle once more you might want to mentally upload a graph
and it's got the following dates the first date is 1400 remember that's when the Aztecs are building
their empire in central mexico and much of Eurasia is recovering from the black death the next date
is 1500 just eight years after columbus's return from his first trip to the americas the next date
is 1600 this is a very easy sequence we're going century by century 1600 is when figures such as
Galileo are beginning to transform european science while the americas are beginning to recover from
a demographic catastrophe far more severe than the black death and the last date is 1700 which we
take as a symbolic starting date for the modern era so let me give you some population figures
let's begin with europe european populations in 1400 were about 52 millions 52 millions in 1500
there was 67 in 1600 they were 89 and in 1700 they were 95 now you'll note we're not seeing
a crash here at most we're seeing a sort of slowdown in growth in the late 17th century and
there is indeed evidence of a sort of minor dip in the 17th century and in fact throw
throughout much of Eurasia but there's no real crash here are the equivalent figures for china
70 84 110 and 150 and the figures for India are 74 95 145 and finally 175 million now in the case
of china too you can find evidence for a slowdown certainly in the 17th century but here we find no
evidence of a crash at the end of this cycle and this provides the first hint that global
rates of productivity may have been beginning to keep pace with population growth better than ever
before so that's an already an interesting sign that we may be on the verge of modernity so did
this cycle bring the world closer to modernity did rates of innovation begin to accelerate sharply
how rapidly did commerce and capitalism expand did the world become more interconnected
and we'll see that the answers to these questions are slightly contradictory
first the first and most spectacular change probably of all in this period was in exchange
networks and this has to count as one of the most spectacular changes in all of human history
what happens after the voyages of columbus is that the four world zones are linked over the next
200 years for the first time in human history and the creation of this first global exchange
network stimulated commerce and capitalism the linking of the four world zones counts as I've
said as one of the great events of human history suddenly it was a bit as if pangea had been
recreated as ideas goods crops people and also diseases began to circulate rapidly across the
entire globe as they never had before we've seen before history seemed to take place in four completely
isolated domains now for the first time this is the first step towards what we call globalization
today history human history is taking place on a single integrated stage much larger and more
varied and more diverse than any of the stages on which it had taken place before
this weaving together of the four world zones was the work of european mariners using highly
maneuverable ships equipped with cannon and they were backed by aggressive commercially minded
governments christopher columbus crossed the atlantic and headed back in 1492 the first
captain known to have circumnavigated the globe was Juan Sebastián del carno he was a commander
in the fleet of ferdinand majelin and he returned to spain with the remnants of the fleet in 1522
majelin's fleet traveled around south america around caporn then across the pacific to the
philippines and it was here in the philippines that its commander ferdinand majelin was killed on
the island of cebu in battle with a local chief called lapu lapu now after these voyages for the
first time in history the world is united this sudden expansion of world markets stimulated
commerce and capitalism very very significantly even carl marx regarded this as a fundamental
turning point in the history of capitalism and that's why he writes world trade and the world
market date from the 16th century and from then on the modern history of capital starts to unfold
a lot of things happen these exchanges were significant almost immediately in the 16th
century they took the form or at least one form of these exchanges was what the historian alfred
crossby has called the columbian exchange a massive exchange of goods and people and diseases
between the americas and the afro-eurasian zone here are some of the things that exchanged american
crops such as maize potatoes manioc and tomatoes were quite soon being grown in many parts of
eurasia including china europe and africa and here they soon stimulated population growth because
they could often be grown in regions that were unsuitable for local staples so the effect of
introducing these crops was to widen the area that could be farmed and to increase total output of
food and other produce between 1400 and 1700 the populations of china india and europe all doubled
increase in trades stimulated commerce and capitalism in most of the old hub regions of
eurasia the eastern mediterranean the the the muslim world northern india and in china
as china's population and economy expanded it began to suck in silver for coinage and the 16th
century chinese governments began to demand that taxes be paid in silver and this had a huge impact
on the world economy that incidentally is a measure of how huge the chinese economy was
and what a significant driver it was of world economic change but this also benefited european
middleman who extracted the silver by force from american minds where did the silver come from
well much of it came from a single place potosi in modern bolivia the city was created when it was
discovered when when uh spanish colonists discovered that the region region around potosi
included a virtual mountain of silver and they discovered this in 1545 within 30 years potosi
had a population of 120 000 and it was certainly one of the largest cities in the world by then
in 1650 its population may have been 160 000 but after that it began to decline with a decline in
silver output at its height potosi was a brutal and violent place and potosi illustrates very well
the brutal some of the brutal sides of of of what i've called the columbian exchange this was
not a peaceful process indians were forced to labor in the mines and died in huge numbers from
overwork exposure and brutal treatment particularly children but they also died from mercury poisoning
the silver ore extracted from potosi was crushed then it was mixed with mercury
after which workers were forced to tread it into a compound with mercury
the mixture of mercury and silver ore was then heated to drive off the mercury leaving pure
silver and deadly fumes as locals died in huge numbers they were often replaced with african
slaves this is not a pretty story increasing commercialization began to transform the lives
of peasants in many areas now here's just an illustration from china and i've gone back
to mark elvin's book the pattern of the chinese past for this this quotation and here's elvin's
account of of how chinese peasants were increasingly sucked into markets and let me remind you that
what's going on here is that people who had been peasants are slowly slowly being transformed
into wage earners and that's a process that will continue and is continuing today in the early 21st
century increased contact with the market he writes made the chinese peasantry into a class
of adaptable rational profit-oriented petty entrepreneurs a wide range of new occupations
opened up in the countryside in the hills timber was grown for the booming boat building industry
and for the construction of houses in the expanding cities vegetables and fruit were
produced for urban consumption all sorts of oils were pressed for cooking lighting waterproofing
and even to go in hair creams and medicines sugar was refined crystallized and used as a
preservative fish were raised in ponds and reservoirs to the point where the rearing of
newly hatched young fish for stock became a major business growing mulberry leaves for silk making
did become a major business now once again what i hope that what that passage does is
illustrate the huge number of different ways in which peasants could find themselves slowly
sucked into market activities and on the slippery slope of becoming eventually wage earners
the emergence of a single global network of exchanges began to transform the global
geography of wealth and power and this is one of the major changes of this period
for most of the agrarian era we've seen the atlantic region was marginal to world history
in afro-eurasia the major centers were in the eastern mediterranean north india and china in
the american zone they lay in mesoamerica and the andes suddenly europe now finds itself at the center
of the first global world system and this is largely because of the role that european
merchants and european mariners have played in weaving the four world zones together european
merchants not only pioneered the first trans oceanic exchange networks but they also managed to
maintain control of them for several centuries europe itself is becoming more distinctive in
this period it's an odd world a durable pattern emerges in europe very different from that in
china at the other end of eurasia not of large unified empires that encourage the patterns of
tribute taking of traditional tributary states but something really rather different in europe what
you get is a durable pattern of small or medium-sized states that seem to be engaged in constant
competition this world ought to remind you slightly of the world of the song dynasty that i described
in the last lectures european rulers are ruling medium states they don't have colossal resources
available if they try to survive merely by exacting tributes from peasants and yet they face constant
warfare a very very competitive international political situation so they have to seek commercial
sources of revenue and the result is that european rulers find themselves generally more supportive
of commerce than the great empires of the muslim world or china someone like venice or genoa is
an archetype of a mercantile state but many of the cities of europe are sort of somewhere between
the two we have rulers whose attitudes very much look like those of traditional tributary rulers
but in fact they are becoming increasingly dependent on commercial revenues and increasingly
supportive of commercial activity with supportive governments and a central position in global
commercial networks european societies become increasingly capitalistic and their governments
become increasingly supportive of entrepreneurial activity above all on the international stage
of which europe now finds itself at the center in britain the slow transformations of society
that go on as a result of this increase increasing commercial pressure are evident from the remarkable
statistics assembled by greggory king who lived in the late 17th century his dates are 1648 to 1712
greggory king king is a fascinating figure and he's one of the pioneers of modern statistical
studies we're surrounded by statistics today we often forget how recent this barrage of statistics
is and greggory king is one of the crucial figures he worked for many years in the college of arms
it still exists it was founded in in the middle ages and what it does is it keeps records of the
coats of arms of british families and it may have been this position that gave him access to a lot
of important government information at the end of the 17th century in 1696 king compiled a manuscript
called natural and political observations upon the state and condition of england in it he
estimated the population and wealth of england and wales he also offers statistics on demographic
facts such as the numbers of those in different classes the numbers of people of different ages
the percentage of those who are married and so on as an aside he also attempted to calculate the
amount of beer drunk each year king statistics are a wonderful treasure trove for modern uh
historians of 17th and 18th century britain and here are some of the things that come out of these
statistics according to king in 1688 43 percent of the british population consisted of and i quote
cottages and paupers or of laboring people and out servants it may not be immediately obvious why
this is so striking but what king is really saying here is that almost half of britain's population
had no land and had to survive entirely from wage labor cottages and paupers laboring people and
out servants these are not fully viable peasants who are supporting themselves from the land these
are people who might look like peasants but they're really at the margins and most of their
income has to come from wage labor of some kind now that's very striking if you remember our rule
of thumb that roughly speaking nine out of every ten people in agrarian civilizations were probably
peasants here we have a society in which 40 to 50 percent seem to be wage earners of some some type
in modern studies many of them using some of king's statistics suggests that in the late 17th
century more than half of british national income came from commercial activities of various kinds
by the early 18th century most of the revenues of the british government came from commercial
sources and this ensured that the british government would aggressively back commerce
and the importance of commerce was evident also from the many merchants in the british
parliament of the 18th century so here we have a society which in many ways still looked like a
traditional tributary society but if you start looking more closely at flows of wealth sources
of revenue and so on you find a society that is becoming increasingly commercialized increasingly
capitalistic so at least in some areas of the world we find capitalist social structures are
becoming more dominant commercial activity is spreading widely and in the world as a whole
we've seen global networks have stimulated exchange and commerce on a huge scale now
if indeed these drivers capitalism commerce expansion of state of exchange networks
are flourishing are more and more visible in this era shouldn't this be stimulating innovation
shouldn't there be there being a sharp acceleration in global rates of innovation
is there well here the evidence really is ambiguous there were significant improvements
in shipping in this period and in military technology this is after all the era of the
gunpowder revolution also in mining and in instrument building of various kinds and you
could list a number of other fields but in general global rates of innovation appear to have remained
fairly sluggish populations grew less because of significant innovations than because of other
changes such as for example the introduction of American crops or government backing for the
settlement of new lands from Siberia to South America in the early modern period there's a
mass of government activity designed to support migration to new areas the Russians are supporting
emigration to Siberia the Chinese are supporting emigration to underpopulated regions of China
the Europeans are supporting emigration to the Americas
it may seem that the European scientific revolution is an exception
so we need to consider this the European scientific revolution itself may well have
been a product in part of the torrent of new information that flowed through European societies
as Europe found itself at the center of the first global network of information
after all think of the implications of this suddenly Europe finds itself a sort of clearing
house for information from around the world no society in previous human history has actually
had access to information from around the world information about new cultures different technologies
different religious beliefs different types of people different types of societies and this
is what's happening in Europe in the 16th and 17th century suddenly this is torrent of new information
much of it completely unexpected it's almost as if new planets had been discovered
what's the impact of this bound to be well the main impact seems to have been
to encourage European thinkers philosophers natural scientists even theologians to start
questioning authority so many of the things that traditional knowledge had said about the world
have turned out to be wrong that increasingly European natural philosophers find themselves
saying well where's the evidence and this is what bacon says loud and clear where's the evidence
so this is the start of what we've seen throughout this course this commitment to knowledge based
not on authority but evidence so this is an immensely important transformation yet the
crucial thing is that as yet and probably not until the 19th century science had very little
impact on technological innovation only the 19th century for the first time you start getting
factories for example setting up labs to research innovation so for a surprisingly long period
science had a rather limited impact on technological innovation now let's look at the smaller the
other world zones outside afro-eurasia what was the impact of this global unification on them
and the short answer is it was catastrophic we've seen that there are ways in which the
afro-eurasian zone flourished as a result of this unification of the world in other regions the
results were catastrophic why globalization exposed the other world zones to colonization
and to brutal exploitation by european invaders we've already had a look at the silver mines of
potosy in modern bolivia as an example of this sort of exploitation all of this designed to
ensure flows of silver that eventually reach china and profit europeans but there's another
crucial factor here and that is disease this is a pattern we've seen before in the era of agrarian
civilizations as exchange networks expand disease vectors also start moving into new
regions and if diseases move into regions where there's no immunity the results can be catastrophic
and this is what happened in the 16th century as a result of the coming together of the world zones
europeans brought with them to the americas and eventually to the australian zone and the pacific
diseases for which indigenous populations had no immunity at all smallpox was perhaps the most
lethal of all of these and smallpox appears in central america within 15 20 years of the arrival
of columbus why was this coming together so catastrophic in disease terms well we've seen
already in afro-eurasia there were several reasons why immune systems over afro-eurasia
should have become increasingly hardened the widespread use of domesticated animals allowed
diseases to cross species creating a rich palette of diseases furthermore we've seen trans-european
eurasian exchange networks created multiple immunities and the major population zones of
afro-eurasia so by 1500 afro-eurasia as a whole particularly its cities are a zone of in which
which people have immunities to a wide range of diseases the other world zones had smaller
populations few or no domesticated animals and much smaller exchange networks and the result was
a less rich disease environment and much more limited immunities so when afro-eurasian diseases
such as smallpox are introduced the results are catastrophic and what they do is they mimic the
impact of eurasian plagues but sometimes on a far larger scale in the more densely settled regions of
mesoamerica and peru it's been estimated that populations may have fallen from 50 to 70 percent
this is a highly controversial area but what there's no doubt about is that the population
decline is very severe in the course of the 16th century for indigenous americans this was an
apocalyptic calamity here just to illustrate this is is is an account of what happened and what this
meant written by from sources in the yucatan peninsula just one description of what this
may have meant to indigenous americans in the yucatan in the maya area before the europeans
arrive says this account there was then no sickness they had no aching bones they had
then no high fever they had then no smallpox they had then no burning chest they had then no
abdominal pain they had then no consumption they had then no headache at that time the course of
humanity was orderly the foreigners made it otherwise when they arrived here and that cited
from alfred crossbees book on the columbian exchange here's another description of what
happened and it's from the other side of this disease holocaust written by thomas harriott who
was the surveyor from the english colony on roan oak island within a few days he wrote within a few
days after our departure from every such town people began to die very fast and many in short
space in some towns about 20s in some 40 and some 60 and in one sixth score which in truth was very
many in respect of their numbers the diseases also was so strange that they neither knew what it was
nor how to cure it the like by report of the oldest men in the country never happened before
time out of mind okay now can we summarize how much had the world changed by 1700 there's no
doubt that globalization had stimulated commerce and capitalism particularly in the aphrioration
zone but also in many areas of the americas and eventually would do so in the other world zones
of australia and the pacific the process has been particularly destructive of course in the americas
so our drivers of growth are clearly flourishing in this era yet in much of the world states were
still dominated by traditional tribute-taking elites with traditional aristocratic values and that
means attitudes that were fundamentally anti-commerce opposed to the development of
capitalistic activities peasants though increasingly enmeshed in market exchanges
remained the vast majority of the population in most countries so these traditional social
structures which still dominate much of the world may explain why on a global scale innovation
remained sluggish we certainly don't yet see the spectacular rates of innovation characteristic
modernity so in the early modern malthusian cycle though there are some areas such as parts of
europe where changes are beginning to look very decisive indeed and though we've seen the downturn
was nothing like a severe as in the medieval cycle nevertheless the basic structures of the
agrarian era remained in place and that may explain why rates of innovation remained low
so when did the breakthrough to modernity finally occur thank you
lecture 41 breakthrough the industrial revolution
if we look down on the world from our imaginary spacetime capsule in 1700
and then we move forward rapidly 100 years then 200 years we'll start to see a lot of
lights turning on this is the beginning of the modern revolution we saw in the last lecture that
by 1700 many of the elements of modernity seemed to be in place we saw that there were areas in
which a capitalist social structures were well developed we saw that commerce was widely developed
in many parts of the world and flourishing in many parts of the world and we also see that saw
that the world was now globally integrated in a way it never was before yet despite all of this
we saw that global rates of innovation didn't yet seem particularly spectacular and i remind you
what we're looking for when you're looking for the breakthrough to modernity is precisely
a breakthrough in rates of innovation so when do the crucial breakthroughs occur
and how in this lecture i want to describe the breakthrough to modernity after 1700
and for a lot of this lecture i'm going to focus on one country Britain where the transformation
has been studied most intensively now to understand these changes we're going to need statistics
one of the wonderful things about the modern world is that suddenly we have a massive statistics
we've seen that in dealing with early eras of human history we're generally scrambling around for the
the least crumb of data now suddenly we're drowning in data and particularly we have a huge amount
of statistical data most of that data refers only to the last century or two but some scholars
have attempted the difficult task of trying to reconstruct statistical series on matters such as
production population productivity that extend back several centuries this is a tricky and
delicate business but i'll be relying on some of these estimates in what follows we do need to
remember how much guesswork is involved in these reconstructions indeed we need to remember that
the very idea of gross domestic product which is one of the concepts that they project back into
the past is in its modern sense a 20th century concept but the good news is that these reconstructions
are so rough and ready that they encourage us to look at the very large picture they convey
that is more likely to convey a realistic impression than the details of the figures they
reconstruct so we shouldn't get too caught up in the details which are much more likely to mislead us
now those of you with statistical phobia can contemplate the idea that a table of statistics
or a set of figures if studied carefully can provide a beautiful snapshot of large economic
changes and that's why economic historians in particular love them the trick is to spend time
with them if you do then what they can do is to provide a pretty good alternative to the
imaginary time space machine that we've used in recent lectures so here are some figures the
first set of figures shows increasing output it attempts to recalculate the idea of gross domestic
product over several centuries the first set of figures estimates total global production
from 1500 to 1998 a gross domestic product which is that the term they use is an estimate of the
value of total output of goods and services so what do these estimates suggest well first
the first thing they show is an astonishing increase in total production between 1500 and 2000
global production on these estimates multiplied by something like 135 times in 500 years
now the second thing we see from these figures is that the increases become really evident in
the 19th century this is an accelerating trend and they become most striking in the 20th century
in the four centuries up to 1913 production had increased by about 11 times in the next
century alone up to 1998 it would increase another 12 times so this is an accelerating trend it's
getting faster and faster so that's the first thing we see massive increase in total production
of goods and services and once again even if these figures are very very rough estimates
estimates they seem to be telling us something very important now here's a second set of figures
and they're on population these suggest that increasing production the increasing production
of energy and of resources and foodstuffs and textiles and so on allowed populations to multiply
by almost 14 times in the same period that's over 500 years now once again if we look more
closely at these figures they're clearly an accelerating trend population growth accelerated
from the late 18th century but much faster in the 19th and particularly in the 20th century
and here's just one figure that captures that in the four centuries up to 1913 global populations
increased a bit more than four times that's in 400 years in the next 100 years to 1998
they would increase by another three times so once again we have an accelerating trend
now you may have noticed that there is something very striking about comparing
these two sets of figures and this is the fact that production rose much faster than populations
remember total production has risen by 130 times in 500 years on these figures
and population by 14 times so what this means is that more goods and services are being produced
at the end of this period per person despite extraordinary rates of population growth
this trend is demonstrated by a third set of figures on per capita production
production per person that is to say total production divided by population production per
person multiplied by about 10 times between 1500 and 1998 and once more this is an accelerating
trend in the four centuries up to 1913 production per person increased a little more than 2.5 times
in the next century alone it increased by almost four times
here in this figure for increasing productivity and in the comparison between the two earlier
sets of figures is the first indicator that one of the results of the modern revolution
may be that production effectively for the first time in human history begins to match
or even outstrip population growth now remember the lag of production behind population growth
was the key to the Malthusian cycles that were the dominant pattern of rise and fall
in the later agrarian era so far in the modern era and I have to say I'm touching wood at this
point but so far in the modern era the world has avoided a global Malthusian crisis that is to say
a global crisis caused by not producing enough stuff now I want to move on to a second data set
and this is a series of figures that illustrates how these changes transformed the global geography
of wealth and power and how as a result of these changes new power centers emerged and old power
centers some of which had been significant centers of power for several thousand years
began to decline and to decline very rapidly here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take
figures for production by Britain and the USA two of the major powers of the new Atlantic hub zone
and compare them with figures for the combined production of India and China so we have two groups
one is Britain and the USA the other is India and China and each case the figures I'm going to give
give you how much of global GNP is produced by each of those blocks now India and China remember
were the ancient economic heartlands of the pre-modern world Britain and the USA will be
the heartlands of the emerging Atlantic world the new hub zone of the modern era
okay here are some figures let's go back to 1750 in 1750 India and China accounted for
almost 60 percent of global production now again I have to remind you how rough these figures are
it's the orders of magnitude that concern us here Adam Smith incidentally who wrote the
wealth of nations in 1776 understood this very very well he said China is a much richer country
than any part of Europe at the same time in 1750 Britain and the British Atlantic colonies
accounted for just two percent of global production it's a tiny share of global production
now let's move forward 80 years in 1830 India and China the old hub region still accounted for
just under 50 percent of global production as late as 1830 at the same date the US and Britain
accounted for about 13 percent now if these figures are giving the right impression they suggest two
things first the Atlantic region still even in 1830 lagged some way behind the old producing zones
but it also suggests something else they are catching up very rapidly indeed and now the
relationship will change very rapidly in the middle of the 19th century by 1860 these two regions
the new Atlantic region and the old hub zone of China and India are neck and neck each producing
about 28 percent of global GDP then at that point India and China start to fall back fall
behind very rapidly by 1900 the USA and UK are producing about 42 percent of global output and
India and China are producing merely 8 percent and by 1950 the USA and UK are producing about 53 percent
more than half and India and China are mere 4 percent of course by 1950 most of that figure of
production for the Atlantic is now coming from the USA of course I need to add that that's not by
any means the end of the story after 1950 the tide will begin to turn again and by the middle of the
21st century India and China will almost certainly have re-established themselves as major economic
powers but that's a story for the future okay that's that's a sort of statistical picture of some
of the very large changes that we see between 1700 and 1900 now I want to focus on one particular
area so we can look at the moment of breakthrough more carefully and that area is Britain
this is where we can see the breakthrough to modernity most clearly so just as we concentrated on
Mesopotamia when discussing the appearance of agriculture and again when we discuss the appearance
of the first tribute taking states so now we're going to focus on Britain many historians have
argued that Britain was the first country to experience the sustained growth rates that are
typical of the modern revolution Patrick O'Brien for example writes and I quote between 1750
and 1850 the long-term rate of growth of the British economy became historically unique
and internationally remarkable now I should add that eventually other economies would
exceed these rates of growth but in the middle of the 19th century no other country throughout
human history had matched these rates of growth notice to understand how what form the breakthrough
took it may help to think of three related revolutions which in combination transformed
Britain in the 18th and early 19th centuries the first of these revolutions was the revolution in
social structure and what it did was to create a society that was more highly commercialized
and in the language we've used earlier more capitalistic entrepreneurs played a more important
role wage earning played a more important role in that society so that's the first change a change
in social structure the second was a revolutionary transformation of British agriculture and agriculture
let me remind you is the largest sector of the economy of all agrarian era economies so here
we're talking about a transformation of the largest most fundamental sector of the British economy
in the 17th and 18th centuries and the third change we'll look at is a transformation in
industrial production so let's begin with changes in social structure we've seen that by 1700
Britain was by many measures one of the most capitalistic societies on earth about half
of its population according to the figures of Gregory King were dependent mainly on wages
so instead of being a society where most of the population were small farmers small peasants
here we have a society in which at least half of the population is dependent on wages and we've
seen that its elite groups too are very highly dependent on commerce of various kinds it was
also one of the best connected regions in the world being at the center of global exchange networks
and it was in control of a modest but rapidly growing overseas empire
and it had a government that valued these assets and supported commerce
now the model I proposed in an earlier lecture suggested in such an environment with a capitalistic
social structure flourishing commerce contacts with the global world system and supportive
governments innovation ought to have accelerated and it ought to have accelerated as entrepreneurs
began to compete to raise output as markets expanded with increasing numbers of wage earners
who had to purchase their food clothing and other needs with cash now does this work does this sort
of social structure really generate innovation well in in Britain in the 18th century it certainly
does let's begin with the transformation of the agricultural sector so that's the change in social
structure that we've seen already now how does it affect agriculture agriculture was the fundamentally
economic sector in all agrarian societies productivity first began to rise in this sector
from the 17th century now we've seen that by 1700 many English peasants had become in effect wage
earners that change itself had momentous implications for economic development as this rapidly growing
class of impoverished peasants competed for employment what they provided was a large supply
of cheap labor so as Britain's peasantry is slowly destroyed what what employers get
is an increasing amount of cheap labor secondly this growing class of wage earners
who from their own perspective might have thought of themselves as failed peasants
from an employer's perspective or an entrepreneur's perspective provide a rapidly growing market
for basic consumer goods such as food and textiles traditional peasants remember are growing
food for themselves they are sometimes even making their own textiles they're not so dependent on
the market but wage earners have to buy most of what they use on the market so here's a rapidly
growing market for basic consumer goods now something also happens to the nature of land
ownership increasingly the land vacated by peasants was taken over by large landowners
who farmed it for profit in Britain this transfer of land from small pockets of peasant farming
to much larger areas farmed more commercially was dominated by the idea of enclosures from
actually from as early as the 16th century acts of parliament in area after area town by town
would allow local landlords to buy up consolidated plots of land and annul traditional rights of
use on that land so what they allowed was the emergence of full private property over large
consolidated blocks of land and landowners took over traditional plots of land that once
had been divided into small peasant plots increasingly rapidly in the 18th century
during the enclosure movement they frequently planted hedges around these newly consolidated
blocks of land to mark them out clearly and that created much of the distinctive English
landscape we see today meanwhile on these large blocks of land they're now free to introduce
new techniques that could benefit from economies of scale that were unavailable to small peasant
farmers if you think about it agriculture or farming on large blocks of land is almost bound
to be a very different thing from farming on small blocks of land as in the traditional peasant way
this marks a crucial difference between two very different types of agriculture
if you farm a small plot as a peasant a lot of your farming is for subsistence and that means
you need to grow a variety of variety of plots and you have a small area of land it's hard to
introduce more advanced techniques if you grow on a large plot of land you're clearly not growing
for subsistence and this means you can grow you can focus on particular crops you can introduce
modern techniques and you can benefit from economies of scale if you're growing on large
plots of land almost inevitably you are a commercial farmer you're growing for profit
not for subsistence so this change in land ownership marks a fundamental transformation
in agriculture it marks the commercialization of agriculture and the appearance of an agriculture
dominated by the profit motive an entrepreneurial agriculture the process has been studied extremely
well in British economic history and here's just one illustration an English historian W. G.
Hoskins studied what the process meant in one village when Wigston Magna in Leicestershire
and he found in the 18th century an absolute transformation in the life of peasants
peasants whose forefathers had rarely needed to handle cash they really weren't involved in the
cash economy suddenly become wage earners they have to think about cash they have to count every
cent they have to think very hard about the value of their labor and he writes for Wigston Magna
the enclosure act of 1765 was a cataclysm small owner occupiers disappeared as a group within
about 60 years and they became instead rural laborers working for other people or framework knitters
are weaving in their own homes or paupers people right at the edges of society
now let's look at the farmers who took over the land farming for profit meant competing
with other producers and that meant increasing efficiency here's the mechanism Adam Smith saw
the drive of competitive markets increasing efficiency meant that English farmers began
to improve their farming usually with techniques that had known for many sent been known for many
centuries there's nothing much that's new about the actual techniques that were introduced
rather as in the early the early the agrarian revolution 10 000 years ago where the techniques
weren't new what was new was the way they were introduced on the scale on which they were introduced
and implemented so now there are increasing incentives for large farmers commercial farmers
to apply them on a large scale and farmers beginning begin raising soil fertility by
planting legumes for example rather than just by leaving land fellow this means you can keep
land in continuous cultivation much longer without destroying its fertility they improved
irrigation they bred better quality animals incidentally improvements in animal breeding
are part of the background to the growing interest in evolution of figures such as Darwin's grandfather
Erasmus Darwin they also used improved methods of planting and preparing the land one of the most
famous of the improvers Lord Townsend advocated the planting of turnips for which he became known
as turnip Townsend now the results of all of this was striking between 1700 and 1850
British agricultural output increased about three and a half times yet at the same time
the numbers employed in agriculture fell from about 61 percent to 29 percent of the population
now here's an entirely new phenomenon in human history for the first time in human history you
have a medium-sized country in which a minority of the population is feeding a majority now those
are the transformations in the agricultural sector now let's look at industry expanding internal
and foreign markets internal markets expanded remember as peasants more and more peasants
became wage earners and consumers and external markets expanded with the growth of empire and
international trade as well as a supportive government most of whose revenues now came
from commercial sources and a stable financial system which made cheap capital available remember
the Bank of England had been incorporated in 1694 all of these features encouraged investment
in manufacturing as well as in agriculture so they drew investment into manufacturing
in most agrarian societies textile production was by far the largest economic sector after
agriculture innovations in cotton spinning in this period reduced the time taken to spin 100
pounds of cotton from 50 000 hours to 300 hours in the late 18th century and stimulated the mechanization
of weaving and remember this is stimulated partly by the fact that the market for textiles is growing
very rapidly another crucial area of innovation which will turn out to be absolutely critical later
is coal a shortage of wood in britain encouraged greater use of coal that meant improving the
technologies used to pump water out of coal mines so that you could mine deeper and that meant pumps
a french inventor Dennis Papin had first demonstrated the potential of steam engines as
early as 1691 his engine used steam pressure to raise a cylinder after which the source of heat
was removed allowing atmospheric pressure to push the cylinder down again tomas nukeman introduced
an improved version in 1712 what this one did was spray cold water into the cylinder at the top of
the cycle to initiate the down stroke now in both these machines most of the thrust came from
atmospheric pressure the cylinders were then attached to a beam that worked a pump one of the
problems was that the rapid heating and cooling of the cylinder was extremely inefficient and
required lots of fuel so these pumps were only cost effective in mines close to abundant coal and
that's why their use didn't spread widely into other sectors of industry then in the 1760s james
what improved the efficiency of the steam engines that were traditionally used to pump out mines
what did he do what did two main things first he separated the condenser so that the cylinder
could remain permanently at high temperature and secondly more precise engineering of the cylinder
allowed him to use the force of expanding steam to drive the engine rather than simply the force
of atmospheric pressure now these changes greatly increase the efficiency and fuel economy of the
machine and they help explain its rapid adoption in different sectors of industry improved steam
engines made it economical for the first time to use coal to drive machines well away from the
coal fields and this encouraged the creation of large factories driven by steam power the next
transformative use of steam power was to put it on wheels early in the 19th century and what this
would do is to revolutionize land transportation and slash transportation costs the first steam
engine began operation on september the 27th 1825 in the county of durham and the first designed
for passengers as well as freight was the rocket designed by george stevensson we have a wonderful
description of it by the actress fanny kembal who described traveling on one of the first railways
in 1830 with george stevensson who incidentally had acquired his engineering skills operating
newcomen steam engines at a colliery in newcastle and here's fanny kembal's wonderful description
she she prides herself in not understanding the technology that's involved so it's a delightful
description we were introduced to the little engine which was to drag us along the rails she said
she for they make these curious little firehorses all mares consisted of a boiler a stove a small
platform a bench and behind the bench a barrel containing enough water to prevent her being
thirsty for 15 miles and the whole machine was not bigger than a common fire engine she goes
upon wheels which are her feet and are moved by bright steel legs called pistons these are propelled
by steam and in proportion as more steam is applied to the upper extremities the hip joints i suppose
of these pistons the faster they move the wheels the coals which are its oats were under the bench
and there was a small glass tube affixed to the boiler with water in it which indicates by its
fullness or emptiness when the creature wants water which is immediately conveyed to it from its
reservoirs and then what she does is she describes the journey and this gives a wonderful sense of
how new the experience was a bit like one of us being invited to fly in the space shuttle i suspect
the snorting little animal she writes which i felt rather inclined to pat was then harnessed to our
carriage and mr stevensson having taken me on the bench of the engine with him we started at about
10 miles an hour later the engine having received its supply of water the carriage was placed behind
it for it cannot turn and was set off at its utmost speed which was 35 miles an hour swifter
than a bird flies she says for they tried the experiment with a snipe i think this conveys
very well how utterly new this phenomenon was by the early 19th century innovation was raising
productivity in many sectors of manufacturing including textiles coal and metals building
and consumer goods between 1770 and 1830 the value of cotton production rose over 40 times that of
coal almost nine times that of iron about five times and that of the building industry by more
than 11 times now the english industrial revolution provides a very good illustration of the model
of innovation proposed in lecture 31 it suggests that once societies emerged that were highly
commercialized capitalistic in their social structures and well connected to global markets
new incentives would begin to stimulate an acceleration in innovation and that we've
seen as the key to the modern revolution but the innovations themselves mattered above all
the discovery of a massive new energy source fossil fuels the steam engine followed by technologies
that exploited oil and natural gas allowed humans to tap into the vast reserves of fossilized energy
that had been laying down in the previous several hundred million years this is what we mean by the
fossil fuels revolution it was a wholly unprecedented energy bonanza for our species before the steam
engine the most powerful prime mover available was probably a windmill which could deliver about nine
horsepower what steam engine delivered 134 horsepower which was a very very significant increase
and just the beginning a modern bowing 747 for example can deliver about 80 000 so by the early
19th century the changes were so striking in britain that some contemporaries began to notice
them and in 1837 the french revolutionary blankey described the changes in britain as
an industrial revolution now the question is how far and how fast would the british industrial
revolution spread elsewhere thank you
lecture 42 spread of the industrial revolution to 1900
do you remember the near industrial revolution of song china in the 11th and 12th century c e
we saw how in an environment that was suddenly more commercialized more competitive than in the past
innovation suddenly increased and a huge amount of innovation occurred in agriculture in industry
in economic organization and so on but then what happened was that it all fell away again
from the end of the 13th in the 14th centuries what made the modern revolution so different
is that instead of dying away like this the process of innovation continued and spread around the
entire world and it's still continuing today more than two centuries later now why the difference
between the outcomes of these two periods of very rapid almost explosive growth partly the
difference is that the world of the 19th century was so much more integrated and interconnected
than the world of the 12th century remember the world of the 12th century the world of song china
was still a world divided into four main world zones and even connections between the different
parts of eurasia between say china and the Mediterranean were slow it took several centuries
for chinese innovations to diffuse through eurasia now we look at this later industrial
revolution how rapidly did the changes we have observed during the british industrial revolution
spread to other parts of the world and how great was their impact well the short answer is that
within just two centuries industrialization had transformed the entire world for better or worse
no earlier transformation in human history had ever been so rapid or so far reaching just remember
in the paleolithic era the first era of human history it took humans almost 200 000 years
to spread around the entire world so what i what i want to do in this lecture is to describe the
impact of industrialization up to about 1900 to get a clear overview of these changes it might
help to think of four main waves of change before 1900 the real processes of course were much more
intricate much more complicated but this idea of four main waves provides a very helpful
broad sketch of the main changes so we'll we'll we'll survey in each of these waves
the region it affected the period it occurred and the distinctive technologies associated
with that wave so let's begin with the first of these four waves wave one
the first wave begins in the late 18th century and we described some aspects of it in the previous
lecture it mainly affected britain it also touched the western edge of europe and in some
senses touched even the eastern seaboard of the united states new technologies in this wave included
a much more productive agrarian sector improved steam engines steam engines that were now
efficient enough to be taken up widely in other other industries and therefore allowed humans
to tap into the immense reserves of energy stored in fossil fuels the mechanization of cotton textile
production and increased production of coal and iron we saw also that changes occurred in a large
number of other sectors as well but these are the main sectors the ones where the changes are most
striking the cotton gin incidentally cotton gin or engine was a particularly important american
contribution to this phase invented by elie whitney in 1793 it was a mechanical device for separating
cotton seeds from cotton fibers now here in this case we can measure the resulting increase in
productivity very easily it now took one person to do what had previously taken 50 people working by
hand unfortunately as with many of these innovations the initial impact of this was simply to increase
the scale of sweated labor or in the case of the states of slavery now wave two wave two took
place in the early 19th century innovation accelerated in many parts of western europe
including belgium france and germany and also along the eastern seaboard of the newly independent
united states technological changes in the second wave included the increased use of
steam engines in manufacturing and the spread of railways and steamships railways spread rapidly
in europe and in the usa the first commercial steamship was a paddle ship designed by robert
falton which traveled between new york and albany beginning in 1807 it used a watt steam engine
the first ocean going steamship was called the great western it was designed by the great
british designer isambard kingdom brunel and it was launched in 1837 it crossed to new york the next
year in 1843 he launched another steamship known as the great britain this was the first large iron
ship in the world and the first to use a screw propeller it's made in voyage to new york took
14 days it had a it had an interesting subsequent history it ended its days as a coal bunker on
the foreland islands but then in 1970 it was finally refloated towed to england and it's now
been renovated as a museum that we see in in bristol steam transportation was immensely important
it speeded up commercial exchanges and it cut transportation costs which stimulated commerce
and manufacturing now this was particularly true in very large countries such as the usa or canada
where cheaper land transport had a revolutionary impact on commerce in general by 1917 there were
about one million miles of railways throughout the world and about one third of them were in north
america now why was the railway so revolutionary well here's one way of looking at it throughout
the agrarian era transportation by land had been slower and more expensive than transportation by sea
that explains incidentally why regions such as the mediterranean where a lot of exchanges
could take place by sea or those connected by great river systems such as egypt and mesopotamia
flourished economically it's at least one of the important factors in their economic growth
with the railway for the first time in human history transportation by land became as cheap
and as rapid as transportation by sea and this provided a massive stimulus for economic development
particularly in regions such as north america where most transportation had to be by land
so that's the second wave and it's dominated by railways the third wave we can assign
roughly speaking to the middle of the 19th century it dominates the middle decades of the 19th century
industrialization accelerates within europe particularly within germany and germany
since the 20s has been united economically within a common custom zone that solverine
and by 1871 it would also be united politically change is also rapid in the eastern usa
technological innovations in this period include the industrial production of chemicals such as
dyes and artificial fertilizers which revolutionized agriculture fertilizers would be immensely
important in supporting in supplying food to the rapidly growing populations of the modern era
and the ability to produce artificial fertilizers greatly cheapened the use of fertilizers
steel making was made more effective with the introduction of the besamer process
and this is the era also in which the industrial use of electricity began
domestic lighting began to revolutionize patterns of work and leisure by lighting up the night
all previous forms of lighting had severe limitations electricity could provide a
sort of brightness that had no parallel elsewhere and and for some purposes obliterate the distinction
between day and night so the humble light bulb transformed life and transformed urban life in
particular its inventor was of course thomas eddison eddison eddison is remarkable he took
out patents on more than a thousand inventions and these included the light bulb and also the
phonograph and the first motion picture camera warfare was revolutionized in this period railways
made it possible to transport large numbers of troops and equipment and material and new and
more powerful weapons such as machine guns began to greatly increase the killing power of those who
are armed with them so the american civil war is widely regarded as the first major war of the
industrial era the telegraph and telephone revolutionized communications but today it's
all too easy to take for granted this revolution in communications but we need to remind ourselves
what a strange phenomenon it was the idea of instantaneous communication over huge distances
transformed the possibilities for what we have called in this course collective learning
the first forms the telegraph and early telephones transmitted messages along electric cables
the electrical telegraph was invented in britain in 1837 and the morse code
at the same time in the states within just 25 years most of the world was linked by telegraph
communication the telephone was invented in 1876 by alexander bell but its reach would soon be
extended by improvements introduced by the ubiquitous thomas eddison who in 1878 made a call
from new york to philadelphia but it was possible to communicate even without cables and this was
a possibility explored by an italian julielmo marconi by 1895 he had found he could send a
message over a few kilometers without wires and on december the 12th 1901 he sent the first
wireless transmission across the atlantic now while we're on the subject of modern communications
here's an anecdote about the wonder of instantaneous broadcasting around the world chronologically it
belongs strictly to a later period but i i can't resist a cricket story and i promise it's the only
one in this course international cricket matches are called test matches and they began to be
broadcast live in the 1920s now you have to understand that broadcasting cricket was a
challenge because a test match can last five days and for much of that period particularly
if there's bad weather not much is happening in the 1940s test matches began to be broadcast around
the world and australian commentators began to commentate on test matches proceeding going on
on on in britain and what they what they did was they used to receive streams of cables from britain
detailing what what happened each ball they would sit in their studios and they would tell the
stories if they were watching the match themselves complete with vivid sometimes largely imaginary
details about the scene and they'd also use special sound effects such as tapping the microphone to
simulate the stand sound of a bat hitting a ball the australian audiences i'm told were spellbound
now that little story i hope just is a reminder of how recent these changes are and how remarkable
they are now let's move on to the fourth wave the late 19th century strictly we should probably
say the late 19th century and early 20th century the fourth wave dominated that period and in this
period industrialization we can say spreads for example it spreads to russia and japan and it
spreads west within the united states and canada in russia railway building particularly the building
of the trans-siberian railroad which was completed in 1904 and ran from mosco to the pacific coast
stimulated iron production and manufacturing and it made it possible to export grain more cheaply
and also stimulated internal trade now this is an example of one of the early phases of state
driven industrialization the initiative came largely from the state so did much of the
initial financing this is the age when a second fossil fuel oil begins to be used the oil age
launched a second phase of the fossil fuels revolution with the invention of the internal
combustion engine in the late 19th century the Wright brothers showed how you could use
an engine to drive a heavier than air plane in 1903 this is again an idea that we take for granted
but we need to remind ourselves how remarkable it is the idea that humans might one day routinely
fly around the world would have seen the purest fantasy just a few centuries earlier today if you
go to kitty hawk you can see a modern replica of their plane which can in fact fly it's a beautiful
machine i've seen it myself in 1913 henry ford produced the first model t ford which pioneered
mass production for a new mass consumer market making the internal combustion engine and the car
not just elite products but products aimed at a much much larger market almost like textiles
now i've described the four main phases the next thing i want to do is describe how these changes
which i've described mainly in economic terms began to affect other sectors of life and the first
area i want to look at is government how did these changes affect government now the short
answer is that they were transformative we use the same word government for modern governments
and those of the agrarian era but but frankly these are utterly different beasts economic changes
and rising productivity transformed the power and the very nature of government in the state during
this era governments acquired new forms of power but they also found that they faced new and much
more complex challenges than had been faced by the relatively much simpler tribute taking states of
the of the later agrarian era war was a major driver of change with increasing production
states from the 18th and early 19th centuries found that they had to become much more effective
at mobilizing national resources both of manpower and materials in fact increasingly success in war
meant success in mobilizing all the resources of your economy the armies of revolutionary
france pioneered in the challenge of raising large citizen armies using the appeal of nationalism
and nationalism was to become immensely important in the modern era it was a way of creating what
the sociologist benedict and anderson called an imagined community to which all citizens of a
particular state were encouraged to think of themselves as belonging so that they would commit
themselves to the support of that community and if necessary die for it but nationalism wouldn't work
if states treated their citizens in the fundamentally exploitative way which was characteristic of most
tribute taking governments if you want your citizens to actually support you as a government as a
state you have to give them a greater sense of ownership of society and this was a change that
was achieved in part through the introduction of more democratic methods of rule of which perhaps
the most important is the use of elections industrializing governments in general found that
to mobilize support from below from a population that was now very different from the peasant
populations of the later agrarian era it was more mobile it was more urbanized it was generally
better educated and it was not self-sufficient in order to gain support from these populations
they had to provide new services and these services included policing and you see the
introduction of the first modern police systems in france during the french revolution it involved
the provision of more health services and also of mass education these were services that
hardly any agrarian era states had had seriously thought of providing there's another feature
of this the power of modern governments depended increasingly on economic growth so they became
increasingly economic managers rather than just takers of wealth to survive they had to spend a
lot of effort and a lot of time worrying about how to stimulate growth how to create
environments in which commerce could flourish how to create legal systems that protected
entrepreneurship how to create banking systems that created stable financial systems now this alone
this change alone the fact that governments became managers rather than simply coerces and
tribute takers was revolutionary remember prince vladimir of Kiev who saw military power as the
key to acquiring wealth he saw coercion as the key to getting wealth in the modern era essentially
the roles have been reversed increasingly for modern states the fundamental rule is wealth
gives you power a wealthy highly productive economy is the key to military power so success
for a state in the modern era means building economic growth there's another way in which
the role of government was bound to increase in societies in which most people were wage earners
and this is because wage earners unlike independent peasants who are largely self-sufficient
depend on the provision of basic services such as markets
to survive as a wage earner you have to find employment there have to be markets on which
you can buy goods and produce there have to be legal systems that protect the conditions of
employment and so on and inevitably what this meant was that governments became more involved
in the day-to-day life of most of their citizens twitter very crudely whereas in the late agrarian
era 80 to 90 percent of the population could be left most of the time just to get on with it peasants
didn't need the state to interfere in the modern era most of the population needs the services
that states provide so states had to protect property they had to maintain law law and order
they had to ensure stable currencies to do that they needed increasing information about their
populations about the health the education and the incomes of the populations they ruled
so to summarize some of these political changes the rules of political success have changed in
the modern era larger more mobile and better educated societies had to be managed rather
than simply coerced in the Atlantic hub zone the beginnings of these changes were already evident
in the political revolutions of the late 18th and early 19th centuries this is the era described
famously by the American historian R. R. Palmer as the age of the democratic revolution and here
is Charles Tilley's pithy summary of the changes that created the modern state here's how he puts it
over the last thousand years european states but a lot of what he says applies to modern
states in general have undergone a peculiar evolution from wasps to locomotives long they
concentrated on war leaving most activities to other organizations just so long as those
organizations yielded tribute at appropriate intervals tribute taking states remained fierce
but light in weight by comparison with their bulky successes they stung but they didn't suck dry
as time went on states even the capital intensive varieties took on activities powers and commitments
whose very support constrained them these locomotives ran on the rails of sustenance
from the civilian population and maintenance by civilian staff off the rails the warlike
engines could not run at all in short modern states have to be in some sense democratic
they have to work with their populations because of the extreme complexity of the societies they
they rule industrialization is also on the other hand magnified the coercive power of
states so here's a paradox on the one hand modern states have to be more democratic they have to
work more closely with their citizens they have to gain support from below on the other hand they
can also coerce more effectively they have more ability to support what we called earlier power
from above and this is largely because modern modern industry has magnified the military power of
states it's enabled them to transport soldiers and weapons weapons larger distances and it's
increased the destructiveness of weaponry this increased military power was apparent in the
astonishing speed with which in the late 19th century governments from the new atlantic hub
region conquered much of africa asia and the americas now i'd like to talk briefly about
changes in another area of life cultural life and life ways the changes we've looked at we've
looked primarily their economic aspects and now the political aspects but they also transformed
cultural life and popular life ways and here are some of the transport transformations
everywhere peasants slowly turned into wage earners as they were squeezed off the land
by increasingly efficient commercial farmers now we have to remind ourselves that this too is a
fundamental change in the life ways of a majority of people on earth as wage earners seeking employment
needed education more than peasants governments began to introduce systems of mass education
for the first time education which had been largely a matter for upper classes as a peasant you
you learn on the job as it were now became a matter that states began to take seriously
and began to extend the population as a whole so mass education began to spread at least in part
because most wage earning employment required at least a minimum of literacy
the earliest modern national educational systems were established early in the 19th century
in the polionic france and germany so from a world in which only a tiny elite were educated
we moved to a world in which the vast majority of the population has at least the rudiments of
literacy but elite culture was transformed also and particularly by the rising significance of
science the first industrial science labs were created in germany in the middle of the 19th
century and that's probably the point at which science begins to play a direct role in encouraging
innovation in modern society before that most innovations had been the work of tinkerers of
mechanics who knew machines well but weren't necessarily thinking primarily as scientists
as the economic technological and military importance of science rose it began to challenge
traditional ways of thinking in many many areas it began to challenge the traditional role for
example of ancient religious traditions in education and culture by offering new and
fundamentally materialist accounts of the universe which offered as we've seen throughout this course
very little room for traditional deities so the intellectual world both of the mass of the population
and of elite groups was also transformed in the course of the industrial revolution
now i'd like to look at some of the negative sides it may seem as if i've been telling a
a totally positive story as if this is everything is is is going wonderfully there's a profoundly
negative side to all of that all of this and that that is the destruction of traditional societies
growth in industrializing regions was accompanied by sometimes catastrophic decline elsewhere
as productivity rose in the new hub regions regional differences in wealth and power widened
we've seen that the once awesome power of ancient tribute taking empires evaporated china's share of
global production fell from 33 percent in 1800 to 6 percent in 1900 and in the 1840s
british gunboats forced china to trade in opium with the remarkably hypocritical argument that
they were defending free trade and china one of the great empires of the past of the past
of the past was forced to submit to humiliating controls on its foreign trade imposed by these
small nations from the other side of the world by 1900 states from the new hub regions of the
atlantic zone dominated much of the world directly or indirectly this transformation
depended in part on new industrial weaponry the first successful machine gun the gatling gun
was used in the later stages of the american civil war it could fire 1 000 rounds a minute
the maxim gun the first machine gun to use a belt feed was invented in 1884 it was used by
british troops in the matabili war in 1893 to 4 in modern zimbabwe and it gave british troops a
devastating and horrifying advantage over their spear-carrying opponents hill air bellock wrote
at the time with with vicious irony whatever happens we have got the maxim gun and they have not
the vast regional differences in wealth and power that are familiar today first appeared
in the late 19th century in an important book on the origins of the third world which is called
late victorian holocausts mike davis argues that in 1800 class differences within societies
were generally more important than those between different regions of the world for example he argues
differences in living standards between a french worker and an indian farmer were probably far
less striking than those between those groups and those who rule over them by 1900 he argues
differences in national living standards between wealthier and poorer countries had become
for the first time in human history as profound as differences within societies and he concludes
that the gross inequalities between different regions of the world that we take for granted today
were and i quote as much modern inventions of the late victorian world as electric lights and
maxim guns in summary this lecture has traced how the modern revolution spread around the world
it transformed economies it transformed governments and it transformed cultures and we've also seen
how rapid industrialization in some areas of the world undermined the traditional economies
lifeways and societies of other parts of the world would these changes continue
in the next lecture we look at what happens in the 20th century thank you
you
lecture 43 the 20th century
now after 13 billion years we enter the era of our own lifetimes the previous two lectures
described the transformative impact of the modern revolution between 1700 and 1900
after 1900 the pace of change accelerated even further and the modern revolution began to
transform societies throughout the world now i have to say that trying to describe the 20th
century from the perspective of big history is one of the hardest challenges in this course
but with that warning here goes three great waves of change shaped the 20th century the first of
these is the fourth wave that we looked at in the last lecture it begins in the late 19th century
and continues into the early 20th century so we've already met this wave it began to transform
regions well beyond the new atlantic core region notably in russia and japan this is the era in
which russia and japan both begin to industrialize very very rapidly in russia as in north america
railways and above all the trans-siberian railroad completed in 1904 played a critical role in
integrating societies in integrating above all the economy over a vast region remember the russian
empire was by far the largest united state unified state on earth both japan and russia in this period
underwent revolutionary transformations and they became major industrial and military superpowers
now that's the fourth wave and we've already looked at it then something slightly odd happens
there's something was slowed down that affects global growth for much of the first half of the
20th century it's as if the engine of growth that seems to have been fired up in the last two
centuries suddenly seems to stall in an era of global wars and global depression global
rates of growth of growth slow the international trading system which had been one of the main
drivers of growth in the late 19th century begins to break break down as states begin to try and
carve out their own economic zones in the fate in the era of imperialism
exactly why the slowdown occurred is not entirely clear but here's just one possibility
it is that capitalist rulers had to learn how to manage capitalist states after all
this is very new now we saw that tributary rulers had to learn the best ways of managing
tributary states and it took them a long long time the rulers of capitalist states are on a
similar steep learning curve and in the late 19th century it's as if they were still operating with
at least some of the habits of the tributary era and one of them was the habit of thinking that
there was only so much wealth to go around and that they better get their share by military force
if necessary and that may explain the burst of imperialism in the late 19th century during which
major capitalist states carved up much of the world in a vicious competition for control of new
colonies it illustrates this increasingly coercive or militaristic attitude it illustrates an attitude
that sees force like the tributary era as the key to growth rather than effective
economic competition it will see that in the 20th century capitalist states began to slowly
realize that in the modern world under modern conditions economic competition could often
stimulate growth more effectively than military competition but that was in the future meantime
there's no doubt that globally growth slowed global wars would dominate the first half of
the 20th century slowing growth rates particularly in the european hub lands the wars incidentally
demonstrated the extent to which what we can call perhaps the productivity of weaponry had also
increased as a result of the modern revolution 19th century military innovations ensured that
world war one would be particularly bloody new weapons included machine guns tanks airplanes
and chemical weapons such as mustard gas which could effectively burn out the internal organs
of its victims and ironically improved medical systems kept more troops at the front only to
be slaughtered in the thousands by machine guns or artillery in often futile raids on enemy positions
however the second world war in many ways was even more destructive about 60 million people
may have died in world war two and what world war two introduced to warfare was the refinement of
systematic bombing of civilian targets most casualties of world war two were civilians
as the aerial bombing of cities became for the first time a recognized weapon of modern warfare
the extreme brutality of the war and the extreme potential and the potential for brutality of
modern states found the most potent symbol in the systematic murder by hitler's nazi party
of almost six million jews in what has come to be known as the holocaust the war ended of course
with the use of the first atomic weapons in japan the first atomic bombs were dropped on the japanese
cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 colonel paul tibetz jr the pilot of the b29 bomber
that dropped the first atomic bomb had named the plane inola gay after his mother the bomb itself
was named little boy so we have a period of slowdown in much of the first half of the of the 20th
century then growth takes off again in what will call the fifth wave of modernity roughly
speaking the fifth wave runs from 1945 to 1990 and it begins after world war two the modern global
engine of growth seems to fire up again and this wave sees the most sustained era of global economic
growth ever known growth built in part on wartime innovations as some of the crucial
innovations included atomic power rocket technology and the electric transistor
the organization of commerce also changed during both wars states had become extremely good at
mobilizing entire economies mobilizing entire economy entire populations and also mobilizing
the skills of their of their of their scientists and engineers after the second world war some
private corporations began to operate on a scale almost as large as that of states and multinational
corporations such as oil companies in particular began to become as powerful as medium-sized states
so these new economic juggernauts that we call multinational corporations began to play an
increasingly important role in economic development another crucial feature of this era was that the
world was divided into two large blocks this is a sort of deglobalization that shaped the
history of much of the 20th century it was divided into a capitalist block and a communist region
each of which sought to influence the rest of the world which came to be known as the third world
communist countries included highly industrialized societies in eastern europe such as soviet
russia and after 1949 much of east europe which was brought within the soviet block
by force at the end of the second world war and after 1949 it also included china with russia
china much of east europe within the communist block almost half of the world's population
found themselves within communist societies now in terms of the logic of this course what
is striking about the communist world and their command economies is that they preserved many
of the elements of tributary societies one of the most striking of these elements is a fundamental
hostility to commerce so like traditional agrarian civilizations the elites of the
communist societies rejected entrepreneurial activity they called it capitalism and they
actively suppressed commerce and tried to organize economies in which the entire workings of the
economy and society were planned from above given the model i set up in an earlier lecture
of the link between entrepreneurial activity and innovation it should come as no surprise to find
that the problem that eventually led to the collapse of these societies
was the sluggishness of innovation nevertheless unlike traditional tributary states of the later
agrarian era those of the communist world the states of the communist world actively encouraged
industrial growth in an environment without markets and to a remarkable extent they were
quite successful they were able to achieve rapid industrialization but the fact that most
innovation depended on state activity or technologies that had evolved elsewhere mostly
in the capitalist world limited the pace of change and also limited the possibility that
innovations might diffuse throughout society in societies where commerce was largely suppressed
there was really no incentive for anyone to try and take up and make use of some of the
innovations pioneered by state activity so that's the fifth wave the sixth wave
began at the end of the 20th century and we're living through it today
computerization and the internet transformed communications they transformed business and
they transformed information exchanges genetic engineering also promised to transform medicine
and agriculture and we may not have seen much more than the beginnings of the impact of both of
these technologies communist societies collapsed most of them now china of course
still flourishes but it flourishes because most of the distinctive features of the communist era
are being slowly abandoned and china is turning rapidly into a successful capitalist society
with the result that capitalism is now the dominant form of the the dominant way of
organizing societies economically socially and politically in the modern world
so this change the collapse of the communist world and its planned economies
counts as a sort of economic reunification of the globe after 70 years of division into distinct
economic blocks entrepreneurial activity within capitalist social structures now shapes the economies
and societies of most of the world accelerating globalization allowed instant global transfers
of information and money but it also generated new cultural conflicts in which powerful but easily
accessible weaponry enhanced the power of small guerrilla armies resisting the power of the great
capitalist juggernauts this is one aspect of military innovation that the increasing power
of modern weaponry and its mini miniaturization has empowered small groups this is the technological
reality behind what we know as the war on terrorism the other reality is cultural as more
traditional communities attempt to defend traditional values against what they see as the onslaught of
western or modern values and attitudes as increasing globalization forces true traditional
communities and value systems into sort of a closer and more uncomfortable cohabitation
with the most successful capitalist societies many feel obliged to resist
another feature of this era has been the revival of asian economies we saw that the great asian
economies were the dominant economic powers probably for most of the last 2000 years of
the later agrarian era and we saw that their economies were deeply undermined in the 19th
and early 20th centuries until their contribution to global production shrank very very rapidly
indeed in the late 19th century and early 21st century in the late 20th century rather and the
early 21st century these economies have been reviving and beginning to challenge the dominance of
the atlantic hub zone watch this space now let's look at some general features of the 20th century
one is acceleration the pace of change accelerated between 1900 and 2000 here are just some figures
that illustrate this world populations quadrupled rising from 1.6 billions to more than 6 billions
it had taken 100,000 years to reach 1 billion people it took just 100 years to add another
billion people the urban population multiplied by 13 times and by the end of the century almost
half the world's population lived in communities of more than 5,000 people so the pace of change
has accelerated to an extraordinary degree population increases were made possible by
increasing industrial and agricultural production indeed by accelerating production global economic
output increased by about 14 times and industrial output by about 40 times
how were all these people fed well they were fed because global grain production rose
five times in the 20th century from about 400 million tons to about 2,000 million tons
now this is one of the great achievements of the modern revolution in general and of the 20th
century in particular feeding this rapidly growing population agricultural productivity
tripled in this period for various reasons one was increased irrigation the irrigated area increased
by about five times in the 20th century a second was the increasing use of artificial fertilizers
first produced as we've seen in the 19th century and also of pesticides and the other crucial
innovation was the introduction of more productive genetically engineered crops
because food production outstripped population growth in the 20th century we've not yet seen
a global Malthusian crisis now the last time I said that I touched wood and I'm going to do so again
what we've not seen yet is a crisis caused by underproduction that affected the entire world
though there have been many regional famines during this period energy use in the 20th century
increased by about 16 times mainly through increased use of the three main fossil fuels coal
oil and natural gas in the early 21st century these account for almost 80 percent of energy use
and nuclear power counts for about six six percent but in this period I think we can argue that the
lethality of weapons increased even more rapidly than productivity here are just some indicators of
this a world war one artillery shell could perhaps kill hundreds of people if it landed in the right
place the bomb dropped on Hiroshima on august the 6th 1945 killed 70 000 people and a similar number
would die over the next few decades from wounds or radiation sickness now if you want a measure of
increasing productivity of weaponry that is extraordinarily powerful
in the 1950s the usa and the ussr developed even more powerful bombs that used hydrogen fusion
the energy that drives all stars the result is that humans now have the power to destroy
most of the biosphere within just a few hours whereas just two centuries ago the most lethal
weapon available could have killed at most a few hundred people the first H bomb based on fusion
power was tested on november the first 1952 on an island in the pacific for the first time
our species had learned to tap into the power at the heart of the sun
one of the great technological ambitions of the 21st century will undoubtedly be to find a way of
taming this astonishing source of energy so that it can be put to creative rather than just destructive
uses the challenge is to find a container for fusion reactions they're simply too hot to be
contained by solids so most current work seeks ways to confine them magnetically within powerful
magnetic fields but the point is that the increased productivity of weaponry made by some
measures have increased in the 20th century faster than other measures of productivity
another feature of the era of the 20th century is that capitalism emerges as a dominant social
and economic system but capitalism also began to evolve in the 20th century in striking new
ways and i want to try and describe these carefully i've argued that capitalism that is to say a
particular distinctive type of social structure with entrepreneurial elites and a mass of the
population that depends on wage wage earners linked through market activity i've argued that this
type of social structure was a fundamental driver of the modern revolution that conclusion looks
even more plausible after the collapse of the communist societies that had seemed for a time
to offer an alternative to capitalism yet the impact of capitalism was contradictory for
while it generated unprecedented material wealth it also generated new forms of poverty
and there's a very good reason for this this is because in capitalist societies
innovation is driven by the gradient in wealth and power between entrepreneurs who own significant
capital resources and wage earners whose main asset is their own labor now there's a striking
parallel here to what we saw when discussing entropy where we saw that in the natural world
change is driven by energy gradients that can do work on a level level playing field not much
can happen the same is true in some sense of capitalism without significant degree of inequality
without some inequality capitalism cannot work in the wealthiest capitalist societies 20th century
capitalism evolved into a new form that we can describe as consumer capitalism and this constitutes
i think one of the most important and fascinating transformations of the 20th century so let me
try and describe very clearly what i mean by consumer capitalism let's go back to carl marx's
analysis of capitalism he and his disciples had argued roughly speaking that as capitalism developed
increasing numbers of people within capitalist societies would be impoverished and their declining
living standards would generate revolutionary movements that would eventually overthrow
capitalist societies throughout the world and now writing as he did in the 1840s and 50s and 60s
this was not a completely implausible picture of the world and his his good friend friedrich engels
remember wrote an astonishingly bleak account of working class life in manchester but from the
perspective of the early 21st century it's clear that his prediction was wrong despite the spread
of communist societies in the middle decades of the 20th century his prediction has proved improved
wrong why what happened what went wrong with it well what happened i think was this as 20th century
capitalist societies developed instead of impoverishing their own working classes as marx had expected
the most successful capitalist societies began to raise the living standards of their own populations
and we can think of this as a sort of learning curve for the managers and rulers of capitalist
societies it's as if they were slowly learning the best ways of managing this new type of society
consumer capitalism raised the living standards of many in the richer capitalist countries rather
than depressing them why well marx had missed something that eventually would become very clear
to industrialists such as henry ford to economists such as john maynard canes
and to politicians such as franklin delano roosevelt and it was this
as productivity rose as it began to outstrip population growth producers found they had
to work harder and harder to find markets for all the stuff they were producing
this is like the sorcerers apprentice they're producing so much stuff that eventually for the
first time in human history the problem of marketing that stuff becomes the fundamental
problem rather than the problem of producing enough stuff early 20th century pioneers such as henry
ford began to perceive that if you're looking for for new markets wage earners themselves
provided a huge potential market but they could only purchase goods if their wages rose
so what this meant was instead of making profits by cutting wages and that's the model of capitalism
that marx had in mind perhaps the way to ensure future profits was actually to raise wages
to ensure that wage earners in your society could purchase all the goods you were producing
with their labor and this meant that if this was true it was in the interests of capitalists to
raise wages and increase consumption now similar arguments were tested in the american new deal
which put money into people's pockets through for example unemployment pay or huge state projects
it these arguments were also developed in the work of economists such as john maynard canes and
we can see all of this as part of this sort of learning curve of learning how to manage modern
capitalism in the most developed capitalist societies led by the usa average consumption
levels began to rise in fact in the u.s you can see this already in the late 19th century creating
not the impoverished working class that marx had expected but instead a large affluent class of
of wage earners and professionals and what that affluence did was to deflect the revolutionary
zeal that marx had expected to develop amongst wage earners as wage earners became more and more
prosperous they became more contented supporters of a flourishing capitalism in other words the
high living standards of flourishing capitalist societies which is made possible by their rapidly
increasing productivity have effectively deflected the revolutionary impulse that marx believed would
bring them down so what we're saying is the consumer capitalism means a capitalism in which
wage earners are not just a source of profit they are also an important market with the result
that consumer capitalism generates increasingly high material living standards for a larger and
larger percentage of the population in flourishing capitalist societies but this more mature form
of capitalism generated some odd new phenomena for the first time in history major economic crises
and the most major economic crisis of all was the depression of the 1930s began to be caused
not by underproduction not by not producing enough but by overproduction and this is one of the most
distinctive features of consumer capitalism what this has done is to create created an entirely
new rhythm of rise and fall we saw that crises in the era of agrarian civilizations were caused
largely by underproduction by the failure to produce sufficient resources that led to famine to
disease to conflict over scarce resources and eventually to the sort of crash that you find
regularly at the end of a Malthusian cycle the major crises in the capitalist heartland
have been caused by the opposite phenomenon by the fact that production was outstripping
population producers found it harder and harder to market goods profits began to fall and leading
to widespread bankruptcy and the whole system threatened to break down this is commonly known
as the business cycle but to emphasize the parallel with the Malthusian cycle of the later
agrarian era we might perhaps christen it the Keynesian cycle after John Maynard Keynes the
economists who analyzed the causes of crises such as the Great Depression and suggested ways of
dealing with them by helping consumers to consume more through for example the provision of unemployment
payments Keynesian cycles in their turn generate a whole series of new phenomena one of which is
massive advertising if the main problem of keeping the economy going is not to produce enough but to
sell enough then advertising clearly has to play a crucial role in a sense I sometimes feel that
the advertiser today plays the role of the medieval preacher but what the advertiser preaches is
consume because if you don't there'll be a crisis that of course is a message diametrically
opposite to the messages of thrift that were offered to most people except members of the
ruling elite throughout most of the agrarian era consumption in the era of consumer capitalism
has become a virtue and that we will see may prove to be a problem if we discover that there is in
fact a limit to how much we can consume yet on a global scale the gap between the rich and poor
continued to widen as some areas of the world became astonishingly rich between 1913 and 1992
the gap between average income levels in the poorest and the wealthiest countries
grew from 11 to 1 to 72 to 1 the gap began to widen between regions here's just one extreme example
in 2000 per capita national income in the usa was about 34 000 in bukina faso in west africa
a landlocked country with a largely peasant population it was about 210 about one 150th of
the u.s. level poverty in third world countries affected health and life expectancies in 2000
life expectancies in the u.s. were 74 for men and 80 for women in bukina faso there were 45 for men
and women land shortage provides a powerful illustration of the destructive power of capitalism
in more traditional agrarian societies the british journalist paul harrison in the in the 1980s
met and interviewed a 60 year old farmer called mumuni in bukina faso and mumuni had lived through
several stages in the growing crisis that's ruined much of the traditional croplands across the
southern borders of the sahara here's what mumuni told harrison populations had grown
but the amount of land available had not so as populations grew the amount of land available
to each household and each individual had declined very very sharply mumuni remember that when he
was a child only 12 people lived in his father's compound now there were 34 with five young men
working away from home on the ivory coast mumuni eventually took paul harrison out to show him
his land and what harrison saw was that mumuni and other farmers like him were being forced to
cultivate land in ways that even they knew were completely unsustainable because they had to keep
land in crops when it needed to be in fallow and this is what this is what harrison saw even
close into the compound the soil looked poor enough stony and dusty without a trace of humus
and this was the only area they ever fertilized with the droppings of a donkey and a couple of
goats outside a circle of about 50 yards diameter around the houses the ground was a dark red
baked hard it had been cultivated the year before but had yielded very little mumuni said
he didn't think anything would grow there this year so we've seen that the pace of change continued
to accelerate in the 20th century and many did very very well with the flourishing of consumer
capitalism but there was another side this this flourishing capitalism could also be
profoundly destructive particularly to those continuing to live in traditional ways is this
widening gap between the very rich and the very poor sustainable that's one of the questions we'll
start tackling in the next lecture thank you
lecture 44 the world that the modern revolution made
where are we where have we got to we've surveyed the rapid and turbulent changes that created
the modern world now as we did with the era of agrarian civilizations we need to try and
stand back and get a sense of the overall shape of the world that was created by the modern revolution
how different is our world from that of 1700 how different was it from the world of the preceding
5000 years that had been dominated by agrarian civilizations before we can seriously tackle the
question of how sustainable modern society is we need to try to get a clear idea about some of its
basic structures and we've described a number of distinct types of human communities in this course
we've described the foraging communities of the paleolithic these tiny nomadic kin organized groups
of the paleolithic we've described the village communities of the early agrarian era we've
described nomadic pastoralist communities and we've described the large communities of the
agrarian civilization so very broadly that gives us already four quite distinctive types of human
societies now can we sort of describe modern society in the same way can we identify some of the
key distinguishing features of today's world can we look at this new world as it were from a distance
and see what are the key distinguishing features of it now in fact doing so is extraordinarily
difficult it's much more difficult than doing so for earlier communities part of the problem is that
we're in the middle of change we still can't see the overall shape of the modern revolutions we've
seen so we're in the middle of it and because of that also we don't have the detachment that we might
have when we look say at agrarian civilizations we're in the center of it we it's very hard to
stand outside and pick out its main features besides the modern world has evolved so rapidly
that it's very hard in the in the extreme flux and complexity of this world to pick out those
features that are likely to be most durable so having said that we still have to try to get a
grip on the main features that distinguish modern society from those of earlier human history so
here goes here's my attempt now the first feature i'm going to focus on is the speed of change
i've argued that at the center of the modern revolution is an extraordinary acceleration
in rates of innovation in what i've also referred to as the synergy of collective learning and this
extraordinary acceleration in innovation has meant a sort of speed up it's meant a sharp increase
in the pace of history now let's try and try and see some aspects of that speed up what the speed
up means is that our world the world created by the modern revolution the world we live in today
is exceptionally changeable as constant innovation constantly undermines existing structures and
creates new structures so history itself moves much faster in the modern era now here's here's one
way of seeing this we've taken the symbolic date of 1700 for the beginning of the modern era
and if we accept that date what it implies is that so far the modern era has lasted
just over 300 years that's about a third of a millennium now because so much historical
scholarship is about the modern era it's all too easy to forget how short a period this is
now if you think about it one third of a millennium is about one thirtieth of the length
of the agrarian era and it's about one six hundredth of human history as a whole if we
go to the scales of big history we've seen that if we collapse the history of the universe into 13
rather than 13 billion years the modern era counts for no more than six seconds six seconds in
13 years so it's just an instant yet in this instant human societies have been utterly transformed
around the entire earth and that's why the modern revolution counts as one of the eight
great thresholds in this course the remarkable pace of change in this era contrast sharply with the
relative stability of most earlier types of human community and the pace of change this
acceleration in the pace of historical change has also had a profound impact on ways of thinking
and we could even say on ways of experiencing the world in looking at the paleolithic world
or the world of agrarian civilizations it was possible to pick out features that persisted
over many thousands of years in the case of paleolithic societies we could pick out features
such as the existence of nomadic kinship communities that may have lasted for 200 000 years these
features in agrarian societies include the rhythms of peasant life or the basic structures of tributary
states or the malthusian cycles over the last five thousand years or the fundamental ideas of some
of the great religions they lasted for centuries some of them lasted for millennia now think of
asking the same question about today is it possible to identify any feature of today's world that will
certainly be present in say 500 years time now there may be features that will be present in 500
years time but it's extraordinarily difficult to pick them out with any assurance another aspect
of the pace of change is that now probably for the first time in human history major changes
radical change radical changes occur within the limits of a single lifetime and this changes
radically the way they're perceived what it means is that we can perceive large changes
as individuals not just through collective memory or through distant memory of changes in the past
but as individuals in my lifetime the world's population has grown by three and a half billions
communism has collapsed the computer revolution has transformed how we communicate with each other
and use information the world i live in today is a very different world for the world i was grown up in
so unlike all earlier communities we know the future will not be the same as the past and we've
experienced these changes this changeability affects our personal sense of both time and history
and in many ways it's one of the things that's shaped our idea of history and certainly shaped
our sense of big history we've seen many times in this course that before modern times most cosmologies
that is to say most descriptions of how the universe was tended to assume that there were many things
that were permanent eternal and unchanging the skies perhaps the landscape perhaps the heavens
the modern vision of a universe in which every aspect has a history including the universe itself
maybe one product of the now universal experience of constant change so the speed of change affects
how we experience the world and how we understand it it also means something else
it means that today's world is extremely unstable what some see as progress others may see as a
colossal accident waiting to happen things are changing so fast it's extraordinarily difficult
to know where they're going so the pace of change itself raises some deep questions about the
sustainability of modern society so that's the first broad feature about modern life the
quite exceptional pace of change the speed up in the last 300 years
now this speed up driven by acceleration in innovation has meant both destruction
and creation let's look at the destructive aspects first
above all above all what it's meant is the root and branch destruction of all previous human
life ways now this is not something that had happened before we saw that during the agrarian
era forages survived for the entire era so did communities of the early agrarian era one of
the first things the modern revolution has done is to destroy all previous life ways the
life ways of the paleolithic era the life ways of the agrarian era and also the tribute taking
political structures of the agrarian era even a century ago viable communities of forages
and early agrarian villages could be found in Papua New Guinea in the amazon in much of Australia
in South Africa and in other areas today it's reasonable to say that none exist outside a
modern state and what that means is even if they maintain some of their traditions some of their
cultures some of their beliefs they pay taxes they engage with modern markets they use modern
technologies after all why shouldn't 21st century australian aborigines hunt kangaroo using rifles
with telescopic lens lenses and four-wheel drive vehicles but perhaps most striking of all
is the destruction of peasant life ways peasant life ways we saw dominated the last 10 000 years
if you were dropped into the agrarian era randomly the odds are you would have been a peasant
roughly speaking we can assume that nine out of ten of all people in that era were peasants
and that meant that peasant life ways dominated the life experience of most people for the last
10 000 years what's happened in the last two or three hundred years is that a combination of factors
once again driven by innovation has undermined sapped and eventually is destroying that peasant
world the factors are a combination of overpopulation leading to land shortage as we saw in the case of
mumuni who lived in bukina faso competition from modern commercial agriculture is another
crucial factor now many many peasants of course still survive today but more and more of them
are being driven off the land often to end up in the huge shanty towns that surround many major
cities and in those shanty towns what do they find they find cities without sewerage clean water
electricity or police environments as dangerous and probably as disease-ridden as ancient uruk
the modern revolution has not just destroyed life ways a whole traditional way of living
it's also destroyed the political structures of the agrarian era the traditional tribute
taking states that dominated that era and one of the fundamental reasons is that we saw that
tribute taking states although they didn't rely exclusively on coercion did rely very heavily on
coercive methods of rule and now coercion simply no longer works in a highly commercialized world
as the fundamental way of managing entire societies i'll give just one illustration of this that seems
to me peculiarly powerful we also know that if you try to rule today as a traditional dictator
simply using ruling by brute force and skimming resources of the population you're probably
not going to survive long but a more powerful example is the collapse of the soviet command economy
and i've argued already that that can be interpreted in part as a result of the fact that
the communist command economy deliberately stifled commerce entrepreneurial activity
but by doing so it unwittingly stifled innovation in his book perestroika which he wrote in 1987
Michael Mikhail Gorbachev put it vividly the wheels he said seemed to be turning but nothing much
was happening this is these are the words he used something strange was taking place the huge fly
wheel of a powerful machine was revolving while either transmission from it to workplaces was
skidding or drive belts were too loose so here we see a modern state behaving in many ways like a
traditional tributary state and it's as if it can't quite get a purchase on the modern world and that's
why it collapsed so that's the second thing the destructive feature of modernity it's extraordinary
capacity to destroy traditional types of society but rapid change has also been extremely creative
so now i want to look at the creative aspect and above all i want to look at the way the modern
revolution has created new types of community and new power structures now here's the first
striking thing about the communities of the modern world this is the first thing that i think that
that someone surveying uh surveying human history over 200 000 years very fast and looking at the
size of communities is going to see they're going to see that modern communities are extraordinarily
large vastly larger than earlier communities here's just some illustrations of that
politically the modern world is organized into 194 sovereign states the united nations had 192
members in 2007 two states were missing which that's a great trivia question and the answer is the
Vatican city and taiwan so 194 distinct polities of these some were tiny some like lichtenstein were
very very small indeed but of these the most populous was china and in 2007 china had a population
of about 1.3 billion india's population at the same time was 1.1 billion so here we have a single
single states ruling more than a billion people and to put that in perspective remember that in the
year 1000 ce the total population of the entire world was about 250 millions that is to say it was
about one fifth of the population of a single state today modern china granted it's the most
popular state in the world these states also cover much more territory than the states of the agrarian
era in fact they cover the entire land mass of the earth with the exception of antarctica
though even control over antarctica is partitioned among a number of different states let's go back
to the figures of ryan target perot whose calculations we've used before even 1000 years ago he calculated
states and we're in the tribute in the later agrarian era when we say this states controlled as
little as 13 percent of all the territory controlled by modern states and the reason for this is that
vast areas including all of australia most of the americas syberia much of africa were not
within the control of tribute taking states now if these figures are correct what they're telling us
is that in the last thousand years modern states have taken control of the remaining 87 percent
of the earth's surface so the state system now covers the entire world and the result is that
unless they're islands like iceland or australia or britain or japan modern states tend to be
contiguous they're they're squashed together in a crowd so unlike most states of the agrarian era
which had borders that tended to be extremely fuzzy and porous and and could change from
year to year or even month to month as a result of varying military successes or failures
modern states have precisely defined and carefully policed and fenced off borders
now this what we've said about modern states also applies to modern cities estimates of the size
of the world's largest cities vary depending on varying definitions of city limits but roughly
speaking there may be 20 or 30 cities today with populations of more than 5 million now that remember
is the total population of the world 10 000 years ago so what we're saying is 20 or 30 cities today
contain what would have been the entire population of the world 10 000 years ago
and several cities today have populations of more than 10 millions mumbai the largest
may be approaching 20 millions and remember that 5 000 years ago cities such as ur
seemed remarkable with their populations of 20 to 50 000 so we're talking about cities
almost a thousand times as large as the first cities in the later agrarian era so size and scale
the scale and size of modern cities modern communities is extraordinary and again that
reflects innovation and the huge resources and populations of the modern era now a second
striking feature of modern communities is that they are to a remarkable extent integrated across
the entire world through exchanges of ideas of goods of diseases and people and what this suggests
is that the modern form of community let's rephrase this if we want to define the distinctive
community of the modern world one way of putting it might be to say that the modern form of community
is in reality a single global community of six billion people that is the modern equivalent
of the tiny foraging communities of the paleolithic era that global community is even to some extent
even though so far in a fairly rudimentary way organized politically the united nations is
just one of many political organizations that provide a modern equivalent of the meetings that
were held periodically between paleolithic communities so even politically modern societies
are to some extent organized at the global level you could mention many other forms of integration
including migration patterns cultural exchanges and so on at the the use of english as an international
diplomatic language one of the most striking aspects of this global integration is the fact
that collective learning now takes place globally modern forms of transportation and communications
allow real-time communication as we've seen between people at opposite sides of the earth
and what this means is that in principle the exchanges of information that have been the
main driver of human history are now taking place throughout the entire world within a very diverse
and often very well educated population of six billion people now if we add to this the ability
of sort of intellectual prosthetics such as computers to multiply the power of human thought
the effects are even more spectacular furthermore entirely new institutions have emerged to store
generate and disseminate in innovations they include universities the institution of mass
education in the 19th century and technologies such as the computer when earlier we compared humans
and their close relatives the great apes i argued that the difference between us and them was the
difference between a standalone computer which is limited by its own computing power and memory
and a networked computer which in principle has access to the computing power and memory
of millions of other computers a modern human with a networked computer has instant access to
much more information than were contained in the very largest of pre-modern libraries i remember
as a child lusting after the encyclopedia britannica but buying a set was a major financial
investment and the thing was so large that it also meant rearranging the house that we never
got the britannica but today i can access it with a few keystrokes through my university library
and i can access a whole series of other computer other encyclopedias and i can even
summon up and print vast numbers of scholarly articles now of course it's also true that
others can dip into my computer that's perhaps the downside of all of this but what seems to be
happening in some way is that humans are now so networked this process of exchanging information
is becoming so powerful that we're beginning to form a sort of vast global brain now i should
add that global integration has also been painful for many because what it's done is it's forced
communities with very different ethical and social attitudes into very close proximity they've been
driven together they have to deal with each other in a way they didn't before and the discomfort
felt by many traditional communities for example when they encounter western television for the
first time is matched in the western world by worries about the world that children can find
as they surf the net it's a scary world out there and where such conflicts are felt to undermine
deeply cherished values they can lead to violent and painful conflicts about issues of symbolic
importance such as the wearing of headscarfs by muslim women in christian countries you may
remember that in 2004 the french national assembly banned the wearing of headscarfs
in public schools it was it was a difficult and highly contentious issue and similar issues
are cropping up in many countries of the world so globalization has also been for many painful
so one way of thinking about the significance of global integration is to say that in the
modern world the basic type of human community now is one single community of six billion people
and this is one of the most remarkable properties of the modern world now i want to talk about a
third striking property of of modern communities they're very different life ways we've already
mentioned in general terms the significance of the fact that the traditional peasant life ways
are gone most people are no longer self-sufficient rural dwelling peasants most people including
surviving peasants earn wages and are deeply integrated into market systems and increasingly
they live in towns and cities this transformation has had a rather profound impact on gender
relations we've seen that throughout the agrarian era peasants typically saw having as many children
as they could as the key to prosperity and protection in old age for wage-earning families
this is no longer true particularly in wealthier regions of the world and the result is that women
are not so closely tied to their role as child bearers and rearers in modern societies and that
amongst other things has allowed women to enter more specialized professions including politics
in far greater numbers and these changes have begun to undermine deep traditions of patriarchy
though many inequalities remain for example female participation in the paid labor force
rose significantly in the late 20th century but even in 2006 there were only 67 women in
paid employment for every hundred men and they were normally paid about 90 percent of what men
received for similar work the extraordinary material wealth generated by modern societies
has led to some remarkable improvements in living standards average levels of health have probably
changed very little throughout the agrarian era today at least in the wealthier parts of the world
though levels of health vary greatly within and between societies more people eat well and live
healthily without chronic pain or suffering than at any other time in human history so here is a
clear gain from innovation and another clear gain is increasing life expectancy lives have got longer
average global life expectancies in 1700 and probably throughout the agrarian era were probably
about 30 years by 2000 they had doubled to 65 years the change was represented above all
a decline in infant mortality in the number of children who died and once more this represents
a momentous change in the nature of life itself and it may prove the foretaste of future extensions
in the life of a single human a sort of stretching of the span of human life now here's another fourth
a fourth striking feature of modern communities and that is the very different role of coercion
in modern societies in some ways the changes have been paradoxical in the later agrarian world
we saw that coercion was a fundamental mechanism for controlling behavior and you can see that
by looking at the pervasiveness of slavery for example as a teacher in a tribute-taking society
i would have been expected to regularly beat my students a striking example of what this
meant for daily life can be found in the 16th century russian manual of household management
known as dama's story which means organization of the household in dama's story we can read the
following have you sons discipline them and break them in from their earliest years that's prompted
by ecclesiastica 724 do not withhold discipline from a boy take the stick to him and save him
from death if you take the stick to him yourself you will preserve him from the jaws of death
if a wife does not obey says dama's story and if she doesn't manage her household correctly
then and i quote the husband should punish his wife beat her when you are alone together
then forgive her and remonstrate with her now i've quoted dama's story because in some ways it
represents the norm in this world a world in which coercion was regarded as a normal way
of steering behavior i should say that this world took a long time to vanish i went to an
english public school where corporal punishment was still regarded as the norm now in this respect
the modern world is fundamentally different behavior is steered much more by market forces
rather than by coercion so modern states generally frown on the use of violence
indeed the german sociologist max vapor regarded this sort of monopolization of violence by the
state as a key feature of modern states here's how charles tilly describes this process disarmament
of the civilian population took place in many small steps general seizures of weapons at the
ends of rebellions prohibitions of duels controls over the production of weapons introduction of
licensing for private arms restrictions on public displays of armed force so we now live in a world
that is increasingly hostile to the use of violence in personal relations both slavery and domestic
violence still exist but they are widely regarded as illegitimate and that is surely a game yet there's
another side to this it is that modern states when they choose to do so can wield coercion far
more effectively than most agrarian era states even the most democratic of states maintain
large prison populations in the usa for example according to department of justice statistics
more than 2.4 millions were incarcerated in prisons and jails at the end of june 2006 which
represents an astonishing 0.8 percent of the population almost one percent it also represents
one of the highest incarceration rates in the world now it's safe to say that no later agrarian era
state would have had the resources to keep so many people incarcerated we also seen that modern
states have levels of military power that seriously threatened the future of human society despite the
end of the cold war the us and russia may have 4 000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert today
they could be launched within 15 minutes in 2005 a plea signed by 32 noble laureates and
parliamentarians around the world asked that these be removed from hair trigger status noting
that there was still enough of them to destroy civilization there have been several instances
recently as this petition pointed out when individuals seemed to have stopped what was
looking like a process leading to an exchange of nuclear weapons here's just one in january the
25th 1995 russia prepared to launch retaliatory strikes after identifying the launch of what
looked like a us trident missile they postponed the launch only when the missile landed in the
sea and turned out to be a norwegian research rocket studying the northern lights the russian
government had been informed but the information had not been passed on to the radar crew now let
me end with some very brief comments about how we can assess all of this does all of this represent
progress or betterment it's a question we've raised several times in this course for example with
reference to living standards in the paleolithic era or in the early agrarian era and each time
the answers were contradictory well here are some possible answers for the modern world
the modern world has solved what was the fundamental problem of the pre-modern world
that is how to produce enough stuff to support everyone and that is a great achievement and it
explains the high living standards of so many people today that's a remarkable achievement and
it's something entirely new yet this achievement itself has raised new questions first it raises
the question of whether material living standards can keep improving the quality of life by raising
material standards over and over again can we keep raising the quality of life that's one question
or will we have to start looking for other ways of improving the quality of life and a second question
is whether modern society is sustainable given its extreme complexity and the breakneck pace of
change can this thing be sustained that's something we'll tackle in the next two lectures thank you
lecture 45 human history and the biosphere
in the previous lecture we began to widen the lens once more by surveying the major structural
changes of the modern era as we've done with previous eras but we deliberately skipped one
very large and important group of changes changes in the relationship between our species and the
biosphere and these these issues have a direct bearing on the question of the sustainability
of modern society so to see these changes clearly what i want to do is widen the lens further to
include all of human history and i want to survey our changing relationship with the biosphere
in the 20th century it became apparent for the first time that humans were beginning to have a
huge and perhaps disruptive impact on many aspects of the biosphere now let me begin by
defining this term biosphere clearly what is the biosphere the term was invented by the austrian
geologist edward seuss who lived in the 19th century and died in 1914 he used it in 1875
to refer to and i quote the place on earth's surface where life dwells incidentally we've
met seuss before in this course as the inventor of the term gondwana land and a precursor of
some of the ideas of alfred vegner the term biosphere was popularized by the russian biologist
v i van adsky whose dates are 1863 to 1945 and he popularized it in a book he published in the
soviet union in the 1920s he used it on the analogy of other geological terms such as
atmosphere the sphere of air or hydrosphere the sphere of water to refer to the spherical
layer of earth water air and living organisms at the earth's surface that sustains life on
this planet so the biosphere didn't include just living things it included the context
in which they existed and this is a large complex system of exchanges of energy and resources the
place of life now we've seen that the major turning points in human history and i'm thinking
really here of the turning points that introduce what i've called the great eras of human history
including the initial appearance of our species the introduction of agriculture and even the
appearance and spread of agrarian civilizations are all associated with increasing control over
or new ways of controlling the resources the energy the space the material resources of the
natural world each new era seems to begin with a sort of acceleration in human control over over
the biosphere now we've seen that increasing control of the energy resources and space of the
biosphere can be tracked in several ways and one is an expansion in the range and the numbers of
our species and we can track it from the paleolithic to the present day each new era marks an
acceleration in growth rates now let's let's take population growth rates to illustrate this point
if you take the best available estimates of human populations throughout the course of human history
and you do some rough calculations on them you find that in the later paleolithic era
after about 50 000 years ago human populations seem to have doubled roughly every 10 000 years
every 10 000 years that in the agrarian era they seem to have doubled about every 1500 years
this is a very significant increase in rates of population growth and in the last 300 years
they have doubled about every 75 years so each of these gear shifts in human control over resources
represents increasing human power ecological power if you like increasing human power
over the biosphere now this is what when human particularly economic historians talk about
these processes they tend to use a word like growth but we need to remember that this is a very
anthropocentric or human-centered view it may be growth for us because it means we have more
resources and our populations can grow but is it growth for the biosphere not really
what was really going on in each case was that the same amounts of energy were entering the
biosphere from sunlight but more and more of them were being diverted to the use of one species our
own in the 20th century it became apparent that our increasing ecological power was beginning to
have a massive impact on the natural world some scholars anticipated this earlier there are one
of the best known scholars in the in the in the usa was george perkins marsh whose dates are 1801
to 1882 he's one of the first to understand clearly the scale of human impacts on the biosphere
vernadski was another and this realization is also one of the main drivers of modern
environmental movements so massive have been these changes in recent history that and here
i want to quote from a wonderful recent environmental history of the 20th century by
john mcneill and i'll come back to us this book later on it's called something new under the sun
this is what john mcneill writes the human race without intending anything of the sort
has undertaken a gigantic uncontrolled experiment on the earth in time he writes i think this will
appear as the most important aspect of 20th century history more so than world war two the
communist enterprise the rise of mass literacy the spread of democracy or the growing emancipation of
women the change in our relationship with the biosphere is indeed astonishing however to understand
what happened in the 20th century we really need to see these changes in a larger context and that's
why in the rest of this lecture i want to retrace our steps and review our changing relationship
with the biosphere over the entire course of human history now i should note that this is still
surprisingly a fairly unusual way of looking at human history the separation of human history
and the other of history and the other humanities from the natural sciences
that took place in the late 19th century which cp snow in a famous assay of 1959 described as a
separation between two intellectual cultures has meant that historians for the most part have tended
to treat human history as if it were entirely separate from the natural world as this course in
big history has shown this is not true human history is deeply embedded in the biosphere
so now i want to review the increasing environmental impact of our species over 250 000 years we'll
go over data some of which we've seen already and assemble that into a coherent account of the
changing human relationship with the biosphere so let's begin by going back to the paleolithic era
how can we best describe the paleolithic relationship to the biosphere and what
impacts did humans have on the biosphere in the paleolithic era we've seen in this course
that the first distinguishing feature of our species was a greatly enhanced ability to adapt
through collective learning to continually find new ways of relating to the environment
and adaptation by its very nature implies finding new ways of manipulating the environment
now this meant that humans to a greater extent than any other species were constantly trying out
new ways of using the biosphere using their own surroundings trying out new plants or animal
species as potential foods or sources of fibers or skins or trying out new environments and trying
out new ways of dealing with those environments our impact in this year was in fact very limited
by modern standards and there are several reasons for this as foragers paleolithic humans gathered
what they needed consuming natural products largely in their natural form furthermore numbers were
small in fact some genetic evidence suggests that human numbers may have shrunk to as few as a few
thousands as late as 70 000 years ago communities were also widely scattered so their ecological
footprint in general their impact on a particular environment was limited and this has led to the
basically false assumption that humans had no significant impact on their environment
this is profoundly incorrect even in the paleolithic era the environmental impact of our
species was exceptional the first way in which we impacted the the environment of the biosphere
was by migrating in the course of 200 000 years humans explored and learned how to exploit
natural environments throughout the entire world with the exception of Antarctica and the islands
of the Pacific which they would explore later as they did so they developed new techniques for
dealing with different environments from the tropics to the tundra now we can easily take if you
look on a map and you look at human migrations in the paleolithic it looks also simple so we need
to remind ourselves that what's going on is technologically revolutionary it was in its way
a sort of scientific and industrial revolution they smeared out over many thousands of years now
think of some of the things that had to happen for humans to migrate in the way they did in the
paleolithic they had to deal with a whole range of new environments for example they exploited
coastal environments by fishing learning to fish or collect shellfish or using seaweed
learning to exploit tropical forests was a particularly delicate trick think about it
tropical forests are amongst the most diverse environments on earth so that to learn to exploit
them it was necessary to develop first a vast amount of botanical knowledge about different
plants many of them were toxic so to use them you had to either avoid them or find ways of leaching
out their poisons others had particular medicinal values incidentally modern pharmaceutical companies
have sometimes a better appreciation than some scholars of the range and extent of the botanical
knowledge of indigenous peoples such as the peoples of the amazon jungle they very often
send out researchers to try and find out the uses of particular plants from indigenous peoples
in addition they have to deal with many forest animals from snakes to piranhas which are dangerous
so this was no mean feat our paleolithic forages also learned to exploit desert environments
and this requires an entirely different suite of technologies and knowledges you have to have
very good geographical knowledge of water holes and which water holes are available at different
times of the years you need to know about technologies for conserving water and you need
an intimate knowledge of desert species and just one more illustration think of what it meant
for paleolithic humans to live in arctic environments at the height of the last ice age
that doing this meant learning to hunt arctic species such as seal walrus and elk
you had to have sea growing going craft you had to be able to navigate through ice flows you had
to be able to build shelters that could protect you through the winter and clothing that could
protect you while outside in extremely cold temperatures so the technological innovation
of paleolithic humans if we understand it rightly was in fact extraordinary and it was that that
allowed these migrations that looked so easy if you just see them on a map now some of these
techniques that were developed in the course of these migrations had a significant environmental
impact an example that we saw earlier was phiastic farming we saw that many paleolithic communities
developed ways of firing the land regularly in order to increase plant growth and to attract
prey species and over thousands of years these practices regular firing of the land repeated
over and over again could slowly change the mix of plant species it's probable that the
australian landscapes that the first europeans found there such as captain cook and which were
dominated by eucalypts were actually not natural environments at all they were in their way as much
a human created environment as the regular neat gardens of 18th century europe and another
example of these impacts was megafaunal extinctions as human hunting techniques improved and they
must have got significantly better in arctic terrain where hunting animals had to provide the
main source of food as they improved paleolithic hunters may well have contributed to the dieout
of a majority of large mammal species in the americas and australia in the americas they probably
included horses which were an american species large camelids giant sloth and a large number of
other similar species in australia they included giant kangaroos and wombats we can recreate
these extraordinary beasts but they're gone they're gone the only area of the world where you find
large populations of megafauna is our homeland africa and that's because humans and large
megafauna evolved together they knew how to deal with each other the results of over over hunting
were most drastic in newly colonized environments such as sahul and the americas where local animals
were too inexperienced to fear the new arrivals and humans didn't fully understand the ecology of
these animals but farages may also have contributed the extinction of Siberian species such as mammoth
and woolly bison now the evidence on the so-called megafaunal extinction still remains ambiguous
but the fact that they coincide roughly with the appearance of humans
makes it really look as if humans had something to do with it now let's move on to the agrarian era
in the agrarian era human environmental impacts increased very significantly this really is a
gear shift one reason is because agriculture by its very nature requires systematic and
large-scale manipulation of the natural environment essentially we've seen what is going on when you
have agriculture is that farmers are clearing away species of animals and plants they don't need
which they classify as weeds or pests or rodents and they replace them with species that they do
need or want which they call domesticus so this by definition involves rearranging the environment
around you and there are lots of different ways of doing this it may mean churning up the soil
through plowing or using digging sticks to remove weeds and to expose fertile subsoils
in which your domesticus can grow well it may involve the elimination of pests such as such as
wolves or it may require more elaborate changes we've seen such as diverting entire rivers into
artificial channels to water crops in arid regions and used badly we've seen that such methods
could destroy the fertility of soils over large areas the landscape of southern Sumer by the end of
the third millennium BCE was profoundly transformed by irrigation and transformed in ways that made it
an impoverished environment for humans and that's why civilization moved north
agriculture can require even more significant changes including the deforestation of large areas
there are hints of a significant increase in the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
at about the time that early swidden farmers began entering forested regions and clearing
or burning them down for farming in fact both the burning of trees and the reduction of tree cover
would have contributed to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and there was another
spike in the amount of methane and other powerful greenhouse gas once farmers in southeast Asia
began introducing the paddy farming of rice so here agricultural populations are beginning to have
a noticeable impact on the environment an impact that's noticeable several thousand years later
domestication provides another example of how agriculture encouraged humans to change their
environment domestication means manipulating the organisms around you to make them more useful
manipulating them genetically over many generations humans began to interfere in the evolution of
species that were important to them and by doing so they turned wild plants and animals into what
we call domesticated species that are useful to humans and dependent on humans for their survival
domestic sheep we've seen are vastly more numerous than their wild ancestors but they're weaker
they're slower and they're stupider they flourish because of their close symbiotic relations with
humans how do you change wild sheep into domestic sheep it's not that hard from each
each birth each group of lambs you pick the fattest and most docile individuals you do this for
enough generations and you'll soon breed out the feistiness that makes wild sheep hard to manage
and sheep are successful because of this and you can measure that in the biomass of sheep
much much larger than that of wild mammals in his wonderful chronology of the universe
timescale Nigel Calder posed the following delightful scenario which is a wonderful little
parable about the meaning of domestication it raises the question of who domesticates who
the question is this if a Martian ecologist were to study the earth and ask what's the
dominant species on this planet her answer might well be lawn grass and calder explains
here is a species that appears to cover a large part of the earth's surface and to have domesticated
a large bipedal species of mammal and trained it to groom the grass to feed it and water it and in
short to keep it in style and that story is a reminder that domestication is a two-way process
we in many ways are as dependent on the domesticates as they are on us
now finally in the agrarian era in regions of the denser settlement such as towns and cities
humans began to create not just landscapes that they had changed but entirely anthropogenic
environments there was little that was not shaped by the presence of humans in even the oldest cities
such as earth this increasing control over environmental resources over landscapes over
plants over animals over energy is what allowed humans to multiply from six millions ten thousand
years ago to more than two hundred and fifty millions just one thousand years ago so one possible
interpretation of these figures is that human impacts on the environment must have multiplied
by at least ten times but in fact as technologies became more productive the real impact was certainly
much greater than that now having reviewed the paleolithic and agrarian eras we're in a better
position to understand and to put in context modern impacts on the environment the modern
revolution has vastly increased our impact on the natural environment let me just quote a few
quick figures from paul kennedy who writes in the 20th century alone the world's population
quadrupled the global economy expanded 14 fold energy use increased 16 times and industrial
output expanded by a factor of 40 but carbon dioxide emissions also went up 13 fold and
water use rose nine times powerful demonstration of the fact that what we call economic growth
is always always based in some way on increased exploitation of the biosphere now let's look
more carefully at some of these phenomena first energy use there are now more than six billion
humans on earth on average each one consumes about 60 times as much energy as humans of the
paleolithic era 10 000 years ago there were about six million humans in other words human populations
have grown 1000 times in that period so on these figures total energy use by our species has grown
about 60 000 times that's a staggering increase modern humans have also had a massive impact
on landscapes in his environmental history of the 20th century which i've mentioned already
john mcneill has estimated that in that century humans became for the first time the single most
significant movers of earth with a greater impact on the reshaping of the landscape than all natural
forces including glaciation mountain building and natural erosion the main factor here was in fact
mining it had the largest impact and here's just one statistic to illustrate the spectacular
increase in mining in the 19th century coal production increased by about 77 times and in
the 20th century it increased by almost another seven times so that in a mere 200 years it increased
by more than 500 times and coal production means of course moving a lot of earth however other
factors including the building of roads and the spread of cities and their suburbs have also had a
significant impact on landscapes we also had a huge impact on other species if the megafaunal
extinctions of the paleolithic era have deprived the world of a large number of presumably beautiful
exotic and interesting organisms today our impact is vastly greater as we consume more resources
obviously less are available for other species so rates of extinction have accelerated very rapidly
during the last two or three centuries and here's a description by lester brown and he's describing
the situation in 1999 he writes of the 242 000 plant species surveyed by the world conservation
union in 1997 14 or some 33 000 are threatened with extinction of the 9600 bird species that
populate the earth two-thirds are now in decline while 11 percent are threatened with extinction
of the earth's 4400 species of mammals 11 percent are in danger of extinction
and of the 24 000 species of fish that occupy the oceans and freshwater lakes and rivers
one-third are now threatened with extinction now it's all too easy to let such figures just
just wash over you and that's very understandable but it's very important just to come away with a
sense of how huge our impact on other species are even our closest relatives the chimps are
perilously close to extinction and one way of getting a sense of the this impact is to note
that the rates of extinction today are comparable with the rates of extinction during the five or
six most spectacular extinction events of the last 600 million years paleontologists can see
these events in the rocks in the sudden disappearance of whole groups of fossils so we do have a
benchmark to compare what's going on today and human impacts are comparable for example to the
effects of the asteroid that wiped out most of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago our impact in
other words to put it dramatically is as significant in its way as that of a massive asteroid colliding
with the earth we've also had an impact on bacteria john mcneill points out that our relationship
with the bacterial world has been transformed in the 20th century indeed for much of the 20th century
humans engaged in a violent war with disease bacteria in which one of the most important
weapons was antibiotics the war was waged across the planet for many decades and it's still going on
but as he points out the outcome is not yet certain and the reason is that bacteria are fighting
back and they're using the techniques of natural selection and their rapid rates of reproduction
to outflank us and develop new disease resistant strains such as the strains of gold and staff
increasingly found to be immune to antibiotics and we saw that in the past we had an impact on
the atmosphere our impact on the atmosphere now has grown by leaps and bounds above all
through the massive use of fossil fuels now there's much debate over the details of this
process but there are some figures that are not in serious doubt and one concerns changes in the
amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere during the last ice age carbon dioxide accounted for
about 200 parts per million of the atmosphere by 1800 the level had risen to about 280 parts
and currently it stands at about 350 parts per million in other words since the beginning of the
modern era levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have doubled and if current trends
continue they're likely to double again to almost 600 parts per million by 2050
now there's very little disputing this some of this dispute is merely about the exact impact of this
increases in the amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide tend to raise atmospheric
temperatures because they absorb sunlight and retain it rather than allowing it to be reflected
back into into space and it's already been predicted that by the middle of the century
the north pole may be ice-free throughout the year so global warming is it increasingly
looks as if global warming is itself a direct consequence of human impacts on the environment
so in summary evidence is accumulating rapidly that we are now using more resources than the
biosphere can keep supplying and we're using them in ways that are having a massive impact on the
environment will this lead to the sort of ecological breakdown that we've seen many times in human
history except on a global rather than the local scale attempts to estimate our footprint that is
to say the amount of energy we use suggest that we're now using far more energy and resources
than the planet as a whole can sustainably reproduce this looks very dangerous indeed
so such conclusions show us starkly that human history is not separate from the history of the
earth because we are part of the complex global film of life that James Lovelock has called Gaia
Lovelock's controversial but influential idea is similar to the idea of the biosphere
Lovelock argued in a book published in 1979 and called Gaia that the entire biosphere can
usefully be thought of as if it were a single organism so Gaia in Lovelock's account is a
single organism that covers the entire surface of the earth and what Lovelock argues is that Gaia
has the capacity to regulate its environment and to make that environment life-friendly for example
he points out that that the sun has the temperature of the sun has increased over four and a half
billion years and yet at the surface of the earth the temperature has remained at about the level
necessary for liquid water to exist so his argument is that Gaia is more or less preserving the earth
in a form necessary for life to persist now Lovelock's been accused of a sort of mysticism
but his argument is that this is simply natural selection that what Gaia will do through natural
selection is remove those organisms that threaten its future so this is a view of evolution
in which the Gaia the biosphere is a single huge organism that has the power to expel
members of the biosphere that threaten its future this is a view of evolution
in which cooperation seems most of the time to be more important than competition between
species and that's where the warning comes for our species if indeed in our aggressive pursuit of
more and more resources we're inflicting great damage on the great super organism of Gaia
will Gaia eventually expel us as the white corpuscles of a healthy organism may be able to expel disease
bacteria we've seen that in the course of human history humans have used more and more resources
at accelerating rate is this a story of triumph or a sign of danger where is this all going
in the next two lectures we'll try to answer this question by peering into the future
lecture 46 the next 100 years
after surveying 13 billion years can we resist peering into the future i think not
indeed i'm going to argue that it's appropriate and necessary to do so in a course on big history
i began attempting lectures on the future in in this in this course when i first began teaching it
because of comments from some of the students i first taught big history to
some of the best students i taught told me at the end of the course that they felt that in a
course that surveyed 13 billion years it seemed very odd to refuse to look at the next 50 or 100
years how could we just stop on a dime in the present moment after all they argued we were
looking at such huge trends that surely some of them are going to continue into the future i mean
this is a bit like an oil tanker turning around an oil tanker is not going to stop suddenly so if
we look at these trends we ought to be able to say something about the future in any case some of
them felt that i'd left humanity hanging by a thread at the edge of a huge possibly malthusian
cliff and they felt i owed them some insights into where the story might be going next
once i thought about what they'd said i soon realized that they were absolutely right
because of its scale because of the scale on which big history looks at the past big history
cries out for discussion of future scenarios in a way that no other approach to history does
so now we had to try and think how i could lecture about the future as a historian i had been trained
in the idea that historians never think about the future they think about the past that's what
historians do and in fact some famous historians have argued that if you find a historian thinking
about the future you know that something's gone seriously wrong so in order to prepare these
lectures on the future i had to wrestle with my conscience as a historian and i had to try to
break some very old habits and i also had to try to ask some new questions why should we take the
future seriously and how should we think about the future as i worked on these lectures i soon
realized that historians seem to be more or less the only people who refuse to think seriously about
the future many human societies have taken the future very seriously indeed do you remember
the mayan calendars which were so accurate partly because a lot of politics depended
depended on predicting exactly the right day to do certain things or perform certain rituals
and even within modern society there are many professions that take the future very seriously
for example this is what the futures markets are all about and some of them even make pots of money
by doing so and after all money is the key test of seriousness in our society so one
reason for thinking about the future is that it really does matter all human societies have tried
to predict the future and many professionals in our own society from stockbrokers to gamblers
make a pretty good living by doing so now there's another reason why we need to think very clearly
about the future and that i guess is political it's that what we think about the future is going
to affect what we collectively do today now this means we need to be very clear what our ideas
are about the future where we think the world is going because the conclusions we reach may affect
what we do today and that could itself shape the future should we be so worried about global warming
that we begin slapping huge taxes on fuel consumption or should we be much more worried
about the possibility that such taxes will stifle growth these are the sort of questions
that we need to think about and they all involve predictions i also realized that in some sense
thinking about the future is something we do all the time in fact all living organisms
or all living organisms with sensory systems and brains think about the future and they do
so a lot of the time they have to and so do we every time you act you have to predict the outcome
of your action so whenever we act we have some idea in our mind about the likely consequences
of what we're doing and sometimes it's very important that we get these predictions right
so natural selection has designed organisms so that they're reasonably good at predicting let me
just give a trivial everyday example if i cross a busy road i move when i predict that no car is
moving so fast that it will hit me if i get it wrong i'll pay a very serious price for it so
there's nothing odd about trying to predict the future it's just that we need to think very clearly
about how we go about it so all of these arguments persuaded me that in fact it was perfectly
legitimate for a historian particularly in a course on big history to be thinking about the
future so now the question was how how should we think about the future well i formulated a number
of rules and i think they're very familiar to anyone who's in a position where they do have
to think seriously about the future here's the first it is that the future really is unpredictable
there are no sure bets now it may seem obvious but i have to say it because in the 19th century
there was a widespread belief amongst physicists that in some sense the universe was deterministic
if you knew the exact position of every particle in the universe and its exact movements
from then on you could predict the entire future of the universe we now know that this is wrong
and it's wrong at a very deep level 20th century quantum physics showed that at the very small
levels of subatomic particles and photons of light the world is not deterministic at all
in fact at that level there's a fair bit of wriggle room it's impossible sometimes to determine
exactly where a particle is and it may be that in some sense it doesn't have a precisely
defined position so indeterminacy unpredictability is built into the universe so that's why we
have to take very seriously the fact that the future really is open-ended and that means any
prediction we make is a sort of percentage game there are no guarantees rule two and rule two
is a rule rule that stop brokers and professional gamblers know very well
those who think carefully about the future are more likely to get it right more often
and as a result earn more money than those who don't so this is something worth thinking about
and very carefully and rule three is related to that the way to think about the future
is very often to begin with existing trends which is the point my students made to me right at the
beginning if you're betting on the horses a horse's form its track record what it's done over the last
year or two is not a perfect guide to performance but it's better than nothing it's a lot better than
nothing i once had a friend who made a living for many years betting on horse races this was his
profession he knew this was an insecure way of making a living but he'd also he'd also reply
that i he knew of many more insecure ways he made a pretty good living and he worked extremely hard
at what he did like a good stockbroker he put a huge amount of time into studying the form
all the factors that might affect the outcome in fact he became so good at this that he had
to place his bets just before a horse race so as not to influence the odds too much and change the
odds okay with those preliminaries what i want to do now is to start peering into the future
and what i'm going to do is i'm going going to divide the future itself
into three distinct periods rather as we divide it human history into into distinct periods
period one is the next century that's the first period it's close enough to matter
at one way of putting that is to say we will know people our grandchildren our great grandchildren
will live in that period we will know people who will live through it it matters
it's also close enough to be shaped by our actions what we do today may shape the future in the next
hundred years and besides we have some data we have form we have existing trends to help us predict
so for these three reasons the next hundred years is a very interesting scale to think about
and that's the first scale the second scale we'll look at is the next millennium the next thousand
years roughly speaking the next thousand years now that is a is a very different type of scale
and the reason for saying this is that particularly given the nature and the volatility of modern
society possibilities of what might happen in that period multiply so fast that it's hard to make
any serious predictions that are not largely speculative so at this scale our attempts to
predict become less and less scientific and more and more they begin to look like science fiction
having said that i'm going to admit that it's fun to look at this scale and i'm going to let myself
speculate nevertheless then period three period three is the rest of time the whole of the rest of
time in the remote future billions of years away the odd thing is that our predictions suddenly
become a bit more serious and a bit more scientific and there's a very good reason for this if we look
to the remote future we're dealing with very large slow trends such as the evolution of
stars of galaxies and of the universe itself and those are things about which modern science
is reasonably confident that it can say some reasonably precise things so when we look at
the remote future we'll see in the next lecture that there are some fairly clear things we can say
okay now the rest of this lecture is going to focus on the first scale the next century and the
next lecture will discuss the second and third scales the scale of a millennium and the scale
of the rest of the future so what large patterns or trends can guide our ideas about the next
century if we take the idea of complexity seriously we have to take seriously also the
possibility that the sharp increase in the complexity of modern society may make modern
societies more fragile than the agrarian civilizations that preceded them and frankly
it's not hard to see possible routes to break down so it's hard to avoid scenarios in which
we see some sort of breakdown of modern society one form of this breakdown is simply that someone
manages to use some of the many hundreds of atomic weapons that are still deployed
and on hair trigger alert that would be a very simple rapid form of breakdown
and it's a very real possibility but there are also other subtler scenarios and these all suggest
or most of them take the form of what i've called in earlier lectures ecological overreach of some
kind except if this happens if we overreach if we overuse the the resources of the biosphere
this time the crash is likely to be not regional but global it might take the form in other words
of the mother of all balthusian crises in his green history of the world published in the early
90s a clive potting took the history of rapa newie east of ireland as a warning about the
dangers of a future malthusian crisis here's how the story goes rapa newie is a tiny polynesian
island just 16 miles long and it's one of the most remote places on earth it was settled
between 1000 and 1500 years ago by a group of polynesian colonists perhaps a boatload of 20
to 30 people they grew sweet potato they fished and they kept chickens
populations grew to about 7000 and village chiefs began building the large stone figures for which
the island is famous you'll all have seen pictures of these figures they are they are large stone heads
some of them two meters tall and some of them have sort of stone top knots that have been put on top
of them then about 500 years ago the society suddenly collapsed now this is a society of
several villages each with their own heads their own village chiefs so we can think of this as a
society of the early agrarian era then things collapse about 500 years ago they collapse in
warfare disease and famine and what this is looking like there's a classic malthusian crisis
but what happened well we have there was writing of some kind that developed on east ireland but
we can't decipher it so we have to decipher the history of east ireland almost entirely
from archaeological records and archaeologists have reconstructed much of this story using the
evidence available to them the stone figures the ahu it turns out were carved in the island's
single quarry and then they were moved around the island how how do you move such huge stone figures
well the answer is almost certainly that they were moved on rollers that were made from trees
now over time it seems that villages and their chiefs began to compete to build more statues
and the result was more trees were cut down until eventually none were left
now this was a catastrophe islanders themselves must have known what it meant as the crisis
approached with no wood you couldn't build boats and that meant you couldn't go out to see and
fish there there's there's an entire food resource that you cannot get hold of any longer
you can't build houses so now you have to live in caves you you can't use wood for fuel
so this is a very serious ecological crisis and the result was the population collapsed
and people started living in much simpler and more impoverished ways than they had before
now think your way back into Easter Island Rapa Nui about 500 years ago the islanders
must have seen the disaster coming as they fell the last trees but they fell them nonetheless
could modern consumption patterns cause a similar crisis but on a global global scale
is it possible that we'll see this thing coming but do nothing about it
in his recent best-seller collapse the biologist and historian Jarrah Diamond
who's made a huge contribution to our to our understanding of world history by adding a
biologist's perspective on it has explored many other examples of such collapses and you see
similar patterns over and over again sometimes leading lead into larger crises sometimes to less
now what does this story have to do with us
now what does this story have to do with us
so far we've seen that there are no signs of a slowing in the astonishing rates of innovation
generated by the modern revolution we're not quite yet at the point that the islanders were at
when they saw the last trees being cut down and that is perhaps why so far we've avoided a
Malthusian crisis innovation seems to keep increasing despite regional famines and some
of them have been massive for three centuries innovation at a global level seems to have kept
ahead of population growth but could that simply mean that we're preparing the way for a huge and
global Malthusian crisis bigger than any that have preceded it are we behaving the way the
Easter Islanders did just before the crash now we've already seen some ominous trends so let me
just list some of the more worrying trends populations are rising extremely fast carbon
emissions threaten rapid climatic change many fisheries some would say most fisheries are in
decline reserves of fresh water are shrinking rapidly particularly as irrigation increases
throughout the world and rates of extinction we've seen are higher than for many millions of years
so there are many signs of an impending crisis in our relations with the biosphere now here
Leicester Brown describes one of these trends it's overconsumption his his description is very
very vivid so let me let me quote it in some detail he writes if the western model would
were to become the global model and if world population were to reach 10 billion during the
next century as the united nations projects the effect would be startling if for example the
world has one car for every two people in 2050 as in the united states today there would be five
billion cars on earth now that's about 10 times the number today given the congestion pollution
and the fuel material and land requirements of the current fleet of 500 million cars a global
fleet of five billion is difficult to imagine if petroleum use per person were to reach the
current us level the world would be consuming 360 million barrels per day compared with current
production of 67 million barrels now that's just talking about cars now he talks about
consumption at a more general level above all consumption of food consider a world of 10
billion people with everyone following an american diet centered on the consumption of fat-rich
livestock products 10 billion people would require nine billion tons of grain now that as
lester brown points out is and i quote the harvest of more than four planets at earth's
current output levels with massive irrigation water cutbacks in prospect as aquifers are depleted
and with the dramatic slowdown in the rise of land productivity since 1990 achieving even
relatively modest gains is becoming difficult now this is what i meant by saying in the previous
lecture that our ecological footprint is in some senses larger than the planet today or it's
certainly heading in that direction that's one side of it if we raise living standards throughout
the world to those of the richer capitalist countries today it's hard to see how the biosphere
can deal with the pressure we will put on it but there's another side global inequalities today
are such that they guarantee increased conflicts if living standards do not rise in poorer regions
can we imagine a world in which we'd lock in present global inequalities inequalities now that
is surely a recipe for violent global conflict as the usa learned in september 2001 modern weaponry
means that even small groups can in such conflicts inflict terrible damage so this raises further
question if we seem to be headed for a level of consumption that is unsustainable can consumption
slow in a capitalist world how does this relate to capitalism or commerce that the basic drivers
of innovation in the modern world doesn't capitalism require endless growth certainly
significant cuts in consumption appear to be extremely unlikely in the richer and more
powerful countries whose economies are driven today by the logic of consumer capitalism now
so those are just some of the worrying trends today but it's not all it's not all bad there are
also positive trends so let's look at some of the positive or more hopeful trends first i said that
human populations were growing and they have indeed grown at a spectacular rate in the 20th
century and growth rates were probably at their fastest just after the middle of the century
but since then in the last few decades it's become very apparent that rates of population
growth are slowing and they're slowing as a result of what demographers call the demographic
transition this is an immensely important phenomenon so let me try and explain it clearly
it has many causes one of which may be simply the dying out or the vanishing of traditional peasant
life ways we saw that peasants throughout most of the agrarian era seem to be committed to a
demography which meant having as many children as you possibly could there were many reasons for this
one of which incidentally was that so many children died young that if you were if you were to
maximize the chances of some of them living to adulthood you had to have as many children as
possible now as that peasant world slowly fades away and more and more people live as wage earners
in towns and as in increasing parts of the world new forms of social security of some
kind are provided which means that children aren't the only guarantee of security in old age
more and more families are beginning to reduce the number of children they have
today improved health care increasing incomes have reduced the sort of pressures to have children
that peasants experienced and smaller families have also as we've seen transformed the role of
women by freeing them from the duty of lifelong childbearing and child rearing now this change
this slowing down in population growth has been quite striking and here's just one illustration
by the 1980s fertility levels in most developed industrialized countries had fallen to the level
of 2.1 children on average for every woman and demographers regard this as the replacement
level this is the level of reproduction necessary to maintain an existing population
but it's it's it's too low for growth in these countries therefore population growth
has depended increasingly on immigration rather than increases in fertility
the phenomenon is particularly noticeable in the wealthier capitalist countries but it's not
confined to them and that's become increasingly clear in the last decade or so rates of population
growth are beginning to decline throughout the world even in poorer countries in the 1960s global
growth rates were over 2 per cent per annum by 2005 they had fallen to under 1.2 per cent per
annum now this from an ecological point of view has to be a good trend in the sense to the extent
that the sheer numbers of humans put pressure on the biosphere this is very positive because
what it suggests is that by the middle of the century global populations may level out at
eight or nine or perhaps 10 billion people you'll find different estimates but nothing like the
estimates of 15 or 16 or 18 or 20 billion people that were being checked around in the middle of
the 20th century now here's another trend a positive trend since the 1960s ecological awareness
has increased significantly one can be cynical about this but it's worth noting that in the
first half of the 20th century ecological issues were barely on the agenda of any government or
any significant international organization now today most governments have agencies concerned
with environmental issues there are many non-governmental agencies concerned with the issue
and there have been two international environmental summits in Rio in 1992 and in Johannesburg in 2002
now again one can be cynical about these but it's striking that these were the largest gatherings
of heads of state in recent years that's a sign of considerable seriousness
they've also been some notable successes one of the most spectacular was the 1988 international
agreement to reduce production of cfcs which damaged the ozone layer that protects the earth
from ultraviolet radiation the cfcs chlorofluorocarbons were invented in the 1920s it was not until
the 1970s that it was realized that they were beginning to have a damaging impact on the
environment this is an issue where the united states took the lead and one of the reasons was
was that by the 1980s alternatives had developed that could replace cfcs despite international
resistance to reform in 1988 for the first time very good scientific evidence came in
to show that there was a massive hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic and this provided
the wake-up call that enabled the international community to act seriously on the banning of
cfcs their production has declined very drastically and the best evidence at the moment is that the
hole in the ozone layer is at least not growing and may be even shrinking that's a good story and
it's a sign that international cooperation on some issues is possible and can be successful
and here's another good story despite the existence of nuclear weapons since 1945
we have avoided a global nuclear war this is one of those things it's hard to see because it's a
negative fact it's not something that that happened it's something that didn't happen
but we need to take it very very seriously indeed the world may have been close to an
all-out nuclear war two or three times the cuban missile crisis was the clearest example
and we need to congratulate those leaders who avoided that crisis
now what is the relationship between capitalism and all of this now here's a positive aspect
of capitalism capitalism may turn out to be part of the solution as well as part of the problem
recent centuries have shown capitalism's astonishing capacity to adapt to change
to mature to take new forms and to find social and technological solutions to new problems
and capitalism is particularly good at reacting to scarcity so as resources become scarce their
prices tend to grow and that tends to shift investment to enter to into alternative sources
of supply already now we see investment shifting towards technologies that may reduce dependence
on fossil fuels by improving alternative sources of energy such as wind power and it's possible
therefore that there's going to be a sort of economic bonanza in sustainable sustainable
technologies and capitalism has the flexibility as a driver to shift resources very quickly in
that direction it's interesting to watch the behavior of the large oil companies as they
increasingly present themselves as green organizations and some of them apparently quite
seriously are beginning to position themselves for the role of energy producers in an era of
sustainability and of course we shouldn't forget collective learning the collective brain of modern
humanity armed with the prosthetic brains we call networked computers counts as the most
powerful problem-solving intelligent entity we know of if there's a solution to the problems
that face us and that face Gaia the exchange of ideas between six billion and more humans
is surely likely to generate that solution which leaves the problem of politics whether or not
when we've seen the solution we will implement it many would argue that we can see the solutions
already we know what needs to be done but will we actually take the hard decisions needed to
implement them and will we be able to take them on a global level so though there are ominous
trends in our relationship with the environment and a real threat of a global Malthusian crisis
yet there's also glowing awareness of the dangers and of what needs to be done so perhaps there are
prospects that this is a maze which we can see our way through collectively as a global community
avoiding the fate of the islanders of Rapa under we thank you

lecture 47 the next millennium and the remote future
now the lens through which we view history is going to begin to widen and it's going to begin to
widen very very fast indeed as fast as you like in fact in this lecture we're going to look at a
larger chunk of time and a larger chunk of space than in any other lecture in this course so the
lens is widening very very fast we return now to larger scales like the ones we considered
early in this course in the first part i'm going to consider the next millennium then the second part
i'm going to consider the rest of time and we're going to ask about the future of the earth the
galaxy and the universe as a whole and we'll find that oddly when we look at this larger scale
it's possible to speculate scientifically about it in a way that's probably impossible
in thinking about the next millennium okay so first let's look at the next millennium the next
thousand years what can we say about the future at the scale of a thousand years well the first
thing we're going to see is on this scale we have far more questions than answers
we've seen that modern human societies are amongst the most complex things that we know of
and they're also extremely volatile and changeable and this means that though we can identify some
trends we know of none that are guaranteed to continue for more than a few decades so really
all we can do in looking at the next thousand years is to play with some different scenarios
and that's what i'm going to do some are scenarios for disaster for humans and perhaps for the entire
biosphere and some are scenarios for a more optimistic future at least from the perspective
of humans and also perhaps from that of the biosphere there's a wonderful novel that was
published in 1959 called Canticle for Libervitz and it was written by Walter M Miller here is
a wonderful disaster scenario what Miller did was imagine a world remember this is this is not
long after world war two Miller imagined a world in which societies evolved to the point where they
developed nuclear weapons at which point they used them the novel begins in the utah desert
in a world that should remind the reader of the european dark ages after the fall of the roman empire
this is a post holocaust world and the people of that world describe the holocaust as the flame
deluge a monk brother francis gerard discovers what the reader will recognize as a bomb shelter
from the 20th century and inside it he's going to discover some documents which turn out although
they can't be deciphered at the time to contain important information about nuclear physics
later segments of the novel take us forward several centuries two eras in which knowledge
is slowly building up again as it did in the european middle ages and through the renaissance
and the era of the scientific revolution until eventually we enter an era in which there is
sufficient scientific knowledge to once again build nuclear weapons and they are used again
so what happens is they hurl the world back into a new dark ages and what's clearly implied by the
novel is that this process is going to repeat itself over and over again now it's a it's an
intriguing scenario is this perhaps the fate of all species capable of collective learning
is there a limit to collective learning or at least the sort of bottleneck of some kind
beyond which it's hard to move is it that species capable of collective learning becomes so clever
that eventually they are inevitably going to do something really dumb like explode nuclear weapons
now if that's true if millers science fiction scenario actually has some relationship to
what's happened in the universe that might explain why we fail to detect other talkative
species like ourselves despite many decades of looking for them is it possible that the
dangerous knowledge that accumulates within a species like ours that's capable of collective
learning is bound to eventually outweigh the more creative knowledge that such species generate
or is it simply that such a species is eventually bound to construct societies of such complexity
that they're not sustainable now here's a second type of disaster scenario
and this is a non-human type of disaster geologists now understand that the earth's history has been
punctuated by periodic impacts from meteorites or asteroids such as the asteroid impact that
that wiped out most species of dinosaurs about 65 million years ago that this is what happened
was established actually quite recently in the 1980s and it was established largely through the work
of Walter Alvarez an American geologist who proved that at least one major extinction event in the
earth's history had been caused by massive asteroid impact this went against the grain of
current geological thinking so it was a very significant achievement to establish the truth of
this we now know that this can happen we saw that in the in the planet's early history
asteroid impacts were very common but they then became rarer as various objects moving around the
solar system was sort of swept up into into planets astronomers today are keeping a close
eye on any objects that could stray too close to us as we've seen before but it's by no means
certain that we have the technological capacity yet to deal with such a crisis despite the 1998
Bruce Willis film Armageddon so there's a natural disaster scenario now some scenarios
are more optimistic so let's look at some of those perhaps there's a whole cluster of scenarios
that go like this perhaps what will happen is that there'll be a sort of wake-up call it may take
the form of a near brush with disaster we can imagine perhaps a regional nuclear war
that will shock the world into a realization of the dangers it faces that scenario is described
very nicely in two good histories of the future one is by Warren Weigar a scholar of the work
of HG Wells and it's called a short history of the future and the other is a fascinating book by
Brian Stableford and David Langford called the third millennium in both these books you have
a human community that's deeply divided and then shocked into some sort of unified action on behalf
of its future by nuclear war and what that scenario suggests is that this shock may provide the
political will and the insight needed to avoid the fate of Easter Island humans will perhaps
deliberately start slowing consumption levels they'll find ways of living that can be satisfying
without putting too much pressure on the environment and they'll learn to live sustainably
within the biosphere they will redefine the good life so that increasing material consumption is
not an essential part of that dream of course doing so will require the rapid development
not just of the technological knowledge needed to generate energy and resources more sustainably
and to limit waste but even more importantly it will require the rapid development of mechanisms
that can enable humans throughout the world to coordinate what they do it'll involve turning
the embryonic human community of today into a more politically organized community that can act
with some sort of unity in dealing with major global issues now if we do indeed evolve in this
way the modern era as we've described it may turn out we just the prelude to an entire new epoch of
human history innovation may generate sustainable technologies that we can barely imagine they
may include new energy sources perhaps the taming of hydrogen fusion they may involve biotechnologies
that create new food sources that can eliminate most forms of ill health and that can prolong
human life that last scenario is worth thinking about because we've already seen the beginnings
of it in the 20th century what would it mean if each of us knew that we might live for a thousand
years or more or even indefinitely would the possibility of a sort of pseudo immortality
change our attitudes to ethics presumably so or to issues like suicide
if we knew that most people alive today will not die in the near future will it follow
that we should stop producing more human beings perhaps the having of children will cease to be
a normal human experience and what will that do to our sense of biological family clearly
a radical extension of life spans will mark a revolution in our understanding
of what a good human life means now we can imagine also the emergence of new social structures that
include improved mechanisms for reducing violent conflict and rely less on increasing consumption
on other more sustainable notions of progress and well-being as we've seen so these are all
optimistic scenarios now if we're trying to be just slightly more realistic we probably have to
agree that it's the in-between scenarios that are most likely to occur a real future which
will fall between these extremes being like all of human history a tale of both triumph and tragedy
of creation and destruction but exactly what form it'll take is anyone's guess now here's a question
we can perhaps pose slightly more seriously and it's this what new things will we learn
now let me attempt to list some areas where it's not unreasonable to think that there could be
profound scientific and technological breakthroughs in the next millennium
quite soon we may find evidence for the existence of planets very similar to the earth this could
happen very quickly within a decade or two within just a few years within a century or so will we
have also found evidence for the existence of life elsewhere in the universe will we perhaps find
that the universe is in fact crawling with life that this is not the only corner of the universe
with living organisms at present given what we know of the speed with which life appeared on
our earth that is not an unlikely scenario now think of the odds we have been able to observe
life on just a single planet so far and what we've seen is that on that planet life appeared
life in the form of simple single celled organisms almost as soon as the planet was cool enough to
sustain life about 3.8 billion years ago now what that seems to imply is that whenever promising
environments are created for life and presumably there'll be on planets in the vicinity of stars
but not too close otherwise they'll be too hot and not too far away otherwise they'll be too cold
as soon as wherever these conditions have appeared this suggests life is likely to appear
life at least in the simple form of single celled organisms may therefore turn out to be
quite a robust form of complexity that is spread throughout much of the universe
but what about the chances of finding creatures like us creatures capable of collective learning
now perhaps they don't need to look like us but let's define the crucial feature of humans as
this ability this capacity for collective learning
that we shouldn't ruled it out the chances of finding such organisms seem a lot less
likely and here are some of the reasons one reason is that on our earth it has taken almost
four billion years to evolve such a species and we also know that a lot of luck was evolved
for example the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs now imagine that it had been on a
trajectory just a few minutes earlier or a few minutes later it would have missed the earth
the dinosaurs would have continued to flourish and mammals as a group of organisms would have
probably remained in their existing niches as small burrowing shrew-like nighttime organisms
they wouldn't have flourished in the way they did after the removal of the removal of dinosaurs
and we are part of that massive adaptive radiation of mammals after the removal of the dinosaurs
then even once our species had appeared what are the chances of it surviving
there are genetic hints as we've seen that our species that our numbers dwindled to just a few
thousands perhaps as recently as 70 000 years ago at that time the survival of our species
hung on a thread now if these hints are correct does that mean that we've come perversely close
to extinction and of course we also need to add that like all evolution events the appearance
of our species depended to a large degree on genetic chance on the appearance of a mutation
that happened to spread amongst a small founder population to create our species how likely
was such an event Stephen J. Gould who I've mentioned before wrote a famous book on the Burgess
Shale the Burgess Shale is a rich source of fossils from the Middle Cambrian era
that was found in the Canadian Rockies and in his book Gould argued that many of the forms
found in the Burgess Shale are so strange that they proved that evolution on earth
could have followed many different pathways so what he's suggesting is that
if you start life on earth and you just tweak the condition slightly you'll find
that the path of evolution runs along completely different lines the story we told
that evolution of life on earth would be very different indeed and the organisms you'd end up
with would be completely different from those we know if he's right the line of evolution that
led to us is perhaps vanishingly unlikely to be repeated elsewhere on the other hand if so
we're extremely unlikely to encounter species anything like us and perhaps unlikely to encounter
any other species capable of collective learning yet there are evolutionary biologists and one of
them is Simon Conway another scholar who's worked on the Burgess Shale who've taken a very
different line what Conway and others who think like him have argued is this they've argued that
there are a limited number of evolutionary pathways and what they're talking about is
the chemistry of biology there are a limited number of ways in which organisms can be created
in which they can evolve to multicellularity and so on so he's argued that evolution is not as random
or as open-ended as Gould supposed there are a limited number of ground plans as it were on
which you can build living organisms if this is true then it follows that given a reasonable amount
of time and given multiple planets on which life evolves it's quite likely that on at least some
of them evolution is going to follow fairly similar paths to those on earth and in some of them
they may eventually stumble upon the idea of a large-brained dexterous organism such as ourselves
that's capable of collective learning if so we might expect that wherever life gets going
on a reasonably long-lived planet that means a planet orbiting a small to middling star
creatures a bit like us might appear perhaps even Conway has argued with similar sensory organs
including eyes and perhaps with brains and a capacity to manipulate their environments and
share information about it if Conway is right then we may not be quite so rare in the universe
so if so what are the chances of actually meeting such creatures well they're not good
if Walter Miller is right in Canticle for Leibovitz and all these creatures always reach a certain
limit and then blow themselves up now here's another scenario let's imagine that we've
survived the various disaster scenarios that are waiting out there for us where will our
history as a species take us are there perhaps new thresholds of complexity out there waiting to be
crossed one intriguing possibility is that like eukaryotic cells in the Cambrian era we may become
so interdependent that there comes a point where we'll start turning into a single earth spanning
species linked in complex ways with many other species of the biosphere we've already seen
that we're now so networked that we're beginning to function as if we are parts of a huge global
brain and of course if James Lovelock's idea of Gaia is correct then like it or not the biosphere
as a whole is already well on the way to being a single organism and one that may feel of course
that our species needs to be removed like a sort of cancer cell okay here's another scenario
and this is migration humans we've seen are travelers and explorers and if we survive the next millennium
our descendants will surely start migrating beyond the earth as our ancestors migrated beyond the
savanna lands of east Africa and as ancestral Polynesians migrated throughout the vast
archipelagos of the pacific ocean how likely is the scenario well this is reasonably plausible
many of the necessary technologies already exist for migration to the planets and moons of our
solar system and of course humans have already reached the moon and within a decade or two it's
very likely that humans will walk on Mars so even today we have some of the technology needed say to
mine asteroids or to colonize the moon for some period of time or to build artificial space colonies
in fact there's one already orbiting our earth the international space station there's even been
some reasonably serious talk although this is probably on the borderline between serious science
and science fiction of the possibility of terraforming Mars to make it more habitable to humans
that would probably involve a sort of artificial global warming beginning perhaps with massive
nuclear explosions so as to create on Mars a breathable atmosphere and and seas if this would
happen it would probably take the best part of a thousand years or more but we could think of it
as a sort of domestication of an entire planet
but at present we have none of the technologies needed to go further than our solar system
none of the technologies needed to migrate to other star systems remember it takes light more
than four years to travel to the nearest star and at present we have no idea how you might
propel a spaceship fast enough to even begin to match the speed of light so for humans such
journeys would presumably take many generations if they occur they will be spectacular recreations
of the journeys that Polynesian migrants made when they settled Rapa Nui or Hawaii
and here's one more thing if our ancestors if our descendants rather do migrate to distant star
systems we will create a vast archipelago a bit like the colonies of Polynesia
collective learning will now start occurring at stellar scales but the distances between these
colonies rather like those between Polynesian islands will be so huge that these communities
will certainly or at least some of them will certainly become isolated culturally
and even eventually genetically slowly our species will start to split through some form
of allopatric speciation a bit like the Galapagos finches they'll split into species that are very
very similar but gradually over time they'll become less and less similar they'll become
distinct species that will that mark the end of our species and will that mark perhaps in some sense
the end of human history okay now let's confess that most of this has been pure speculation
at larger scales though we can return to scientifically solid ground or at least reasonably
scientific speculation so now let's move forward to the remote future the rest of time
at scales beyond those of human history we return to slower and simpler processes such as the evolution
of the earth the sun and the universe and these processes we can discuss with a bit more confidence
so let me go through some of the predictions we can make first about the geography of the earth
studying the movement of tectonic plates is something we can now do with great precision
using satellites we can tell exactly how fast plates are moving and exactly what in what direction
so these studies hint at what the earth may look like in a hundred or two hundred million years
and there are some things we can say the Atlantic will widen and the Pacific will narrow
bringing Asia and North America together and eventually a new supercontinent will emerge
remember we've seen in the last billion years supercontinents have formed at least twice
radinia perhaps six or seven hundred million years years ago and pangea about 200 to 250 million
years ago so eventually a new supercontinent will emerge as it does so Los Angeles will slide north
and it will become part of Canada this will be a world that will very different from the world of
today what of the future of our earth our sun we've seen is about halfway through its life
in three to four billion years the sun will run out of hydrogen then it'll collapse in on itself
as it does so it'll generate much higher temperatures in its core and it will expand
again to form a red giant it'll be much larger than it is at the present it'll include mercury
and venous and the earth will be sterilized of life and the oceans will boil away there'll be no
more life on earth we should certainly have got out by then eventually when the sun has burned up
all the helium in its core it'll collapse again temperatures will rise once more they'll become
much higher than they were even in the helium burning era and the sun will get larger than
it was before this time it'll reach the earth's outer orbit and our earth will be evaporated
by then we need to have seriously got out of the inner solar system and preferably out of our solar
system then what will happen the sun will expel its outer layers and what's left will cool down
and shrink it'll become a black dwarf it'll be a retired star an x star and now what'll it do
in its retirement it'll do nothing but keep cooling for countless billions of years it won't
shine any longer it won't do anything useful for its surroundings that's the fate of our sun
and the future of our galaxy well we can say something even about the future the milky way
the milky way is on a collision course with its neighbor the andromeda galaxy
and at about the time that our sun enters its death throes the two galaxies will collide
what'll happen well it's not going to be a violent collision they will glide gracefully
through each other though gravity will in introduce some turbulence as they do so
but we won't be around to see the spectacular night skies that that will produce
and finally the universe what is the fate of the universe we've seen the beginning of the story
do we have any idea about the end actually cosmologists have some reasonably clear ideas
about what is possible one idea was very popular in the late 20th century and it was this it was that
all the matter in the universe and all the energy in the universe we've seen exerts a gravitational
pull so the idea was that this gravitational pull would eventually be so powerful that it would
slow down the expansion of the universe and then come a time when the expansion would slow it would
grind to a halt and eventually the universe would start shrinking again rather like a vast
solar nebula that includes the entire universe uh steven hawking perhaps slightly with tongue
in cheek argued that at that point time might start reversing and all sorts of processes will
go into reverse so the universe will start shrinking over many billions of years it'll
shrink until eventually it'll shrink away to nothing this will be the big crunch as opposed to
the big bang oh what'll happen then well now here things do get seriously speculative but many
scientists seriously speculated that out of the big crunch might come another big bang so this is
the scenario of bouncing universes universes appear they expand then they contract again into nothing
and then they expand again and perhaps there's a sort of larger multiverse that is full of these
expanding universes but since the late 1990s cosmologists have learned that the rate of expansion
of the universe is actually increasing it's not slowing we don't clearly know why but what this
suggests is that the more likely scenario is that the universe will keep expanding forever and ever
and what will that mean well here are some of the things that'll happen eventually every star in
the universe will have used up its fuel and died they'll all be retired the universe will darken
over countless billions of years black holes will graze on the remaining bits of matter
and when i say countless billions of years i'm talking about gazillions of billions of years
i said earlier we imagine we can imagine in the universe that there are as many stars as there are
sand grains on all the all the deserts and beaches of the earth will now start thinking
that many billions of years in the future the universe will keep expanding the space between
remaining objects will increase temperature differentials will narrow with smaller energy
differentials there are no stars for example to drive complexity the universe will become simpler
and more boring any complex things will slowly simplify the universe as a whole will become
simpler the second law of thermodynamics will have triumphed over complexity and this is what
was known in the 19th century as the heat death of the universe and what'll happen next well
the universe will continue to get more and more uninteresting for as many billions of years as
there are sand grains on all the beaches and deserts of the earth and so on forever and ever
where does that leave you and me what's our place in this huge story
the last lecture in this course will touch on some of these large issues of meaning
and will also briefly recapitulate the story of big history thank you
lecture 48 big history humans in the cosmos
early in this course i said that one way of thinking about big history might be to imagine
a community of people old and young around a campfire as i say this i'm actually thinking of
some wonderful holidays that my wife and i spent with our children and friends of ours who also
had children and we spent them at a lake in australia north of sydney each evening we would build a fire
and because all children are natural pyromaniacs we would sit around it till late at night and
they poke sticks into it and eventually we could look up and see a wonderful stylet southern hemisphere
sky i'm sure you can think of similar occasions and it's not at all hard to imagine that most people
perhaps throughout most of human history have had similar experiences now we can imagine that the
youngest people in the group start asking questions they start asking questions about the meaning of
life and about where things come from so they say why are there so many people in the world for
example or how big is the world really and imagine that we try to give them the best
and most intelligent answers we can our answers might take the form of the story we've been following
throughout this course but played in reverse so here's how it might sound if i told this to an
adult audience let's begin with human history today's society is the the largest and by far the most
complex human society that has ever existed today there are more than six billion humans
and though they live in distinct societies with different states that are often in conflict with
each other all these communities are linked through trade travel and modern forms of communication
into a single global community this modern global community which is the world we live in today
was created very recently just during the last 300 years about 300 or 400 years ago human beings
initially in some parts of the world and then eventually throughout the world crossed a sort
of threshold human societies became more interconnected and as commerce was becoming
more important than ever before people in some regions began to innovate faster than ever before
now these changes are often described as the industrial revolution what they did
was to lay the foundations for today's vast and rapidly changing societies by suddenly
introducing a whole new wave of new ways of dealing with the environment and getting energy
for several thousand years before this most people had lived in the large powerful communities
that we describe as agrarian civilizations they had cities with magnificent monumental architecture
they had powerful rulers and these these state systems were sustained by large populations of
peasants who lived in the countryside and produced most of society's resources innovation was much
slower than today and that's why things tended to change much more slowly the pace of history was
slower and there were far fewer people than today than today 2000 years ago for example there were
probably only about 250 million people on earth where did the agrarian civilizations come from
well the first agrarian civilizations appeared in regions such as Mesopotamia Egypt and China
and they appeared about 5 000 years ago during the previous 5 000 years an increasing number of
humans lived in small relatively independent communities of small farmers that were governed
by local chiefs but there also existed many people who lived not by farming but by foraging that is
to say by gathering the resources they needed as they migrated through their territories agriculture
appeared about 10 or 11 000 years ago before the appearance of agriculture all human beings
were foragers they all lived like foragers or hunter-gatherers what agriculture did was to greatly
increase the amount of resources that human communities could extract from a given area
and the result was it led to rapid population growth and eventually that led to the creation
of the very large human communities that were the first agrarian civilizations so that's why the
appearance of agriculture counts as the most important threshold in history before the appearance
of the modern world for the 200 000 years or so before agriculture all humans had lived as foragers
and that means they lived in small family-sized nomadic communities of perhaps less than 50
people for the most part sometimes with links with their neighbors for most of this time
there were very few humans on earth probably little more than the numbers of great apes in
the world today so that's a period of about 200 000 years the first members of our species homo sapiens
appeared about 200 to 300 000 years ago we don't know exactly when but we're pretty sure they
appeared somewhere in Africa their appearance counts as the most important threshold before
the appearance of agriculture what made these first humans different from all other animals
and what accounted for their ability to explore so many different environments was their ability
to exchange and store information about their environments humans could talk to each other
and they could exchange information with a speed and efficiency that no other animal could match
and that means they could store information in addition unlike any other animals they could
ask about the meaning of existence humans were probably storytellers from the very beginning
of their history now that's a brief history of how human societies developed into the remarkable
global community of today but how were the first human societies created humans after all are
living organisms so to explore the origin of humans of our species we must describe the
history of living organisms and that's the next stage in this story our species evolved in the
same way as all other species by natural selection tiny changes in the average qualities of each
community slowly accumulated over many generations until the nature of each species slowly changes
and this is the process that created the huge variety of species today our ancestors evolved
from highly intelligent bipedal ape-like ancestors known as hominins the first hominins appeared
about six million years before the appearance of homo sapiens our species the hominins in turn
were descended from the mammals known as primates they were related most closely of all
to the gray tape such as the chimpanzees and gorillas but the primates as a group were
tree dwelling mammals they had large brains they had dexterous hands they had stereoscopic
vision these are all the things you need to live in trees and as a group they had appeared
about 65 million years ago the primates were mammals mammals were a type of animal that had
first evolved about 250 million years ago they in turn the mammals in turn were descended
from large creatures with backbones whose ancestors had learned to live on the land about 400 million
years ago all amphibians and reptiles are also descended from these ancestors large multi-cell
organisms like ourselves had only been around since about 600 million years ago that's the
first time during the so-called cambrian era that you get very large animals made up of billions
of individual cells before that all living organisms on earth were single-celled most would
have been invisible to a human eye the first living organisms on this planet seem to have appeared
as early as 3.8 billion years ago that's just 700 million years after the formation of our earth
they were the remote ancestors of all living creatures on earth today including you and me
what's remarkable is the speed with which they appeared
just 700 million years after the creation of our planet and our early planet was not a very
hospitable place for life so the speed with which they appeared suggests that life is likely to appear
in our universe wherever the conditions are right and that means wherever we find planets
that are bathed in the light from nearby stars but far enough away for liquid water to form
because liquid water water in liquid form that is provides an ideal environment for complex
chemical reactions like those that formed living organisms the other crucial ingredients
of course is a is a rich mixture of chemicals so it seems that wherever you get a hospitable
environment for life in our universe it's very probable that life will appear so the formation
of life itself as we move back in time is the next most important threshold before the appearance
of our species that we've also seen lots of minor thresholds as life evolved
life in turn was only possible where the conditions were right so to understand the
appearance of life we need to understand the appearance of planets of stars and of chemical
elements that takes us to the history of geology and into astronomy our earth was formed about
4.5 billion years ago and it was a formed it was formed along with all the other planets moons
and asteroids and comets of our solar system all of them were formed as a byproduct of the processes
that created our sun what happened was that debris left over bits and pieces if you like
orbiting the sun smashed together within the earth's earth's orbit slowly accumulated into
larger and larger lumps until eventually they all aggregated into a single large lump which was our
early planet the formation of our planet therefore is the next important threshold in our story as
we move back in time now how common was this process well solar systems may have formed countless
billions of times in the history of the universe but this happens to be the only solar system whose
origins we know much about at present our planet like the living organisms that inhabit it is made
up of many different chemical elements in fact in in our body you can probably find traces of
elements from across the periodic table so neither our planet neither our earth nor you and me could
have been formed if the chemical elements had not been manufactured they were manufactured
in the violent death throes of large stars in supernovae or in the dying days of other stars
we don't know when the first stars died and scattered new elements into space but it's
very probable that it happened within one billion years of the creation of the universe so this new
threshold the creation of chemical elements takes us back more than 12 billion years close to the
beginnings of the universe since then billions upon billions of stars have died scattering new
elements into interstellar space now obviously stars could not have died if stars had not been born
stars were born like our sun as clouds of gas clouds of matter collapsing under the pressure
of gravity heated up in their centers until eventually hydrogen began to fuse and at that
point they lit up they turned into stars though star formation has occurred has continued ever
since the first stars appeared that's why as i said in an earlier lecture there are probably more
stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches and deserts of our earth
the first stars may have been formed more than 13 billion years ago quite soon within 200 or 300
million years of the origins of our universe so as we move back in time the creation of stars
counts as one more great turning point in the story so we've looked at human societies life
the creation of planets and stars and that takes us back to the beginning obviously nothing could
obviously nothing could have existed if the universe itself had not been created the universe
we now know was created about 13.7 billion years ago stars were formed from great clouds of hydrogen
and helium atoms which like the force of gravity itself were created at the moment of the creation
of our universe this is the first turning point of all the first threshold of all
and in many ways it's the most mysterious our universe began as a tiny hot expanding ball of
something that popped out of nothingness like an explosion and the explosion which cosmologists
call the big bang has continued ever since you and i and the planet we live on are simply part of
the debris that's the very beginning of the story and we can't go further back in time
so that's a quick summary of the story we've told in this course
the story i've just told is a highly condensed summary of the best modern scientific attempts
to understand origins to understand how everything around us was created it's our best shot at
explaining origins just as every traditional creation story also represented the best attempt
given the available knowledge to answer all the fundamental questions about origins
now it needs to be said that the story told in this course that i've just summarized is far from
perfect like all previous creation stories it will be eventually superseded indeed important
details have changed or been clarified just in the decade or two since i began teaching
big history when i started teaching for example the best date available for the origins of the
universe was somewhere vaguely between 10 and 20 billion years ago i have to say as a teacher
it's much more satisfying to be able to say to students 13.7 billion years ago rather than vaguely
between 10 and 20 billion years ago at that time no planets had been detected beyond our
solar system we still had no certainty that planets existed anywhere else in the universe
we now know that they do and genetic dating techniques were just beginning to revolutionize
the study of human evolution we've seen that those techniques have completely changed our sense
of the timing of human evolution especially exciting at the moment is the use of genetic
comparisons to track human migrations in recent millennia perhaps in 10 years time
if i'm still teaching this course we'll be able to describe these migrations in much more detail
even for times when we have no written records within decades the story i've told will also
undergo pretty significant renovation where well here is just a preliminary list of some of the
areas in the story where we might expect to see significant changes cosmologists will continue
to try to push back their understanding of the origins of the universe at the moment they're
within a fraction of a second of the origins at the moment of creation but they're going to push
the story back the holy grail will be a theory that explains why the universe popped out of nothing
or perhaps that explains what it popped out of at the moment it has to be said there are lots of
theories lots of ideas but the main problem is finding evidence that could test them cosmologists
will also look for a better understanding of the significance of dark matter and dark energy
now you may remember when we talked about star formation astronomers are pretty confident
astronomers and cosmologists are pretty confident that we know a lot about the universe
but they also know and this is a kind of deep dark secret of astronomy that there's a lot of stuff
out there that they don't understand anything about they know it's there because it's clearly
exerting a powerful gravitational pull and you can detect it by the movements of galaxies and
clusters of galaxies and the pull is powerful enough that this stuff may make up 95 percent of the
stuff the matter and the energy in the universe but we have no idea what it is now that's extremely
odd and if the problem is solved say within the next 10 or 20 years it could revolutionize our
understanding of cosmology and it could end up changing quite a few of the details of the story
as i've told it another area where there may be significant breakthroughs is the understanding
of the origins of life on earth now here it's probably as if we're very close and we're going
to just fill in some final pieces of a puzzle at present it looks as if we have most of the story
most of the jigsaw and we're just looking for the last pieces and the last pieces will probably
tell us how dna evolved and how the very elaborate and precise mechanism of reproduction
that's present in all living organisms today itself evolved when it comes to human evolution
anthropologists will seek new evidence on the origins of our own species the early stages
of our species history are still a bit fuzzy and what we need above all is more data from africa
more archaeological data above all so this story may be may get clearer particularly if archaeologists
do more work in africa where our species evolved another area where that could could add a lot
to our understanding of human evolution is a better understanding of how symbolic language
evolved and that will probably come from studies in neuropsychology uh understanding of the brain
and theory of language but that would contribute a lot to our understanding of how our species evolved
and why language played such a crucial role in our history but finally and this is a problem that
appears particularly clearly within a course on big history we need a better understanding of complexity
complexity we've seen is a is an issue that crosses all the disciplines touched on in this course
it's something that's approached in different ways within different disciplines mathematics
mathematicians approach it in one way sociologists approach it another way but what we really need
is an understanding of complexity that crosses all of these disciplines and that can simultaneously
illuminate our understanding of stars and of modern human societies and that can also show the many
links between these different types of complexity this is one of those fields where the fragmentation
of modern knowledge seems to be the main barrier plenty of ideas there what we really need to do
is bring them together into a coherent transdisciplinary understanding of what complexity
means across all these disciplines and that's an area where big history itself may have a
significant contribution to make so the story we've told has limitations nevertheless it's a story
we really need to know in fact telling it backwards as i've just done is a pretty good way of showing
how such stories can provide meaning they provide meaning by providing sort of maps
of time and space telling the story backwards shows how the modern the modern world of humanity
fits into the largest story of human history how human history in turn fits into the largest
story of the history of life and how all these stories fit into the largest story of all that
of the universe as a whole like the different parts of a russian matryoshka doll you remember
these dolls you have a a tiny doll in the center which is in a slightly larger doll in a slightly
larger doll and so on each of these stories is nested in a larger story and each of the stories
can help illuminate the stories both at larger and at smaller scales so each part of this story
can illuminate the other parts of it and in this way what these stories can do these collections
of stories is help each of us identify our place within time and space our place within the space
time of our universe and knowing where we fit in in other words mapping ourselves onto space time
already tells us a lot about who we are so this story even if we think of it simply as a sort of
mapping is full of meaning are there other meanings in it well scientists are for the most part
reluctant to look for the meanings of the story as they tell most scientists just want to get the
story right and let other people worry about its meaning but of course for ordinary human beings
for you and me it's impossible not to look for meaning indeed our need for meaning may be closely
related to our ability to think symbolically and to use symbolic language and to exchange ideas
with each other the very idea of meaning is symbolic and that means there's very good
reason to think that chimps however clever they may be don't seek out meaning in their universe
chimps just deal with the universe we try to seek out meaning now i've suggested that the map of
space and time provided by big history is the first form of meaning that this story offers
but what other forms of meaning can we find now here i'm sort of going to go a bit beyond what most
scientists would say and offer an answer that has to count as largely personal and it's based on
20 years of teaching big history and also responding to the questions of my students
so here's one possible meaning
think of the story i told in the last lecture of the eventual death by tedium of our universe
that story suggests something very interesting about the time in the universe's history when
we're alive what it suggests is that we live at perhaps the most exciting and interesting period
in the universe's history we live in a sort of spring time of our universe we live in a period
when there existed the perfect balance of energy space and stuff to make complex things such as
ourselves there's lots of energy in the universe there's also lots of space there's not too much
energy so you can create complex things eventually in the future it'll be impossible in the very
early universe everything was too violent to create complex things so so that's one form of
meaning it tells us about the period of the universe's history that we live in now here's
a second possible meaning lurking within the story we saw in a very early lecture that humans
seem tiny on the scales of space and time but we've also seen since that modern human society
may be in some sense the most complex thing we know indeed we've hinted at the possibility
that it may be the most complex thing to be found within our galaxy so how complex is complex are
we perhaps the most complex thing in the milky way strictly is modern human society the most
complex thing in the milky way now there's a powerful reason for saying this may be true
and the main reason is that despite searching for signs of extraterrestrial life for several
decades through the SETI project the search for extraterrestrial intelligence no signs have been
found if intelligent life or to be more precise life capable of collective learning is fairly
common in the universe then that is distinctly odd if intelligent civilizations that adapt
through collective learning are common there ought to be many perhaps millions in our galaxy
and lots of them in our part of the galaxy and surely many of them are likely to be much more
sophisticated than us with much more powerful means of communication and transmission of
signals for example yet our civilization is already pumping episodes of I love Lucy out into
the cosmos if we're already doing it we should expect that at least some of the others would
be indiscreet enough to have been pumping similar signals out into space for much longer and in
much greater quantities but so far we haven't picked up a thing zilch so that may suggest that
we are alone we represent a sort of pinnacle of complexity so does modern human society this
astonishing product of just the last few centuries in our corner of the universe represent perhaps
the most complex thing in our part of the galaxy or in the galaxy as a whole well if so it makes us
rather interesting and here's a third possible meaning within the story we've seen
we're not just the most complex things we know of so far we're also the only creatures we know of
that are capable of seeking meaning and purpose in the universe of looking for meaning in the
scientific view of the universe we've seen there is no deity and no conscious creator
and that means that we become the universe's bearers of conscious purpose and meaning
modern science rejects the idea of a creator deity or deities so it's left with the vision of
a universe constructed by blind natural laws that when repeated over and over again billions of
times can slowly construct very complex and interesting things but it's all done without
purpose just because that's the way things are now this is an astonishing image of the
universe itself and for many people it's it's it's also a quite satisfying one but there's
something even more astonishing about it out of these apparently blind algorithmic processes
repeated billions of times over billions of years there has emerged at least once in the universe
a group of beings that do have a sense of purpose and do want a sense of meaning indeed
beings that have the astonishing ability to figure out how and when the universe was created
we can easily take it for granted but if you think about it it's an astonishing achievement
these are beings who can construct a history of the entire universe so we are in a sense the
eyes and ears of the universe its way of knowing itself and that's where we'll end
I hope you've enjoyed this telling of our modern creation story our modern scientific creation
story and I hope you will want to encourage others to become acquainted with it if they're young
enough they may be the ones who will eventually help construct a new and perhaps better story
