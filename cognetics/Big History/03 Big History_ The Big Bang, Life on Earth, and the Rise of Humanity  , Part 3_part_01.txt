we saw as a mechanism that could stimulate growth and that's the expansion of exchange networks
we saw that as exchange networks developed for example through the silk roads they could encourage
the exchange of technologies ideas innovations of various kinds but they could also stimulate the
spread of disease and this could take catastrophic forms so here too we have a structural feature
of agrarian civilizations that had a contradictory impact on growth rates here's how it worked
here's how it worked William McNeill explored this aspect of Eurasian history in his wonderful
study plagues and peoples he showed that as exchange networks expanded there would come a
point where regions which had previously had very little contact would have enough contact
that they would start swapping disease vectors now once this happens if diseases move into areas
where people have no immunities the results can be catastrophic a disease which is not terribly
dangerous amongst populations used to it can be like a plague in another region so what he showed
is that as Eurasia began to get more integrated you get more and more of these exchanges of diseases
indeed he argues that one component in the demographic and political decline of both the
roman and han empires about 1500 years ago may have been precisely the exchange of diseases
between these two regions as contacts between them became more common as he points out the
Mediterranean region and China being at the edges of Eurasia were more likely to have populations
that lacked immunities to diseases from other parts of Eurasia so this may be why when smallpox
for example arrives in the Byzantine Empire it can be so catastrophic in its effects
so by 2000 years ago there was increasing evidence of diseases such as smallpox and
eventually the bubonic plague spreading across Eurasia as the silk roads flourished and eventually
the black death may have spread in a similar way from the far east to the western end of Eurasia
in the 14th century so that's a second mechanism both the disease environment of cities and the
exchanges of diseases through exchange networks could dampen population growth by causing periodic
or in the case of cities quite regular decimations of populations now here's the third mechanism
they'll call it ecological overreach or over exploitation we've seen that humans
are brilliant at finding new ways of exploiting their environments what we are not so good at
is making sure that in applying these new methods we don't undermine the environments on which we
depend time and again agrarian civilizations overreach they over exploited their natural resources
to the point where entire civilizations collapsed one of the most spectacular examples comes from
the population history of Mesopotamia estimates of population in Mesopotamia over 7 000 years show
two periods of sudden decline we've already mentioned the sudden collapse at the end of the
third millennium early in the second millennium BCE which was almost certainly caused by over
irrigation which led to salination and declining harvests Sumerian civilization collapsed and the
region's center of gravity shifted permanently to the north according to one estimate Mesopotamian
populations fell from about 630 000 in 1900 BCE to about 270 000 by 1600 BC that's more than 50
percent and they wouldn't rise again for at least a millennium then the same patterns repeated again
new forms of irrigation are developed including new devices for lifting water they allow populations
to build up again and then in the early centuries of islamic civilization while populations are
built up then a few centuries later early in the second millennium CE once more you have a collapse
so ecological overreach as a third crucial way in which agrarian civilizations could dampen growth
now i want to ask what is the impact of these checks to growth and we'll see that it's profound
and it explains one of the most striking and common structural features of agrarian civilizations
and i'm going to call that feature Malthusian cycles a very distinctive pattern of evolution
and change let me explain what i mean these and other factors that checked growth
functioned alongside the positive feedback cycles that drove growth
so you have positive feedback cycles that encourage growth but you also have what we can call
negative feedback cycles and it's this balance between the two that shape the fundamental
rhythms of historical change throughout the later agrarian era let me remind you what a negative
feedback cycle is a positive feedback cycle is a cycle of causation in which one cause encourages
another which in cause encourages a third and round the circle so positive feedback cycles
lead to runaway change very rapid change a negative feedback cycle is the opposite the
the classic model is a thermostat in a heating system the heating system works the thermostat
eventually is triggered it switches off the heating system the temperature cools down again it reaches
a point where the heating system is switched on again and so on so negative feedback cycles
tend to dampen down growth they limit change they lead to stability
a typical negative feedback cycle in agrarian civilizations would begin with innovations
that stimulated population growth these in turn would stimulate growth in other sectors
they might stimulate commerce urbanization as more and more people became wealthy they might
start funding the arts new buildings and so on so you see growth in many sectors of society
eventually though populations begin to press against ecological constraints
shortages appear there's growing evidence of malnutrition as more and more peasants don't
have quite enough to feed themselves this encourages disease you very often find states begin to fight
increasingly or warlords over scarce resources and finally through warfare disease or famine
populations crash if you graph the populations of major regions of Eurasia say Europe China and
India over 2000 years you can see these rhythms very very clearly they are rhythms of rise and fall
but they're on a long-term trend that is rising now this rhythm the Malthusian cycle dominates
the history of the later agrarian era do you remember Malthus by the way we last met him as
one of the inspirers of Darwin's idea of natural selection he was also as we saw then one of the
pioneers of the science of demography that's the study of the evolution of populations
and one of Malthus's central ideas was that the capacity of societies to reproduce
and he's thinking here of both human and animal societies would always be greater than their
capacity to innovate or to find new resources eventually he argued population growth would
always overtake growth in resources and there would be a crash now this is a pretty good description
of the characteristic rhythms of agrarian civilizations that's why it's fitting to describe
these typical cycles of agrarian civilizations as Malthusian the economic historian Robert Lopez
has described these cycles as an alternation of crest trough and crest that can be observed
not only in the economic field but in almost every aspect of life literature and art philosophy and
thought he writes politics and law were also affected though not all to the same extent
and the great French historian Leroy Ladurie one of the great historians of the Annales school
who wrote a wonderful account of population rises and falls in the south of France over many
centuries writes of these cycles that they were like the respiration the in breaths and out breaths
of an entire social structure so Malthus's mechanism what Malthus actually said by the way
was that populations increased geometrically by multiplication whereas resources increased
arithmetically by addition and this is why population would always outstrip resources
so this is the key mechanism now what's the explanation for it why over and over again
in agrarian civilizations do we see the same Malthusian cycles the explanation in in fact
is very simple indeed and it takes us right to the heart of the issue the nature and rate of
innovation in agrarian civilizations the fact that there was innovation in this era but never
quite enough to keep pace with population growth is what explains the persistence of this depressing
rhythm over several millennia in other words the Malthusian cycle must be explained fundamentally
by the fact that innovation existed in the agrarian era but it was never quite fast enough
to keep up with population growth and that's why we get these periodic crashes so that's the
explanation for Malthusian cycles that dominate the history of the later agrarian era and that
create this sense of long-term cycles of rise and fall even beyond the rise and fall of particular
rulers such as Ozymandias so what we've seen is that some of the same factors that stimulated
growth in agrarian civilizations including the functioning of tribute-taking states the role
of cities and the expansion of exchange networks could also stifle innovation and growth or they
could cut population growth and in combination this balance of forces between factors encouraging
growth and factors limiting growth explains why eventually each phase of expansion ended in collapse
now in the last three lectures we've concentrated on Afro-Eurasia on how agrarian civilizations
worked in Afro-Eurasia now we need to ask how typical was the history of the Afro-Eurasian zone
of humanity as a whole how typical of the rest of the world and to answer that question we're going
to shift our focus to the other three world zones the Australasian Pacific and American World
Zones and find out what was happening there thank you
lecture 36 comparing the world zones
we often take the geography of our earth for granted but in this course we've seen that the
earth's geography too has a history like the universe like the planet like life on earth like
human beings and we saw that about 200 million years ago most of the earth's continents were
joined together in a huge supercontinent pangia that ran from north to south that's the supercontinent
that Wagner proposed must have existed at some time it's worth asking the question how different
would human history have been if all humans had lived throughout their history on the single continent
of pangia and one difference is surely that once humans had started constructing large and powerful
agrarian civilizations however long it took and wherever it happened on pangia all those civilizations
would eventually have contacted each other as there were no seas to separate them many of the
processes of global history would have been similar to some of the processes we've seen
in the history of afro-eurasia human history would have taken place on a single stage but our world
is very different we happen to live in an era in which continents are separated by huge seas
so that as a matter of fact human history took place on a number of quite separate stages which
i've called the world zones so we spent several lectures looking at what happened in afro-eurasia
from our combination spaceship time capsule orbiting the earth now we need to ask questions
about the earth as a whole were similar changes occurring elsewhere how typical was afro-eurasia
did agrarian civilization expand elsewhere as well did states become more powerful
did exchange networks expand linking different regions into large world systems
is the evidence of the innovation or of malphusian cycles if there were differences between the zones
then to what extent and in what ways were those differences shaped by the different
geographies of each world zone so what we do now is we try to look at the other world zones
and get some feeling for how different the trajectories of human history were in each
zone and some of the reasons why they might have been different the comparison between these regions
between the various world zones is important for two main reasons the first is that the differences
really mattered we'll see that they they mattered most and most obviously during the last 500 years
when at last the world zones were joined the history of each of the world zones since that time
has been very much shaped by the trajectory of history in that zone before the unification of
the world so these differences really mattered but secondly there's the theoretical point that
we've touched on already if we find important similarities between the zones despite the lack
of significant contacts between them then these may hint at some deep patterns in human history as a
whole if we find just random variation if we find that the stories of each world zones are completely
different then we shouldn't be looking for any large directional trajectories for human history
so that's the crucial question behind all of this as jarrod diamond has suggested the contingent
fact that we evolved in an era when the world's continental plates were scattered across the
earth's surface has set up a series of revealing natural experiments as he calls them for it suggests
how human history could evolve from different starting points let me quote jarrod diamond on
this and this is from his bestseller guns germs and steel he writes well neither astronomers
studying galaxy formation nor human historians can manipulate their systems in a controlled
laboratory experiment they both can take advantage of natural experiments by comparing systems
different in the presence or absence or in the strong or weak effect of some putative
causative factor for example cultural anthropologists unable to provide human groups
experimentally with varying resource abundances i mean what he's saying here is you can't simply
you know take human groups put them in a lab give them certain conditions like
rats and then see what happens that's impossible the fact that you can't do this means we can still
study long-term effects of resource abundance on human societies by comparing for example recent
Polynesian populations living on islands differing naturally in resource abundance
so we can't deal with human history experimentally what we can do is look for natural experiments
