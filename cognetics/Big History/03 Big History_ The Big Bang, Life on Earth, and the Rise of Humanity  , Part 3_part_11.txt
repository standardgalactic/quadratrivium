more than half and India and China are mere 4 percent of course by 1950 most of that figure of
production for the Atlantic is now coming from the USA of course I need to add that that's not by
any means the end of the story after 1950 the tide will begin to turn again and by the middle of the
21st century India and China will almost certainly have re-established themselves as major economic
powers but that's a story for the future okay that's that's a sort of statistical picture of some
of the very large changes that we see between 1700 and 1900 now I want to focus on one particular
area so we can look at the moment of breakthrough more carefully and that area is Britain
this is where we can see the breakthrough to modernity most clearly so just as we concentrated on
Mesopotamia when discussing the appearance of agriculture and again when we discuss the appearance
of the first tribute taking states so now we're going to focus on Britain many historians have
argued that Britain was the first country to experience the sustained growth rates that are
typical of the modern revolution Patrick O'Brien for example writes and I quote between 1750
and 1850 the long-term rate of growth of the British economy became historically unique
and internationally remarkable now I should add that eventually other economies would
exceed these rates of growth but in the middle of the 19th century no other country throughout
human history had matched these rates of growth notice to understand how what form the breakthrough
took it may help to think of three related revolutions which in combination transformed
Britain in the 18th and early 19th centuries the first of these revolutions was the revolution in
social structure and what it did was to create a society that was more highly commercialized
and in the language we've used earlier more capitalistic entrepreneurs played a more important
role wage earning played a more important role in that society so that's the first change a change
in social structure the second was a revolutionary transformation of British agriculture and agriculture
let me remind you is the largest sector of the economy of all agrarian era economies so here
we're talking about a transformation of the largest most fundamental sector of the British economy
in the 17th and 18th centuries and the third change we'll look at is a transformation in
industrial production so let's begin with changes in social structure we've seen that by 1700
Britain was by many measures one of the most capitalistic societies on earth about half
of its population according to the figures of Gregory King were dependent mainly on wages
so instead of being a society where most of the population were small farmers small peasants
here we have a society in which at least half of the population is dependent on wages and we've
seen that its elite groups too are very highly dependent on commerce of various kinds it was
also one of the best connected regions in the world being at the center of global exchange networks
and it was in control of a modest but rapidly growing overseas empire
and it had a government that valued these assets and supported commerce
now the model I proposed in an earlier lecture suggested in such an environment with a capitalistic
social structure flourishing commerce contacts with the global world system and supportive
governments innovation ought to have accelerated and it ought to have accelerated as entrepreneurs
began to compete to raise output as markets expanded with increasing numbers of wage earners
who had to purchase their food clothing and other needs with cash now does this work does this sort
of social structure really generate innovation well in in Britain in the 18th century it certainly
does let's begin with the transformation of the agricultural sector so that's the change in social
structure that we've seen already now how does it affect agriculture agriculture was the fundamentally
economic sector in all agrarian societies productivity first began to rise in this sector
from the 17th century now we've seen that by 1700 many English peasants had become in effect wage
earners that change itself had momentous implications for economic development as this rapidly growing
class of impoverished peasants competed for employment what they provided was a large supply
of cheap labor so as Britain's peasantry is slowly destroyed what what employers get
is an increasing amount of cheap labor secondly this growing class of wage earners
who from their own perspective might have thought of themselves as failed peasants
from an employer's perspective or an entrepreneur's perspective provide a rapidly growing market
for basic consumer goods such as food and textiles traditional peasants remember are growing
food for themselves they are sometimes even making their own textiles they're not so dependent on
the market but wage earners have to buy most of what they use on the market so here's a rapidly
growing market for basic consumer goods now something also happens to the nature of land
ownership increasingly the land vacated by peasants was taken over by large landowners
who farmed it for profit in Britain this transfer of land from small pockets of peasant farming
to much larger areas farmed more commercially was dominated by the idea of enclosures from
actually from as early as the 16th century acts of parliament in area after area town by town
would allow local landlords to buy up consolidated plots of land and annul traditional rights of
use on that land so what they allowed was the emergence of full private property over large
consolidated blocks of land and landowners took over traditional plots of land that once
had been divided into small peasant plots increasingly rapidly in the 18th century
during the enclosure movement they frequently planted hedges around these newly consolidated
blocks of land to mark them out clearly and that created much of the distinctive English
landscape we see today meanwhile on these large blocks of land they're now free to introduce
new techniques that could benefit from economies of scale that were unavailable to small peasant
farmers if you think about it agriculture or farming on large blocks of land is almost bound
to be a very different thing from farming on small blocks of land as in the traditional peasant way
this marks a crucial difference between two very different types of agriculture
if you farm a small plot as a peasant a lot of your farming is for subsistence and that means
you need to grow a variety of variety of plots and you have a small area of land it's hard to
introduce more advanced techniques if you grow on a large plot of land you're clearly not growing
for subsistence and this means you can grow you can focus on particular crops you can introduce
modern techniques and you can benefit from economies of scale if you're growing on large
plots of land almost inevitably you are a commercial farmer you're growing for profit
not for subsistence so this change in land ownership marks a fundamental transformation
in agriculture it marks the commercialization of agriculture and the appearance of an agriculture
dominated by the profit motive an entrepreneurial agriculture the process has been studied extremely
well in British economic history and here's just one illustration an English historian W. G.
Hoskins studied what the process meant in one village when Wigston Magna in Leicestershire
and he found in the 18th century an absolute transformation in the life of peasants
peasants whose forefathers had rarely needed to handle cash they really weren't involved in the
cash economy suddenly become wage earners they have to think about cash they have to count every
cent they have to think very hard about the value of their labor and he writes for Wigston Magna
the enclosure act of 1765 was a cataclysm small owner occupiers disappeared as a group within
about 60 years and they became instead rural laborers working for other people or framework knitters
are weaving in their own homes or paupers people right at the edges of society
now let's look at the farmers who took over the land farming for profit meant competing
with other producers and that meant increasing efficiency here's the mechanism Adam Smith saw
the drive of competitive markets increasing efficiency meant that English farmers began
to improve their farming usually with techniques that had known for many sent been known for many
centuries there's nothing much that's new about the actual techniques that were introduced
rather as in the early the early the agrarian revolution 10 000 years ago where the techniques
weren't new what was new was the way they were introduced on the scale on which they were introduced
and implemented so now there are increasing incentives for large farmers commercial farmers
to apply them on a large scale and farmers beginning begin raising soil fertility by
planting legumes for example rather than just by leaving land fellow this means you can keep
land in continuous cultivation much longer without destroying its fertility they improved
irrigation they bred better quality animals incidentally improvements in animal breeding
are part of the background to the growing interest in evolution of figures such as Darwin's grandfather
Erasmus Darwin they also used improved methods of planting and preparing the land one of the most
famous of the improvers Lord Townsend advocated the planting of turnips for which he became known
as turnip Townsend now the results of all of this was striking between 1700 and 1850
British agricultural output increased about three and a half times yet at the same time
the numbers employed in agriculture fell from about 61 percent to 29 percent of the population
now here's an entirely new phenomenon in human history for the first time in human history you
have a medium-sized country in which a minority of the population is feeding a majority now those
are the transformations in the agricultural sector now let's look at industry expanding internal
and foreign markets internal markets expanded remember as peasants more and more peasants
became wage earners and consumers and external markets expanded with the growth of empire and
international trade as well as a supportive government most of whose revenues now came
from commercial sources and a stable financial system which made cheap capital available remember
the Bank of England had been incorporated in 1694 all of these features encouraged investment
in manufacturing as well as in agriculture so they drew investment into manufacturing
in most agrarian societies textile production was by far the largest economic sector after
agriculture innovations in cotton spinning in this period reduced the time taken to spin 100
pounds of cotton from 50 000 hours to 300 hours in the late 18th century and stimulated the mechanization
of weaving and remember this is stimulated partly by the fact that the market for textiles is growing
very rapidly another crucial area of innovation which will turn out to be absolutely critical later
is coal a shortage of wood in britain encouraged greater use of coal that meant improving the
technologies used to pump water out of coal mines so that you could mine deeper and that meant pumps
a french inventor Dennis Papin had first demonstrated the potential of steam engines as
early as 1691 his engine used steam pressure to raise a cylinder after which the source of heat
was removed allowing atmospheric pressure to push the cylinder down again tomas nukeman introduced
an improved version in 1712 what this one did was spray cold water into the cylinder at the top of
the cycle to initiate the down stroke now in both these machines most of the thrust came from
atmospheric pressure the cylinders were then attached to a beam that worked a pump one of the
problems was that the rapid heating and cooling of the cylinder was extremely inefficient and
required lots of fuel so these pumps were only cost effective in mines close to abundant coal and
that's why their use didn't spread widely into other sectors of industry then in the 1760s james
what improved the efficiency of the steam engines that were traditionally used to pump out mines
what did he do what did two main things first he separated the condenser so that the cylinder
could remain permanently at high temperature and secondly more precise engineering of the cylinder
allowed him to use the force of expanding steam to drive the engine rather than simply the force
of atmospheric pressure now these changes greatly increase the efficiency and fuel economy of the
machine and they help explain its rapid adoption in different sectors of industry improved steam
engines made it economical for the first time to use coal to drive machines well away from the
coal fields and this encouraged the creation of large factories driven by steam power the next
transformative use of steam power was to put it on wheels early in the 19th century and what this
would do is to revolutionize land transportation and slash transportation costs the first steam
engine began operation on september the 27th 1825 in the county of durham and the first designed
for passengers as well as freight was the rocket designed by george stevensson we have a wonderful
description of it by the actress fanny kembal who described traveling on one of the first railways
in 1830 with george stevensson who incidentally had acquired his engineering skills operating
newcomen steam engines at a colliery in newcastle and here's fanny kembal's wonderful description
she she prides herself in not understanding the technology that's involved so it's a delightful
description we were introduced to the little engine which was to drag us along the rails she said
she for they make these curious little firehorses all mares consisted of a boiler a stove a small
platform a bench and behind the bench a barrel containing enough water to prevent her being
thirsty for 15 miles and the whole machine was not bigger than a common fire engine she goes
upon wheels which are her feet and are moved by bright steel legs called pistons these are propelled
by steam and in proportion as more steam is applied to the upper extremities the hip joints i suppose
