miles northeast of modern mexico city may have had a population of at least 100 000 people now
this is getting a huge huge this is a huge city they lived amongst colossal pyramids which still
survive today and archaeology has shown that teotihuacan also included migrants who came from
many other parts of mezzo-america and you can show this by the the distinct distinctive styles of
their buildings in different suburbs to the east in the yucatan peninsula the mayan civilization
flourished as well market relations and warfare seem to have linked all these areas of evolving
agrarian civilization into a large network of exchanges and warfare so it may be appropriate
to talk of a mezzo an evolving mezzo-american world system you'll remember the label world
system refers to large areas of agrarian civilization linked through trade and other
exchanges into into a large exchange network here's one just tiny illustration of the sort
of links between them in 378 we know an army from teotihuacan conquered tical in modern guatemala
one of the major cities of the maya and probably killed its king and installed a new dynasty
distinctive features of mezzo-american civilizations include religious beliefs that required the
letting of blood and calendrical systems that were of great religious and political significance
and were probably more accurate than any that were developed in afro-eurasia
i'd like to spend a little time talking about the maya and the reason is that the maya are
particularly interesting and particularly now since it's been possible to decipher their
writing system and the result is that the maya are now probably better known than any other
american civilization before 1500 mayan civilization emerged as early as about
1000 bce and it began to emerge that early in the lowland rainforests of the yucatan
peninsula in the region on the border between south mexico bellies and guatemala here villages
initially practiced forms of sweden agriculture but by the end of the first millennium you find
large temple complexes appearing in the region with pyramids large causeways and public squares
these are getting quite grand in the so-called classical period of mayan civilization in the
middle of the first millennium c e the maya seem to have been organized in a large number of
competing city states which may have linked with each other in complex and shifting alliance systems
here we have very strong echoes of sumer perhaps in the time of gilgamesh
eventually the maya developed remarkably accurate calendars their their calendar
had several different cycles one was a sacred year of 260 days that may have been linked to the
movements of venus and there's also a secularly year of 365 days and in addition to that a long
historical calendar the long count so in effect three overlapping calendars and as in china the
calendars seem to have had great political significance it seems that that power figures in
this region were extremely concerned that things happen on auspicious auspicious states so the
calendars were extremely important political tools the maya also developed a hieroglyphic script
it appears to have evolved in conjunction with the development of the calendar and it was used
from the start to record political and religious events and to keep records of royal lineages so
as this gets deciphered we can begin to construct in considerable detail the political history
of the maya in the classical era now note that here writing doesn't appear to evolve from the
sort of accounting systems that we saw in sumer nevertheless the process seems to have been
quite similar in several ways it did evolve from the task of keeping track of something in this case
what was being kept track of was dates that had ritual significance and there's another striking
similarity with the sumerian cuneiform and that's the use of the rebus principle we've already
encountered this in looking at sumerian cuneiform you remember the principle just as in english for
example i could use a picture of an eye to represent the personal pronoun i so in mayan the symbol of
a torch which sounded like the word for torch sounded like tar sounded the same as and could
be used to represent the preposition at which was also tar in mayan so you can sound use the picture
of a torch to represent something much more abstract a preposition at so here we see some
quite striking similarities in the evolution of language though as always of written language
though as always we also see interesting differences okay the decline of mayan civilization
is quite striking mayan civilization declined rapidly in the eighth and ninth centuries CE
the causes are still hotly debated but it seems almost certain that ecological collapse played a
very significant role and all the various theories about collapse suggest to me very
powerfully that what we're looking at is a typical malthusian collapse in which ecological factors
increasing military competition overpopulation perhaps breakdowns of political order all play
a similar similar role so here we have the classic pattern of societies under stress overpopulation
larger mayans mayan cities may have had populations in some cases of as many as 120,000 people
and these are based on forest soils which aren't that fertile unless you farm them very very
carefully using elaborate techniques such as terracing many more lived in the surrounding
settlements so population densities were very very high in the mayan heartland around the
city of tikal in this region it's been estimated that population densities may have been greater
in 800 than they are today now this sort of overpopulation particularly if agriculture is not
quite fertile enough to support populations can very easily lead to conflicts overland
to sustained warfare between neighboring city states eventually it can lead to a breakdown of
agricultural systems particularly if you need to maintain irrigation structures or in this case
probably terraced agricultural on hillsides or the building of reservoirs and eventual collapse
so this whole complex in some ways looks very familiar indeed bringing together
climatic problems ecological overreach political overreach overpopulation
and growing political crisis here's a quotation from a scholar of this region that captures this
well co writes the classic maya population of the southern lowlands had probably increased
beyond the carrying capacity of the land no matter what system of agriculture was in use
there is mounting evidence for massive deforestation and erosion throughout the central area only
alleviated in a few favorable zones by dry slope terracing in short overpopulation and environmental
degradation had advanced to a degree only matched by what is happening in many of the poorest
tropical countries today the maya apocalypse he writes for such it surely was surely had ecological
roots but this was not the end this was this was a malthusian collapse followed by a subsequent
malthusian revival mezzo-american civilizations would revive by 1492 when columbus reached the
caribbean there existed in central mexico a huge imperial civilization based on the capital city
of tenoc titlan now mexico city which was built built on lake tezcoco the aztec rulers of tenoc
titlan exacted tributes from neighboring regions and cities using pretty coercive methods they were
they were a very they had a very powerful army and by this time tenoc titlan was probably
one of the most magnificent cities in the world with nearby towns it may have had a population
of two million people now as it happens we have a wonderful description of it in the writings of
courtes lieutenant bernaldias who first saw it in 1519 so i'd love to quote from bernaldias
description of first seeing tenoc titlan next morning he writes we came to a broad causeway
and continued our march towards east apalapa tenoc titlan was built on lake tezcoco so it was built
out on the lake and this is this is the meaning of the of the causeways when we saw all those
cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land and that straight and
level causeway leading to mexico tenoc titlan we were astounded these great towns and buildings
rising from the water all made of stone seemed like an enchanted vision from the tale of amades
indeed some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream it was all so wonderful
that i do not know how to describe this first glimpse of things never heard of seen or dreamed
of before it's it's a lovely description of some of the astonishment felt when the different world
zones came together and people learned of the existence of civilizations whole populations
they'd never known of before okay now let's move on to the andes region in the andes region
agrarian civilizations evolved in modern ecuador peru and chile and also parts of modern bolivia
the main crops here were maize potatoes and quinoa a plant grown mainly for its edible seeds
and the main animal domesticates were llama alpaca and guinea pig along the pacific coast
substantial communities emerged in the second millennium bce so here as in mezzo america
the critical period in which agrarian civilizations are being built up seems to be the second
millennium bce here populations build irrigation systems and ceremonial pyramids now by now you'll
be alert to the fact that this ought to be telling us that we're beginning to see the appearance of
at the very least quite powerful chieftains even if we're not yet talking about agrarian civilizations
the first are sancipian agrarian civilizations and that's really a way of ducking the question of
whether they exactly are or not emerge in the first millennium bce the crucial basis for agrarian
civilizations in this area according to a fairly broad consensus amongst anthropologists
is the ability of emerging states to exploit different ecological zones that extended from
the coast with its arid climates and its rich fishing to the mountain highlands with their
crops of peanuts potatoes cotton and beans towns began to appear some of them with populations of
more than 10 000 each and large public buildings so this is looking a bit like olmec civilizational
olmec chieftains a millennium later the moche state centered near the coast of northern peru
integrated highland and lowland regions of northern peru it organized irrigation
it managed exchanges between the coast and the highland regions using human human porters
lama and alpaca images carved images show evidence of class hierarchies and of warfare
once again as we've seen over and over again once again we find these ubiquitous pictures
of rulers inspecting prisoners and apparently executing at least some of them and we also see
lots of evidence of organized labor at the moche state collapsed sometime in the seventh
century c e this is at about the same time as the maya after a series of spectacular natural
disasters ruined irrigation systems well el el nino systems ruined the rich anchovy fisheries of
the shore and once again it's it's very tempting to think that what we're dealing with here is a
regulation malthusian crisis no writing is known from these early states however by 1500 c e are
a later imperial power the inka had developed a system of communication or accounting based on
knotted strings or kipu the kipu system is slowly being deciphered and what's very clear is you can
use it to convey quite a lot of information of an accounting type but also political
information about instructions to officials for example so this worked pretty well for politics
and accounting we have no evidence that it was still that it was rich enough to work well for
the recording of history or literature but clearly it's evolving in that direction now
were these two major agrarian zones of agrarian civilization these these two major american
zones linked we've seen that in afro-eurasia by the time of marco polo there are quite substantial
exchanges of of people of trade of religions even of diseases right across the eurasian
landmass from china to the mediterranean so what's the evidence in the americas well there
was certainly some evidence of of diffusion and contact between these two zones maize appears to
have diffused to south america from mezzo america by about 2000 b c e and there's one more sign that
there were exchanges going on though they're below the radar of the historians when the spanish arrived
some of the diseases they brought with them appeared to have reached peru
before any of their soldiers did so there were clearly contacts of some kind nevertheless
these contacts were much less intense than those that linked different regions of afro-eurasia
through the silk roads so here we have an area of agrarian civilization or two areas of agrarian
civilization that cover less territory include less populations than those of afro-eurasia but
they're also less interlinked than those of afro-eurasia and one of the crucial reasons may be that with
few animal domesticates transportation systems were less developed in the americas here humans
were the primary beasts of of burden and this is a reminder incidentally once again of how
important the secondary products revolution was in eurasia now let's try and summarize some of this
discussion and try and get a feeling for some of the similarities and differences between the
histories of agrarian civilizations in afro-eurasia and the americas the timing of major subordinate
thresholds is clearly different in the americas similar phenomena appeared but with a considerable
time lag and roughly speaking we can never even get a feeling for what that time lag was judging
by what we know of the political evolution of the americas it was about 3000 years now i don't
want to make too much of this this is not a this is again a very very rough date but here's the
reason for saying that we've seen that the city of montelban perhaps the first real city state in
the americas emerged late in the first millennium bce you'll remember that this is some 3000 years
after the first state structures had appeared in afro-eurasia in sumer similarly by 1500
by 1500 ce much larger imperial structures had appeared such as those of the inca or the asthec
