set up by the fact that human history has taken place in a number of different environments and
we can see what happens so if we find no significant similarities as we've seen
we might conclude that human history is an entirely contingent process it's driven
by accidents of geography and the unpredictable choices of millions of individuals but if we
find significant similarities we may have to conclude that some powerful general forces
have steered human history down certain tracks despite the play of contingency
let's look at each of these zones and try and tease out some of the large general features
that shaped its history and its geography let's begin with how history began in each zone and
we'll see that human history seems to begin in rather different ways in each of these zones
now for some of this i'm going to be collecting information some of which we've already encountered
in earlier lectures on the early history of the various world zones but i want to put it all
together so we can see the contrasts quite clearly between them okay first the afro-uration zone and
just in summary the afro-uration zone was the oldest it was the largest in terms of land mass
and it was most varied of the world zones and it played a dominant role in world history
it was here that human history began some 200 000 years ago because our species evolved in Africa
and we've looked at the afro-uration zone now let's go on to a second zone the australian zone
as i've called it that was the second to be settled by human beings the ice age continent of Sahul
included modern Australia Papua New Guinea and Tasmania it was unified because lower sea levels
at the height of the last ice age filled the bridges between these areas so it was a single
land mass it was smaller in area much smaller than afro-uracia and smaller than the americas
and it was also for the most part less diverse with relatively arid climates and flat old
ancient landscapes with the exception of the northern rim that eventually would form modern
Papua New Guinea its soils for the most part were old and relatively infertile
Sahul had once been part of the supercontinent of gondwana land you'll remember that when
pangia broke up it broke first into two huge supercontinents laurasia and gondwana land and
gondwana land was in the south uh sahul had been part of gondwana land and it inherited the marsupial
fauna of gondwana land but it had separated from gondwana land almost 100 million years ago so its
plant life and animal life by this time were really quite distinctive had it had a very unique
flora and fauna the human history of sahul began 40 to 50 000 years ago during the last ice age
when it was still a single continent we saw that to reach sahul from outer eurasia humans had to cross
at least 50 to 60 kilometers of open sea even at the height of the last ice age
we now have some idea of where these humans came from excavations at jeremoly cave in east
timore by susan o'connor have shown that humans probably lived here about 40 000 years ago
the remains of tuner at these sites suggest that they were fishing and they were fishing quite well
away from the shores and that's a powerful hint that they had quite significant sea going skills
and sea craft that could go some way offshore
we saw that no other large mammal made the crossing to sahul so it provides very clear evidence of our
ancestors unique ecological adaptability and once they arrived they had to keep adapting
because they had to adapt to sahul's almost entirely novel flora and fauna
the encounter between newly arrived humans and indigenous species that had no experience of humans
and no understanding of how dangerous they could be may help explain the massive extent
of the die-off of large mammals in sahul in the millennia after the arrival of humans
megafaunal extinctions and the widespread use of fire stick farming suggests that even in australia
where agriculture did not appear before modern times humans nevertheless had a significant
impact on their environments and this is one of the reasons for thinking that this very general
trajectory that i've talked about driven by collective learning of a capacity to spread
into new environments is something that we can see very clearly certainly in the australian world
zone even if it doesn't take quite the same forms as elsewhere now let's look at the americas
and the beginnings of history in the americas the american world zone formed actually quite
recently it formed about three million years ago when a large fragment of loratia that fragment
we now call refer to as north america touched a large fragment of gondola land that we now
refer to as south america and they joined at the isthmus of panama creating a single united world
zone as a result this zone uniquely stretches from gondola land to loratia from the Antarctic to the
arctic and it spans all major ecological and climatic zones jared diamond has pointed out that
this north south orientation means that when humans arrived they found that
most long distance migrations would lead them into new and unfamiliar climatic zones
now his point is that this is very different from afro-eurasia afro-eurasia certainly the
uration part of it is sort of oriented east west the americas are oriented north south
and the significance for early humans is this if you're migrating over long distances in afro
eurasia a lot of those migrations can be done within a single climate zone and that tends to
minimize the amount of change you need to introduce climates at least change even don't change too
much even if topologies may so his point is that it was by and large easier to migrate over large
distances in afro-eurasia in the americas in contrast the major migrations north and south
were constantly taking you into new climatic zones so the amount of adaptation that had to be
done to migrate through the americas was significantly greater than in afro-eurasia and he's argued
that this difference in geographical orientation may have played a fundamental role in the history
of the americas here's how he puts it axis orientations affected the rate of spread of
crops and livestock and possibly also of writing wheels and other inventions this basic feature
of geography therefore contributed heavily to the very different experiences of native americans
africans and urations in the last 500 years it's at least an intriguing idea and it's
possible that this played a role in perhaps slowing down american migrations
through the americas though i have to say there's also counter evidence suggesting that
despite these difficulties americans travel through the early inhabitants of america travel
from north to south quite quickly we've seen that humans entered the americas from east
syberia they entered either across the bering straits land bridge which was exposed during the
last ice age or perhaps by short sea voyages around the coastline around the coastline from
eastern syberia around the bering straits past alaska and down to the northwest coast of north
america humans had certainly arrived by 13 000 years ago and genetic evidence hints that or at
least to put it more precisely there are those who've argued that there are genetic hints that
humans may have arrived as early as 30 000 years ago genetic evidence from some communities in
central america has been used to claim that these communities or their ancestors left syberia at
least 20 000 and possibly 40 000 years ago but as we've seen the consensus at the moment is that
humans had certainly arrived by 13 000 years ago and there's no hard evidence yet of earlier
arrivals now here as in sahul the entry of humans into unfamiliar territory unfamiliar terrain
facing new flora new fauna and the fact that local animals had no understanding of our species
may help explain the massive megafaunal extinctions that occurred here too
roughly at the time that humans first arrived if humans did indeed contribute to these extinctions
we must conclude that they had a substantial impact on their environments even before the
appearance of agriculture at jarrod diamond has also pointed out that the removal of these
species and in the americas they included for example the horse a species that evolved in
the americas and was then driven to extinction they also included many species of large camlids
and he argues that this may have had a very significant impact on the history of america
of the americas above all what it meant was that here in the americas there could be no
real equivalent of the secondary products revolution that had such an impact on communications
on the spread of plough agriculture on the emergence of pastoral nomadism in afro-eurasia
so that's a sketch of the very early history of the american zone now the pacific zone
the pacific world zone actually was the largest of all the world zones it covers most of the
pacific ocean the largest mass of water on earth nevertheless its actual land area was the smallest
because it formed a huge island archipelago so that communities were separated by hundreds or
thousands of miles of open sea each island had distinctive features and therefore a
distinctive history so here you get a wonderful natural experiment of the kind that jarrod diamond
described earlier and it's it's an experiment that he analyzes very very carefully in his book
collapse which is about how natural conditions may make it easier or harder for human societies
to live sustainably in a particular environment as he's shown the size fertility
and remoteness of each island could have a very powerful impact on its history
affecting its populations population densities and the stability of the societies that were created
some islands for example Easter Island or Rapa Nui which we will discuss later in this course
was so small that they required very delicate handling and any ecological overreach any failure
to maintain local resources could easily prove catastrophic the pacific world zone and this
is one of the most striking distinctive features of this zone apart from the fact that it was an
archipelago was not occupied until the later agrarian era and it was settled by migrants who
brought knowledge of farming and superb navigational skills in other words this world zone bypassed
the Paleolithic era entirely and it began its history with its own equivalent of the early
agrarian era the migrations that settled first Melanesia the islands of the east of Papua New
Guinea and then Polynesia the islands further to the west in the Pacific Ocean count as a
wonderful counterpart of the migrations of the Paleolithic era they're a sign of the astonishing
capacity of humans to seek out and explore new environments and find distinctive ways of exploiting
them so where did the migrants come from for a long time it was assumed that the pacific islands
had largely been settled from the americas this was the basic assumption that underlay Thor
Heyerdahl's famous expedition on the Contiki in 1947 you may remember that he built a raft
modeled on types of raft you could find in the pacific and he sailed it with a crew from Peru
to the Tuamotu islands but since he did that and what he did of course was to prove that it was
possible but since that time a large body of evidence has shown that the migrations actually
took place in the opposite direction from Asia and the west some of the crucial evidence can
includes the similarity of the austronesian languages of Melanesia and Polynesia to languages of
southeast Asia and the spread of a distinctive type of pottery known as Lapita where as a result of
these migrations and this evidence has shown that the pacific islands were settled in fact by
people whose ancestors probably came ultimately from the mainland of southeast Asia the islands of
Melanesia to the east of Papua New Guinea reaching as far as Fiji and Tonga were settled over quite
a large period of time the Solomon Islands may have been settled by as early as 35 000 BCE but
remota islands in Melanesia were settled as late as 1000 BCE 3000 years ago and the migrants who
arrived there traveled in huge ocean going double hulled canoes that and they carried with them
crops that included taro, yam, breadfruit, coconuts and sugarcane and they also carried
domesticated animals with them in particular chickens dogs and pigs and it's very likely that
rats traveled with them as hitchhikers the remota islands of eastern Polynesia were mostly settled
during the first millennium CE New Zealand one of the last regions to be settled was probably
colonized between 1000 and 1200 CE we now know quite a lot about how these migrations were conducted
and we know this a lot of this comes from experimental archaeology which is involved
recreating and sailing Polynesian ships and recovering some of the skills of their navigators
through interviews with surviving navigators and their families and what this evidence has shown
is that these astonishing migrations were the result of systematic well-prepared journeys of
exploration in ships that could carry sometimes as many as 200 people along with the with samples
of their crops and chicken and pigs and they were guided by navigators who sometimes memorized maps
of the stars or used special reed maps of Polynesia and could tell from signs such as subtle shifts
in currents or the presence of seabirds where to expect landfall one of the most remarkable
aspects of this is that when clouds obscure the skies navigators claim to be able to hunker down
within the ships close their eyes and feel from the subtler movements of the ship and the wind
where there might be land okay that's a sketch of the early history of these zones now let's talk
briefly about how the agricultural revolution played out in each of these zones let's begin with
the Australasian zone and it may seem at first as if there's not that much to be said about the
Australasian zone but I think in fact there may be quite a lot to be said agriculture appeared early
in Sahul remember but only in the far north in modern Papua New Guinea in Papua New Guinea
