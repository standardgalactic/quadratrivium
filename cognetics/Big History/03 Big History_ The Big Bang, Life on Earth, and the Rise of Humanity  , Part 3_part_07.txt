of the population have to concern themselves with productivity all the time so the spread of
capitalism ought to encourage innovation driver three is the sudden expansion in the size of
exchange networks and therefore of collective learning the coming together of the four world
zones from the 16th century stimulated commerce and capitalism by simply expanding the scale
and intensity and variety of entrepreneurial activity and information exchanges throughout the
world and we'll see that this sudden rearrangement of global networks of exchange also shifted the
centers of wealth and power in the world away from their traditional centers in afro-eurasia
in the mediterranean mesopotamian persian indian and chinese zones to a region that had previously
been completely marginal the atlantic seaboard that would prove to be one of the most radical of
all the changes associated with the modern revolution so now let's take these crucial
drivers of innovation and see if we can use them to explain the slow build-up to the critical moment
at which modernity really took off in 1700 thank you
lecture 39 the medieval malthusian cycle 500 to 1350
so when did the modern revolution begin when and how was the explosion of the modern revolution
ignited what are the signs we should look for this is a question very similar to the one we've
asked about earlier thresholds such as the threshold leading to the appearance of human
beings or agriculture in the next two lectures i try to answer these questions to define and
identify the moment at which when the threshold was crossed and i'll do so using ideas sketched out
in the previous lecture what i'm going to do is to survey world history over roughly the last 1500
years through two malthusian cycles to see if we can detect elements of modernity falling into place
remember what we mean by malthusian cycles these are cycles in which population growth
may initially stimulate growth in other sectors of society economy even culture or the expansion
of political systems but eventually population growth outstrips growth in resources and that
leads to an eventual collapse of populations of states and sometimes entire civilizations
and that's why we call it a cycle this lecture describes what i'll call the medieval malthusian
cycle it begins roughly in the in the middle of the first millennium about 500 ce this is not long
after the decline of the roman and han empires and it continues to about 1350 the time of the black
death the second cycle we'll look at in the next lecture i'll call the early modern malthusian cycle
that begins at the time of the black death about 1350 and lasts until about 1700 in this first
lecture as we follow the medieval malthusian cycle will focus almost entirely on afro-eurasia
which was the largest and most significant of the four world zones but it was also the region
that probably drove most change in the early stages of the modern revolution so here's our strategy
we're going to focus on one key aspect of modernity accelerating innovation because as i argued in
the last lecture this seems to be the key to understanding all other or at least most other
aspects of modernity consequently we're going to try and keep our eyes on three
crucial drivers of innovation three factors that might have led to an acceleration in rates of
innovation and let me remind you these three are commercialism that is to say the spread
of competitive markets and of entrepreneurial activity associated with markets secondly the
spread of capitalism and thirdly a rapid expansion in the extent of exchange networks
so we'll ask can we detect any evidence of an increase in the importance of these drivers of
innovation that might help explain an increase in rates of innovation and we'll also try and find
if we can see in this period any evidence that rates of innovation are beginning to rise
so we'll be asking did commercialism commercialization raise productivity by encouraging specialization
this is smithian growth we'll ask did entrepreneurial activity and wage earning the two key key features
of capitalism become more important and if so did they tend to accelerate innovation and third
and third we'll ask did exchange networks expand and if so did they stimulate commercial activity
and information exchanges the other thing we're going to look for is signs of a shift in wealth
and power to a new hub region around the atlantic remember the great powers that is to say the
major centers of both of wealth of urbanization of high culture and of political power during
most of the later agrarian era could be found around the Mediterranean in the north of the
Indian subcontinent and in China the great powers of the modern revolution so far and I have to say
this because this could change within a generation or two have been located in the atlantic region
and that was a region that was completely marginal to world history before the last millennium
so can we detect the beginnings of this shift in wealth and power from the traditional centers
of Eurasia to the atlantic region a region that was completely marginal before northwest Europe
remember was an area of barbarians even in the time of the roman empire the eastern seaboard
of the usa had even less connection with major centers of agrarian civilization
and finally there's one more thing we must keep an eye out for or at least remember during this
discussion and that is the idea of accumulation during the 4 000 years of the later agrarian era
despite malthusian fluctuations we saw that on a long trend populations increased markets expanded
and new technologies emerged in much of the world without this slow accumulation of skills and
resources and technologies and experience the modern revolution could not possibly have occurred so
this was the foundation for it all the slow accumulation of wealth populations technologies
and organizational skills during the later agrarian era that was the foundation
okay let's look at the medieval malthusian cycle which ran i remind you from about 500 c.e. that's
a largely symbolic date i mean somewhere in the middle of the first millennium to about 1350 c.e.
the time of the black death let's begin with population figures because malthusian crises
malthusian cycles rather are most easily seen as patterns of rise and form fall in population
now i'm going to have to ask you to upload into your imagination a sort of graph drawing machine
i'm going to give you the figures and see if you can mentally draw the graph it's not that
hard and it's a fairly simple graph you'll need first to place dates along the vertical axis so
let me give you the crucial dates here are the dates the first is 600 c.e. now that's two centuries
after the fall of the roman empire the second date is 1000 c.e. that's when the vikings set up a
colony in newfoundland that didn't last long but it's the first contact that we know of between
the oration zone and the americas in recent millennia that's the second date 1000 c.e.
the third is 1300 c.e. marco polo has just been released from a genoese jail where with a fellow
convict a writer of romances from pizza called rousticello he's just completed an account of
his travels to china that's 1300 c.e. and the fourth date is 1400 in meso america the mexica
from their city in what is now mexico city ten octetlan
were beginning to build the aztec empire so here are the data you need to add to the graph and
remember our four dates are 600 1000 1300 and 1400 european populations rose from about 22
millions in 600 to about 30 millions in 1000 to about 70 millions in 1300 and then they dropped
to about 52 millions in 1400 there's the malthusian downturn but if you look at this sequence of
figures as a whole you'll also see something else and that is that the long trend is still
arise even after the collapse populations in europe are larger than they were at the beginning of
the cycle so that's why i argued that malthusian cycles for the most part seem to have been cycles
on a rising trend now here are the figures for china 49 million in 600 c.e 56 million in 1000 c.e
83 million in 1300 c.e and 70 million in 1400 you can see the same pattern you can see the
malthusian downturn and you can also see the general trend which is towards increasing population
and finally the figures for the indian subcontinent and once again we're going to see the same thing
here are the figures 37 million in 600 c.e 40 in 1000 100 in 1300 and 74 in 1400
so that is a kind of graphic sketch of this medieval malthusian cycle
now let's look at some of the things that happened during the cycle
what commerce develops very rapidly in fact so fast during the cycle that the historian
robert lo pez claimed that there was a commercial revolution in europe in the later middle ages
and robert lo pez and many historians of his generation have often been inclined to think
that this is the key to understanding modernity but since he wrote several decades of work by
world historians have shown a slightly different picture and that picture is that the commercial
revolution was not just a european phenomenon it affected all of eurasia as in all malthusian cycles
growth began with innovations that stimulated population growth new technologies included
improved strains of rice in china and improved plows and yolks in europe we've already met these
improved yolks they allowed you to harness a horse without choking it when it pulled too hard because
they were attached more to its shoulders than to its neck populations grew fastest in regions
such as south china or east europe that had previously been underpopulated frontier regions
population growth in turn stimulated growth in other sectors of society they stimulated commerce
as as villages and towns expanded there's more exchange between them they stimulated urbanization
the appearance of new towns of new villages of new major cities and they also stimulated cultural
efflorescence where there's a lot of money about you you find patrons and you find governments with
spare cash and they may invest it in things like gothic cathedrals so the number and size of cities
and the richness of the culture they could support increased throughout eurasia
and populations became very dense in this period according to asa briggs by the late 13th
century and i quote a bigger area was cultivated in england than at any period before the wars of
the 20th century bagdad and cairo were among the largest cities in the muslim lands that dominated
the eurasian heartland but by the end of the cycle it may have been that china was the most
urbanized region in the world by the 12th century china may already have been extremely
highly urbanized with well over 10 percent of its people in the towns hangzhou marco polo's
kinzai that's what marco polo called the city was the capital of the southern song dynasty
and it may have been the world's largest city with at least a million inhabitants
it it contained many different suburbs it contained working class suburbs with crowded
multi-story houses it contained foreign quarters with sections for christians jews and turks it had
a large muslim quarter with many foreign traders and it also had a wealthy southern region that
was dominated by government officials and rich merchants and we have some idea of the astonishing
variety of trades conducted in the town zha gianna's list of the guilds of hangzhou include
jewelers guilders glue makers art and antique dealers sellers of crabs olives honey or ginger
doctors soothsayers scavengers bootmakers bathkeepers and money changers so in this period
the largest cities in the world could probably be found mainly in china let me remind you that
that that wonderful list of different professions is what smith is talking about when he's talking
about the division of of labor people becoming more and more specialized in very highly specialized
professions or activities as the size of the market expands and can support more and more
highly specialized professions now let's look at trade networks we've looked at some of the
phenomena of expansion in this period now let's look at trade networks trade networks or networks
of exchange is another phrase i've used reached further in this era than they ever had before
muslims dominated the silk roads which were i suppose the sort of backbone of exchanges in
eurasia the extenders we've seen from from china through to the mediterranean and down into india
but europeans were increasingly active so europe which had been a marginal zone in the time of
the roman empire is becoming increasingly significant in international exchanges by 1300
vikings had reached iceland greenland and even north america where they established the short
lived colony of newfoundland in 1000 c e while venetian traders such as marco polo had reached
china indeed in in marco polo's time in about 1300 c e just after publishers began issuing
regular travel guides to travelers heading for china these are sort of medieval versions of the
of the sort of travel guides we use today except they're aimed primarily at merchants so they
tell you about prices where you find translators what sort of money to take with you what sort of
goods to take with you where you're going to make your best sales and so on as exchange networks
increased commercial activity and other exchanges between different regions capitalism flourished
and as capitalism flourished wage earning and entrepreneurial activity expanded let's begin
with wage earning wage earning is a crucial part of the story we saw that in agrarian civilizations
peasants as a rule of thumb probably made up 90 percent of the population uh they are not very
specialized and for the most part they have limited incentives to innovate so as the number of wage
earners expands in society this itself may be a very powerful index of commercialization
and of the emergence of more capitalistic types of societies what very often happened
is that peasants in many regions found themselves sucked into capitalist networks
government demands to pay taxes in cash could force them to try and find cash if governments
