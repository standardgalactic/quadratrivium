will no longer accept payment in kind in animals or in eggs or in in wheat you have to find cash
and you have to look beyond your peasant farm for it land shortage could also drive them to
see cash if they don't have enough land to support their household or so can indebtedness they run
into debt then they're going to have to pay their debtors in cash or the need to buy goods on markets
all of these forces could drive peasants to earn cash and that meant drive them on to markets in
various ways they could earn money by selling surplus produce but generally that was available
to the wealthier peasants or they could earn money perhaps by selling goods such as textiles
manufactured in the households now this of course means they're functioning not just as pure peasants
supporting themselves from the land they're also functioning as petty artisans they might be making
silk they might be making textiles but they're half in the peasant world they're half in the wage
earning world or finally if things get really tough peasants might send one or two members of a
household to seek wage work as laborers in nearby towns or on nearby farms so in all these ways
peasants could slowly find themselves getting sucked into networks of commerce and wage earning
and these are some of the very subtle ways in which peasantries slowly began to turn into
classes of wage earners in this sort of environment entrepreneurs also flourished
their power was particularly striking at the edges of the great empires in southeast asia
or in the Mediterranean where powerful small trading states flourished such as venice or
genoa in fact in in in those cases we are talking about states where mercantile activity is so
important that merchants actually rule them now to illustrate the power of some of these changes
to stimulate innovation i want to focus in on china between 960 and 1279 in the era of the song
dynasty because the history of china in this in this era illustrates very well the transformative
power of these changes first let's go back in time since china was first unified in 221 bce
by the by the uh the first unified emperor shihuang di china had been the very epitome
of a traditional agrarian era tribute taking empire its rulers controlled huge revenues
exacted mostly in the form of tributes from a vast peasantry and most of those tributes came
from the land and like most agrarian elite groups they tended to despise commerce even though markets
flourished in china and played a pretty significant role in its economy so here we have a very
conventional tributary state but then in the 10th century things start to change this is a pattern
that had occurred before as central government broke down and was then revived but the striking
thing about china is for how much of the last 2000 years it was ruled by unified governments and
also europe's very different in the 10th century north china was conquered by dynasties originating
in manchuria and in tibet suddenly china instead of being a unified empire is divided into three
large warring states and the song dynasty is now confined to the south its rulers find themselves
facing very serious military challenges from their rivals to the north and they also have
a shrinking tax base because they ruled a smaller area and this poses very severe problems you have
very severe military problems and you've got less revenue to deal with it so what happens
is the song rulers suddenly find that despite their distaste for mercantile activity they're forced
to start exacting revenue from commercial activity and that means they're forced to start working
with entrepreneurs with merchants and in fact behaving a bit like the entrepreneurial rulers
of commercial city states such as venice or genoa here's one piece of evidence of this
in just 200 years the share of chinese government revenues from foreign trade rose from just two
percent initially tiny share to 20 percent a quite substantial share not surprisingly the song
government began to back traders and to encourage trade including foreign trade now our model of
drivers of innovation predicts that if commercial activity becomes more and more important if
governments start supporting it actively we should expect innovation to accelerate does it
in a now classic study mark elvin the study's called the pattern of the chinese past
describes the remarkable acceleration of innovation in this era here are just some
illustrations of it there were innovations in agriculture new strains of rice from vietnam
led to rapid population growth in the south and it's striking that the use of these new
strains was was actively encouraged by government propaganda using woodblock printing so that they
could distribute leaflets to provincial officials telling them how to use these strains how to
encourage their use and so on in manufacturing government factories produce 32 000 suits of
armor each year in the 11th century in this period iron was produced in amounts that would
not be matched again until the industrial revolution in 18th century europe and copper production rose
so fast that ice cores taken from greenland glaciers today show a sudden increase in atmospheric
copper pollution in this era in weaponry this was the era when gunpowder first began to be used
in war so there's an astonishing range of innovations it really looks as if innovation is
beginning to take off so we have to ask was china song china perhaps on the verge of any of an
early industrial revolution as society and governments became more commercialized and
more capitalistic well foreign trade's a wonderful illustration of this
particularly striking in this period are advances in naval technology between 1405
and 1433 a muslim admiral and eunuch eunuch jung-her led seven huge chinese fleets with
up to 60 ships and 40 000 soldiers in voyages to india south west asia and east africa on the
coast of east africa you can still find the remains of ming vases left by these expeditions
and we know that at least one giraffe was brought back by these fleets to china
there's no good evidence incidentally that his ships reached the americas though they might
have had the ability to do so in theory jung-herr's largest ships were at least five times the
length of columbus's ships they had watertight internal compartments they used compasses to
navigate in all in all this is fantastically sophisticated navigation and it shows that song
china is not merely highly commercialized highly innovative but it's also beginning to reach out
to other parts of the world then what happens in 1279 a mongol dynasty which took the the the
chinese name of the yuan reunited china under a ruler named kubla khan he was the grandson
of jingis khan and in 1368 the yuan themselves were overthrown by a new chinese dynasty the ming
so now what you have is a reunited china many of the pressures on governments to engage more
seriously in commercial activities of various kinds are now off the pressure diminishes and
they can revert to the behavior of much more conventional agrarian tribute taking states
and they can fall back on the norms of of confucianism and traditional cultural attitudes
which despised commerce slowly government practice reverted to the anti-commercial
tribute taking methods of earlier times the amount of revenue from trade diminishes
governments stop backing commerce and trade and the ming even tried to ban foreign trade
it was in this period that the voyages of jung-herr are ended
so innovation slowed it slowed partly because reunited chinese governments had less need to
support commerce so the entire commercial activity of china instead of being backed by states
is now being stifled by state activity but the other reason why this did not lead to a sort of
not lead to a sort of takeoff was because the world as a whole was as yet too disconnected
for innovations to spread rapidly so what was happening in china didn't turn out to be the
starting point for a global industrial revolution some of the some of the changes some of the
innovations such as gunpowder and use of the compass did indeed diffuse slowly across eurasia
but it took a long time in the mid 14th century then the medieval malthusian cycle ended and it
ended in a crash that affected most of eurasia we find signs of ecological overreach in many
parts of of eurasia it's been particularly well studied in in europe you find overpopulation
you find increasing numbers of famines you find weakened populations more subject to disease
overpopulation and mal malnutrition becomes more common and then eventually in the middle
of the 14th century the plague spreads from china through central asia to the Mediterranean world
in many regions it killed off a third of the population what this crash suggests
is that rates of innovation though impressive in some regions was still not yet rapid enough
to match population growth so the malthusian pattern would continue in 1350 the main structures
of agrarian civilizations including tribute taking elites and peasant farmers remained firmly in place
and eurasia was still dominated by the traditional hub regions so the structures of the later agrarian
era still seem to dominate change in the history of the whole of eurasia the commerce capitalism
and international exchange is flourished during the medieval malthusian cycle and remember we
called it a cycle precisely because it doesn't lead to sustained growth they could not yet overcome
the technological inertia that was characteristic as we've seen of most agrarian civilizations
and this is why the medieval malthusian cycle for all its innovation for all the growth that occurred
during it should not count as a significant turning point on the road to modernity the next
lecture is going to survey changes during the early modern malthusian cycle which lasted from
1350 to 1700 and we'll ask the same questions is there any evidence here that we're on the verge
of a breakthrough thank you
lecture 40 the early modern cycle 1350 to 1700
so when did change become so rapid that we can no longer say we are still in the agrarian era
we asked this question of the medieval malthusian cycle that ran from 500 CE to 1350 and what we saw
was that though we can see an increase in the significance of our three main drivers of growth
which are commerce capitalism and the expansion of exchange networks
the population crash at the end of the cycle confirms the impression that we've not yet
left the agrarian age now we ask similar questions of the next large malthusian cycle which extends
from about 1350 the era of the black death to about 1700 and this i'll call the early modern
malthusian cycle let me first give you the population figures so we you get a sense of the
general shape of this malthusian cycle once more you might want to mentally upload a graph
and it's got the following dates the first date is 1400 remember that's when the Aztecs are building
their empire in central mexico and much of Eurasia is recovering from the black death the next date
is 1500 just eight years after columbus's return from his first trip to the americas the next date
is 1600 this is a very easy sequence we're going century by century 1600 is when figures such as
Galileo are beginning to transform european science while the americas are beginning to recover from
a demographic catastrophe far more severe than the black death and the last date is 1700 which we
take as a symbolic starting date for the modern era so let me give you some population figures
let's begin with europe european populations in 1400 were about 52 millions 52 millions in 1500
there was 67 in 1600 they were 89 and in 1700 they were 95 now you'll note we're not seeing
a crash here at most we're seeing a sort of slowdown in growth in the late 17th century and
there is indeed evidence of a sort of minor dip in the 17th century and in fact throw
throughout much of Eurasia but there's no real crash here are the equivalent figures for china
70 84 110 and 150 and the figures for India are 74 95 145 and finally 175 million now in the case
of china too you can find evidence for a slowdown certainly in the 17th century but here we find no
evidence of a crash at the end of this cycle and this provides the first hint that global
rates of productivity may have been beginning to keep pace with population growth better than ever
before so that's an already an interesting sign that we may be on the verge of modernity so did
this cycle bring the world closer to modernity did rates of innovation begin to accelerate sharply
how rapidly did commerce and capitalism expand did the world become more interconnected
and we'll see that the answers to these questions are slightly contradictory
first the first and most spectacular change probably of all in this period was in exchange
networks and this has to count as one of the most spectacular changes in all of human history
what happens after the voyages of columbus is that the four world zones are linked over the next
200 years for the first time in human history and the creation of this first global exchange
network stimulated commerce and capitalism the linking of the four world zones counts as I've
said as one of the great events of human history suddenly it was a bit as if pangea had been
recreated as ideas goods crops people and also diseases began to circulate rapidly across the
entire globe as they never had before we've seen before history seemed to take place in four completely
isolated domains now for the first time this is the first step towards what we call globalization
today history human history is taking place on a single integrated stage much larger and more
varied and more diverse than any of the stages on which it had taken place before
this weaving together of the four world zones was the work of european mariners using highly
maneuverable ships equipped with cannon and they were backed by aggressive commercially minded
governments christopher columbus crossed the atlantic and headed back in 1492 the first
