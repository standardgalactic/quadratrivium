agriculture was based on root crops such as taro that did not store well as we've seen that may be
why no agrarian civilizations emerged here however they did emerge flourishing and highly competitive
early agrarian village communities some of which have survived to the present day and and they
flourished throughout the best part of 10 000 years without ever developing a fully grown agrarian
civilization in australian Tasmania foraging technologies survived to modern times now why
the difference between these two parts of Sahul one reason may be geological Papua New Guinea
provided a sort of snow plow as the plate on which Sahul rested drove north from Gondwana land
and that sort of snow plow drove it into the smaller plates of the complex tectonic system of
southeast Asia driving up mountains within Papua New Guinea so Papua New Guinea has accumulated
a much more varied ecology and topology than the rest of Sahul it has areas of rich soils
and a great variety of different ecological zones whereas most of australia is older flatter less
varied and has thin and far less productive soils so it could be just that agriculture
was intrinsically much more difficult in the mainland of australia rather than in the northern
regions that became Papua New Guinea however we shouldn't exaggerate these differences during
the last 5000 years there's plenty of evidence in the archaeology of australia of various processes
of intensification and of slow increases in population and even in some regions the appearance
of sedentary affluent foragers a bit reminiscent of the natufians now I say this just so that we
don't fall into the trap of thinking that somehow history stopped in regions like australia
we find evidence in the last 5000 years of more finely made more varied stone tools
we find evidence of population growth the dingo a semi domesticated dog appeared about 4000 years
ago probably across the Indian Ocean because it's very seems to be genetically closely related
to Indian species of dogs and in some areas people began to become more sedentary and this
happened along some of the coasts and regions where they depended on fishing one of the most
spectacular examples it comes from the state of victoria where people built elaborate eel traps
some incorporating canals up to 300 meters long as sort of holding tanks for eels these could be
harvested using special eel pots made from strips of bark or plaited rushes and once caught the
eels were killed I love this bit they were killed by biting them on the back of the head no thank you
so many eels could be stored in this way that people began to construct relatively permanent
settlements around them and in one case as many as 146 low stone huts were found at a single site
these were in fact villages and I hope you'll see the similarities with the natufians so this is
clearly evidence of a tendency towards forms of intensification even if the threshold to fully
developed agriculture is never quite crossed we can see other examples elsewhere in central
Australia for example 19th century European travelers observed communities harvesting wild
millet with stone sickles and storing it in large hay ricks given more time it's hard to think that
australia too would not have launched its own indigenous agricultural revolution now how significant
was the australian zone demographically by 500 years ago when the world zones would at last be
joined the population of sahul cannot have been more than about two millions it was tiny demographically
in the american zone agriculture evolved later than the afro-eurasian zone and in different ways
now i'm going to come back to the american zone later so i'll just summarize the evidence very
briefly crops such as maize and squashes may have been cultivated early but the earliest dated
samples of domesticated maize were grown about 3500 bce in the tehuacan valley southeast of
mexico city in south america guinea pigs lamas and alpacas were domesticated by 2000 bce think
incidentally how different the region's history might have been if they could also have domesticated
horses and large camelids species that had flourished just a few thousand years earlier
the relatively late development of cultivation in the americas may reflect the absence of easy
domesticates crops such as maize had to undergo significant changes before they could support
large populations besides as we've seen many potential domesticates were no longer available
now as for the population of this zone estimates of the populations of the americas 500 years ago
vary quite right widely from about 40 million to as high as about 100 millions this is a lot
larger demographically than australia but still nothing like as large as afro-eurasia
in the pacific zone migrants as we've seen brought agricultural technologies with them
there was no paleolithic era here though on some smaller islands including eventually
easter island agriculture eventually failed and populations began to revert to modified
forms of foraging so here we have an example of the possibility of human societies actually
becoming simpler particularly in regions with extremely limited resources and the populations
of this zone it's extremely unlikely that 500 years ago the pacific zone had more than one to two
millions for the sake of a comparison it's worth reminding you that the population of afro-eurasia
500 years ago was probably about 400 to 500 millions so this gives us a powerful idea of
the demographic imbalance between the different zones now in summary we've seen that there were
some striking differences and historical trajectories of these different zones these are very very
different stories those differences include a striking demographic imbalance with populations
ranging from 400 to 500 millions for afro-eurasia to 50 to 100 millions for the americas and to
a mere one or two millions for the australian and pacific zones so it's easy to assume that these
are completely different histories but i think that may be deceptive there are also beneath these
differences some striking parallels and above all we find intensification of some kind in all four
world zones in each zone human numbers tended for the most part to increase over large time scales
and they did so as a result of innovations that allowed humans to extract more resources from a
given area and we've seen this is true even in australia where there's plenty of evidence pointing
towards intensification and movements in the direction of a sort of agricultural revolution
here too humans occupy an increasing range of different environments from lush coastal regions
to the arid interior and they begin processes of intensification so these comparisons suggest
that the differences between the world zones and their histories
may have been more a matter of timing than of substance in each region we see evidence of
innovations that allowed the settlement of new areas and prepared the way for forms of
intensification here we may be seeing similarities that imply that everywhere collective learning
led to technological change of some kind and they suggest that the differences between the
histories of these regions reflect differences in their natural endowment their geography and
sometimes the size of their populations and therefore in what i've called the synergy of
collective learning now i want to explore these comparisons slightly more carefully by looking
at the second largest of the world zones the americas thank you
these lectures are part of the great courses series they are produced by the teaching company
these lectures are titled big history the big bang life on earth and the rise of humanity part four
lecture 37 the americas in the later agrarian era
in the last lecture we compared the early histories of the four world zones and we saw
that there were some striking differences between them but also some very interesting parallels
and we saw that this business of comparing the world zones can help us tease out some quite
deep issues about the driving forces of human history now what i want to do is look more closely
at the americas and that's the only other world zone apart from afro-eurasia in which agrarian
civilizations flourished so this gives us a chance to look more carefully at the different
trajectories according to which agrarian civilizations evolved in different environments
and remember once again these were areas without any significant contact between them so this is
the sort of natural experiment that jarrod diamond talked about so how similar was the
evolution of agrarian civilizations in these two zones and what were the crucial differences
and what can they tell us in the americas agrarian civilizations evolved in two main
regions in meso america in the south of mexico guatemala belize central america and also in
the andes region peru bolivia northern chile parts of ecuador in both these regions evidence of
embryonic agrarian civilizations the build up towards agrarian civilizations begins to
appear from about the second millennium bce now there's a third area in the americas where we see
the beginnings of this process but it never quite reaches the point of developing a flourishing
full-blown agrarian civilization and that's in parts of the usa along the mississippi valley
about 1000 years ago at sites such as kahokia in illinois which with a population of 10 to 20 000
may have been the largest pre columbian city of north america you find all the signs of powerful
chieftains of societies just on the verge of building up fully developed agrarian civilizations
the inhabitants the inhabitants of the regions region not only had quite large small towns they
also built huge artificial mounds but by 1400 c e this civilization the so-called mississippian
culture had largely broken down however given another millennium it's it's quite probable
there's a reasonable guess that a full-blown agrarian civilization might have also evolved
along the mississippi now what we'll do is survey the evolution of agrarian civilizations
in the two main regions of the americas in which they developed and flourished and let's begin
with meso america in meso america what we can call incipient civilizations first appeared after
about 2000 bce in the second millennium bce the earliest hints of something pointing towards
agrarian civilization appear amongst the olmec of southeast mexico near modern veracruz and the gulf
of mexico and they appear in the middle of the second millennium bce here in this region improved
varieties of maize beans and squash allowed rapid population growth in regions of heavy rainfall
where drainage was probably more important than irrigation but like irrigation regions this was
a region where farming would flourish but only if there was substantial investment of effort on
the part of whole communities eventually towns appeared based on the farming of these rich forest
soils towns such as lorenzo which probably had a population of about 2500 people so these are
these are not huge towns and la venta but what these towns did have was large ceremonial centers
with pyramid-like tombs that could be up to 33 meters high and they were apparently designed
as royal tombs the other thing about the olmec is that they made huge and distinctive basalt
stone heads most of us have seen pictures of these these wonderful very beautiful objects
with no large domestic animals these had to be transported by humans presumably under compulsion
so as in afro-eurasia monumental construction of this type implies that already there exist
quite significant hierarchies of power and wealth there probably exist regional rulers or chiefs who
can exercise at least some degree of coercion yet the relative relatively small size of these
towns suggests that they represented polities not quite at the level of a full-blown tributary state
yet the presence of obsidian remember obsidian is this this volcanic glass that can be used to
produce very sharp edges it's very important in all societies of the of the neolithic era
the presence of obsidian and other precious goods at olmec sites shows the existence of
quite extensive exchange networks we see in the olmec region some signs of a sort of collapse
la venta for example is destroyed violently in about 400 bce and this is an indicator of one
other component of agrarian civilizations moderately large-scale warfare finally an inscribed stone
found in 2006 in veracruz suggests that the olmec had already developed a writing system
though it's not yet been deciphered if this is true then this is probably the first writing system
to be developed in the americas in short by 500 bce and probably earlier the olmec despite the
smallness of their polities show many of the features we expect to find in incipient or embryonic
agrarian civilization so on a reasonably small scale so after about 1000 bce during the first
millennium bce large communities evolved in the oaxaca valley of south mexico and here we start
to find evidence of of significant craft specialization an extensive division of labor we see signs
of canal building of markets and also writing systems emerge and by 500 bce we have in the
oaxaca region a cluster of city states that certainly echo the early city states of sumer
by 500 c e a thousand years later oaxacan civilization is flourishing and the largest city
montielban may have had almost 20 000 inhabitants indeed it may have been the first large city to
flourish in the americas carved stone engravings found in montielban depict slaughtered enemies
and they show that warfare was on a significant scale here we certainly have a flourishing
agrarian civilization with large populations cities warfare writing trade and monumental
architecture on a large scale i hope by now you're getting very familiar with this sort of
checklist of the things that we expect to pop up once we get agrarian civilizations
olmec and oaxacan civilizations created many durable features of mezzo-american civilizations
by the first century c e the first century of the modern era towns cities and states could be found
also to the north in modern mexico city here the largest city teotihuacan which is about 25
