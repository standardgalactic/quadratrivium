john mcneill and i'll come back to us this book later on it's called something new under the sun
this is what john mcneill writes the human race without intending anything of the sort
has undertaken a gigantic uncontrolled experiment on the earth in time he writes i think this will
appear as the most important aspect of 20th century history more so than world war two the
communist enterprise the rise of mass literacy the spread of democracy or the growing emancipation of
women the change in our relationship with the biosphere is indeed astonishing however to understand
what happened in the 20th century we really need to see these changes in a larger context and that's
why in the rest of this lecture i want to retrace our steps and review our changing relationship
with the biosphere over the entire course of human history now i should note that this is still
surprisingly a fairly unusual way of looking at human history the separation of human history
and the other of history and the other humanities from the natural sciences
that took place in the late 19th century which cp snow in a famous assay of 1959 described as a
separation between two intellectual cultures has meant that historians for the most part have tended
to treat human history as if it were entirely separate from the natural world as this course in
big history has shown this is not true human history is deeply embedded in the biosphere
so now i want to review the increasing environmental impact of our species over 250 000 years we'll
go over data some of which we've seen already and assemble that into a coherent account of the
changing human relationship with the biosphere so let's begin by going back to the paleolithic era
how can we best describe the paleolithic relationship to the biosphere and what
impacts did humans have on the biosphere in the paleolithic era we've seen in this course
that the first distinguishing feature of our species was a greatly enhanced ability to adapt
through collective learning to continually find new ways of relating to the environment
and adaptation by its very nature implies finding new ways of manipulating the environment
now this meant that humans to a greater extent than any other species were constantly trying out
new ways of using the biosphere using their own surroundings trying out new plants or animal
species as potential foods or sources of fibers or skins or trying out new environments and trying
out new ways of dealing with those environments our impact in this year was in fact very limited
by modern standards and there are several reasons for this as foragers paleolithic humans gathered
what they needed consuming natural products largely in their natural form furthermore numbers were
small in fact some genetic evidence suggests that human numbers may have shrunk to as few as a few
thousands as late as 70 000 years ago communities were also widely scattered so their ecological
footprint in general their impact on a particular environment was limited and this has led to the
basically false assumption that humans had no significant impact on their environment
this is profoundly incorrect even in the paleolithic era the environmental impact of our
species was exceptional the first way in which we impacted the the environment of the biosphere
was by migrating in the course of 200 000 years humans explored and learned how to exploit
natural environments throughout the entire world with the exception of Antarctica and the islands
of the Pacific which they would explore later as they did so they developed new techniques for
dealing with different environments from the tropics to the tundra now we can easily take if you
look on a map and you look at human migrations in the paleolithic it looks also simple so we need
to remind ourselves that what's going on is technologically revolutionary it was in its way
a sort of scientific and industrial revolution they smeared out over many thousands of years now
think of some of the things that had to happen for humans to migrate in the way they did in the
paleolithic they had to deal with a whole range of new environments for example they exploited
coastal environments by fishing learning to fish or collect shellfish or using seaweed
learning to exploit tropical forests was a particularly delicate trick think about it
tropical forests are amongst the most diverse environments on earth so that to learn to exploit
them it was necessary to develop first a vast amount of botanical knowledge about different
plants many of them were toxic so to use them you had to either avoid them or find ways of leaching
out their poisons others had particular medicinal values incidentally modern pharmaceutical companies
have sometimes a better appreciation than some scholars of the range and extent of the botanical
knowledge of indigenous peoples such as the peoples of the amazon jungle they very often
send out researchers to try and find out the uses of particular plants from indigenous peoples
in addition they have to deal with many forest animals from snakes to piranhas which are dangerous
so this was no mean feat our paleolithic forages also learned to exploit desert environments
and this requires an entirely different suite of technologies and knowledges you have to have
very good geographical knowledge of water holes and which water holes are available at different
times of the years you need to know about technologies for conserving water and you need
an intimate knowledge of desert species and just one more illustration think of what it meant
for paleolithic humans to live in arctic environments at the height of the last ice age
that doing this meant learning to hunt arctic species such as seal walrus and elk
you had to have sea growing going craft you had to be able to navigate through ice flows you had
to be able to build shelters that could protect you through the winter and clothing that could
protect you while outside in extremely cold temperatures so the technological innovation
of paleolithic humans if we understand it rightly was in fact extraordinary and it was that that
allowed these migrations that looked so easy if you just see them on a map now some of these
techniques that were developed in the course of these migrations had a significant environmental
impact an example that we saw earlier was phiastic farming we saw that many paleolithic communities
developed ways of firing the land regularly in order to increase plant growth and to attract
prey species and over thousands of years these practices regular firing of the land repeated
over and over again could slowly change the mix of plant species it's probable that the
australian landscapes that the first europeans found there such as captain cook and which were
dominated by eucalypts were actually not natural environments at all they were in their way as much
a human created environment as the regular neat gardens of 18th century europe and another
example of these impacts was megafaunal extinctions as human hunting techniques improved and they
must have got significantly better in arctic terrain where hunting animals had to provide the
main source of food as they improved paleolithic hunters may well have contributed to the dieout
of a majority of large mammal species in the americas and australia in the americas they probably
included horses which were an american species large camelids giant sloth and a large number of
other similar species in australia they included giant kangaroos and wombats we can recreate
these extraordinary beasts but they're gone they're gone the only area of the world where you find
large populations of megafauna is our homeland africa and that's because humans and large
megafauna evolved together they knew how to deal with each other the results of over over hunting
were most drastic in newly colonized environments such as sahul and the americas where local animals
were too inexperienced to fear the new arrivals and humans didn't fully understand the ecology of
these animals but farages may also have contributed the extinction of Siberian species such as mammoth
and woolly bison now the evidence on the so-called megafaunal extinction still remains ambiguous
but the fact that they coincide roughly with the appearance of humans
makes it really look as if humans had something to do with it now let's move on to the agrarian era
in the agrarian era human environmental impacts increased very significantly this really is a
gear shift one reason is because agriculture by its very nature requires systematic and
large-scale manipulation of the natural environment essentially we've seen what is going on when you
have agriculture is that farmers are clearing away species of animals and plants they don't need
which they classify as weeds or pests or rodents and they replace them with species that they do
need or want which they call domesticus so this by definition involves rearranging the environment
around you and there are lots of different ways of doing this it may mean churning up the soil
through plowing or using digging sticks to remove weeds and to expose fertile subsoils
in which your domesticus can grow well it may involve the elimination of pests such as such as
wolves or it may require more elaborate changes we've seen such as diverting entire rivers into
artificial channels to water crops in arid regions and used badly we've seen that such methods
could destroy the fertility of soils over large areas the landscape of southern Sumer by the end of
the third millennium BCE was profoundly transformed by irrigation and transformed in ways that made it
an impoverished environment for humans and that's why civilization moved north
agriculture can require even more significant changes including the deforestation of large areas
there are hints of a significant increase in the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
at about the time that early swidden farmers began entering forested regions and clearing
or burning them down for farming in fact both the burning of trees and the reduction of tree cover
would have contributed to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and there was another
spike in the amount of methane and other powerful greenhouse gas once farmers in southeast Asia
began introducing the paddy farming of rice so here agricultural populations are beginning to have
a noticeable impact on the environment an impact that's noticeable several thousand years later
domestication provides another example of how agriculture encouraged humans to change their
environment domestication means manipulating the organisms around you to make them more useful
manipulating them genetically over many generations humans began to interfere in the evolution of
species that were important to them and by doing so they turned wild plants and animals into what
we call domesticated species that are useful to humans and dependent on humans for their survival
domestic sheep we've seen are vastly more numerous than their wild ancestors but they're weaker
they're slower and they're stupider they flourish because of their close symbiotic relations with
humans how do you change wild sheep into domestic sheep it's not that hard from each
each birth each group of lambs you pick the fattest and most docile individuals you do this for
enough generations and you'll soon breed out the feistiness that makes wild sheep hard to manage
and sheep are successful because of this and you can measure that in the biomass of sheep
much much larger than that of wild mammals in his wonderful chronology of the universe
timescale Nigel Calder posed the following delightful scenario which is a wonderful little
parable about the meaning of domestication it raises the question of who domesticates who
the question is this if a Martian ecologist were to study the earth and ask what's the
dominant species on this planet her answer might well be lawn grass and calder explains
here is a species that appears to cover a large part of the earth's surface and to have domesticated
a large bipedal species of mammal and trained it to groom the grass to feed it and water it and in
short to keep it in style and that story is a reminder that domestication is a two-way process
we in many ways are as dependent on the domesticates as they are on us
now finally in the agrarian era in regions of the denser settlement such as towns and cities
humans began to create not just landscapes that they had changed but entirely anthropogenic
environments there was little that was not shaped by the presence of humans in even the oldest cities
such as earth this increasing control over environmental resources over landscapes over
plants over animals over energy is what allowed humans to multiply from six millions ten thousand
years ago to more than two hundred and fifty millions just one thousand years ago so one possible
interpretation of these figures is that human impacts on the environment must have multiplied
by at least ten times but in fact as technologies became more productive the real impact was certainly
much greater than that now having reviewed the paleolithic and agrarian eras we're in a better
position to understand and to put in context modern impacts on the environment the modern
revolution has vastly increased our impact on the natural environment let me just quote a few
quick figures from paul kennedy who writes in the 20th century alone the world's population
quadrupled the global economy expanded 14 fold energy use increased 16 times and industrial
output expanded by a factor of 40 but carbon dioxide emissions also went up 13 fold and
water use rose nine times powerful demonstration of the fact that what we call economic growth
is always always based in some way on increased exploitation of the biosphere now let's look
more carefully at some of these phenomena first energy use there are now more than six billion
humans on earth on average each one consumes about 60 times as much energy as humans of the
paleolithic era 10 000 years ago there were about six million humans in other words human populations
have grown 1000 times in that period so on these figures total energy use by our species has grown
about 60 000 times that's a staggering increase modern humans have also had a massive impact
