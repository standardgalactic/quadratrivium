profession he knew this was an insecure way of making a living but he'd also he'd also reply
that i he knew of many more insecure ways he made a pretty good living and he worked extremely hard
at what he did like a good stockbroker he put a huge amount of time into studying the form
all the factors that might affect the outcome in fact he became so good at this that he had
to place his bets just before a horse race so as not to influence the odds too much and change the
odds okay with those preliminaries what i want to do now is to start peering into the future
and what i'm going to do is i'm going going to divide the future itself
into three distinct periods rather as we divide it human history into into distinct periods
period one is the next century that's the first period it's close enough to matter
at one way of putting that is to say we will know people our grandchildren our great grandchildren
will live in that period we will know people who will live through it it matters
it's also close enough to be shaped by our actions what we do today may shape the future in the next
hundred years and besides we have some data we have form we have existing trends to help us predict
so for these three reasons the next hundred years is a very interesting scale to think about
and that's the first scale the second scale we'll look at is the next millennium the next thousand
years roughly speaking the next thousand years now that is a is a very different type of scale
and the reason for saying this is that particularly given the nature and the volatility of modern
society possibilities of what might happen in that period multiply so fast that it's hard to make
any serious predictions that are not largely speculative so at this scale our attempts to
predict become less and less scientific and more and more they begin to look like science fiction
having said that i'm going to admit that it's fun to look at this scale and i'm going to let myself
speculate nevertheless then period three period three is the rest of time the whole of the rest of
time in the remote future billions of years away the odd thing is that our predictions suddenly
become a bit more serious and a bit more scientific and there's a very good reason for this if we look
to the remote future we're dealing with very large slow trends such as the evolution of
stars of galaxies and of the universe itself and those are things about which modern science
is reasonably confident that it can say some reasonably precise things so when we look at
the remote future we'll see in the next lecture that there are some fairly clear things we can say
okay now the rest of this lecture is going to focus on the first scale the next century and the
next lecture will discuss the second and third scales the scale of a millennium and the scale
of the rest of the future so what large patterns or trends can guide our ideas about the next
century if we take the idea of complexity seriously we have to take seriously also the
possibility that the sharp increase in the complexity of modern society may make modern
societies more fragile than the agrarian civilizations that preceded them and frankly
it's not hard to see possible routes to break down so it's hard to avoid scenarios in which
we see some sort of breakdown of modern society one form of this breakdown is simply that someone
manages to use some of the many hundreds of atomic weapons that are still deployed
and on hair trigger alert that would be a very simple rapid form of breakdown
and it's a very real possibility but there are also other subtler scenarios and these all suggest
or most of them take the form of what i've called in earlier lectures ecological overreach of some
kind except if this happens if we overreach if we overuse the the resources of the biosphere
this time the crash is likely to be not regional but global it might take the form in other words
of the mother of all balthusian crises in his green history of the world published in the early
90s a clive potting took the history of rapa newie east of ireland as a warning about the
dangers of a future malthusian crisis here's how the story goes rapa newie is a tiny polynesian
island just 16 miles long and it's one of the most remote places on earth it was settled
between 1000 and 1500 years ago by a group of polynesian colonists perhaps a boatload of 20
to 30 people they grew sweet potato they fished and they kept chickens
populations grew to about 7000 and village chiefs began building the large stone figures for which
the island is famous you'll all have seen pictures of these figures they are they are large stone heads
some of them two meters tall and some of them have sort of stone top knots that have been put on top
of them then about 500 years ago the society suddenly collapsed now this is a society of
several villages each with their own heads their own village chiefs so we can think of this as a
society of the early agrarian era then things collapse about 500 years ago they collapse in
warfare disease and famine and what this is looking like there's a classic malthusian crisis
but what happened well we have there was writing of some kind that developed on east ireland but
we can't decipher it so we have to decipher the history of east ireland almost entirely
from archaeological records and archaeologists have reconstructed much of this story using the
evidence available to them the stone figures the ahu it turns out were carved in the island's
single quarry and then they were moved around the island how how do you move such huge stone figures
well the answer is almost certainly that they were moved on rollers that were made from trees
now over time it seems that villages and their chiefs began to compete to build more statues
and the result was more trees were cut down until eventually none were left
now this was a catastrophe islanders themselves must have known what it meant as the crisis
approached with no wood you couldn't build boats and that meant you couldn't go out to see and
fish there there's there's an entire food resource that you cannot get hold of any longer
you can't build houses so now you have to live in caves you you can't use wood for fuel
so this is a very serious ecological crisis and the result was the population collapsed
and people started living in much simpler and more impoverished ways than they had before
now think your way back into Easter Island Rapa Nui about 500 years ago the islanders
must have seen the disaster coming as they fell the last trees but they fell them nonetheless
could modern consumption patterns cause a similar crisis but on a global global scale
is it possible that we'll see this thing coming but do nothing about it
in his recent best-seller collapse the biologist and historian Jarrah Diamond
who's made a huge contribution to our to our understanding of world history by adding a
biologist's perspective on it has explored many other examples of such collapses and you see
similar patterns over and over again sometimes leading lead into larger crises sometimes to less
now what does this story have to do with us
now what does this story have to do with us
so far we've seen that there are no signs of a slowing in the astonishing rates of innovation
generated by the modern revolution we're not quite yet at the point that the islanders were at
when they saw the last trees being cut down and that is perhaps why so far we've avoided a
Malthusian crisis innovation seems to keep increasing despite regional famines and some
of them have been massive for three centuries innovation at a global level seems to have kept
ahead of population growth but could that simply mean that we're preparing the way for a huge and
global Malthusian crisis bigger than any that have preceded it are we behaving the way the
Easter Islanders did just before the crash now we've already seen some ominous trends so let me
just list some of the more worrying trends populations are rising extremely fast carbon
emissions threaten rapid climatic change many fisheries some would say most fisheries are in
decline reserves of fresh water are shrinking rapidly particularly as irrigation increases
throughout the world and rates of extinction we've seen are higher than for many millions of years
so there are many signs of an impending crisis in our relations with the biosphere now here
Leicester Brown describes one of these trends it's overconsumption his his description is very
very vivid so let me let me quote it in some detail he writes if the western model would
were to become the global model and if world population were to reach 10 billion during the
next century as the united nations projects the effect would be startling if for example the
world has one car for every two people in 2050 as in the united states today there would be five
billion cars on earth now that's about 10 times the number today given the congestion pollution
and the fuel material and land requirements of the current fleet of 500 million cars a global
fleet of five billion is difficult to imagine if petroleum use per person were to reach the
current us level the world would be consuming 360 million barrels per day compared with current
production of 67 million barrels now that's just talking about cars now he talks about
consumption at a more general level above all consumption of food consider a world of 10
billion people with everyone following an american diet centered on the consumption of fat-rich
livestock products 10 billion people would require nine billion tons of grain now that as
lester brown points out is and i quote the harvest of more than four planets at earth's
current output levels with massive irrigation water cutbacks in prospect as aquifers are depleted
and with the dramatic slowdown in the rise of land productivity since 1990 achieving even
relatively modest gains is becoming difficult now this is what i meant by saying in the previous
lecture that our ecological footprint is in some senses larger than the planet today or it's
certainly heading in that direction that's one side of it if we raise living standards throughout
the world to those of the richer capitalist countries today it's hard to see how the biosphere
can deal with the pressure we will put on it but there's another side global inequalities today
are such that they guarantee increased conflicts if living standards do not rise in poorer regions
can we imagine a world in which we'd lock in present global inequalities inequalities now that
is surely a recipe for violent global conflict as the usa learned in september 2001 modern weaponry
means that even small groups can in such conflicts inflict terrible damage so this raises further
question if we seem to be headed for a level of consumption that is unsustainable can consumption
slow in a capitalist world how does this relate to capitalism or commerce that the basic drivers
of innovation in the modern world doesn't capitalism require endless growth certainly
significant cuts in consumption appear to be extremely unlikely in the richer and more
powerful countries whose economies are driven today by the logic of consumer capitalism now
so those are just some of the worrying trends today but it's not all it's not all bad there are
also positive trends so let's look at some of the positive or more hopeful trends first i said that
human populations were growing and they have indeed grown at a spectacular rate in the 20th
century and growth rates were probably at their fastest just after the middle of the century
but since then in the last few decades it's become very apparent that rates of population
growth are slowing and they're slowing as a result of what demographers call the demographic
transition this is an immensely important phenomenon so let me try and explain it clearly
it has many causes one of which may be simply the dying out or the vanishing of traditional peasant
life ways we saw that peasants throughout most of the agrarian era seem to be committed to a
demography which meant having as many children as you possibly could there were many reasons for this
one of which incidentally was that so many children died young that if you were if you were to
maximize the chances of some of them living to adulthood you had to have as many children as
possible now as that peasant world slowly fades away and more and more people live as wage earners
in towns and as in increasing parts of the world new forms of social security of some
kind are provided which means that children aren't the only guarantee of security in old age
more and more families are beginning to reduce the number of children they have
today improved health care increasing incomes have reduced the sort of pressures to have children
that peasants experienced and smaller families have also as we've seen transformed the role of
women by freeing them from the duty of lifelong childbearing and child rearing now this change
this slowing down in population growth has been quite striking and here's just one illustration
by the 1980s fertility levels in most developed industrialized countries had fallen to the level
of 2.1 children on average for every woman and demographers regard this as the replacement
level this is the level of reproduction necessary to maintain an existing population
but it's it's it's too low for growth in these countries therefore population growth
has depended increasingly on immigration rather than increases in fertility
the phenomenon is particularly noticeable in the wealthier capitalist countries but it's not
confined to them and that's become increasingly clear in the last decade or so rates of population
growth are beginning to decline throughout the world even in poorer countries in the 1960s global
growth rates were over 2 per cent per annum by 2005 they had fallen to under 1.2 per cent per
annum now this from an ecological point of view has to be a good trend in the sense to the extent
