results were catastrophic why globalization exposed the other world zones to colonization
and to brutal exploitation by european invaders we've already had a look at the silver mines of
potosy in modern bolivia as an example of this sort of exploitation all of this designed to
ensure flows of silver that eventually reach china and profit europeans but there's another
crucial factor here and that is disease this is a pattern we've seen before in the era of agrarian
civilizations as exchange networks expand disease vectors also start moving into new
regions and if diseases move into regions where there's no immunity the results can be catastrophic
and this is what happened in the 16th century as a result of the coming together of the world zones
europeans brought with them to the americas and eventually to the australian zone and the pacific
diseases for which indigenous populations had no immunity at all smallpox was perhaps the most
lethal of all of these and smallpox appears in central america within 15 20 years of the arrival
of columbus why was this coming together so catastrophic in disease terms well we've seen
already in afro-eurasia there were several reasons why immune systems over afro-eurasia
should have become increasingly hardened the widespread use of domesticated animals allowed
diseases to cross species creating a rich palette of diseases furthermore we've seen trans-european
eurasian exchange networks created multiple immunities and the major population zones of
afro-eurasia so by 1500 afro-eurasia as a whole particularly its cities are a zone of in which
which people have immunities to a wide range of diseases the other world zones had smaller
populations few or no domesticated animals and much smaller exchange networks and the result was
a less rich disease environment and much more limited immunities so when afro-eurasian diseases
such as smallpox are introduced the results are catastrophic and what they do is they mimic the
impact of eurasian plagues but sometimes on a far larger scale in the more densely settled regions of
mesoamerica and peru it's been estimated that populations may have fallen from 50 to 70 percent
this is a highly controversial area but what there's no doubt about is that the population
decline is very severe in the course of the 16th century for indigenous americans this was an
apocalyptic calamity here just to illustrate this is is is an account of what happened and what this
meant written by from sources in the yucatan peninsula just one description of what this
may have meant to indigenous americans in the yucatan in the maya area before the europeans
arrive says this account there was then no sickness they had no aching bones they had
then no high fever they had then no smallpox they had then no burning chest they had then no
abdominal pain they had then no consumption they had then no headache at that time the course of
humanity was orderly the foreigners made it otherwise when they arrived here and that cited
from alfred crossbees book on the columbian exchange here's another description of what
happened and it's from the other side of this disease holocaust written by thomas harriott who
was the surveyor from the english colony on roan oak island within a few days he wrote within a few
days after our departure from every such town people began to die very fast and many in short
space in some towns about 20s in some 40 and some 60 and in one sixth score which in truth was very
many in respect of their numbers the diseases also was so strange that they neither knew what it was
nor how to cure it the like by report of the oldest men in the country never happened before
time out of mind okay now can we summarize how much had the world changed by 1700 there's no
doubt that globalization had stimulated commerce and capitalism particularly in the aphrioration
zone but also in many areas of the americas and eventually would do so in the other world zones
of australia and the pacific the process has been particularly destructive of course in the americas
so our drivers of growth are clearly flourishing in this era yet in much of the world states were
still dominated by traditional tribute-taking elites with traditional aristocratic values and that
means attitudes that were fundamentally anti-commerce opposed to the development of
capitalistic activities peasants though increasingly enmeshed in market exchanges
remained the vast majority of the population in most countries so these traditional social
structures which still dominate much of the world may explain why on a global scale innovation
remained sluggish we certainly don't yet see the spectacular rates of innovation characteristic
modernity so in the early modern malthusian cycle though there are some areas such as parts of
europe where changes are beginning to look very decisive indeed and though we've seen the downturn
was nothing like a severe as in the medieval cycle nevertheless the basic structures of the
agrarian era remained in place and that may explain why rates of innovation remained low
so when did the breakthrough to modernity finally occur thank you
lecture 41 breakthrough the industrial revolution
if we look down on the world from our imaginary spacetime capsule in 1700
and then we move forward rapidly 100 years then 200 years we'll start to see a lot of
lights turning on this is the beginning of the modern revolution we saw in the last lecture that
by 1700 many of the elements of modernity seemed to be in place we saw that there were areas in
which a capitalist social structures were well developed we saw that commerce was widely developed
in many parts of the world and flourishing in many parts of the world and we also see that saw
that the world was now globally integrated in a way it never was before yet despite all of this
we saw that global rates of innovation didn't yet seem particularly spectacular and i remind you
what we're looking for when you're looking for the breakthrough to modernity is precisely
a breakthrough in rates of innovation so when do the crucial breakthroughs occur
and how in this lecture i want to describe the breakthrough to modernity after 1700
and for a lot of this lecture i'm going to focus on one country Britain where the transformation
has been studied most intensively now to understand these changes we're going to need statistics
one of the wonderful things about the modern world is that suddenly we have a massive statistics
we've seen that in dealing with early eras of human history we're generally scrambling around for the
the least crumb of data now suddenly we're drowning in data and particularly we have a huge amount
of statistical data most of that data refers only to the last century or two but some scholars
have attempted the difficult task of trying to reconstruct statistical series on matters such as
production population productivity that extend back several centuries this is a tricky and
delicate business but i'll be relying on some of these estimates in what follows we do need to
remember how much guesswork is involved in these reconstructions indeed we need to remember that
the very idea of gross domestic product which is one of the concepts that they project back into
the past is in its modern sense a 20th century concept but the good news is that these reconstructions
are so rough and ready that they encourage us to look at the very large picture they convey
that is more likely to convey a realistic impression than the details of the figures they
reconstruct so we shouldn't get too caught up in the details which are much more likely to mislead us
now those of you with statistical phobia can contemplate the idea that a table of statistics
or a set of figures if studied carefully can provide a beautiful snapshot of large economic
changes and that's why economic historians in particular love them the trick is to spend time
with them if you do then what they can do is to provide a pretty good alternative to the
imaginary time space machine that we've used in recent lectures so here are some figures the
first set of figures shows increasing output it attempts to recalculate the idea of gross domestic
product over several centuries the first set of figures estimates total global production
from 1500 to 1998 a gross domestic product which is that the term they use is an estimate of the
value of total output of goods and services so what do these estimates suggest well first
the first thing they show is an astonishing increase in total production between 1500 and 2000
global production on these estimates multiplied by something like 135 times in 500 years
now the second thing we see from these figures is that the increases become really evident in
the 19th century this is an accelerating trend and they become most striking in the 20th century
in the four centuries up to 1913 production had increased by about 11 times in the next
century alone up to 1998 it would increase another 12 times so this is an accelerating trend it's
getting faster and faster so that's the first thing we see massive increase in total production
of goods and services and once again even if these figures are very very rough estimates
estimates they seem to be telling us something very important now here's a second set of figures
and they're on population these suggest that increasing production the increasing production
of energy and of resources and foodstuffs and textiles and so on allowed populations to multiply
by almost 14 times in the same period that's over 500 years now once again if we look more
closely at these figures they're clearly an accelerating trend population growth accelerated
from the late 18th century but much faster in the 19th and particularly in the 20th century
and here's just one figure that captures that in the four centuries up to 1913 global populations
increased a bit more than four times that's in 400 years in the next 100 years to 1998
they would increase by another three times so once again we have an accelerating trend
now you may have noticed that there is something very striking about comparing
these two sets of figures and this is the fact that production rose much faster than populations
remember total production has risen by 130 times in 500 years on these figures
and population by 14 times so what this means is that more goods and services are being produced
at the end of this period per person despite extraordinary rates of population growth
this trend is demonstrated by a third set of figures on per capita production
production per person that is to say total production divided by population production per
person multiplied by about 10 times between 1500 and 1998 and once more this is an accelerating
trend in the four centuries up to 1913 production per person increased a little more than 2.5 times
in the next century alone it increased by almost four times
here in this figure for increasing productivity and in the comparison between the two earlier
sets of figures is the first indicator that one of the results of the modern revolution
may be that production effectively for the first time in human history begins to match
or even outstrip population growth now remember the lag of production behind population growth
was the key to the Malthusian cycles that were the dominant pattern of rise and fall
in the later agrarian era so far in the modern era and I have to say I'm touching wood at this
point but so far in the modern era the world has avoided a global Malthusian crisis that is to say
a global crisis caused by not producing enough stuff now I want to move on to a second data set
and this is a series of figures that illustrates how these changes transformed the global geography
of wealth and power and how as a result of these changes new power centers emerged and old power
centers some of which had been significant centers of power for several thousand years
began to decline and to decline very rapidly here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take
figures for production by Britain and the USA two of the major powers of the new Atlantic hub zone
and compare them with figures for the combined production of India and China so we have two groups
one is Britain and the USA the other is India and China and each case the figures I'm going to give
give you how much of global GNP is produced by each of those blocks now India and China remember
were the ancient economic heartlands of the pre-modern world Britain and the USA will be
the heartlands of the emerging Atlantic world the new hub zone of the modern era
okay here are some figures let's go back to 1750 in 1750 India and China accounted for
almost 60 percent of global production now again I have to remind you how rough these figures are
it's the orders of magnitude that concern us here Adam Smith incidentally who wrote the
wealth of nations in 1776 understood this very very well he said China is a much richer country
than any part of Europe at the same time in 1750 Britain and the British Atlantic colonies
accounted for just two percent of global production it's a tiny share of global production
now let's move forward 80 years in 1830 India and China the old hub region still accounted for
just under 50 percent of global production as late as 1830 at the same date the US and Britain
accounted for about 13 percent now if these figures are giving the right impression they suggest two
things first the Atlantic region still even in 1830 lagged some way behind the old producing zones
but it also suggests something else they are catching up very rapidly indeed and now the
relationship will change very rapidly in the middle of the 19th century by 1860 these two regions
the new Atlantic region and the old hub zone of China and India are neck and neck each producing
about 28 percent of global GDP then at that point India and China start to fall back fall
behind very rapidly by 1900 the USA and UK are producing about 42 percent of global output and
India and China are producing merely 8 percent and by 1950 the USA and UK are producing about 53 percent
