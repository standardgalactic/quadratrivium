combustion engine in the late 19th century the Wright brothers showed how you could use
an engine to drive a heavier than air plane in 1903 this is again an idea that we take for granted
but we need to remind ourselves how remarkable it is the idea that humans might one day routinely
fly around the world would have seen the purest fantasy just a few centuries earlier today if you
go to kitty hawk you can see a modern replica of their plane which can in fact fly it's a beautiful
machine i've seen it myself in 1913 henry ford produced the first model t ford which pioneered
mass production for a new mass consumer market making the internal combustion engine and the car
not just elite products but products aimed at a much much larger market almost like textiles
now i've described the four main phases the next thing i want to do is describe how these changes
which i've described mainly in economic terms began to affect other sectors of life and the first
area i want to look at is government how did these changes affect government now the short
answer is that they were transformative we use the same word government for modern governments
and those of the agrarian era but but frankly these are utterly different beasts economic changes
and rising productivity transformed the power and the very nature of government in the state during
this era governments acquired new forms of power but they also found that they faced new and much
more complex challenges than had been faced by the relatively much simpler tribute taking states of
the of the later agrarian era war was a major driver of change with increasing production
states from the 18th and early 19th centuries found that they had to become much more effective
at mobilizing national resources both of manpower and materials in fact increasingly success in war
meant success in mobilizing all the resources of your economy the armies of revolutionary
france pioneered in the challenge of raising large citizen armies using the appeal of nationalism
and nationalism was to become immensely important in the modern era it was a way of creating what
the sociologist benedict and anderson called an imagined community to which all citizens of a
particular state were encouraged to think of themselves as belonging so that they would commit
themselves to the support of that community and if necessary die for it but nationalism wouldn't work
if states treated their citizens in the fundamentally exploitative way which was characteristic of most
tribute taking governments if you want your citizens to actually support you as a government as a
state you have to give them a greater sense of ownership of society and this was a change that
was achieved in part through the introduction of more democratic methods of rule of which perhaps
the most important is the use of elections industrializing governments in general found that
to mobilize support from below from a population that was now very different from the peasant
populations of the later agrarian era it was more mobile it was more urbanized it was generally
better educated and it was not self-sufficient in order to gain support from these populations
they had to provide new services and these services included policing and you see the
introduction of the first modern police systems in france during the french revolution it involved
the provision of more health services and also of mass education these were services that
hardly any agrarian era states had had seriously thought of providing there's another feature
of this the power of modern governments depended increasingly on economic growth so they became
increasingly economic managers rather than just takers of wealth to survive they had to spend a
lot of effort and a lot of time worrying about how to stimulate growth how to create
environments in which commerce could flourish how to create legal systems that protected
entrepreneurship how to create banking systems that created stable financial systems now this alone
this change alone the fact that governments became managers rather than simply coerces and
tribute takers was revolutionary remember prince vladimir of Kiev who saw military power as the
key to acquiring wealth he saw coercion as the key to getting wealth in the modern era essentially
the roles have been reversed increasingly for modern states the fundamental rule is wealth
gives you power a wealthy highly productive economy is the key to military power so success
for a state in the modern era means building economic growth there's another way in which
the role of government was bound to increase in societies in which most people were wage earners
and this is because wage earners unlike independent peasants who are largely self-sufficient
depend on the provision of basic services such as markets
to survive as a wage earner you have to find employment there have to be markets on which
you can buy goods and produce there have to be legal systems that protect the conditions of
employment and so on and inevitably what this meant was that governments became more involved
in the day-to-day life of most of their citizens twitter very crudely whereas in the late agrarian
era 80 to 90 percent of the population could be left most of the time just to get on with it peasants
didn't need the state to interfere in the modern era most of the population needs the services
that states provide so states had to protect property they had to maintain law law and order
they had to ensure stable currencies to do that they needed increasing information about their
populations about the health the education and the incomes of the populations they ruled
so to summarize some of these political changes the rules of political success have changed in
the modern era larger more mobile and better educated societies had to be managed rather
than simply coerced in the Atlantic hub zone the beginnings of these changes were already evident
in the political revolutions of the late 18th and early 19th centuries this is the era described
famously by the American historian R. R. Palmer as the age of the democratic revolution and here
is Charles Tilley's pithy summary of the changes that created the modern state here's how he puts it
over the last thousand years european states but a lot of what he says applies to modern
states in general have undergone a peculiar evolution from wasps to locomotives long they
concentrated on war leaving most activities to other organizations just so long as those
organizations yielded tribute at appropriate intervals tribute taking states remained fierce
but light in weight by comparison with their bulky successes they stung but they didn't suck dry
as time went on states even the capital intensive varieties took on activities powers and commitments
whose very support constrained them these locomotives ran on the rails of sustenance
from the civilian population and maintenance by civilian staff off the rails the warlike
engines could not run at all in short modern states have to be in some sense democratic
they have to work with their populations because of the extreme complexity of the societies they
they rule industrialization is also on the other hand magnified the coercive power of
states so here's a paradox on the one hand modern states have to be more democratic they have to
work more closely with their citizens they have to gain support from below on the other hand they
can also coerce more effectively they have more ability to support what we called earlier power
from above and this is largely because modern modern industry has magnified the military power of
states it's enabled them to transport soldiers and weapons weapons larger distances and it's
increased the destructiveness of weaponry this increased military power was apparent in the
astonishing speed with which in the late 19th century governments from the new atlantic hub
region conquered much of africa asia and the americas now i'd like to talk briefly about
changes in another area of life cultural life and life ways the changes we've looked at we've
looked primarily their economic aspects and now the political aspects but they also transformed
cultural life and popular life ways and here are some of the transport transformations
everywhere peasants slowly turned into wage earners as they were squeezed off the land
by increasingly efficient commercial farmers now we have to remind ourselves that this too is a
fundamental change in the life ways of a majority of people on earth as wage earners seeking employment
needed education more than peasants governments began to introduce systems of mass education
for the first time education which had been largely a matter for upper classes as a peasant you
you learn on the job as it were now became a matter that states began to take seriously
and began to extend the population as a whole so mass education began to spread at least in part
because most wage earning employment required at least a minimum of literacy
the earliest modern national educational systems were established early in the 19th century
in the polionic france and germany so from a world in which only a tiny elite were educated
we moved to a world in which the vast majority of the population has at least the rudiments of
literacy but elite culture was transformed also and particularly by the rising significance of
science the first industrial science labs were created in germany in the middle of the 19th
century and that's probably the point at which science begins to play a direct role in encouraging
innovation in modern society before that most innovations had been the work of tinkerers of
mechanics who knew machines well but weren't necessarily thinking primarily as scientists
as the economic technological and military importance of science rose it began to challenge
traditional ways of thinking in many many areas it began to challenge the traditional role for
example of ancient religious traditions in education and culture by offering new and
fundamentally materialist accounts of the universe which offered as we've seen throughout this course
very little room for traditional deities so the intellectual world both of the mass of the population
and of elite groups was also transformed in the course of the industrial revolution
now i'd like to look at some of the negative sides it may seem as if i've been telling a
a totally positive story as if this is everything is is is going wonderfully there's a profoundly
negative side to all of that all of this and that that is the destruction of traditional societies
growth in industrializing regions was accompanied by sometimes catastrophic decline elsewhere
as productivity rose in the new hub regions regional differences in wealth and power widened
we've seen that the once awesome power of ancient tribute taking empires evaporated china's share of
global production fell from 33 percent in 1800 to 6 percent in 1900 and in the 1840s
british gunboats forced china to trade in opium with the remarkably hypocritical argument that
they were defending free trade and china one of the great empires of the past of the past
of the past was forced to submit to humiliating controls on its foreign trade imposed by these
small nations from the other side of the world by 1900 states from the new hub regions of the
atlantic zone dominated much of the world directly or indirectly this transformation
depended in part on new industrial weaponry the first successful machine gun the gatling gun
was used in the later stages of the american civil war it could fire 1 000 rounds a minute
the maxim gun the first machine gun to use a belt feed was invented in 1884 it was used by
british troops in the matabili war in 1893 to 4 in modern zimbabwe and it gave british troops a
devastating and horrifying advantage over their spear-carrying opponents hill air bellock wrote
at the time with with vicious irony whatever happens we have got the maxim gun and they have not
the vast regional differences in wealth and power that are familiar today first appeared
in the late 19th century in an important book on the origins of the third world which is called
late victorian holocausts mike davis argues that in 1800 class differences within societies
were generally more important than those between different regions of the world for example he argues
differences in living standards between a french worker and an indian farmer were probably far
less striking than those between those groups and those who rule over them by 1900 he argues
differences in national living standards between wealthier and poorer countries had become
for the first time in human history as profound as differences within societies and he concludes
that the gross inequalities between different regions of the world that we take for granted today
were and i quote as much modern inventions of the late victorian world as electric lights and
maxim guns in summary this lecture has traced how the modern revolution spread around the world
it transformed economies it transformed governments and it transformed cultures and we've also seen
how rapid industrialization in some areas of the world undermined the traditional economies
lifeways and societies of other parts of the world would these changes continue
in the next lecture we look at what happens in the 20th century thank you
you
lecture 43 the 20th century
now after 13 billion years we enter the era of our own lifetimes the previous two lectures
described the transformative impact of the modern revolution between 1700 and 1900
after 1900 the pace of change accelerated even further and the modern revolution began to
transform societies throughout the world now i have to say that trying to describe the 20th
century from the perspective of big history is one of the hardest challenges in this course
but with that warning here goes three great waves of change shaped the 20th century the first of
these is the fourth wave that we looked at in the last lecture it begins in the late 19th century
