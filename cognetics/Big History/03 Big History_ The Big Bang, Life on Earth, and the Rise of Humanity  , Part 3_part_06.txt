many areas that it's extremely difficult to pin down the essential nature of these changes
here with the modern revolution more than ever before in this course the challenge
is to see the whole elephant and not just the wrinkles on its skin now the result of this blur
of information and changes is that describing what we mean by modernity or the modern revolution
is extremely difficult we have to try somehow though to grasp the essence of modernity from a
big history perspective what does it look like from our time and space capsule there are other
difficulties one is that the changes continue today which makes it very difficult to grasp the
overall shape of change in the modern era that the changes are continuing we can't see the overall
shape of this era in fact that's why i've labeled it the modern era and i'm using the idea of the
adjective modern deliberately in a fairly empty sense to simply mean the era closest to us because
it's very hard to pin down its essence with agriculture you could say agriculture was the
essence of those changes with modernity it's not absolutely clear yet what is the essence of change
the result of all these difficulties is profound disagreement about what we mean by modernity
some will say it meant new ways of thinking new attitudes that these these began perhaps
during the european enlightenment some will stress economics some will even claim that
modernity is over that we now live in a postmodern era
the result of all these disagreements is that i'm going to have to
take some decisions about what we focus on and the discussion that follows represents an attempt
to pick out the crucial features of the modern revolution as seen through the wide lens of
big history and that's a lens that tries to see this threshold as one in a long sequence of thresholds
that reaches back to the very origins of our universe the approach i'll adopt builds however
on a long tradition of debate about modernity that includes major thinkers from adam smith
to carl marx and max vapor and up to many contemporary thinkers so we have plenty of ideas
once again though the problem is so many ideas it's hard to it's hard to decide which are the most
crucial ones and one more thing the big history perspective has certain consequences for how
we look at modernity the first is going to be and this is a sort of product warning that some
familiar landmarks such as the french revolution or the renaissance or the enlightenment may seem
to vanish entirely at these scales for example the renaissance is going to zoom past so quickly
it'll be a bit of a blur a bit like a passing train in the night what we're looking for are the very
large patterns of change a second consequence of the big history perspective is that we'll try to
see the modern revolution as a global phenomenon unlike many traditional accounts that have seen
it largely as a product of changes in europe or the west recent scholarship in world history has
shown very very clearly that the transformations were indeed global and they had global roots
modernity is not just a european or western phenomenon the americas for example played a
crucial role early on as suppliers of new crops and also as suppliers of vast amounts of silver
to the world economy and today of course the americas are the home of the most powerful and
richest nation on earth okay with those preliminaries out of the way i'm going to stick my neck out
and suggest four defining features of the modern revolution this is the first
and i'll argue later it's probably the most fundamental rates of innovation accelerated
sharply now let me remind you the word innovation is a modern economist term but it sort of overlaps
with the biologists term adaptation so we're talking about adaptation this is absolutely
fundamental it represents a sort of gear shift in the synergy of collective learning
this acceleration in innovation or adaptation had several consequences it increased the pace of
historical change we've seen it took 200 000 years for foraging lifeways to spread around the world
about 10 000 years for agriculture to do so and just two to 300 years for the modern revolution
and that's a direct consequence of this increase in the speed of innovation and change
innovation also increased human control over the energy and resources of the biosphere
because this is what innovation always does it always means finding new ways of extracting
resources from the biosphere but there are further aspects to this what's what's happened
is that innovation has become institutionalized in the modern era in modern institutions of
education and science that can that have constructed formal structures to encourage
and sustain innovation so we're now deliberately innovating in a way that has no parallel in
earlier epochs now here's the second the second crucial defining feature of the modern era it is
that innovations drove many other changes they increased available resources this allowed humans
to multiply creating larger denser and more complex societies than those of the agrarian era
the general pattern is one we've seen before innovations lead to intensification to increasing
population density creating greater social complexity we've seen the numbers already human
numbers rise from 250 millions a thousand years ago to about nine 50 millions in 1800 c e to about
six billions in 2000 c e what we're seeing is a 30 fold increase in human populations in a thousand
years as in the agrarian era larger communities meant new lifeways new types of power structure
wage earning replaced peasant farming as the normal way of earning a living and this is probably
one of those things that is less obvious but it's one of the changes that affected probably the
largest number of people in some european societies peasants became less than 50 percent of the
population as early as the 18th century globally this threshold had probably been reached by the
end of the 20th century the great british historian eric hobsbawm puts this almost at the center of
his account of the 20th century he writes the most dramatic and far-reaching social change of the
second half of the 20th century and the one which cuts us off forever from the world of the past
is the death of the peasantry as a part of this build-up of resources governments became larger
more powerful and more intrusive they had they they had the capacity to interfere in daily life
on a vastly greater scale than the rather clumsy tributary governments of the agrarian era but
they also became more responsive to the needs and capacities of their subjects and we'll see
that this was necessary simply to handle the complexity of modern societies and human society
became global since the 16th century this is the third great feature of modernity human society
becomes global it's it's globalization an early stage in globalization since the 16th century
human societies have exchanged goods ideas diseases and people within a single global network for the
first time humans meet each other not within the limits of these world zones but globally
improved technologies of communications and transportation have steadily tightened these
links over the last few hundred years that's the third feature globalization and the fourth
is that our species has begun to transform the biosphere by some estimates humans may now be
controlling or managing the disposal of 25 to 40 percent of all the energy that enters the biosphere
through photosynthesis this is staggering ecological power for a single species and there are other
ways of measuring this and these are just illustrative modern weaponry is now so powerful
that humans could if they chose destroy much of the biosphere within a few hours the bomb dropped
on Hiroshima on august the 6th 1945 was simply a horrifying demonstration of this power the
diversion of biospheric resources to human use has also had a profound effect on other species on
other parts of the biosphere through loss of habitat and increasing extinctions and as we now
know it's beginning to transform the global climate system mainly through global warming and here's
a quote from two Scott scholars Ravel and Seuss that captures this very night nicely they wrote
this as early as 1957 human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a
kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future within a few centuries
we are returning to the atmosphere and oceans the concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary
rocks over hundreds of millions of years the environmental historian John McNeill writes
for most of earth's history microbes played the leading role of all life in shaping the atmosphere
in the 20th century he writes humankind stumbled blindly into this role so here are four defining
features a sharp increase in innovation innovation had a large number of consequences in other areas
the globalization of human history and finally a sharp increase in human impacts on the biosphere
now let's start talking about the even more difficult problem of explaining this defining
the modern revolution is tough enough can we explain it what i want to do is it is is describe
the strategy i'm going to adopt for explaining the modern revolution i'm going to begin by
focusing on one of these four features and that is the first accelerating innovation
because this is really the key to most other aspects of the modern revolution
only a very sharp increase in innovation or adaptation can possibly explain how within
this period humans have found it possible to support so many other humans now if we focus on
this accelerating innovation this simplifies our task a bit it means we can focus on just
trying to explain one of our four features so now the challenge is can we explain why innovation
accelerated so sharply in the last few hundred years economists and historians have discussed the
main drivers of innovation at least since the publication 1776 of the wealth of nations by
adam smith and in discussing the agrarian era we already started looking at these discussions
and considering possible drivers of innovation and growth a short list of familiar drivers of
innovation that appear in the literature might include some of the following first the power of
states something we looked at in discussing the agrarian era we've seen that tributary states could
generate innovation but we've also seen that they could stifle it so this looks an unpromising
candidate for explaining the modern revolution here's a second we've looked at population growth
we saw that ester bosarup argued that population growth itself encouraged innovation
yet we've also seen that throughout the later agrarian era there were these malthusian crises
now if population is encouraging growth they ought to appear the fact that they did shows that
population growth does not always encourage growth so let's drop that one a third idea changing
ideas this has played a very important role in a lot of debates about modernity the german sociologist
max Weber argued that Protestantism encouraged the spread of capitalism the trouble is if he's
right how in turn can we explain the rise of Protestantism quite apart from the fact that
many scholars have shown that many aspects of Catholicism or Buddhism for that matter or
Confucianism could also be compatible with capitalism so though these drivers have been
discussed a lot i'm not going to treat them as the keys to explaining modernity instead i'm
going to focus on three other drivers which we've already met in slightly different guises the first
is commercialization and the spread of competitive markets the second is the spread of capitalism
and the third is the expansion of global exchange networks and let me describe each of these briefly
driver one increasing commerce adam smith argued that specialization raises productivity people
if they're highly specialized can do their work more efficiently efficiently than if they're
generalists and specialization he said depends on the extent of market competition
here's how he put it the greatest improvement in the productive power of labor and the greater part
of the skilled dexterity and judgment with which it is anywhere directed or applied seemed to have
been the effects of the division of labor that's chapter one of the wealth of nations in chapter
two he writes this division of labor from which so many advantages are derived is not originally
the effect of any human wisdom which foresees and intends that general opulence to which it can
occasion it is the necessary the very slow and gradual consequence of a certain propensity in
human nature which has in view no such extensive utility and that propensity is the propensity to
truck barter and exchange one thing for another what he's saying essentially is as market relations
spread as people are allowed to truck and barter more that will increase the division of labor
specialization and productivity so here's smith's key idea and this is what we've called smithian
growth now his driver to capitalism it sort of overlaps with the first driver carl marx whose
dates are 1818 to 1883 spent most of his life trying to overthrow capitalism but he was also
a great admirer of capitalism because he saw how powerfully capitalism could raise productivity
his ideas expand in important ways on those of smith he offered a social structure theory of
growth which implies that different social structures have different impacts on innovation
and we've already seen this in the agrarian era we've seen that neither peasants nor tribute
taking elites really have a sustained interest in innovation though both groups can occasionally
innovate capitalism marx argued is different the dominant groups are not tribute takers but
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs make their wealth by trading officially efficiently on
competitive markets they have to spend all their life thinking about innovation and the majority
class in a capitalist society consists not of self-sufficient peasants but of wage earners
who have to work hard and efficiently to market their labor so they too have to think about
productivity so here we have a social structure in capitalism in which both elites and the majority
