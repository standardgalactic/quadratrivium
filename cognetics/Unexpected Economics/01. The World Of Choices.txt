When I start chatting with someone at a party or with a cab driver or with the person sitting next to me on an airplane
And I tell them that I work on an academic journal of economics
I get a fairly common set of reactions
First there's a little bit of an eye roll, a little bit of a head toss
The kind of body language that says, whoa, I didn't see that one coming
And over time I found that really this is made up of a mixture of several suspicions
There's a sense that I'm definitely some sort of geek or gearhead
And I might start jabbering away about statistics or theorems at any minute, so beware
Even worse than that, I'm likely to be some sort of a weird zealot
Maybe an extreme capitalist, maybe an extreme socialist
But either way, you can just see the person thinking, he's likely to want to shoot his mouth off about it
And either way, what he's interested in is likely to be so mind-bendingly dull
In many cases you can almost see the silent prayer go up
Please, please, don't let him start talking about economics
In other cases, they'll say something like, so, what do you think about the economy
Or sometimes, what about the stock market?
Well, I'm exaggerating just a little bit here, but not all that much
Economists are just a little bit different
Let me try to illustrate some of the difference by telling you three of the kinds of stories that economists tell about themselves
They're jokes in a way, but also jokes that reveal something about how economists see the world
Economists see the world as a place of choices, sometimes unexpected choices
That can lead to potentially disconcerting reactions and interactions between people
Here's the first story, an old story about two economists from the University of Minnesota, Oswald Brownlee and John House
They were heading for home one day and they wanted to buy some steaks for dinner
So they stopped off at a market along the way
Now, it's dinner time, there's a big line in the market, so they took a number
And they're way back in line, say they're number 20 in line
They wanted to get home sooner than that
So they found someone further up in the line and made that person a cash offer to switch places in line
Now, they found that other people in the line had a hard time even understanding this offer or why they were making it
But as economists, they knew that this pretense of incomprehension was nothing more than a bargaining strategy to drive up the price they were asking
So naturally, recognizing what they're involved in here, they raised their bid
Now, at around this point, others in line began to notice their strategy and to express their opinions about that strategy
And while it's inevitably hard to summarize a group reaction, it would be fair to say the reaction of this group was unhappy with their offer
Perhaps even hostile to them personally
Now, can't you just imagine these economists standing there in line?
They're explaining they are only discussing the possibility of a mutually beneficial exchange where they would give some money in exchange for some time
And after all, this transaction doesn't affect anyone else
If you were 18th in line ahead of them, you'll still be 18th after their transaction is done
If they bought the place of the first person in line and that person moved back and switched with them, moved back to 20th place
No one else in the line is affected in any way by this transaction
To any economist, this sort of transaction is perfectly reasonable
But anyway, the story goes the discussion got a little heated
Some people just didn't see the reasonableness of the economic offer
And in the end, it seemed to the two economists it was better just to leave for home
And maybe get a pizza delivered for dinner or something else
Here's a second story
Most of you are familiar with what happens when you get to the airport
And the airline has sold more tickets than there are seats on the plane
They make that announcement, we are overbooked
Anyone willing to take the next flight and get a free ticket or maybe a voucher for $300 against free ticket, please contact the gate attendant
And eventually they get a volunteer and life goes on
But it wasn't always that way
Up until about 1978, airlines overbooked their flights
That is they sold more tickets than they had seats
But if you showed up near departure time and the plane was already full and there wasn't a seat
You just got bumped to the next flight
There was no choice and there was no compensation
An economist named Julian Simon had noticed this problem back in the 1960s
And in 1968, he published an article called
An Almost Practical Solution to Airline Overbooking
His basic almost practical idea was that the airline should ask people to write down
What the people would be willing to accept in exchange for delaying to the next flight
The airline could then choose the lowest bid
Now at the time, this was thought of as the sort of silly unrealistic proposal that some academic economist might make
Impossible to administer, unlikely ever to work
A little wacky, perhaps a little disturbing
Maybe even as weird as trying to buy a place in line at the grocery store
But when they were required to start offering a ticket for being bumped in the late 1970s
The airlines and customers found out that actually it worked just fine
Not only was it better for customers who could now choose whether they were going to be bumped or not
But it turned out to be better for airlines too
Because they could overbook their flights at least to some extent with impunity
They know that if the flight does overflow, it will be a volunteer giving up a seat
A compensated volunteer, but still a volunteer, not someone who was forced to do so against their will
It turned out that creating a situation where those who would be bumped could choose themselves
Rather than having a situation where people were bumped without having an ability to make a choice
Made all parties, both the customers and the airlines, better off
Here's a third story, which sometimes for economists goes under the name of the golf course joke
Three guys are playing golf. There's a minister, a social worker and an economist
As they go around the course, the group playing ahead of them is really, really slow
And by the end of the day, our three friends at the golf course are just steaming. It's taken forever
They go to the manager of the golf course to complain and they say, look, this group ahead of us was just really too slow
They're messing up everyone's day. And the manager says, oh, I'm really sorry
We'll try to make it right with you. But you should know the group ahead of you was a group of players who were blind
But they use these balls that beep and they play the balls largely by sound
I'm so sorry you were inconvenienced. We'll try and make it up to you in the future
Well, you can just imagine what our friends say
The minister says, oh, I always tell people to be forgiving
And now I face a situation where I should be the forgiving one. I'm so disappointed in myself
The social worker says, oh, you know, I've always worked for accommodations for the disabled
Now I face a situation where I need to be the one making the accommodations
I feel like I've betrayed my real professional status here
The economist listens to this conversation and what the others have said and pauses for a minute
And then the economist looks up and says, why don't you just let the blind people play at night?
Now, I'll hasten to say here, I'm not arguing that blind people should only be allowed to golf in the dark
But what I will say is there would be nothing at all wrong with a golf course having some nighttime hours
If there were a lot of people with visual impairments who tended to play during that time
Along with I'm sure some Gonzo golfers who would play golf on an iceberg if someone would lay out 18 holes
Hey, the additional choice is okay by me
Now to most economists, the golf course joke is a vivid story to illustrate that thinking outside the box
Looking at a situation and being willing to propose some additional choices that have a sort of logic
Is a very powerful way to tackle the world
Now in this case, the solution maybe doesn't have enough thought or compassion, which is after all what makes it a joke
But economists are willing to follow that train of thought until it reaches a destination
I'm building up to a broader theme here
Economics isn't just about standard expected topics that many people think of when they hear the word economics
Like whether GDP will grow next quarter or the unemployment rate will fall
It's not just about say international trade issues like China or trade deficits or imported oil or outsourcing jobs
Or what to do about budget deficits or topics like labor unions and pollution and innovation, technology, poverty and inequality
Economics is not just about the economy
In fact, economics is about so much more than the economy
One of the most commonly cited definitions of economics is taken from an essay by a British economist named Lionel Robbins back in 1932
He emphasizes that economics is about the inescapable need to make choices in a world of scarcity
We can't all have everything we want
Here's a comment from Robbins famous essay
Robbins wrote, the time at our disposal is limited
The material means of achieving ends are limited
We have been turned out of paradise
We have neither eternal life nor unlimited means of gratification
Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human behavior
I love that comment from Robbins about how we've been turned out of paradise
But what he's really emphasizing is that in a world of trade-offs people have to make choices
There's no alternative but making choices
Sometimes economics is even called the science of choice
Which is a term so pretentious it makes me want to gag
But it's fair to say that economics is highly focused on how choices are made
And how different choices interact with each other
Now thinking of economics as centered on embracing the concept of choice
Carries some perhaps surprising implications
Economics is a broad subject
It's not just thinking about what you buy or save or where you work or government economic policy
It's thinking about human beings in terms of the time they have and how they choose to spend that time
Moreover, it's thinking about the time they have over a lifetime, not just in a week or month
So economics isn't just about working, buying, saving, the stuff you might normally think of as economics
It's also about choices like marrying, having children, committing crimes or even terrorist acts
Giving to charity, donating a kidney and much more
A second implication is that choosing implies purposefulness
You sometimes hear talk about how economists assume that everyone is always rational
And there's some truth to this claim but you need to be careful about exactly what it means
Rational doesn't mean that everyone knows everything, everyone can calculate everything perfectly
People have no biases whatsoever
It certainly doesn't mean all people do have or should have identical preferences about what they want to choose
What it really means is that people try as best they can to figure out what they want
And if conditions change, if the costs of what they want get higher or the benefits seem lower
They will to some extent adjust their behavior, adjust their choices
Now this framework applies if the costs and benefits are expressed in terms of prices
It also applies if there are other kinds of costs and benefits like time or personal energy or prestige
This point of view recognizes that people don't always have full information
They won't always be able to process information fully, they will make mistakes
Sometimes this may all lead to undesired consequences
When economists say people are rational, they don't mean that they have god-like knowledge and intelligence and decision making
Or perhaps in very simplified models, you might make some assumptions along those lines
But in a broader view of economics, all rationality means is that you're purposeful
You're making choices about what's out there and you're not getting fooled over and over and over again
In the same ways, like the classic rock band The Who sang, won't get fooled again
Or at least those making choices won't get fooled again in the same way over and over and over
Rationality would prevent them from doing that
A third implication is that they're going to be potentially complicated interactions here
Many of the things that people want are provided in the institutions we call markets
Others are provided in the institutions we call government
Now when institutions enter the picture, the wants and desires of individuals must be brought into harmony in some way
In a market, for example, you can't have in the long term a situation where the costs of producing something are really high
But it sells for much less
You also can't have a situation in the long term where costs are really low, but it sells for much more
In the second case, it's because competition among producers will eventually bring down the price
With government, you can't have a situation in the long run in which government spending is really high, but taxes are really low
That's unsustainable
People won't keep lending to this government forever, as countries like Greece and Ireland have discovered recently
And Argentina, Russia and Mexico and many others have discovered over history
You can't have a situation in the long run where government spending is low and taxes are high
Because competition among politicians to either have tax cuts or more spending won't allow it to occur
You can expand this overall perspective to look at interactions in the institutions of families, institutions of nonprofits and clubs and others
The point is that economists insist on looking at how choices are affected by the incentives that exist on all sides of these institutions
As well as situations in the natural world, such as what incentives and choices might reduce the costs that humans experience of natural disasters
Finally, this force of all these purposeful choices interacting with each other can be positive or negative
Economists going at least back to Adam Smith's classic wealth of nations in 1776 have emphasized what's come to be known as the invisible hand
The idea is that those pursuing their own interest can also benefit society as a whole
Now this is an easy enough idea, I think, to understand more than two centuries later
The notion is that a business firm is trying to make a product that has a good value and can build up a good reputation, a steady stream of customers
It does this selfishly, hoping to earn a profit
Consumers on the other side hunt around for the best combination of cost and quality that will suit their preferences
Again, pursuing their own self-interest, but in doing this, they provide incentives for firms to innovate and give consumers what they want
The combination of these together, as if by an invisible hand, tends to benefit all parties
It's a remarkable social insight, and its power and ramifications are probably still underappreciated
But it can turn out in other ways too
Almost a hundred years ago, the famous Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto wrote
The efforts of men are utilized in two different ways
They are directed to the production or transformation of economic goods, or else to the appropriation of goods produced by others
A modern UCLA economist named Jack Hirschleifer, stealing from the Star Wars movies, christened this second motivation, the dark side of the force
After all, firms might try to fool consumers with cheap products, false promises, and misleading language
Theft is pursuit of self-interest, so is embezzlement, so is dumping pollutants in air or water
War is often a pursuit of national interest, as are aggressive lawsuits, and using politics to control resources in ways voters might not fully approve of
Voting for politicians who promise all tax cuts and all spending increases must not work out somehow in the long run, even if it is the pursuit of self-interest
And organized institutions, like firms, might be expressions of self-interest, but so is organized crime, hatred, envy, racism
These are all motivations humans have too, not just genteel pursuit of self-interest
Economics is broad enough to cover not just the bright side of the force of self-interest, and how self-interest brings social benefits, but also the dark side of the force
And how self-interest can run amok in destructive ways
Taking this approach of focusing on choices, how they're made, and how they interact has clearly made economics the market leader of the social sciences
More students take economics courses than any other social science, especially if you combine economics with business majors who typically get a big dose of economics
Economics also gets more attention from policymakers. After all, in the White House, there's a council of economic advisors. There's not a council of sociology advisors or political science advisors or psychology advisors
Economists get more attention from the media. The New York Times, for example, for some years now has been running a set of opinion columns by academic economists, but not by other social science professions
For all of these reasons, economics is sometimes called the imperialist of the social sciences
Economists have taken their conceptual tools of purposeful choices, being made in situations of scarcity, and taken them into political science, history, sociology, and in recent years more and more into psychology
In fact, there's an old joke among economists that economics is all about the choices people face, while sociology and anthropology are about how people don't actually have any choices to make
More broadly, that joke encompasses two views of why people act, and they both have some truth in them
One view is that people's decisions are largely predetermined by their upbringing, by their genetics, by social pressure, peers, other limitations they face in their lives
The complementary view is that while all of those things matter, there is still an extremely large realm in which people really do make choices, and that realm of personal purposeful choice and how those choices interact is where economics operates
At least to me, this focus on the choices people make gives economics a perhaps surprisingly optimistic glow
An overview of the topics in this course hints at the breadth of topics that many people would not expect to be in economics, but in fact are active areas of research by academic economists
For example, think about the choices people make concerning organ donations, or the choices that create traffic congestion, and how you might set up different choices
Of course, that's the modern version of the classic problem of waiting in line
What about the role of choice in belonging to a religion? The role of choice in marriage, after all, choosing a partner is in some ways similar to choosing a job
The choice to have children, the costs of choosing to become a parent, evolve as society gets richer over time
What about occupational choices like, say, crime or terrorism? And the interaction of purposeful choice with a number of different motivations, like racism and discrimination, or fairness and reciprocity, cooperation, charity and gift giving
Choices about risk taking, hurting behavior, addiction and obesity, the interaction of choices in economics with natural disasters, with voting, and with how economic activities and gains relate to surveys about whether people view themselves as happy
For example, how do we interpret the finding that despite economic growth over decades, there doesn't seem to be an upward trend in how happy people say they are
For those trained in economics, the broad idea that economics can and should be applied wherever people make choices will not be new or even especially controversial
But for many others, the idea that the economics framework of personal choice can be applied in these settings may be unexpected indeed
Now I hope at this point I've diffused at least some of the concerns you might be bringing to a lecture series about economics, or at least given you a sense that it's worth going ahead and listening a while longer before you render judgment
But still I imagine there's a little silent question in the back of a lot of minds
I've dressed up economics in a language of purposeful choice, but I can hear some of you asking a basic question
Ultimately, is all this just nice rhetorical cover for arguing greed is good?
The short answer is no
The long answer is greed is not identical to trying to act in one's own perceived self-interest and to make choices along those lines
After all, greed is one of the seven deadly sins. It's often defined with words like avarice, covetousness, inordinate or excessive desire to possess
But I draw a big line between greed in that sense and making the best choices you can in a world of scarcity
There's a famous aphorism from Hillel, the Jewish philosopher who lived in the century before the birth of Christ
Hillel said, if I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, who am I?
Hillel's comment expresses a sense of balance. Yes, you can be for yourself, but not only for yourself
You don't have to be self-abnegating, only for others. Someone needs to be on my side. I'm probably the most likely candidate
The idea that greed is good is a stupid sentiment. It's maybe even intentionally stupid for the sake of shock value and entertainment
But greed is bad can also be a stupid statement because if taken to an extreme, it requires a sort of soft haze sentimentality about how people really make decisions
and about what it's legitimate for people to consider when they're making choices
At an extreme, greed is bad takes a desire to look after your family and friends and provide them with consumption and education
and treats that as somehow something that's not morally approved
It would take a desire to build a business or the idea of serving customers and treat that as equivalent to theft
It takes creating an organizational structure called a company which provides both income for workers and a sense of self-worth and participation for many people
And the greed is bad philosophy would call hiring these people exploitation
Now the world is a complicated place. Self-interest properly understood has a powerful important role to play
and we don't clarify that situation by just saying it's all greed
Understanding and accepting the pursuit of self-interest in fact may lie close to the root of what we really mean by being modern
This argument was perhaps made most famously in Albert Hirschman's 1977 book The Passions and the Interests
And a big part of that book is a history of the rise of capitalism and modern ways of thinking
Imagine that you go back to the early Middle Ages. A lot of economic activity at this time is very static
You're born into a role. You're a peasant, noble, maybe you have a trade like a blacksmith or a shoemaker
Prices and wages are set by tradition. There's a just price, the price that's set by kings and churches based on their view of what's right
The poor and those in certain roles are taught they should be grateful for their role, they should be grateful for their poverty and they should know their place
The rich should be grateful for being rich because that was their place
And then a slow transition occurs through the 16th and 17th century
You start to have more long-distance trading expeditions and bigger markets
There's a rise in banking and finance. There's a need for independent commercial law
The possibility begins to come up that people could choose to alter the station in life into which they were born
They began to have the possibility of making some choices
Now of course at this point it wasn't like a commoner could really become a royal
But commoners could be wealthy and wealth could lead them to be treated as important
People began to break free of the situation of pre-modern society where exchange mainly happens through traditional family ties
They began to feel like they had choices in the context of law and society
Now it's not coincidental that as this change is happening, economists begin to play a role too, especially by about the 18th century
By the time Adam Smith publishes his great work The Wealth of Nations in 1776
He's writing about how the wealth of nations is not built on war or plunder or on an accumulation of gold and silver
Instead the wealth of nations is built on people dividing up the tasks of production to jobs
Specializing in work, cooperating in factories and selling over long distances
The idea of how wealth is created begins to shift
It's no longer a matter of winning a war or fighting the crusades
Now it's a matter of sending ships around the world and producing output
The economic idea of purposeful self-interest is based on this idea that you yourself get to make choices
You're not stuck in a certain role and trying to change your role is not wrong
In fact shedding part of that communal focus is probably a necessary step to modern economic development
And lots of countries around the world are still making that transition
You can make a fair case, I think, a persuasive case that what distinguishes the modern outlook on life is this transition to a fuller sense of self
A self that's not predestined, but a self that gets to make choices and accepting that self as legitimate
In short, economics isn't remotely just about money and business
It's not about taking a simple assumption like greed is good and using it to justify whatever unfairness occurs in the world around us
Instead, economics seeks a deeper level of understanding
It seeks to uncover and explore the reality that people make choices that they choose with a purpose
Even though that purpose could be short-sighted or far-sighted
There are choices intersect in social institutions like markets and government
And the outcomes of those choices can be either good or bad
When economics is done right, there is a delightful richness to it
I hope to illustrate for you that economics actually offers far more than is generally realized
Because the choice-oriented framework of economics reaches so far
It lets us study a wide array of intriguing topics, often from unexpected angles
And in that manner, it helps us gain rich insights into all sorts of human and social behavior
