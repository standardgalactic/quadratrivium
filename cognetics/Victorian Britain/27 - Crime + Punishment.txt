Lecture 27 â€“ Crime and Punishment
There was a lot of crime in Victorian Britain. Some of it was political, designed to maintain
a popular sense of justice and order. But much more of it was due to poverty and to opportunism.
The occasion to perpetrate a crime arose and people seized it. And particularly in the
lower reaches of the working class, a complete alienation from middle class norms of good
conduct.
The Victorian middle classes became very interested in crime, as in so many other social problems.
Henry May Hubey talked a lot about it, Charles Dickens got interested and many more. And it
was an era of penal reform in which new kinds of prisons were built, in which public executions
were abolished, and in which in general there was a tendency to make punishments less brutal.
By the end of the Victorian era there was also a little bit less crime, which makes
it tempting to say that the diminution of the severity of the punishments diminished
the crime as well. But there certainly isn't that kind of close cause and effect available.
Well first of all a word about political crime. It often had overtones of the idea of preserving
a natural sense of local justice. At the beginning of the 19th century there were bread riots
over the just price. If the price became too high there would be a riot around the granary
and sometimes it would be forced open. But then people would pay what they thought the
just price of bread was. In other words it's a protest against the idea of shifting market
values. Those are the days when the phrase reading the riot acts could be taken literally
for big mob gathered, a big crowd. The sheriff would read the riot acts declaring that if
they didn't disperse the army would be called out to deal with them. In Wales in 1839 there
was a series of events called the Rebecca Riots. What had happened there was that a
series of toll roads were being built throughout Wales or sometimes toll booths were being
established in places where the road hadn't really been improved at all. The claim was
the toll is being collected for improved roads. And that of course meant that previously easy
journeys were becoming more difficult and more expensive. Groups of men dressed up as women
with a leader called Mother Rebecca. This is based on a passage in the book of Genesis
about women possessing the gates of those which hate them. They go up to the toll gates, demand
to be let through free of charge and if the toll keeper attempted to collect the toll they'd
seize him and beat him up and burn the toll gate down or overthrow it completely, smash
it up. When the new workhouse was built in some parts of Wales, in Carmarven for example
a new workhouse was built and it was demolished by Rebecca Riots who objected to the idea
that the traditional practice of giving outdoor relief was now being abandoned. Parliament reacted
to these disturbances by removing a lot of the toll gates and by trying to make sure that they
could restore a sense of popular justice in the neighborhood. But when land enclosures became
commonplace in parts of Wales they flared up again in the 50s and 60s in which popular enthusiasm
maintains a sense of local justice. It's got a Robin Hood quality to it. In other words it's
clearly illegal but it's supported by local sense of what's right and proper. Similarly when
strike breakers at Welsh Collieries appeared they'd often be attacked by men with blackened
faces called Scotch cattle. So when an enquiry said who was it who attacked these strike breakers,
it was the Scotch cattle as the name they gave to themselves as vigilantes, preventing strike
breakers. Observers recognized that crime throughout Britain correlated closely with war time. When
war broke out crime was less common. Why was that? Well it was partly because a lot of the people who
would resort to crime in ordinary circumstances joined the army. Very often what Wellington called
the dregs of society were the people who fought in the ranks of the army and conversely when peace
came crime tended to increase. For example in 1854, 5 and 6 during the Crimean War a lot of men
were in the army and the crime rate was a bit lower but it increased again as the men were
demobilized at the war's end. Now one of the middle class names for the urban poor was the
criminal classes. They actually called them that straight up and it was often true that poverty
could force you into committing crimes and it's also true that there were certainly many areas
in which crime was so common that you'd be raised in a family of criminals and related to them and
living in the places where they lived and so on. Certain slum areas in London particularly were
called the rookeries and a rookery is a hotbed of crime whose inhabitants tend to be involved in one
way or another in illegal activities. In Oliver Twist Fagan's group of boy criminals live in one
of the rookeries and there's a vivid description in the book of what it was like. As urban improvements
took place in Victorian London particularly, very often things like the lines of railways
would be deliberately sent through the middle of a rookery as a way of forcibly breaking it up
and trying to disperse its inhabitants who so long as they were working together would keep the crime
rate very high. One of the most centrally placed rookeries in London was called the Holyland
because it was it was cited between two churches St Giles's and St George's Bloomsbury and it was
one of these ghastly stinking slums which I've mentioned on several occasions but it also had
elaborate built-in defences for the hundreds of thieves who lived there. A crime historian called
Kellow Chesney describes it in this way. Over the years the whole mass of yards and tenements had
become threaded by an elaborate complex of runways traps and bolt holes in places that cellar had
been connected with cellar so that a fugitive could pass under a long series of houses and emerge in
another part of the rookery. In others long established escape routes ran up from the maze of inner
courts and over the huddled roofs. To chase a wanted man through these escapes escape ways could be
really dangerous even for a party of armed policemen. Very often when the police did venture into the
rookeries the local people would sympathize with their neighbors rather than with the police in
their attempts to apprehend criminals. In 1840 the police heard that a group of coin foragers were
at work in the Holyland that is they were making counterfeit coins. They were able to rush into
the house where the foragers were at work and surprise them to literally catch them red-handed
but although they had the surprise at first the news of the police's coming spread so quickly
that as they emerged from the house with the the the foragers in their control a mob appeared
attacking them and throwing rocks at them shouting rescue rescue. So for a while it looked as though
the the arrests were going to fail but the police had anticipated that they were going to be attacked
by a mob and so they had a reserve squad around the corner who in turn came charging forward
under the leadership of a big policeman called Restio who had a famous reputation among the
criminals as a tough man who could disarm even an armed opponent in hand-to-hand fighting.
So because of this police counter-attack against the mob they were finally able to get the criminals
out arrested but that gives you a vivid sense of how dangerous it was and how desperate the
circumstances in which this kind of work had to to go on. Criminals in London and elsewhere
had a richer slang and a great variety of ways in which they set about preying on the rest of
the population. There's a big variety of types of pickpockets called dippers and they went out into
the wealthier parts of the towns to steal from the citizens. Some of them called toolers specialized
in robbing women and their nickname for the victims was the Pogues. Henry Mayhew who wrote
London Labour and the London Poor interviewed some of the some of the toolers and he found that
one common method was to have a group of people one of whom would usually be a child
and the adults would attract the attention of a middle-class woman and talk to her
while the child stole from her taking a purse. Now in days when the women were wearing very
elaborate crinolines if they were if they were wearing their purse attached to the crinoline
which was sometimes the case it was relatively easy for the child to steal the purse without
the woman feeling it and similarly if she was dressed as she often was in whale bone corsets
she wouldn't be instantly aware of someone touching up against her. One subdivision of this
group were called the maltoolers these were people who specialized in robbing women who were riding
on the new buses the first horse-drawn omnibuses went into London in the 1850s and 60s and what
and typically what would happen is that two two of the robbers would climb onto the bus one on
each side of the intended victim one would engage her in conversation while the other one stole
from her on the other side you can imagine inside the bus it's cramped so there's an enormous great
massive fabric and crinolines and stuff making it much easier for the victim to lose control of her
own purse. Bug hunters were the people who stole from drunks they hung around outside the pubs
and then when a drunk came staggering out it was an easy matter to knock them over and steal whatever
money they had left and children played a large role in all these forms of crime Oliver Twist is
a great insight it was based on his conversations with Mayhew and his own study of the Rookers where
he used to get policemen to take him to look around see what it was like. Oliver Twist such a clever
novel because it shows that poor old Oliver who grew up in the workhouse has much more fun among
the artful dodger and Fagan and the criminals at least at first than he'd had in any other part of
his life which explains why the kids should be so loyal to the gangs that they became attached to
Fagan incidentally is a kidsman a kidsman was a man who trained children in effective theft
and there's a great scene where where Fagan's pretending to be a rich old gentleman walking
through the street and the art artful dodger and all the others are practicing stealing from him
at such times he would constantly look about him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping all his
pockets in turn in such a very funny and natural manner that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down
his face all this time the boys followed him closely about getting out of his sight so nimbly
every time he turned around that it was impossible to follow their motions at last the artful dodger
trod under his toes or ran upon his boot accidentally while Charlie Bates stumbled up against him
behind and in that one moment they took from him with extraordinary rapidity snuff box
note case watch guard chain shirt pin pocket handkerchief and even his spectacle case if the
old gentleman felt a hand in one of his pockets he cried out where it was and then the game began
again so they go through these training maneuvers in the house and when they're all very very efficient
at it they go out onto the street and start preying on the passers-by one branch of the
pickpockets were called the swell mob it was quite expensive to become a member of the swell
mob because it meant dressing up in the kinds of clothes worn by the upper classes being square rigged
as it was called and then going off to places like royal ask at the the race meeting which was one
of the events of the london season and you'd have to appear to be a gentleman while nevertheless
stealing the valuables off the other gentleman a high risk enterprise another special a specialty
was the kinship lay this is stealing from children and one of the branches of the kinship lay was
was skinning this means literally taking children's clothes off them it was a crime much practiced by
women in the cities the trick was to have a very sympathetic manner and lure an unwary child into
an alley where you could then get its clothes away a woman called susan nun appeared in court in 1850
and a whole succession of middle-class children were brought forward to say yes she's the one who
took my clothes away it was a good one particularly for older women who'd got a grandmotherly air
and they were no longer quick enough to be involved in the pickpocketing now bulky women's clothes the
hoop skirts and the crinolines and so on were very good places to hide stolen goods and one of the
ways in which criminals would transport stolen goods around was inside these voluminous folds of
the women's clothes another specialty was snowing snowing was stealing laundry now it was common in
those days for lawn people who ran laundries to go to collect the laundry in a hamper from the
house of the owner and then roll it off to whenever their laundry was and they'd be attacked attacked
along the way and the and the hampers of laundry stolen it was relatively easy to sell whatever
you've sold sorry to sell whatever you stole because this is a poor society but certainly by
our standards a very poor society so an enormous number of people wore only secondhand clothes
almost everything could be recycled or sold for a small profit and large numbers of people lived
in a kind of legal gray area where they would they had an ostensibly legal business like
being publicans owning a pub but they were also fences receivers of stolen goods the pawnbroker
has also lived in a legal pen number where they were clearly often involved in illegal activity
particularly receiving stolen goods divers and cracksmen were burglars and the divers were ones
who specialized in robbing houses in the daytime the kinds of houses that it was worth burglarizing
were also the kinds of houses in which there were servants because every respectable household would
have servants and so the difficulty if you're a diver was to was to steal from the house in the
presence of the servants or find a way of getting the servants temporarily out of the way while you
could do it so again they often worked in teams one member of the gang would knock on the door
the cook would come up from the basement kitchen to answer the door the diver would
nip down into the kitchen or into other parts of the house and so on very often the burglars
would try to get to know the servants who worked inside the house and offer them a share of the
proceeds in return for being let in at crucial moments or for giving them wax impressions of
the keys so that they could break in was not when nobody was there having servants in a way made
the house safer because it meant there was nearly always somebody about but of course there was a
constant fear on the part of the employers that the servants themselves might be exposing them to
theft rather than protecting them from it that's why it was so important to get servants who came
with good letters of recommendation I'll talk more about that later in the course occasionally
servants would be planted that is a servant going into a household would already be a member
of a criminal gang but would have forged letters of reference to appear to be upright and then of
course help work out how to get in and how to get at the potential loot a burglar would usually have
two useful birds helping him a crow and a canary a crow was the lookout the person who waited
outside the house that was being burglarized especially at night telling him when to start
especially if you have to make a noise when to stop when the police were nearby when it was
necessary just to get out and escape and the canary was usually a woman who would bring the
the burglar's tools to him so as he himself wouldn't be seen carrying his burglary tools
through town gradually of course the police got to know who were the familiar break-in artists
and would watch them to see whether they were carrying the tools so the canary could bring
the tools to the scene of the crime and afterwards if the if the loot wasn't too bulky could get
away with it as well rather than the robber himself having to do it because when we see crime
films these days there's nearly always a dramatic getaway in motor cars but there weren't any motor
cars then if you're stealing bulky goods like carpets how did he get them away from the place
where he'd stolen usually you had to um just bring in a wagon very often a taxi a one-horse
fly so-called and it would it would draw up as close as possible to the the target and he'd load
the goods in there and then off would go the taxi but because there were no motor vehicles um
urban and because far more people were pedestrians than now it tended to be difficult always to
carry off a night crime because there are people watching and it's quiet so unusual noises and
particularly the movement of goods in the middle of the night would tend to get noticed one of the
things which made it a risky proposition well there were muggers in victorian britain as well
they were called ramps men or foot pads in the 1860s there was a rash of grotting that is the
victims being strangled sometimes uh by having a rope or a piece of wire um stretched around their
necks incapacitating them occasionally just being strangled from behind by a man with a very strong
arm a member of parliament named mr pilkington was grotted in 1862 walking between the houses of
parliament and his club in pal mal that is in one of the most fashionable parts of west minster
and it was so quick and so silent that the police who were nearby walking their regular beat
weren't even aware of it having happened a tremor of horror went through society and a kind of
national obsession with grotting sprang up for a while in 1862 citizens patrols were going out
armed with sword sticks and so on in other words attempting to make sure that the streets would
be cleared of the grotters parliament actually passed a special act specifying that anybody who
engaged in these street holdups would be imprisoned and very severely flogged a punishment which was
greatly dreaded by the convicts themselves very often the foot pads worked with women a woman
would pick a man up often in a pub and pretending either to be a servant or sometimes pretending
to be a prostitute would lure a man into the the alleys or the railway arches or some obscure
place and then and then the male robber would come up and beat him or sometimes pretend to be
an indignant husband who finding his wife involved with another man and rob the victim in that way
this is called bearing up for every one of these crimes there's an interesting slang term one of
the most dismaying forms of victorian crime was what's called baby farming this is this is getting
rid of unwanted children contraceptives weren't very widely available and weren't very well
understood they certainly weren't particularly reliable it was possible to get an abortion but
it was very very dangerous and uncertain and so there were places where you could go and have a
have your baby if you are reluctantly pregnant and then no questions would be asked and it's
quite clear that in some of these places the babies would be born and then murdered for example
a woman called mary hall in camberwell ran a baby farm anyone who wanted to to give birth would pay
her a fee and go there to give birth it was a kind of makeshift lying in hospital but when it came
to a court case her neighbor testified that she never heard babies crying and she said once a week
i experienced the most sickening odor of something being burnt or boiled of a fleshy kind another
neighbor said a little hunchback woman used to come after each confinement and take away
parcels and a third witness said that she'd seen babies being thrown into a hole in the garden and
buried well this one was convicted another one margaret walters convicted 10 years later
of murdering babies and executed in 1870 it was after that the parliament passed the infant life
protection act of 1872 for the much closer monitoring of child care places this is one of the many
incidents where it showed the inadequacy of a purely laissez faire policy there are certain
activities going on in society which must be closely monitored while the police themselves
the metropolitan police force the london police was founded in 1829 and this is when robert peale
who later became prime minister was the home secretary and because he'd founded them one
of the early nicknames of the police was the pealers it's virtually an extinct name by now but
you may just possibly have heard it already it was centralized under the control of two commissioners
and began to be used regularly in place of the army previously there had been special constables
but every time there was some serious disruption the army had been called out part of the the complete
turnover to a more civil way of dealing with criminal affairs was with the rapid spread of the
police they were certainly bitterly resented by members of the criminal community some of them
were ex criminals who'd reformed themselves and a lot of the others were demobilized soldiers
regularly in the rookeries they'd be attacked as we've seen but on the other hand they were
greatly admired by people like the the small shopkeepers who felt that their businesses were
far safer if there was a policeman on the beat looking after their interests in 1842 the detective
force was found founded a group of policemen who weren't wearing uniforms but his job was to
investigate crimes and also to try to anticipate when crimes might happen by getting to know
who the crucial figures were they'd become they themselves become familiar in the rookery
and find out who was doing what and who'd suddenly come to town or suddenly left town
and where they were the same kind of device which is still used by the police today becoming
familiar with the kinds of individuals who may be involved in crimes and very often relying on
informants inside the community over whom they hold the threat of prosecution one of the most
spectacular robberies in of the whole century was the great train robbery of 1855 there's a movie
about it it required the the intricate cooperation of a large number of daring criminals in its way
a masterpiece of criminal execution and it all went off very smoothly they stole 12 000 pounds
in gold from a train and put into its place lead shot of the same weight so that the robbery
wasn't instantly recognized it was a train that was going from london to the south coast and then
was going to go over to europe and it was it was part of the payroll for the army fighting in the
Crimean war but eventually the criminals were brought to light because the girlfriend of one of
the conspirators one of the robbers wanted to get some money from the leaders of the gang to pay off
her creditors and was told she couldn't have it and retaliated by giving them giving the gang away
this was the great problem of course for a crime involving a large number of people it was more
likely that somebody would turn evidence so in the 1830s the police force was spreading throughout
the the british towns and countryside it wasn't only crime which which changed with the development
of society punishment changed as well in 1837 parliament reviewed the criminal code and reduced
the number of capital offenses there were 200 different crimes which you could be put to death
until then the number was reduced to 15 and then reduced again in 1861 to just four of which the
the chief ones were murder and treason but even in the days when there were 200 offenses for which
you could ostensibly be hanged the number of hangings wasn't really all that great regularly
what would happen is that a jury would find you guilty of a lesser charge it was that in fact the
jury would would take on itself an ad hoc function of sparing the life of the prisoner who clearly
was technically was in fact guilty of the crime which was a capital one and the executions took
place in public there were great spectacles entertainments and if a famous criminal was
being executed thousands of people would gather to watch for example when John Gleason was executed
in Liverpool in 1849 the railway company laid on a lot of extra trains to bring people in from
Manchester and elsewhere and a crowd of a hundred thousand people watched the execution a carnival
atmosphere took developed around the hanging people would be there selling food and
selling fake confessions allegedly made by the criminal in his last day or wondering about
singing songs about the crimes themselves and so on at Newgate prison the one in London the
hangings always took place on Monday mornings but a crowd would start gathering on Sunday evening
more than 12 hours before the hanging itself took place at about midnight the the carpenters would
appear and actually set up the gallows outside the gates and by then the crowd would already be
quite big people getting there early so that they could be close if you owned one of the houses in
the op and on the other side of the street you'd rent out your windows and roofs to gentry at big
prices finally just before eight o'clock the condemned man appeared with guards and a chaplain
and the crowd roared hats off and then the man would be blindfolded and the news put around his
neck and the trapdoor released causing him to to fall suddenly and be be killed and the body was
then suspended for an hour on the gallows before being lowered down into the waiting coffin and as
you know from one of the earlier lectures that the body would then be given over to the anatomy
clinics for dissection the novelist Thackeray went to a hanging it was the hanging of Corvoisier a
man who'd a servant of Alay who'd murdered his own employer and he says he noticed some quote
some quiet fat family parties of simple honest tradesmen and their wives looking on with the
greatest imaginable calmness and sipping their tea otherwise it was an almost respectable
activity to go along to the hanging the London executioner from 1828 right through to 1871
was a man called cowlcraft and we're taking you to cowlcraft would be a kind of catchphrase
meaning you'll go to the executioner for this he was paid a guinea week as a retainer plus another
guinea for each hanging he actually carried out it was a protest against public executions in the
Victorian period and one of the people involved in the protest was Charles Dickens he he wanted
particularly public execution to be abolished because he believed it intensified some people's
desire to commit crimes the very opposite to the argument that it's that capital punishment has a
deterrent effect no he says it has an incentive effect there's one of his letters written in 1845
on the subject i believe hanging to have a horrible fascination for many of those persons
who render themselves liable to it impelling them onward to the acquisition of a frightful notoriety
i presume this to be the case in very badly regulated minds when i observe the strange
fascination which everything connected with this type of punishment or the or the object of it
possesses for tens of thousands of decent virtuous well-conducted people who are quite unable to
resist the published portraits letters anecdotes smiling snuff takings etc of the bloodiest and
most unnatural scoundrel with the gallows behind him it produces crime in the criminally disposed
and engenders a diseased sympathy morbid and bad but natural and often irresistible among the well
conducted and gentle it was also a post but because of the possibility of a mistake but an innocent man
might be hanged well finally in 1868 public executions were discontinued although capital
punishment itself continued well into the 20th century one thing that looks strange to us about
the victorian penal code is that crimes against property were much more severely handled than
crimes against persons i mean for example in the early century again a costamunga a london
street tradesman attacked the policeman from behind and cripple him for life but the sentence was
just one year in prison in 1849 a Gloucestershire case a man attacked his girlfriend blinded her in
one eye broke her nose gave her a concussion and threw her over a 10 foot high balcony sentence
one year but at the same time if you stole goods to the value of 10 pounds the punishment was 10
years transportation to australia without very much prospect of ever being able to get back
this seems disproportionate doesn't it and as the as the century went on crimes against property
became relatively less severely handled and crimes against persons relatively more so
transportation to australia ended in 1853 it was also a period of penal of experimentation
with penal reform was it possible they said to build a prison which would actually reform the prisoner
one of the the long-term expedience the hulks that is just a rot the rotting old hull of a ship
in which the prisoner had been dumped the the hulks were gradually phased out they show up in
great expectations when magwich the escaping convict finds a pip on the marshes and in return for his
help later leaves him a great fortune cold bath fields was one of the new prisons which the
prisoners greatly field greatly feared because there they had to do incredibly exhausting
physical labor to exhaust them and make them less threatening they had to work on a treadmill or do
what was called the shot drill which is where a group of prisoners literally stood in a line
and passed around great heavy cannonballs from one to another for about an hour and a half until
they were utterly exhausted by it pentonville prison built in 18 the 1840s was a model prison
of a different kind it specialized in solitary confinement by then it was it was well understood
that the problem with sending anyone to prison was that you'd be sending them into the company
of all the other prisoners in other words prison became a school for young criminals
and very often taught them far more about the potentials of a criminal way of life
than they would have known if they'd gone there alone so the idea of solitary confinement was
to prevent them from meeting any of the other prisoners it must have been a horrifying ordeal
as well because the type the type of people who went to prison were also the type of people who
came from very very overcrowded places who'd lived with an enormous amount of noise all through their
lives and constant human surroundings so suddenly to be alone could induce absolute madness in them
and eventually the idea of solitary imprisonment was abandoned after john gallsworthy wrote a play
in 1910 called justice which one of one of whose themes is the progressive madness of a prisoner
who's condemned to solitary confinement well by the end of the 19th century and beginning of the
20th violent crime was becoming relatively scarcer the rookries had largely been broken up
new houses for the middle classes were less heavily fortified with bars and chains than
they had been previously there was still plenty of slums but there was no longer so clearly
identifiable as there had been at the beginning of the victorian period of a distinct aggressive
criminal class
