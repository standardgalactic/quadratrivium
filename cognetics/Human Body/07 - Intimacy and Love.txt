Lecture 7 Young Adulthood, Intimacy and Love
Having considered career in our previous lecture, we now turn to the other major piece in the
lives of young adults, and that is love, affection, intimate relationships.
Of course, like career, these concerns are not restricted to young adulthood, they are
in some ways lifelong concerns, but partly for the sake of convenience, we need to discuss
it in some ways where it first becomes prominent, and then in subsequent lectures when we talk
about other phases of life, we will return to these themes.
In Ericsson's scheme, intimacy and distancing is the phase-specific task of young adulthood,
and therefore from that perspective, it's very appropriate that we focus on this topic
at this time, but I want to take a few minutes and try to trace the evolution, the unfolding
of this experience which we call love, all the way back not only to childhood, but in
a sense to the evolutionary roots as it were.
When we study interactions of animals and in what ways, what they do enhances their
fitness, which is to say not only just to survive, but to reproduce, there are four patterns
that come forth.
Animals act in selfish ways where one animal does something which is to its own advantage
to the detriment of others, that's certainly not love.
They cooperate, which is sort of reciprocity, but there is also altruistic behavior where
one animal will behave in a way which is in an immediate sense detrimental to itself,
but it enhances the chances of well-being or reproduction of others.
And in this altruism, if you wish, we begin to see the sort of beginnings of what later
on in human interactions we are going to characterize as affection, love and so on.
Now of course we also see plenty of evidence of animals taking care of their children and
being caught almost in human terms affectionate towards them, but we have to be careful not
to read human meanings in how animals behave and animals typically behave because they
are programmed to behave a certain way.
Yet even with experiments involving young monkeys, it's very clear that if young monkeys
do not have the kind of contact closeness nurturing in their childhood, then they simply
become incapable of reproducing, of acting sexually later on, even though biologically
there is nothing wrong with them.
Now if this kind of early bonding is important for monkeys, we can imagine how important
it ought to be for humans.
And beginning with humans, clearly the origins of our experience of loving and being loved
must be traced to the earliest interactions of the infant to the adult caregivers who
are typically the biological parents.
So it's the infant nursing at the mother's breast being held, being cuddled by the father.
This is the context in which this whole basic notion of affection develops and the bonding
that attracts to people and keeps them together takes place.
So much with respect to background in terms of what happens subsequently very much depends
on who you ask.
Again as we referred to earlier, the Freudian notion that the intimate relationship between
parents and children at ages one, two, three defines and sets the tone what is going to
happen later on.
And the claim that this is basically an erotic type of love has created a great deal of discussion.
And this whole approach now, prominent as it was for many decades, is increasingly questioned
by social scientists who do not find the sufficient sort of data-based scientific base to give
full credibility to this theory.
Nonetheless, this is an idea that clearly has persisted in the sense that love and sexuality
are present early in life in childhood and basically evolve or elaborated as we go along.
About that I don't think there is any doubt.
Now culturally there have been also different ways of looking at love, at different conception
of love.
The ancient Greeks, the classical Greeks, Romans were very concerned, were very interested
in this topic and in fact they had a very sophisticated and sort of differentiated view
of different types of love.
For example, they differentiated between affection, which bonds parents with children from passion
which we called eros, which is an erotic, a sexual type of love.
Aria refers to friendship, the bond that arises from common interests, from a non-erotic form
of attachment to somebody.
And in Hellenistic times, the notion of agape, selfless love, became yet another dimension.
This is perhaps best characterized in the description of love in St. Paul's letter to
the Corinthians, if I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not love, etc.,
which is of course a very lofty form of love and perhaps more characteristic of St. Paul's
so it God's love for humans and whether human beings themselves are capable for this kind
of completely unselfish love is an interesting question.
So the point of all this is to say that when we say love, we really mean many things, can
mean many things and have meant many things and therefore we need to have a somewhat more
differentiated, somewhat more sharply focused understanding.
Furthermore, currently, love immediately brings to mind, particularly when we are dealing
with young adults and adolescents, the idea of falling in love.
This is something that most of us go through and is one of the glorious experiences in
life.
It can also be one of the most dismal experiences in life and has this bittersweet quality about
it.
And so I am going to dwell on this notion of falling in love, what it means, how is
it linked to sexuality and whether or not it is an adequate basis for marriage, which
is again in our culture the typical expectation that you have to fall in love first in order
to be married and you hope that if you do fall in love, you will have the kind of cross-knit
relationship, commitment, marriage, cohabitation or some other alternative so that love can
come to fruition fully within that relationship.
Now we used to think for a while that this idea of romantic love was mainly a Western
tradition going all the way to the Middle Ages, the tradition of courtly love and so
on.
But more recent evidence, anthropological evidence, cross-cultural evidence seems to
show that this is pretty much a universal experience.
So this is not just a Western invention.
On the other hand, the idea that love should be a precondition for marriage is a more of
a Western idea.
So at different times in different cultures, the idea of marriage is more of a social contract
where two individuals and two families in fact come together and make a decision that
this couple is going to be married and whether or not they are in love or not is not the
issue.
Yet, as I said earlier and without belaboring the obvious, most of us now think otherwise
and even if we are not in love, there is almost the need to pretend that we are if we are
going to marry somebody because the idea that you marry somebody you don't love comes across
as kind of a some crass motive must be involved here.
Why would you marry someone if you don't love that person, if you are not in love with that
person?
Of course, those two things are not always necessarily the same.
Now the idea of romantic love falling in love has been of course the subject of a great
deal of attention on the part of poets, novelists, artists.
In fact, all things considered probably the best insights and descriptions of the love
experience still come from the humanities.
And social scientists tackle this but the topic seems to wilt in their hands.
It's very difficult to do justice to the sort of subtleties of love yet I don't want to
diminish the importance of also doing sort of cold blooded evaluations of what this emotion
is and what it involves rather than simply getting wrapped in the romantic folds of this
or this wonderful experience.
Now one investigation by Dorothy Tenner which sort of pulls together what we know and what
she has learned is to see love as a experience that has a beginning and an end.
She has used the term limerence to refer to this falling in love experience.
And the features that characterize the experience of being in love are intrusive thoughts.
If you are in love, you are preoccupied with this experience and with the idea and your
feelings about the beloved.
There is acute longing for reciprocation.
There are fewer worst kind of miseries in this world than being in love with somebody
who is not in love with you.
The sense of exclusivity, most people can do this only with one person at a time.
So there is a sense that there is just two of us in order for this to fully work, exclusion
of all else, positive evaluation which means that the person is seen in a highly favorable
light and this is taken care of through two processes of idealization and crystallization
which I can illustrate.
Let's say that I have a rather large nose but if you are in love with me, you will look
at my nose and you will say I have a small nose or you will look at my nose and say you
have a large nose but it's cute so I can't lose.
And this is why we transform the love object to something quite different than who she
or he actually is.
There is a buoyancy of mood and this buoyant mood, this wonderful feeling is very much dependent
on reciprocation and should there be the slightest hint of rejection then this buoyant mood is
replaced with the gloom of anxiety and fear.
And there is an acute need for positively interpreting everything that's going to happen
so the intense in love experience really does not tolerate any chance that anything
may be other than absolutely wonderful.
Now if there is some adversity and the lovers are not able to come together, this does create
initially at least for a while an intensification of the love experience.
The course of love is roughly two years according to this research and the outcome varies all
the way from love, this intense love experience leading to marriage or somehow putting your
lives together and whether or not this burning the candle on both ends type of intensive
love can survive or not is an open question typically it does not but it will lead to
more sustainable forms of love which is no less wonderful but it isn't this tremendous
intense type of falling in love experience.
So you graduate from this to another in some ways if you wish more mature type of love,
more sustainable type of love or gradually you lose interest in the love object it sort
of slowly disintegrates the wind goes out of its sails or there is a break up a dramatic
end of this experience with a lot of heartache and headache and therefore it becomes a very
painful way of putting this whole idea to rest.
Now the course and the characteristics of course vary there are instances where this
experience is very short in which case we are likely to refer to it more like infatuation
rather than rather than love and what produces this and what leads to its various outcomes
is a complicated issue.
People who fall in love typically remember a particular instance an incident that essentially
made it possible for them to fall in love and this is usually some very subtle cue it
may be a ray of light in a flock of hair or some glint in somebody's eye they are usually
not sort of overtly sexual themes that attract the person and lead the person to fall in
love.
So we have to differentiate between the sort of intense sexual arousal and lust and wish
for someone from this more romantic notion that leads you into this state of being.
What is the relationship of love and falling in love and sexuality?
As I said earlier among youth at least this is often seen as a precondition so sex becomes
proper desirable in the context of a love relationship unfortunately this is sometimes
simply pretended rather than the case so at one way of looking at it is that love becomes
the falling in love experience becomes now a precondition or it is seen as an enhancer
that is to say if you are sexually intimate with the person you are in love which you
typically want to do that reinforces love or if you are in love that makes the sexual
experience far more pleasurable.
This is also in the sort of good news category the optimistic way of looking at this but
there are also individuals who find that the intense falling in love experience is in some
ways antithetical to sexual attraction.
There may be a feeling that somehow the introduction of the sexual element contaminates this purity
of the romantic love experience.
Now whether or not this is simply a residue of Victorian and older kind of ways of looking
at it or there is more going on is interesting but this attitude can sometimes be quite problematic
because for instance there may be men and this is more often a male although not exclusively
male characteristic where it becomes very difficult for someone to be sexually attracted
to somebody if you love them because love means purity and in this sense sex contaminates
that.
Sometimes this is referred to as the Madonna prostitute complex that is to say you as a
male put human beings females in two categories they are either to be revered, loved, court
worshipped or lust adapter, engage in sexual activities and so on.
So you can see if one is in this position then it becomes very difficult to bring together
these two very strong impulses these three two important incentives that typically as
I said we hope will bond people together.
Now with respect to characteristics of the love experience of same sex people even though
that has not been studied as much and it is only recently that most people sort of look
at it as an alternative to heterosexuality in a more or less socially acceptable way.
For example in one study of gay and lesbian couples the pattern that emerged of intimate
relationships now this is not just a question of the falling in love experience but that
more of a patterns of intimacy.
So you have close couples who are basically like monogamous married couples where you
see the proportion of females is higher than for males then there are open couples which
allow for relationships in addition to the primary relationship.
There are those who are single and function quite well psychologically and otherwise.
Those who are single and don't and a significant number of some 16 percent males 11 percent
females basically are asexual.
Now is this pattern a function of people being gay is this is rather than being heterosexual
or is this a reflection of the fact that gay relationships have been until very recently
forbidden punished ostracized and are still seen by quite a few people as being undesirable
immoral and in some way socially unacceptable and that these different ways of getting around
this issue is simply reflected by these statistics is an issue that we need to explore and understand.
Of course when the time comes if the time comes that people are simply free to choose
the sexual partner on the basis of their own sexual orientation it will be easier to
see whether there are going to be residual differences between how heterosexuals conduct
business with each other in this respect and how homosexuals do.
Now I said earlier that social scientists now are looking at these issue more intently
and one of the ways in addition to what we saw with respect to the study of the falling
in love experience is worked on by Sternberg who the psychologist at Yale University who
sees love as a more complex emotion not just a question of being in love but a sort of
a triangular model is what he uses whereby there are three major components of love.
One is intimacy, one is passion, second is passion and the third one is decision.
Intimacy, passion, decision.
Now the type of love that emerges from these three factors has to do with whether they
exist alone or in various combinations.
If you have intimacy alone you have an intense type of liking so that is the one type of
love.
Now by intimacy we mean the ability and the willingness to get close to someone to disclose
your inner feelings and sometimes it's more difficult to undress yourself emotionally
than physically probably more so for men than women.
It implies trust, it implies the feeling that I'm going to let you in to my inner life,
it implies common interests, it implies mutual affection so we're not talking about sort
of a very mild type of liking, we are talking about a very intense type of liking which
qualifies it as a form of love.
So intimacy alone liking is the type of love.
Passion alone is termed infatuation.
Passion is in this sense pretty much a strong type of sexual attraction and infatuation
is typically used to indicate that where the pull is mainly sexual and if that's all you
have then the form of love is infatuation.
At the third angle end of the triangle you have decision and commitment.
Now we think of love as a form of emotion not some kind of cognitive function where
we are making a cold blooded decision but in this scheme Sternberg claims that what
you have also an experience whereby at some point you sort of tell yourself I have now
decided that I am in love or I love this person not in love that I love this person
and that based on that decision typically the commitment is made that this is it this
is the person and we are going to be together and so on.
When the love experience is exclusively based on this kind of decision that I love this
person what you have is empty love because there is no intimacy and there is no passion.
Now maybe love began between these two individuals including intimacy and passion but if that's
no longer the case you have empty love.
So empty love is like the shell of what may have been a fuller more richer more intense
relationship love relationship or it may have simply started for whatever reason practical
or otherwise as love simply being based on this kind of decision.
Now there are some marriages which persist even though spouses have become strangers
to each other there is no intimacy and passion has left town long ago but they stay together
because they said they are going to stay together either because of religious conviction
or because of a sense of commitment the marital relationship persists but the form of love
that characterizes it is empty love.
There may be other reasons why people may want to stay married but you are simply talking
about them they make perfectly good sense for them but we are talking about where loves
come into these pictures.
Now the combinations between these three are just as interesting when you combine intimacy
and passion you have romantic love this is the falling in love experience this is typically
the kind of love that is very attractive to young adults to adolescents they like the
idea of intimacy they love the idea of passion commitment can wait so we have now romantic
love or you have a curious combination of infatuation or rather passion alone and commitment
passion and commitment and there you have fatuous love perhaps one sort of caricature
example of this is two people are on a cruise they begin a sexual affair and somebody says
you know you people look like you are very much in love the captain can marry you and
the cruise company will throw a free reception so on an impulse they get married the ship
board romance well the ship docks in port and now they are married there is a commitment
and but then there is they hardly know each other so it's the absence of intimacy which
makes this into a fatuous type of love then we have a combination of intimacy and decision
and this is or commitment and this is companion at love probably quite characteristic of many
stable reason of the happy marriages where spouses are good friends they are together
in the business of making a success of the marriage there is commitment but passion was
either not there very much or has eroded over the years so that's kind of the missing element
finally you put all these three together intimacy passion and commitment and you get
consummate love which is sort of the best of all worlds type of love difficult to attain
not easy to sustain but well worth try so this is now the sort of revisiting of this
ancient idea and just like the Greeks tried to differentiate it into its various forms
now psychologists are looking at this experience not as kind of one type experience but a many
faceted experience which also interestingly can change from one to the other now one nice
thing about this representing this graphically as a triangle with three ends at which as
I describe are the three major components is that you need to you need to characterize
the life the love experience in a couple not on the basis of one person's triangle but
on the basis of two person's triangles because it takes two to play in this game and ideally
the triangles should be exactly the same but in reality that is virtually never possible
so two people are always going to be different in some ways so you can see sort of graphically
manipulating two triangles how mismatch they are you can say a big triangle means a lot
of love small triangle means little love so you bring the two together there is an asymmetry
or in one instance the primary type or the main component may be intimacy for one person
passion for another person commitment for one person the combination of the other two
for another person so you can see you can play all kinds of games trying to match these
triangles and on this basis you could say that the better match the triangles the greater
the likelihood of a compatible love relationship because often what creates problems is this
incompatibility this asymmetry it really doesn't matter or it matters less if people want to
have sex to be a very important part of their life or a less important part of their life
as long as both want the same thing if both want the same thing then it will work much
better than one wanting something and one wanting something else this is just common
sense but it's a very powerful determinant as we shall see in our next lecture when we
talk about marriage of why some marriages seem to work better than others why are some happier
than others we now move on to sort of the bad news there is a tendency there has been a tendency
to see the experience of love and sex either in kind of purely positive terms where everything
is great or in rather suspicious negative terms where the word sexual or passionate particularly
immediately raises all kinds of red flags a to my mind it is much more sensible to say
like other human experiences like other human emotions we have to look at it across the board
and see in what ways is this an adaptive in psychological senses experience how is it
maladaptive how does it contribute to our well-being and happiness how does it detract from it
what is the cost what are the benefits and here we need to look at two facets among the number
of others you can think of which are really problematic one is the issue of jealousy now
jealousy can be part and parcel of the love experience and it will fall on a spectrum
as as you can visualize now what I mean by jealousy is the sort of negative emotional response
consisting of feelings of anxiety anger depression which is triggered by real or imagined real or
imagined sexual or emotional involvement of a romantic partner with another now at one end
you have normal self-interest you have to compete for the love object it is not going to be
handed to you on a silver platter so you have to protect your interests you have to express
your sense of belongingness so that is part of a let's say normal way where a person who loves
another protects the relationship by this sense of working for it expressing belongingness and
protecting the relationship from others or from erosion now this merges as you move to one side
into a sense of ownership and this begins to be this begins to be more problematic there is a sense
of inadequacy you can't trust yourself you can't trust that the person that you love loves you
enough that is not going to stray away from you and the sense is that love is in limited supply
and therefore if the person I love is also affectionate or interested in some ways not
necessarily sexual or erotically in someone other than me then this is going to come out
of my pocket and so this this takes on a more of a possessive sense and is typically again a
reflection of people who who have this sense of inadequacy now I am assuming that in all this
that the love partner is is not in fact moving away or being unfaithful I am assuming that that's
constant and it's only the person's perception of the other individual that varies now you push
this to the other end and you have pathological jealousy where people misperceive they become
almost delusional they imagine things that are happening become extremely intrusive and sometimes
violent a significant number of murders are committed by people and the victim is somebody
they claim they love that's a strange way of loving someone by killing that person
but it's also an understandable emotion humanly speaking pathological as it may be
so jealousy is one at one point part of the normal feeling of possessiveness protecting
your interests at the other end becomes a very blatant form of a very disturbed way of looking
and you have sort of all the gradations in between a similar notion which is more recent
jealousy we have known about for a very long time and again there are great novels and descriptions
in in in literature but a more modern concept is that of love addiction now this uses the model
of addiction which typically comes from originally was described being addicted to a chemical substance
a drug or alcohol where in fact your body is habituated is addicted physiologically so that
when you withdraw this drug this chemical then there are actual bodily reactions as well as
psychological reactions now whether or not you can apply this kind of chemical model of dependency
to other human emotions is an open question but it seems to be convenient way of describing these
so what is now used for love addiction or obsessive love is a set of conditions that are characterized
by somebody using love not in the ways that we describe sort of in the adaptive positive way
but as a way of feeling avoid in oneself now the mature lover is somebody who is overflowing
with things to give in this case one is simply feeling avoid although I don't mean to say that
a certain amount of dependency on each other is not normal or is not part of life that is one
of the points of loving somebody we need each other we need to feel this need but this is
different than trying to feel a gaping void in your life by having somebody else in a sense take
your place there is a loss of identity in the relationship you sort of closeness doesn't mean
loss of boundaries closeness doesn't mean that you lose your individuality that you are swallowed
up by the other person in this obsessive love there is a need there seems to be to do that
there is increasing dependency and craving just like an addict and the withdrawal is acutely
distressed full and the experience is harmful to the self or the other that's a key phrase as well
as kind of it's out of control the person himself or herself realizes that one is involved in this
intense love relationship it is not good for you but there doesn't seem to be anything you can do
about it or you establish a type of relationship which becomes very destructive you break out of it
having paid a very heavy fine and then sooner or later you establish yet another relationship
with exactly the same kind of person this is sometimes exemplified by people being married to
a severe alcoholic having a very difficult time coming out of that relationship or marriage and
then going on and marrying yet another severe alcoholic and therefore you are back in the
first predicament that you were finally to sort of end this on a more positive note
what do you do what can you do to sustain this feeling of love one of the problems and this
we will discuss more when we talk about marriage is that things may start on a very high note you
are in love everything is fine more or less and then you are able to come together there are no
external obstacles of establishing this union but over time things get chipped away and this
intense feeling this wonderful feeling that united people together seems to dissipate
therefore once again you have a capital you have a hand of cards how do you play it how do you
maintain the relationship how do you meant how do you keep love alive now quite a bit of this is
common sense and we don't need to be labor we will reiterate some of this when we talk about
happy marriages but for now let us say that respect appreciation intimacy self-disclosure
correcting of shortcomings making time for each other all of these things and there will be much
more that we are going to say in this respect make possible the maintenance of this relationship
otherwise you will notice that there is a rule of entropy as it were that says
in this world all systems gradually slowly go to hell unless unless you add something to the system
unless you add something to the system which is another way of saying that you need to maintain
them now one issue I do want to focus on is is the question of expressing love because it turns
out one of the best ways of keeping love alive is through its expression and this is done verbally
physically sexually and materially now verbally you have to say it you have to tell the person that
you love that you love that person people never tire of hearing that they are loved no one will
ever tell you stop telling me that you love me that simply doesn't happen for all intents and
purposes and no matter how obvious it is that you love this person verbally saying it is one of
the ways of maintaining it and it has to be said voluntarily spontaneously it should not be beaten
out of you so the person you love asks you do you love me the very fact that that question becomes
necessary means that that person didn't hear it recently that you do love that person and for
whatever reason if that person has an excessive need to hear that he or she is loved the answer
cannot be of course I love you or why don't you think I love you or why the hell don't you think
I love you which obviously is a giveaway that you are irritated second is physically now physically
means that we need to be touched held we are like those monkeys we need this kind of physical
expression of close contact and closeness through physical contact and this need not be sexual
it's impact very important that the physical expression of love sometimes not lead to sexual
arousal more often than not what happens again I'm going to sort of talk in fairly stereotype terms
a man a husband is affectionate towards his wife physically and she takes great pleasure from this
but in the process he becomes sexually aroused and so the affection moves from physical to sexual
and she says well you see this is what he had in mind all the time and therefore that may be fine
in itself but you don't get credit for physical expression of love you get maybe credit for the
sexual expression of love now this doesn't have to be simply a male reacting with the female this way
it can be the opposite and incidentally there is also no reason why this is any different
based on the on the sexual orientation of the partners from physical expression of love we
move to the sexual expression of love which is self-evident and we have already talked about this
and here again for most individuals a satisfying sexual relationship seems to be
an important part of their life even though how important this is how important it ought to be
is a personal choice or more precisely is a choice done by a couple you cannot individually decide
how important sex is going to be for you if you have a partner this is the sort of thing that has
to be jointly decided and sometimes it requires a certain amount of compromise but there is little
doubt that a satisfying sexual relationship where partners know that they are not in this only for
their own pleasure but for each other's pleasure and for the obvious reasons this becomes now a
superb way of expressing love and cement's love further then the last point is the material
expression of love now this doesn't necessarily mean the giving of something concrete like a present
although that never hurts in fact let's begin with that one of the ways in which we express love
is to in fact give something to someone you must remember though that presents that are given on
occasions like Christmas birthdays wedding anniversaries don't really count because these are
sort of more or less expected this is part of your contractual obligation they are nice but
they in and of themselves do not convey this kind of material expression of love much more
effective are presents that are spontaneous and for no particular preconceived defined occasion
man or woman goes on a trip comes back with a present now what does this say to the partner
this says to the partner you see he or she must have been thinking about me otherwise wouldn't
have gone into the trouble of getting this present now remember that sometimes this material gifts
to each other can be a compensation or a cover for love that is not there but this is not what
i'm talking about you're not buying the person out by giving lavish presents the present is
becoming a another vehicle of the expression of love furthermore in this category things don't
need to be exchanged that are material objects services can be exchanged as we will see for young
two career professional couples that's almost more important particularly when it comes to the
very demanding tasks of child reading here again if i have an agreement with my spouse or partner
i cook you wash the dishes or vice versa by simply fulfilling my end of the bargain i don't get any
extra credit that's obligation but if occasionally i say you are supposed to be doing this but i'm
going to do this for you for these special circumstances now that becomes a material way
a service way if you wish of expressing love against this background we will now in our next
lecture move on to how to institutionalize what kind of an institution to be a partner of which
will sustain nurture and perpetuate this wonderful feeling
