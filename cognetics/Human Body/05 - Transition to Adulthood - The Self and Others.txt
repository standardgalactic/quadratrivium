مع straws Touch, Moreatorium, Time Off, as it were all that some people find it possible
to resolve these questions of the identity crisis which tends to be experienced through
a sense of isolation, through a sense of loss of continuity and the same sense of sameness.
حظفت directives should have provided this sense of yummy
toolkit and by necessity this whole thing is coming up over review
talking about infection
Love me and love you and as if you don't have control over what is going on.
A somewhat shortened time perspective, the inability to project being as if frozen in the present,
very much a residue of the way that the child feels.
Now according to Erickson all of these things are simply part of the growing pains of the development of a sense of ego identity during adolescence.
but beyond these, you also have more problematic outcomes,
and these take a variety of forms.
You can have identity confusion.
This is now really the polar opposite of the proper development of identity,
and here there is an exaggeration of the various components I described,
where there is more of a loss of sense of control,
and where these confusions get in the way of the adolescent going on with his or her daily business.
It's one thing to stay on track in school, work hard, continue accomplishing,
but in the middle of the night, asking yourself, who am I?
That is different than saying, I don't know who I am,
and therefore, I don't know what to do, so I'm not going to school.
And if this begins to get kind of in the way of this inevitable march of moving alone,
and what I described as I said, are these characteristics,
then we really are not talking about more of a situation of confusion than otherwise.
Another possible outcome is identity foreclosure.
Closing the books in a hasty manner, accepting of prescribed roles by parents, by society,
without a personal engagement and commitment.
There is nothing wrong, in fact, there is no way we could avoid receiving ideas of who we are,
and why we are who we are from our parents and other key significant issues in society.
But to make that really work, those perceptions have to be made our own.
There is nothing wrong receiving something as long as you integrate it yourself,
and you take ownership of it rather than simply taking it and saying,
well, there is nothing for me to do.
It's kind of the difference between a passive acceptance and an active acceptance.
With the idea of foreclosure, the result is sort of an unauthentic self.
You are the carbon copy of somebody's idea of who you should be.
You haven't had much say in who you are.
Or the outcome may be one of negative identity.
In this case, the individual does the opposite of the foreclosure.
Instead of accepting everything wholesale and uncritically,
he or she rejects everything wholesale and uncritically.
Because daddy or mommy said so, I don't want it.
The very fact that this is coming from the outside becomes the condition for rejection.
Well, as you can see, this is another way of handing control of your life to somebody else.
Because there is little difference in doing what you are doing
because somebody is telling you to do it or because somebody is telling you not to do it.
Because ultimately, you are not really making a free choice.
You are either accepting uncritically or rejecting wholesale.
So here we see a range of the possible outcomes that involve the sense of identity.
It's normative development, it's normal growing pains,
and it's less acceptable ramifications in the sense that I described.
One of the problems that has plagued research in these areas traditionally
is that more often than not, the male has been taken as the norm of development.
And not enough allowance made for the fact that perhaps there are fundamental ways in which for whatever reason
girls develop somewhat differently than boys.
Now, more currently, more recently, due attention is being paid to this.
And one of the, for example, ramifications of this, as it has been pointed out,
is that in the next phase of young adulthood, which is based on establishing relationships,
maybe the male pattern is to establish your sense of identity
and having found out who you are, seek who you want to cast your lot with.
Whereas it could be that females reverse this
and therefore again in traditionally terms at least,
they may have tended to define their sense of identity
in the context of their important primary relationships.
So in one instance, the self comes first, relationships follow.
In the second instance, the relationships comes first and the self follows.
What about the role of parents and peers in all this?
Clearly, both are very important,
but in what ways are they important and in what ways do they differ?
In the 1960s, during the upheaval of the sexual revolution, political turmoil,
particularly on college campuses,
people got the impression that we had entered a radically new phase in our history,
whereby for hundreds of years, parents had called the shots,
they had decided what goes particularly the father,
who typically has been the source of authority and the enforcer of the rules.
And now youth as if had become emancipated or had rejected all family control
and they had become a nation unto themselves
and they were simply being governed and ruled by the dictates of the so-called peer culture.
Those of us who lived through the turmoil of the 60s and 70s
have no trouble understanding why we would be tempted to think so.
But in fact, this is certainly not the case now
and the chances are it probably was not even then.
Because we were judging the behavior of adolescents and adolescent development
from the highly vocal, highly visible minority
that was kind of setting the tone which the public media were taking
and parlaying into as if this is what was happening at a national level.
So we have to go back to a more balanced understanding
of the fact that both parents and peers are influential.
The question is, in what ways are they influential?
In what areas and how do they exert this influence?
As I said traditionally, the authority of parents has been unquestioned
during the Roman Empire, fathers had the power of life and death over their children.
Now over time that kind of absolute parental authority of course has declined.
And another notion as to what is happening in terms of the turmoil of adolescents,
in fact this concept was very much in place long before the 1960s.
In fact this can be traced to the turn of the century
and in large part to the work of G. Stanley Hall an eminent psychologist
and educator in this country.
And the idea that adolescence inevitably involves a period of storm and stress
became the accepted wisdom.
This idea of storm and stress being inevitable during adolescence
was given further credibility by the work of clinicians, theorists like Anna Freud,
the daughter of Sigmund Freud, who went even beyond and said,
not only this kind of adolescent rebellion is inevitable, it is necessary.
This is the way it ought to be and if there is no such adolescent rebellion
then something is missing.
The idea being that this kind of rebellion was essential for the adolescent
to separate himself or herself from the parents
and become the autonomous adult individual
because unless there is this kind of separation from parents
we cannot become autonomous and independent.
But of course separation is not the same thing as alienation.
You can be separate, you don't have to be enemies.
And current work now has very much reversed this notion
and the present sense is that harmony is the norm
and there is detachment without alienation
and there is not the kind of sharp break from childhood relationship with parents
which was hypothesized as a result of these ideas.
What does happen is that there is in fact decreased engagements.
The lessons typically talk less with their parents,
they listen less to their parents
and has to sort of, they have to be as it were, more on their own
and it's not the same kind of running to mommy and daddy
when you have a problem asking for things
when you need something which characterizes more the experiences of childhood.
Furthermore, there is a clear distinction in power relationships.
Clearly the lines of authority are being redefined
and the issues over which there is usually conflict
are not things like politics, values or ideology
but they are typically more mundane things
like chores, curfews, school responsibilities, grades and the like.
If you want to put a figure on this
you will have to say that in three quarters of cases
the relationship between adolescents and parents remains more or less harmonious.
It is only in one out of the four instances
that you have this kind of the clash and the banging doors
and the surliness where boys are sullen, surly, cocky
in conflict with father and girls treat their mothers with withering scorn.
They are patronizing, they fly into rages and so on and so forth.
Now a little bit of this may happen
but typically where it becomes really a problem according to this more current work
this is one out of four instances
whereas in the rest of three out of four cases
relationships remain reasonably harmonious
subject to the modifications we talked about.
Furthermore conflict is resolved between parents and children
in one of several ways.
One is negotiation, rules have to be changed
In some ways adolescents want more freedom
than parents are willing to give them
but they bargain over it
and each gives up some
and therefore some reasonable resolution comes about.
Any kind of negotiation requires a certain give and take.
If that doesn't work the adolescent may withdraw
or if parents do not allow the kind of negotiation
they don't listen, they don't talk
then it gives little opportunity to the adolescent but to withdraw.
And in all fairness to parents sometimes adolescents seem to withdraw
even if parents are dying to negotiate and communicate with them.
We don't always understand why people behave the way they do.
And of course confrontation which is the last alternative
is the situation where push comes to shove
and then you have pretty much open conflict.
With respect to the sort of life cycle of parent-child relationships
children are usually tractable, easy to deal with.
With early adolescence the level of confrontation with parents starts rising
and incidentally a common experience is that kids enter adolescence
sooner than parents were expecting it.
Many parents seem to be taken by surprise.
They say, what we knew this was happening
but we didn't think it was going to happen so soon
because they may be likely to think of adolescence
as somebody who is 15, 16 years old
whereas here we are talking about kids who are 11, 12 years old.
معای راقل سب حربом، حربون در نگردان اتنانز بخر,
داره能 دارنه که خمقلکشی، اینهاhee سب نکنگ باقی آنina segment Dad
ایدر because of parental behavior or because of the adolescence behavior.
So the adolescent may run away from home, take off and completely sever the relationship with the parents.
That's an extreme case.
But unfortunately, the streets of our large cities are littered with thousands and thousands of runaways.
Some of these kids have no home to run away from, but others they have, in fact, homes that they have run away from.
To summarize, parents continue and for all intents and purposes are going to continue to be of central importance in shaping the lives of their children.
And this is not only at the level of sustenance because as our society becomes increasingly more complex,
the period of adolescence stretches now for a period of ten years, whereas it used to be just a matter of two, three years.
The importance of parental nurturing, sort of this incubation period during which the child is gradually going to be transformed to an adult
as that remains longer and longer, as people now after even college are coming home and staying with parents.
It sort of seems like an endless process, then the importance of parents becomes even more obvious.
Yet, we should also recognize the fact that forces other than the family are also very operative.
And therefore, this is both a source of comfort and dismay, sometimes when parents ring their hands,
when things have not gone right and say, what did I do to bring this about?
Sometimes the answer is, there is not much you could have done and that there are other players in this game.
Who are the other players in this game?
Well, obviously, one key group is the peer group.
Now, what do we mean by peer group?
The common perception and the caricature, if you wish, is that bunch of teenage kids are running in packs after hours in schools or shopping malls,
in corner hangouts, in a culture of their own, alienated from adult society, causing trouble and so on.
Now, this is, of course, true for some, but it is not true for the majority.
The temptation on the part of adults to see youth as being irresponsible, hedonistic and as if there is some kind of a monolithic youth culture,
which is there to drive adults up the wall.
Here again, often it is adults that are somehow projecting their fears on what's going on,
generalizing from the few to the others, but there is also quite a bit of truth as people who live in large cities
and have to be confronted with gangs and crime by teenagers and violence by teenagers,
which is a very, very serious problem, particularly teenage boys.
So, we have to be both aware of what is out there and how does this peer group function and how not to exaggerate it.
The difference between the peer group and peers is that we are not talking about dyads,
we are not talking about two people who are good friends, but we are talking about a group,
a small group that typically influences in many ways what happens and the peer groups can take one of several forms.
One is the institutional. This is the very opposite of a bunch of kids hanging out together.
This are the boy scouts and the girl scouts and the church groups and school groups.
There are institutions created largely by adults and sustained by the participation of young people and that's one kind of peer culture.
Now, everybody recognizes that because adolescents are going to interact with each other and they need each other's company,
you can't simply tell them, don't hang out with Tom, Dick or Harry, go to the club sponsored by this or that organization,
where there is a recognition that here are people your age that you can interact with.
So, that's one thing. Then you have cliques which are basically people, group of kids who sort of hang around together,
they have common interests and then there are crowds which are collections of similar types who may not necessarily interact with each other.
We may think of nerds, jocks, droggies, brains or affiliations based on ethnicity.
Now, these are therefore amorphous gatherings and they are not an organized crowd but in fact they are a crowd
in the sense that a bunch of people who have common characteristics but do not necessarily act together in concert.
What is it that the peer group does for the individual? Where is this attraction coming from?
Now, as kids grow from childhood to adolescence, important changes take place.
You have the situation where they spend more time with each other.
In high school for example, typically classroom takes 25% of the time, peers take 30% of the time,
parents take 15% of the time of the sort of the interacting capital of the individual.
They are more autonomous, less supervised and more gender segregated boys and girls running with each other
as well as of course same sex friendships.
The relationships with peers functions in providing a number of things.
It provides a number of services if you wish.
One is it gives the adolescent person an independent primary status.
That is to say in the peer group you are not Mr. and Mrs. Smith's son or daughter.
That's not relevant.
You are John or Jane and through some other ways you have to have membership in that group.
You can see why this would be important in the adolescence development of a sense autonomous separate from independent from the parents
even though still at some level very much linked with it.
There is a sense of recognition, feeling needed and valued.
It's a haven from the adult world because it brings together people with shared interests and problems.
It is a setting for experimentation and learning both good and bad.
Experimentation and learning on how to become a better students or experimentation and learning in abusing alcohol and drugs.
This business of pressure for conformity is very real but also tends to be exaggerated and it seems to peak at around the ages of 11 to 13.
And finally of course peer groups provide opportunities for romantic and sexual engagements.
So it is not an accident that peers are being very much sought and very much interacted with because they fulfill these services.
In what ways do peers influence each other?
Because again we need to have a more differentiated view of how this peer influence is operating.
And one of the ways that we must understand is that typically peers do not dictate behavior to each other.
Now this sounds counter intuitive but five kids will not tell the other you must drink beer or you won't be our friend.
Now that may happen but that's not typically how it goes.
The influence of peers on each other is more through modeling.
If the five guys are drinking beer the sixth one is in a sense pressured to also drink beer.
Not because the other five are mandating it but because if you want to be like them with them accepted by them then you pretty much have to behave like them.
And therefore the power of peer influence is coming mostly from modeling and imitation and the wish to be accepted, the wish to be part of something.
And again remember that the adolescent is desperately trying to find some new texts, some new scripts to answer the question who am I?
The fundamental question running through at least if you accept Levinson's idea that the sense of identity is the primary concern.
There is this desperate search for texts and therefore they are grasping at straws and everything available.
Not only what the peers are offering but again to recapitulate as well as what the parents are offering.
So it is as if teenagers are in a cafeteria and there are all these choices and they are observing how everybody else is behaving.
Now if the relationship of parents and adolescents is a close one, a good one, an understanding one, a mutually respectful one, one in which the adolescent views his or her interest to be consistent with those of the parents
then there is a far better likelihood that the imitation will be the kinds of behaviors that parents are putting for.
If that door is either slammed in your face or is patently unacceptable if the last thing a kid wants to be is like his father or like her mother,
then you inevitably turn to these other models being offered in this cafeteria by people about your own age.
Now there is also the process of adoption and reinforcement of values.
In other words, we are back to now the idea of moral development and a good deal of moral development is not only shaped by religious organizations or parents but also through peers.
Although adults may be reluctant to call these moral instructions.
For example, a prominent belief that emerged during the sexual revolution which still pretty much governs the ethical choices of young people in the sexual sphere is that love makes sex okay.
There is generally the feeling that running around is not a good thing, that indiscriminate sexual engagement is not a good thing even though one may do it but still the feeling is this is not quite right.
The precondition is that if you are in love then it's okay.
Now this is a consistent way of looking at the world of evaluating moral behavior, something that everybody understands.
Of course it raises all kinds of questions about how do you know that you are in love, what is love, what does it mean to be in love, how can you separate the lust you feel because of the sexual impulse
and the more romantic, rarefied feeling of love which is based on selflessness, on care and concern for the other people.
Well this is where of course a lot of teenagers go astray.
But it's not because the teen culture is not attempting to provide something of a moral scaffolding and so in some sense every generation redefines
the received values of previous generations and we as adults may always think that youngsters are modifying what we believe in
and it's all easy to forget that when we were young we too were modifying the beliefs and the received system of ethics of our predecessors.
One difference however may be the rate of change and the drastic way in which things have changed.
For example there's no question that the changes in the sexual behavior of unmarried young women as I said earlier over the last past 30 years
has changed far more dramatically than anything we can think of let's say during the life of this particular republic.
Another issue to bear in mind is that there is a lot of information floating around in the peer culture and some of this information is real, reliable, some of it is outright not true.
And here another danger is to accept uncritically what peers may be saying, they may be for example the common belief that pot is harmless
and this now takes the position of sort of a certified medical statement pot is harmless becomes the accepted view.
The susceptibility to all of these things varies, it is more in younger adolescents in early adolescents than in late adolescents.
By the time individuals become later adolescents they are more adult and therefore they exercise more independent judgment.
You see interestingly think of it this way, for the adolescent to truly become adult not only he or she must become independent of the sort of the ironclad control of the family on the child
but you also have to become to some extent independent of the ironclad control of the peer group because in this culture at least we associate adulthood with the sense of autonomy.
We associate adulthood with the sense that you make the decisions for yourself and you are of course influenced by a great deal that goes on but ultimately you call the shots.
So it remains an area of both joy and grief and sometimes very serious grief for the parents looking at it now from the parents perspective.
And as we have already pointed out there are very, very serious problems facing this country's youth which we need to be concerned about both as parents, as adults, as citizens.
We talked about pregnancy, we talked about sexually transmitted diseases, we haven't talked about drug use, we haven't talked about smoking, alcohol, other high risk behaviors, the aggression of children against each other, the exploitation of children.
So putting all these together what emerges sort of in the aggregate from this whole phase of transition to adulthood is that this is a time which is first of all absolutely essential, this is a journey we all have to make, we can't stay kids, that's not an option.
Second it is a journey that is fraught with some difficulties, it is a high risk period but for most individuals who have the necessary parental and other supports who in fact come from a childhood of reasonable peace and quiet.
Incidentally I failed to point out that that quarter of individuals who have this kind of rebellious problematic adolescence typically are those who also were troubled as kids.
So it is a continuation of a pattern rather than suddenly out of the blue you are struck by a bolt of lightning of adolescent rebellion.
And that we as the adult generation have an obligation as well as an opportunity to help teenagers youth to go through this transition to become the kind of adults we would like them to be and we have an obligation to let them know what it is but ultimately recognize the fact that they are going to make their bed and sleep in it.
