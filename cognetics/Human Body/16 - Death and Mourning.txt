Lecture 16 Late Adulthood, Death and Morning
In this last lecture, as we approach the end of our journey through adulthood in this course,
it is only fitting that we address the topic of the end of earthly life, which is death.
This is a topic both fascinating as well as in some ways frightening, and there is a healthy
balance between being realistic about confronting death, facing the music, knowing what it is
on the one hand, and morbid preoccupation with death or its complete denial on the other.
If you take a very naturalistic look throughout much of human history on the face of this globe,
human beings like the rest of the animal world have been part of a food chain.
They have gotten eaten up and they have eaten and so life goes on and one doesn't need to
shed many tears.
Of course, we have a very different perception now in that we are sentient human beings,
we have culture and therefore we reflect on our faith, on life, on death.
What is it?
Why do we die?
What happens when you die?
The kinds of questions that have been addressed by thoughtful men and women, both ordinary
folks as well as great philosophers, and will continue to be addressed because these are
not the kind of questions that have caught answers that are going to satisfy everybody
for all time.
Some people think of death for understandable reasons as the end of life, but related to
all of life.
For others it is the beginning of a new life.
For some death gives meaning to life, for others death makes life meaningless.
For the next 5-10 minutes I want to make some general observations about this issue
and then we are going to mainly focus the rest of our attention during this hour on
two aspects.
One, how do people anticipate and cope with the anticipation of one's own death?
And second, when somebody, a dear person, has died, how do those individuals cope with
the inevitable reaction of grief and mourning?
And then towards the end we will look at this issue of how people have perceived the alternatives,
the possibilities as to whether or not this is the end of the story or is there something
that comes later?
Now perceptions of death can be thought to fall in sort of three general categories.
Death is the impersonal perception of death.
You read in the newspaper in the morning that there was an airplane crash and 16 people
died.
Well, you feel maybe concerned about it, perhaps a little sad about it, but these are people
you don't know so that's the end of your involvement with that piece of news.
Then there is the interpersonal perception of death and this involves the death of somebody
that means something to you.
And there is the interpersonal which has to do with your concern with your own death.
Now in addition to this, death has been perceived and is perceived as an organizer of time.
In other words, this is one ending about which you can be absolutely sure.
There may or may not be stages in life or one theorist or another may be right or wrong
but about one thing there is no disagreement, everybody is going to die.
So it's a very important sort of fixed point.
It's the bottom line.
And it organizes time.
As we notice particularly in the midlife transition, you turn away from looking in the past and
saying I have lived so many years and you'll turn to the future and say how much time do
I have left?
So it helps structure time.
Second, a very obvious perception of death is death is a loss.
Death is a loss and this can take many forms.
It's a loss of opportunities.
We are understandably very upset when a young person dies because that person hasn't had
the chance to play out his or her whole life.
This is less of a concern when somebody dies in very old age even though we may still grieve
for that individual.
It's the end of relationships.
You owe nothing once you die.
It's gone.
Your debts are forgiven.
All it's over.
There are no more roles.
There are no more responsibilities.
Enjoyment of life is cut short if it has been enjoyable.
Furthermore, all of this kind of sense that I was one of the participants in this game
of life in some way ceases.
Even though of course your memory persists, there are people who have been dead for thousands
of years and are still very much with us in terms of our reverence, interest or hatred
of them.
It doesn't always have to be a sign of love.
Another way of looking at death is as a form of release.
If you are in intense pain and suffering, if you have had a miserable life, then the end
comes as a relief.
It is a release from burdens and obligations and in a religious sense in Buddhism, in Hinduism,
it is basically a release from the bondage of human existence which even for the noblest
prince or princess is full of sorrow.
So that's another way of looking at it.
First, people see death as a punishment.
It is life is seen, long life is seen as a reward for being a good person and then death
is seen as a punishment.
Interestingly, this often happens when people associate certain diseases with bad behavior
and they will say, you behaved this way and you died at age 40, well you had it coming
to you.
So the sense that death in some ways is a punishment for misbehavior.
And finally, death as transition as I have alluded already and we will come back to,
which simply sees death as sort of a way station from one form of life to another and this
is of course a matter of religious belief.
Really interesting situation in terms of how individuals gradually develop this sense
of death, this understanding of the reality of death.
Now children even in preschool have some understanding of death but are not entirely clear about
its irreversibility.
This is partly because adults are not always candid with them.
When grandpa or grandma dies, they will say, well grandpa is gone.
Well the kid may figure out, grandpa is gone but he may come back.
So they are not given that feeling that grandpa is gone and is gone forever because it's in
a way of sort of saving the child from this grief.
Now by the time the kids enter elementary school ages 5 to 9 or so, they have understood
the irreversibility of death but they tend to personify death, which is something of
course that adults also do.
You think of a death man or the pale rider or the grim reaper as if there is somebody
out there who is coming and snuffing the candles of light depending on whether or not your
time has run out.
By age 10, both the inevitability as well as the sort of more personal quality of death
has already become established.
Now the fear of death, which is of course different than the reality of death, again
tends to vary.
Those who have had early experiences with separation, loss, etc., tend to be less afraid
of death.
With respect to religious belief, those who are deeply religious or not religious at all
tend to be less afraid than those who are sort of half lukewarm religious because the
fully religious have assurance of eternal life.
The non-religious know that it's dust to dust, so what does it matter?
But if you think there is going to be a judgment, you are not sure and that is then troublesome
because you may not have the passport stamped and ready to go to heaven.
The older individuals will of course see death in a more realistic way and they come to terms
with it.
Young individuals see it more like a loss of opportunity and relationships but kind
of postpone confronting it.
The middle aged individual seems to be most terrorized by the idea.
All things being equal because time hasn't gone so far that you say well this is sort
of the natural outcome yet it's not so distant that you can simply not think about it.
So all of these issues have our ways of sort of helping us realistically come to terms
with what death is and prepare ourselves to eventually dealing with it.
Now one very interesting development came about several decades ago with the publication
of a book by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross who had studied patients mostly suffering from cancer
which meant that number one there was a certain sense of inevitability of death.
Of course this is not true for all cancer patients but cancers for which there is no cure and
also dying from cancer allows you a certain amount of time to come to terms with it whereas
a massive heart attack doesn't.
One minute you are alive, next minute you are dead.
So based on this work she proposed that there are stages of dying which really means that
there are stages of coping with the prospect of death and these stages follow a more or
less predictable sequence.
The first stage is that of denial.
The doctor says I am terribly sorry to tell you but the results of the x-rays have come
in or some other test now shows without any question that putting everything together
you have an incurable cancer and the person says well what does that mean how long do
I have left to live and the doctor usually will not give you an exact time but roughly
will say we are talking about months or years or whatever.
First reaction is not me, this is not happening to me.
Denial an attempt to not confront the reality because it's too painful it's a perfectly
human reaction.
To sort of set it aside and say not me I am denying and this allows the individual to
have a certain period of emotional numbness, gains time and allows the individual therefore
to cope more effectively and normally the denial is not going to last and it leads to
the next stage which is anger where the question is why me.
Now here it is an issue of having recognized that this is happening dealing with the feeling
that there is something seemingly unfair about this.
Yes, people are going to die, we are all going to die and somebody has to die over the next
year but why should it be me?
Is this because I have done something wrong and all this searching the sense of unfairness
now this business of anger may be very subdued, internalized or it can be very explosive and
people in this situation will sometimes just lash out at everybody around including the
people who are trying to take care of them, doctors, family, faith, God, whoever it is
that they feel is responsible or has anything to do with their faith.
This is the kind of rage which is so magnificently expressed in Dylan Thomas' poem Rage, Rage
Against the Dying of the Light, so it reluctance to let go and fighting it.
The next stage is that of bargaining, you say okay I am going to die fine I accept it
but I need six months.
I want to attend the wedding of my son or I want to make sure that I have enough time
to put my affairs in order.
It is as if there is somebody out there with whom you can bargain and so we try to bargain
and of course you try to bargain with the doctor as if it is in the doctor's hands to
radically change things.
But there too will gradually yield to the next stage which is depression.
What has happened here is that having gained a little bit of time through denial, vented
your spleen through anger, tried to bargain your way out of it, you realize that none
of these things is going to make any difference and therefore you have to confront the fact
that you are dying, it is a loss and the natural reaction to loss is depression.
Having gone through these and of course even though these are listed like one step follows
the other in reality as you can imagine there is more of a cycle that goes over and over
that is to say it is not that you have a phase of denial and you never deny again but the
other it is primarily a phase of denial following which there is anger, following which there
is bargaining and then you deny again and then you get angry one more time, you bargain
some more, you deny once again, you sort of switch back and forth.
But if this sequence is true and it seems to generally fit most experiences of a particular
subtype of patient that I described, the general trend is mainly moving from one key area to
the other and the other backs and forth are sort of side trips that still eventually bring
you on schedule.
The last stage acceptance letting go is the natural sequence and in this instance this
is the sort of successful resolution of this stages of coping because ultimately that is
the only thing available to you.
You have to accept it there is nothing else we can do.
So you let go and individuals experience an interesting terminal drop.
So towards the end there is very much a sense of giving up and this takes many forms I recall
when my mother who was quite elderly and suffering from cancer was dying and I knew
it both as a physician as well as her son and there was a nurse, a very skillful hospice
nurse who was among others taking care of her and of course this was going on over quite
a bit of months and I had to both be attentive to her needs as well as go on with my life
which often required getting on airplanes and travel.
Every time a travel came I would have to ask the doctor taking care of her and the nurse
well shall I go on this trip or shall I not go because I don't want to be away when my
mother is dying and interestingly this nurse more so than the doctor seemed to have an
excellent sense of the schedule of dying and she would say well of course nobody can exactly
predict and promise but I will tell you when the time is coming and in fact some role later
she said well this is now the time and it was very clear.
In a literal sense my mother turned her face to the wall when that happened it was clear
that the end was near she was packing her bags and soon after that she never came back
from that stage so knowing about these stages once again is helpful this is an excellent
example of anticipatory coping people vary about this but at least some of us feel that
it is better to know than not to know if that knowledge is going to be useful to you knowledge
for the sake of knowledge may or may not be useful but this is the sequence by which we
can help ourselves and we can help others who are facing this painful dilemma.
Now so far we have addressed ourselves to the question of death natural death in the
sense that something is happening that is ending your life there is another kind of
death which is qualitatively different and that is suicide in this case it is the individual
who is bringing about his or her death this is a difficult large topic and we can only
sort of touch upon it and as you would imagine there are many reasons for committing suicide
all the way at one end to making a cold rational decision saying there is no point in my going
on like this I am going to die there is no way out all the avenues have been tested and
checked and exhausted and I am needlessly suffering so enough is enough I would rather
be dead.
Then there is the sense of despair which is heavily colored by being depressed and here
you really are not in as good a position of making this kind of cold rational decision
and this is why as I will briefly expand on that we cannot simply give people license
saying well if you are an adult and can sign your name at the bottom of this paper and
if you want to die fine will help you kill yourself because if you are in the throes
of a severe depression the world is going to look very bleak and maybe the world doesn't
need to be that bleak so that's the second then you have suicide of course which serves
purposes other than release from pain suicide can also be a very aggressive act suicide
can be directed at other people because suicide generates a tremendous amount of guilt and
if you let's say leave a suicide note addressed to your husband or wife or your lover or whoever
and say you really made life hell for me and I am killing myself and I hope you are glad
there are such letters now unless the other person is absolutely void of any human human
feeling that person is going to feel terrible so suicides can be in that sense very aggressive
acts and the person may be aware of the aggressive component or may not be but that hardly matters
so far as the mood of the recipient is concerned then of course in all the subtleties and decimal
points which differentiates who commits suicide when and interesting comparisons between different
cultures why suicide is more common in some cultures than others in Japan for example
suicides at least traditionally often were a way of sort of dealing with deep shame and
you killed yourself if you felt that you had acted in a way that was highly socially undesirable
and another way of looking at it is the differences in suicide rates both with respect to age
as well as in this case in the United States ethnicity and gender you can see that if you
use these three variables simultaneously you get rather dramatically different rates
of suicide we see that the suicide rate for white males is highest at all periods of life
but particularly after midlife so the curve goes along and is high and will reach a point
in the midlife where it really shoots up taking the other three curves in its wake next is
black males which is midway between white males and white females and black females
at the bottom are the two female curves and the curve with the which is the lowest the
people least likely to commit suicide are black females now this is in some ways quite paradoxical
because if you look at the way that we typically explain who's having a hard time and who's having
an easy time in this world right now most people would say whites that tend to be more affluent
easier lives are more privileged have it easier than African Americans and men generally have
easier than women yet black females seem to combine the disadvantages as it were of both
ethnicity and gender yet they are least likely to kill themselves what does this mean is suicide
not simply a reflection of whether your life is easy or hard or are we making a mistake perhaps
white males have the toughest lives you get all kinds of value judgments imposed on this
incidentally during times of great stress like war and so on suicides don't go up they go down
which is another interesting way of looking at it it is as if if there is a lot of trouble outside
you sort of get distracted as it were you know from on your own personal misery and of course
there is also a sense of rallying around and you know fighting your way through and so on but I
simply bring this issue up because this is a significant question and thousands and thousands
of people commit suicide in this country we should also realize that there are hidden suicides quite
a few instances of car crashes are not pure accidents but it's a way of concealing the fact
that you're committing suicide maybe because you don't want people to know this maybe you want to
make sure that your insurance companies are going to honor their obligations there are all of these
all of these considerations that come together one last word about this as we know there is now a
foot a movement of physician assisted suicide saying can we develop a system where under very
strict control conditions with lots of safeguards second opinions making absolutely sure that
the person involved is in a position to make a decision giving all the benefit of the doubt all
the times you can you can pile up all the protections you can imagine even then should
some members of society so delegated typically physicians in fact make it possible for somebody
to kill himself or herself incidentally nobody says that the physician should inject that drug
that's yet another step that's euthanasia we are talking about making it possible for somebody to
commit suicide here opinion is divided doctors as a rule both organized and individually are opposed
to it the law is at this point opposed to it but as you can see there is a need for it out there
this is why people keep searching and in some of them in fact putting this into practice we are
now done with the question of dying now let us turn to the issue of grieving we differentiate
between grief which is the acute reaction to loss and mourning which is the longer range
resolution of the loss and we differentiate normal grief and mourning from pathological
grief and mourning and I am going to draw these distinctions as we go along what happens in the
acute phase the grief phase which typically lasts a matter of weeks for six weeks or there about
there are five steps as it were or five not steps really but five sets of conditions through
which the person passes there is bodily distress sense of unreality denial anger guilt hostility
disruption of behavior and depression illness and let's consider these one at a time in somewhat
more detail the somatic distress takes the form of a tightness in the throat choking
sensation shortness of breath sighing a sense of sort of emptiness in the pit of your stomach
a muscular weakness this is why people they look like they are fainting they're not fainting but
they're sort of collapsing because their knees are giving giving in and in something which is
probably best described as psychic pain and anguish and of course crying which is the normal
reaction to all this so this first reaction the acute grief is a purely more or less physical one
so that your your body is crying your entire system is is in this acute grief reaction second
there is a sense of in the acute grief reaction sense of unreality now it's the same mechanism
that we described earlier for the person who's anticipating death in other words when you are
faced in a situation where you are flooded with strong emotions the natural defense is to back
off because you can't handle it this is a downpour of emotion you want to take shelter and in this
case the person who's grieving also will have this sense of unreality he is not dead she is not
dead this is not happening this is a bad dream or distance oneself from others yet one also on
the other side may become tremendously preoccupied with the image of the deceased so it can be
everything from single-minded preoccupation to sort of as if forgetting about the individual as if
nothing happened there is typically a phase of guilt and anger which follows why guilt you
didn't kill the person no but it's very difficult to be intimate with somebody let alone live with
somebody for long periods of time and not do or say things that were offensive or hurtful or not
fail to do certain things that would have been loving and helpful and these things come now to
haunt you and you go through the why didn't I what if I had you replay this over and over
sometimes these can be sort of relatively trivial things it may have to do with the fact that you
did not go home for Thanksgiving last time around even though your aging mother very much wanted you
to do and you torture yourself as if having gone home for Thanksgiving was going to make any
difference to that person's dying or not dying but that becomes sort of symbolic and important
event and of course it's much much not tougher to come to terms with this when you lose a brother
with whom you you you quarrel 20 years ago and never spoke to him and now you say you know if I had
another chance well you're not going to have another chance the consequence all this typically is the
loss of the normal patterns of conduct in other words typically you just can't get up the next
morning and go to work and you know carry on business as usual even though some people may be
tempted to do that and you have to have a period of time in which this becomes your job having to
deal with the grief reaction becomes a full-time occupation as it were once you have been through
this process of the sense of unreality next is the anger guilt hostility we spoke disruption of
behavior in some cases there is a severe depression that can set in and some people get ill as a
result and I will have more to say about this but perhaps this may be a just as a good place to
point out that the period of highest risk following the death of a near person highest risk for
depression and suicide is during the first year so if this is going to happen it's likely to happen
during the first year the first six months pause considerably higher risks of death for the
surviving spouse to use that as an example why because of the tremendous stress because one in
the depth of this acute grief may neglect one's own health and other circumstances which also come
to complicate and therefore the bit of a risky period following the death of someone this is why
even though grief is a perfectly normal reaction these people cannot be just left alone they need
to be looked after or at least somebody needs to keep an eye on them we move on from the period of
acute grief to that of mourning which is more protracted and may go on for a year or two of
course these stages these these periods vary and here the main features are the first one is a
yearning for the deceased you wish the person were still there in fact it's quite common that even
after a long periods of time somebody you will think that let's say your spouse died that the
person is in the next room you may in fact almost hear if not that person's voice at least the
footsteps so one is still trying to come to terms with this loss and try to sort of metabolize as
it were the the consequences of loss so this takes the form of of of this focusing on thoughts on
the deceased etc as well as there may be an element of protest and continuing despair range
anger and blaming others now the trouble is that right after a severe loss people rally around you
but after a while you are alone more or less or with fewer people and also the believed individual
can act in such ways that it makes it very difficult to help them they may tell even close
relatives leave me alone I don't need you I don't want anybody go away well inside that is not how
they feel inside they are crying for somebody to help them and hold them and comfort them yet at
the same time this combination of denial rage anger all gets mixed together one way of reacting
to this on the part of others is to engage in frenetic activity you sort of throw yourself
into work this is the classical idea of you forget yourself in your work you bury yourself in your
work of course you can also do so by by by drinking heavily or trying to change your mood with drugs
and other ways there is a certain period of despair this organization when anxiety depression
lethargy all characterized now I'm not suggesting that for a period of two years everybody is going
through this kind of protest despair these things can have can occur sort of pretty much under the
surface and or they can be very explosive it all the way from the mile to the severe but
eventually there are the final two stages of a search for meaning and a detachment and the
resolution of the grief which means that the cycle of grieving has been pretty much completed
now this doesn't mean that you forget the person this doesn't mean that the person hasn't died
the thoughts are there but the intense feelings are no longer there which is the way it ought to be
because we have a certain amount of limited emotional capital and this emotional capital if it
begin if it remains invested in the dead person it's not available for it to be reinvested in
somebody else and as a general rule for most people even though we cannot make rules for people in
this respect the healthy thing to do is to get on with your life establish new relationships and
many people of course remarrying if they lose a child they have another child it's never a
complete replacement but life is malleable and the individual must be malleable and therefore
the expectation is that you get on with it you start anew and without sort of giving up that
phase of your life you don't let that contaminate and ruin your chance of happiness now in a new
setting in a new marriage in a new family and so on this is the sort of normal course which
involves pain anguish suffering yet ultimately you come out of it having lived through what are
one of the inevitable experiences of life and that in the best of all worlds you come out stronger
and in some ways better for the experience tragic as it may have been now what happens if things
don't go right what is pathological grief basically in short pathological grief means that you get
stuck in one of these stages and steps we are talking about you can't get out of the denial
you continue thinking as if the person has not died or you don't want to deal with it you don't
want to hear about this person you don't want to talk about it you don't want anybody else to talk
about it well you see that doesn't work because you're not allowing the healing mechanisms to help
you to get through this process or the the increased effect the anguish the anger which is
perfectly understandable and manageable if it never subsides then it becomes very tough for
people to do continue doing business with you another evidence that things are not working is
the frequent and severe experience of intrusive thoughts in dreams in your everyday life as if
the memory of the departed person is like a monkey on your back and you can't get that off and and
again some of this is understandable but if this becomes a kind of a fixed pattern then it's going
to compromise your ability to to move on and if you are going to be essentially a wrecked with guilt
and shame and as a result for what happened and never forgive yourself and fail to reconnect with
people then this pathological grief is going to compromise your ability to function as adaptively
as you could now revert back to the previous lecture and we talked about making a success of
your life and so on so forth this becomes now a burden a liability and even though things may
still be okay for you they ultimately are not going to be as good as they could be the whole
question of how to help grieving individuals how to help people to die is still evolving
traditionally of course people died at home and that has many advantages as well as many
disadvantages lots of us are simply are not able now to take care of somebody who is in a
protracted sort of a fatal illness over long periods of time there are questions of course there
are all kinds of considerations so it's it's it's not easy to live it's not easy to die all have
their own complications but maybe putting all together what makes it in some ways most manageable
is the individuals own frame of mind the readiness to say goodbye to life without bitterness I had
a friend a distinguished British civil servant Sir Jeffrey Vickers who died in very old age and he
had written a poem which I subsequently read in his memorial service that was sent to me and he
had said he had written when he knew that time is running out I did not guess age held such bliss
simply to rest be still desist let striving cease body mind heart content to part in peace
this is the goodbye of a man who has had a very successful and largely very happy life it was a
wonderful picnic but the sun is set it's time to go home now where is home is the end of the last
breath the end of life this is an issue of course that has tormented and excited people since prehistory
there is a lot of evidence that by neolithic times human beings had figured out that maybe there is
something beyond death you surmise this from their very elaborate burial customs which typically took
place of putting the dead person in this fetal position in a big jar now if you thought the person
is just going to go back to dust why bother this would imply that maybe you are preparing somebody
preserving it as in as it were or in some inchoate poorly understood way preparing this individual
for another journey by the time of Egyptian civilization the art of dying the ritual of
dying is a highly elaborate business people spend large sums of money on the prospect of
dying and of course the pyramids one of the greatest architectural accomplishments are nothing but
tombs and memorials to the individual now in the United States it turns out that two out of three
people believe in some kind of life after death although they may not be able to articulate it
and interestingly the majority thinks they are going to heaven and not hell which also may not
be entirely clear what the justification of this confidence is but be that as it may we of course
link this often to religious belief and the notion of life after death is central to Christianity in
fact when we refer to the gospel the gospel is really the good news of the fact that Christ
rose from the death which is what transformed the band of disciples who were sort of going nowhere
into this fiery band of new persons who eventually took over in terms of their the religion that
they that they fostered the entire Roman Empire curiously the ancient Greeks or Judaism which
were sort of two of the channels that flew into early Christianity do not make much out of life
after death with the Greeks it's sort of a pale existence in the underworld and it's nebulous
and you know it's not the nicest place in the world but you know that's the way it is and Judaism
doesn't deny the possibility of existence life after death but the focus in Judaism is kind of on
the here and now this is the life you get you make the best out of it of course Buddhism and
Hinduism are very much based on the idea of the trans migration of souls so life becomes an attempt
to be released from this cycle of suffering which is life and the individual soul the atman becomes
united with the universal soul and then that is Nirvana now recently there have been attempts to
try to document scientifically that is to say to find some physical evidence of a soul or a spirit
or something that survives death and these have taken the forms of mediums who claim to get in
touch with spirits through complicated maneuvers and as a result there are certain findings which
are very difficult to explain away yet at the same time nobody of course has to anybody's
satisfaction in a scientific sense brought forth any convincing proof in this respect others who
have had near-death experiences feel that they had the glimpse of the afterlife as it were but
these things to my mind remain largely illusory so belief in afterlife is still very much a
belief which you can have or not have and so we are back for St. Paul's comments that faith is
the evidence for things unseen this is where science stops and faith takes over we have now
come to the end of this journey and I by way of by way of pulling everything together if that's
possible I want to read to you a quotation from a 17th century physician Sir Thomas Brown who
without having gone through all these research etc we talked about sort of looks at life and has to
say the following about stages what you do who you are and all that confound not the distinctions
of my life which nature has divided that is youth adolescence manhood we would not say personhood
