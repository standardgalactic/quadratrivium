Let your 50, late adulthood, personality, consistency and change.
The outset of this course, we looked at a number of theoretical perspectives as a way
of anticipating and organizing the information that we were going to consider about what
happens during the various phases and facets of the adult life cycle.
Then we plunged into a series of facts and figures and descriptions of events, and even
though there was occasional reference to these theoretical ways of organizing the material,
we were not primarily concerned with theory, but understanding sort of the phenomenology
of what happens.
As we near the end of this course, it is now important for us to step back again and take
another look at the attempts at making sense of this information, once again leaning more
towards a theoretical perspective.
Now facts and figures are very important, and we don't have enough of them.
As by now it should be clear.
At the same time, facts and figures also have a certain seductive quality.
They give the impression that they have real knowledge.
So when you read about a study that says, so many percent did this, so many percent
did that, and so many percent could not make up their minds, you get a sense that we really
are getting real knowledge.
This is quantified information, this is statistics, whereas if you read a description of what
people have and have not done, it sounds kind of more iffy, and to some ears it sounds
like a fairy tale.
Now I don't want to denigrate the importance of quantification, yet at the same time we
have to be careful that simply because we are imposing figures and statistics on a phenomenon,
we are not necessarily explaining it any better.
Facts are like little birds that perch briefly on the short branches of our memory and then
they fly away.
We have to take these facts and incorporate them in an intellectual context, and we do
that through the use of theory, and personally we have to incorporate the facts into personal
experience at which point they become knowledge.
Now if we can also take that knowledge and somehow use it to guide our lives, hopefully
to the better, then we have wisdom.
I am not sure that we can aspire to much wisdom at this stage, but we will certainly try to
move not only through facts, but from facts to knowledge.
I am going to use a key issue which has been central in discussions of how human beings
think, feel the fundamental psychology of being human, and this has to do with the notion
of personality.
And whether or not personality is pretty much stable through the lifespan, or does it change
in significant ways?
This debate has been going on for a long time, and as you shall see, it is by no means settled.
Even if we go back to, let's say, one particular theoretical perspective, psychoanalysis, the
earlier parts of this century, Freud was of the opinion, as we have seen earlier, that
things get pretty much gelled early in life.
You already have formed your character by the time you are coming out of childhood,
and then the rest is a rehash and a replay and a refinement, but fundamentally there
is no dramatic change in the individual.
This is sort of in the normal course of events.
Yet one of his major followers and disciples, Jung, felt that individuals continue to change
and evolve during the entire lifespan, if you incidentally, which has won over, because
most people now believe that that is in fact the case.
There are others who have written about this.
It is an interesting segment from William James, the eminent American psychologist, who talks
about how things are already sort of set in place using the vocational perspective,
and he writes how at the age of 25 or so, you see professional mannerisms settling down
on the young business person, young doctor, young minister, he says, you see the little
lines of cleavage running through the character, the tracks of thought, the prejudices, the
ways of the court, shop, unquote, in a word from which the man can by and by no more escape
than his court sleeve can suddenly fall into a new set of folds.
On the whole, it is best he should not escape.
It is well for the world that in most of us by the age of 30, the character has set like
plaster and will never soften again.
So you see this notion that things are going to freeze in place, will remain in place.
The question is, is this so?
And again, whereas nobody is foolish enough to say in a very extreme way that nothing
changes or everything changes, the question is, predominantly, can we think of personality
as something pretty stable across the years, or is it something that is going to unfold,
evolve as you go through the various phases, stages, changes, all of the things that we
discussed and considered.
I'm going to approach this from two perspectives.
First I'm going to explain the point of view of those who feel, who propose through their
work, that in fact change is the order of the day.
This is going to mean a quick review of Erickson, and then we are going to move on to look at
the work of George Valiant and the grant study to which we made brief reference earlier.
I am going to refer to a set of other studies without discussing them, kind of making the
case for change.
And then we are going to switch to a very important study that makes a very powerful
argument in favor of stability, consistency of personality traits over time.
And then finally, we will see how these competing alternative perspectives match in terms of
helping us understand who human beings are and how their personalities unfold or persist
through time.
Now to revisit Erickson's stages, here is an excellent example of a changing pattern
around a constant core.
The constant core is the fundamental identity of the individual, which as we saw comes into
place during adolescence.
But this in itself, even though it's the core answer to the question, who am I, takes
different shapes and forms during the various stages as we see in the diagonal, in the boxes
in the diagonal going up.
And once more, to look at the key issues that are bringing about this evolution of this
individual's central concerns, major features of personality, we go from the trust versus
mistrust, autonomy and shame, initiative and guilt, industry against inferiority, the sort
of childhood stages with which we would not deal with.
And to recapitulate what we did deal with, namely, during adolescence, the key issue
of industry versus identity, that is, identity versus identity confusion, intimacy versus
isolation, generativity versus stagnation, and integrity versus despair, which is of
course the phase-specific task of late adulthood.
Let us briefly digress and expand a little bit on this issue of integrity and despair,
because this is the phase-specific task of this particular phase that we are lastly concerned
with.
Essentially, once again, this is defined by way of polar opposites and the sense of integrity
that comes to the individual who has successfully completed the life cycle is fundamentally
one of a sense of wholeness, a sense of things having come together, a feeling that this
was my life and perhaps it was not perfect, it rarely is, if it ever is, but this is good
enough.
And so there is a sense of authenticity, a sense of feeling that this is really me,
and a wonderful feeling of being comfortable within your own skin, acknowledging your shortcomings
without having to apologize for them.
This is who I am, take it or leave it.
If this does not happen, the polar opposite, which is not the more adaptive but the maladaptive
outcome of this, is a sense of despair.
Now despair is associated with feelings of hopelessness, with the feeling that there
is not much I can do about things, and this of course is a very painful emotion coming
in the latter stages of one's life, because unlike midlife where you still had some time
to play with, and unlike young adulthood where time seemed to be boundless and opportunities
completely open to write the script of your life, when you are in your late years and
the older you grow, the more true this is, the feeling is that the sort of the bus has
left the station and there is not much to be done about it anymore.
You cannot refight your battles, you cannot go back and correct the major omissions and
commissions of your life that you would rather have otherwise, so you basically are stuck
with the sense that you missed the boat.
And this feeling that I missed the boat is the explanation why despair now becomes the
predominant emotion.
Once more I have to repeat this over and over, these things are not absolute, 100%, 0%, all
of us end up with sort of a mix between the two.
It is impossible not to have a certain sense of despair and be human, yet at the same time
one would hope that no matter what dismal a failure somebody thinks his or her life has
been, there should always be some glimmer of hope, some sense that in some area in one
way or the other you in fact did okay, so that there is a certain sense of integrity
that you can cling to.
Now so the change that is going on through this sequence that we describe, taking these
different forms involving engagements in different playing fields, stage after stage,
can also be reshuffled and now people who are building on Erickson's work try to not
only try to reconfirm whether the stages of change are going on, but also try to reshuffle
this deck of the eight particulars to see if they fit in some kind of a more fundamental
aggregation of what is it that is being accomplished.
Now one way of looking at this would be to say that a unique life course is molded out
of the interactions of the basic biological needs, the basic biological plan which unfolds
in interaction with the average expectable environment, primarily the social environment.
And you will recall from our first lecture that the fundamental principle that underlies
this progressive change is that of epigenesis.
An epigenesis, this embryonal principle says that there is a basic plan and from this basic
plan the parts arise and gradually they become integrated into an overall entity, a wholeness.
One could put together some of the phase specific tasks which are the big landmarks of change
for Erickson into another sequence where you could say that the big flaw of life through
the years which is bringing these changes about goes from the fundamental issue of trust
being able to link up with others with whom you can remain bonded with whom you can continue
doing business on whom you can depend and who in turn can depend on you.
From trust you move to the issue of achievement when you have to do the job, accomplish things,
attain competence, one of the hallmarks of successful growing up.
And all this leads to this overall sense of wholeness being one, being integrated and
not simply a collection of warring factions pulling you hither and yon.
So those who see Erickson sort of fitting into this even grander scheme would say that
of the stages we discussed and we just reviewed, under trust would come of course first of
all stage one of basic trust, stage two the autonomy versus shame which is the second
stage and these are childhood stages and then leaping on to young adulthood the phase specific
issues of intimacy and distancing which is one of the tasks of young adulthood.
So you see the similarity between these three they basically have to do with the establishment
of key relationships and key relationships are fundamentally based on mutual trust.
Under the achievement motive that is driving this process of unfolding would come the category
of initiative and guilt which is a childhood stage of activity, industry and inferiority
which is another childhood phase which follows this initiative and guilt and when we are
talking about industry and inferiority you are talking about the school age child who
is already beginning now to simply not be the object of affection at home and the more
informal socialization but demands are being placed on the individual.
As soon as you go to school you are asked questions much more so perhaps than you are
at home about what do you know what have you learned there are exams of one sort or another
to contend with and under achievement will come the once again the generativity versus
stagnation which we discussed in the context of middle adulthood.
And so here is now this kind of second category a bigger category which pulls together several
of the Ericssonian stages.
And when you come to the issue of wholeness this is now not only a question of integrity
and despair which is the last phase but what we discussed about in identity and identity
confusion as the phase specific task of adolescence also is part of this general category.
So you see I think this is an interesting way of looking at Ericsson which capitalizes
on this succession of stages but also mixes and matches these stages to see even broader
overarching themes which then could be said is the fundamental script by which the individual
is in fact changing modifying establishing trust achieving and attaining wholeness.
In the same tradition in theoretical terms is George Valent.
Now Valent brought a perspective theoretical perspective which is derived from what we
call ego psychology which originally was of strictly speaking sort of a psychoanalytic
orientation has always remained within that general camp but unlike the original work
of Segment Freud which depended so heavily on instincts the vicissitudes of instincts
focus on the two fundamental instincts of the libido or the sexual drive and aggression
and basically manipulated the ups and downs of these in the shaping and the unfolding
of the human character.
Freud's daughter Anna Freud shifted the emphasis the theoretical emphasis from the instincts
to the ego and so there began a new tradition intellectual tradition of ego psychology
where now the emphasis was more on those ego mechanisms which came to be called ego defenses
which were the psychological tools by which a person was able to negotiate and work through
the competing demands of the impulses the id the demands of reality of which the ego
is sort of the guardian and the requirements and the dictates of the superego which is
the conscience in sort of plain English and which represents the expectations of the social
environment and the values which essentially say thou shalt do this thou shalt not do that.
These how you have what kind of mechanisms you use in coming to terms with these and
there are a long set of maybe two dozen of these mechanisms determines what kind of a
person you are in other words what is your character which is another term for personality
determines the level of your mental health the level of your functioning as an individual.
Now from this valiant has developed the idea of a not simply a gathering of defenses that
cluster in one or another configuration but a hierarchy of defenses by which you can make
certain judgments about the adaptive value of these particular defenses. Now adaptation is
the key term in this particular perspective it is no wonder that the book that valiant wrote
based on the grand study is called adaptation to life and fundamentally the hallmark of the
psychologically healthy individual is that of the well adapted individual and the hallmark of the
psychologically not well individual is the person who is not well adapted. Now this creates all
kinds of philosophical problems that we should we cannot get into that is to say what about a
person who is well adapted to a particular society that is immoral and rotten is it enough for you
to simply say well I am an excellent representative of the demands of this culture is the culture is
no good can you simply say I'm just doing my job because I was given orders to do so and in our
society it's perfectly fine to kill women and children and whoever else you meet. Now this is of
course there's no quick answer to that but setting aside that kind of special case as it were and
assuming that individuals should continue to exercise a certain level of free will by which
ultimately we are responsible for what we do and we can simply say I was given orders. All things
being equal given a reasonably a decent society then adaptation to your internal needs to the
society's expectations in fact adds up to what we will call mental health. Now let me give you
some examples of how these defense mechanisms work and what does this mean to the question that we
are addressing change of personality over time. One type of defense is the immature defense an
example here would be acting out. Now this is a typical defense which teenagers adolescents use as
they're going through the process of coming to terms with themselves and with the requirements of
their parents and the world. Acting out means that if you have a psychological conflict if you are
in a struggle let's say with your parents instead of simply arguing the matter out instead of
discussing it you do something. So what do you do if you are a teenage girl and to really want to
punish your parents you get pregnant or if you are a teenage boy and want to humiliate your parents
you get caught stealing you act in a delinquent ways. Now this doesn't mean that you have stood
there and insulted your parents but in fact through what you have done the effect is the same. Not
every teenager who gets pregnant is acting out so but this is a way in which you are trying to
resolve an issue in this case the question of your hostility let's say to your parents and are doing
it through behavior through acting out rather than through talking out. To take a perhaps somewhat
more amusing example passive aggressive behavior. Now we all inevitably sooner or later have to behave
in a way which requires a certain amount of self assertion. Aggressive people of course will do
this in a way which is not adaptive. The passive aggressive will not frontally deal with you will
not attack you but will somehow harm you in an indirect way. It may be like the individual or the
waiter in a restaurant who spills the soup on you not as a pure accident but as a way of getting
at you. Now this person may not himself or herself be aware in fact by definition these
defenses are unconscious you don't know that you are doing it. It's the very fact that you are not
aware of it makes them tricky and becoming aware of what you are doing and why you are doing is
of course one of the signs of health and one of the objectives of treatment in this particular
tradition. A second category of defenses are referred to as neurotic defenses and here a
perfect example is repression which means you put things out of your consciousness they are there
but you are not aware of it but they continue influencing your actions. Then you have the
more maladaptive forms of using certain defense mechanisms and here we are talking about the
so-called psychotic defenses and this may involve something like delusional projection where you
think that people are pursuing you and you are going to be murdered etc because your sense of
hostility you have others have been projected outside. A milder form of this would be to say
to I hate you but I don't want to acknowledge that and I say you hate me so we sort of put
the burden on you. Now this is just a very superficial way of addressing this question
against these immature neurotic psychotic defenses which in various combinations are responsible
to the different types of what we call mental illness that may be in the form of a neurosis,
a circumscribed set of symptoms in the form of a personality disorder which is the problem is
how you behave generally who you are or psychosis which involves a cluster of symptoms that are
more maladaptive. Now of course here again the confusing variable is that there may be all
kinds of biological factors involved particularly with respect to some of the severe psychosis
like the depressions and schizophrenia but let's not overly complicate life but we have to be
aware that that is in fact may well be the case. Setting all this aside you have another cluster
of symptoms that are the mature defenses. Now this we are more concerned this is not a course in
psychiatry we are more concerned about normal development and so these are things like suppression.
Suppression is the conscious attempt to say I am angry but I'm going to suppress the anger and
not express it. I am doing this because I choose to do so as against repression which says to
yourself I'm not angry I'm not aware that I am angry and you pretend that you are not angry when
in fact you are. Sublimation involves taking an impulse the expression of which would be socially
problematic and transforming it into something that would be socially acceptable. Anticipatory
coping knowing what's going to come and preparing yourself to deal with it and finally humor. Now
humor is a very nice way of dealing with aggression because it has an edge to it and of course this
is why it has become politically so treacherous now to tell jokes but and you know you can also
hurt people with humor but all things being equally certainly is preferable to punching somebody.
And then finally there is altruism which you see is a way of taking the poison and negating
sort of canceling the poison out and and doing good even to those who don't mean well don't mean
to do you good and this is where you are sort of introducing an element where the more negative
issues in interactions are being ironed out. Now what does all this mean about the question of
change? Two basic conclusions from the grand study one is that and this is the good news
valent found that generally as people get older not only do they change but the configuration
of their defenses moves from the less healthy ones less mature ones to the more mature ones.
So in fact there is some truth to the wisdom that you really grow up and you become a more
adapted individual better adapted individual psychologically as you get into the more mature
stages. Now setting aside the question of defenses in mental health what is it that
correlates can we correlate characteristics of individuals early in their lives you recall the
grand study was done with a group of undergraduates at Harvard we talked about this briefly in the
first lecture and is a study that is going on and is still in progress and so these people now are
in their 60s incidentally is again you recall this is Jack Kennedy's generation although
he was not a member of this group so that you know places you in terms of who we are talking about
and when these individuals reached middle age there were very predictable and interesting
correlations in terms of their past experiences and the successful most successful less successful
outcomes in their lives it turned out that the most successful and the well adjusted individuals
grow up in warm supportive intellectually stimulating families they had better rated
psychological and physical health in college and they were the types of folks who were well
organized exerted themselves they knew what they were doing which leads to the self-evident to a
lot of people conclusion that if you start well you end well now the surprise came when these
people were re-studied in their early 60s where to everyone's astonishment in turned out that
most of these characteristics in early life had no predictive value now to who was doing fine who
was successful and who was not in this adaptational sense in the 60s so this is now a new ball game
and it turned out that in fact what you could best correlate success in the 60s was success in the
50s which means perhaps one of two things namely that each era requires a different set of skills
and qualities for success so there is not just one prescription that runs throughout all and that
success is not for ordained for life but created and over and over again from the resources of
what is available i'm using the word success in terms of successful outcome not necessarily
career success although that clearly is one of it now we are going to switch to the opposite
perspective which argues for consistency now there are not that many studies in this camp as in the
first one but there is a formidable study which has been extremely well carried out by costa and
macray where large numbers of individuals have been studied in a very rigorous way through
the kinds of cross sequential complicated type of method that we saw earlier so this is now
in a way the equivalent of many studies and in fact there are several components to this
so therefore it really brings a very sophisticated set of data to bear on this issue
and focuses on the notion of a trait it's a trait theory of personality traits being a distinctive
relatively enduring way in which one individual behaves relative to others so could be like
calm aggressive friendly and its behavior understood in forms of attributes that reflect
underlying traits now costa and macray have categorized the traits that they are concerned with
under five groups neuroticism extraversion openness to experience these three have received the most
amount of attention in the research and then agreeableness antagonism and conscientiousness
undirectedness and it is very striking that these traits remain highly stable over 10 12 years
even longer and therefore not only is this true that individuals see themselves the same way
but when spouses are rated about how they perceive these individuals those rate those ratings also
remain fairly consistent so this is now a very different way of explaining what's going on it
would seem to indicate that once you are lodged in one of these five areas where the predominant
traits are in one of the five categories and I'm going to give more detail about these in a moment
then you pretty much go through the ups and downs of the life cycle
without changing that much and now this opens up another possibility that what is happening to you
in some ways must be a reflection of the type of person you are and the type of business you
are conducting with other individuals so here the driving force as to what is coloring your life
experiences becomes your fundamental personality structure as defined by this cluster of traits
and that's going to be the explanation if you wish of the scenario of your life
now let's briefly look at what these five clusters are under neuroticism they list
six sort of facets anxiety takes the form of fearfulness nervousness being high strong tense and
so on hostility proneness to anger being irritable hard to get along with self-consciousness sensitive
to criticism prone to the feelings of inferiority and shame a preponderance for feelings of sadness
depression helplessness loneliness guilt love low self-esteem impulsiveness lack of self-restraint
which may take the form of excessive drinking smoking drugs doing things in excess overeat
overspend and a sense of vulnerability low ability to deal with stress and being highly
dependent on others in crisis now it is not surprising that if you are this kind of person
there is a greater likelihood of unhappiness because these individuals are not as easy to deal with
extraversion takes the form of warmth these people are easily attached they're friendly
they are compassionate they are gregarious they desire to be with others and if you combine
warmth and gregariousness you get sociability they are assertive in the sense that they take
charge they are natural leaders decisive they readily and easily express their thoughts and
feelings they are highly active they are busy high energy talk fast on the go they seek excitement
they look for exciting environment challenging situations and they have positive emotions of
zest being delightful and and fun to be with and these are more compatible with a sense of
happiness and other people wanting to be with you then you have the openness to experience
which takes a variety of forms with respect to fantasy this means vivid imagination and active
dream life in an aesthetic sense it means appreciation of art and beauty of original
experience experience for its own sake in terms of action openness to experience takes the form
of willingness to try new experiences ideas intellectually open curious imaginative value
knowledge for its own sake these people tend to have more liberal values they are more tolerant
of other people's values they are empathic with people in different circumstances and in terms
of feelings they experience their own feelings strongly and find meaning in them rather than
shove it under the carpet with the agreeableness antagonism antagonism unfortunately is easier
to describe it is the skeptical mistrustful confrontational stubborn rude you see we are
describing it through adjectives these are sort of traits that come together uncooperative
unsympathetic also narcissistic that is self-centered selfish arrogant vindictive
perfectionist manipulative and in some ways what is known as the so-called type a behavior which
in itself is an interesting concept the opposite is the good nature and and all the positive
in the lack of these elements interestingly there is a sharp difference you see in this perspective
and what valent would say now in a colloquial terms people may be inclined to to call somebody
who's in this aggressive category with the derogatory term of saying that guy is a real bastard
valent says that bastards are not born they are made now kustan nekaya are not saying
bastards are born but the question is when are they made and once are they made are they going
to remain in the same so you have these two competing perspectives conscientiousness undirectedness
the conscientious person is careful reliable hardworking well organized groupless neat self-reliant
fair and the undirected is negligent careless undependable lazy disorganized sloppy not punctual
thoughtless quitting and so on you will recall that when we were discussing career choice
we talked about the personality types that seek a certain environment in which to work with
now there is some correlation in the costa and mccray categories and what we saw earlier in terms
of the six personality types so that you can see how the person who is interested in in the in the
social type there is a counterpart in each group the person who is more artistically inclined and
creative and so on so forth there is a certain counterpart in each group see ideally these
various studies should reinforce each other unfortunately more often than not they tend to
cancel each other out and one reason for this is that people often start from a different theoretical
perspective they are looking at things through a method and a theoretical perspective that colors
what they are looking for and what they find so that in a way what you discover is largely
determined what is it that you are looking for and this is one of the difficulties particularly
when you look at the research of people coming from very disparate backgrounds
investigators who have basic assumptions about human beings that are very different from each
other and who use methods as varied as eric erickson sitting in a room in a chair and listening to
what a psychoanalytic patient is saying hour after hour day in and day out and on the basis of his
own training his own knowledge of himself his own insight into the world making sense out of these
individuals utterances and then having heard enough individuals talk about these various issues
pulling the gist of what they are learning and making a theory out of how human beings develop
change go through stages change over time and so on at the opposite extreme you have a study
like costa and macray where you have very clearly defined and tested instruments by which data is
being gathered which whether i gather the data or you gather the data should not make a difference
because the instrument is gathering the data and where there are enough cases that can be counted
where you can see that these figures that are that yield are subject to statistical manipulation
you can do tests of significance and you come up with another set of conclusions
and those who have to kind of make collective sense of all this have a hard time
my sense is that one should not err simply saying only this type of study is useful
and of course if you are in that camp it's very tempting to do so but it's also important for
some of us to take a more sort of broad eclectic view as i promised i was going to do at the beginning
of the lecture and not simply sort of join one particular disciplinary or theoretical party
and therefore say if it fits with our presuppositions it's fine if it doesn't it doesn't make sense
and use whatever method that would give the best result there is now a lot of disenchantment
with the generation of grand theories because experience with forming grand theories that
used has been very popular for a long time doesn't seem to yield the kind of scientifically
uh the kind of study that can be scientifically validated in the sorts of methods that we have
been talking about and therefore you see ericsson in the Freudian tradition of building grand theory
and you see costa and macray and other typical social scientists not trying to build a
one gigantic grand theory but trying to be certain that what they are saying is applicable
is replicable and therefore putting pieces together bit by bit it's a little bit like looking at a
mosaic which is the latter method where each tesare each piece comes from a particular research
and these bits in the mosaic get together and one day you hope you will have the gestalt of
the overall picture and the pieces can always be replaced and have to be replaced as new research
come into action the other style the clinical style the ericsson style is more like an
impressionistic painting you cannot make sense of it by tearing it apart and and and checking
the bits and pieces but if it's successful you look at an impressionist painting and say
my goodness there is a forest maybe the trees look wrong maybe they are not the color in nature
but we immediately get the sense that you are looking at something that makes personal sense
