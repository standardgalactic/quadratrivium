Lecture 14 Late Adulthood, Psychosocial Aspects of Aging
You have seen the ads, the new image of maturity, couple with white hair or would have been
white had it not been dyed, standing on the deck of a luxury cruise liner having a wonderful
time. This is the new image of maturity and mind you I have not used the word old age which
has now become not so acceptable and we have various other terms typically euphemisms for
it and there is a almost industry of books and magazine articles which basically tell
us that fundamentally we need not grow old at least in the traditional sense of becoming
decrepit and that there are endless possibilities open to us and essentially presenting a very
positive image. Now given the excessively negative image associated with aging given the
dismal expectations which until people's health and life conditions improved were all true but in
addition to that the self-fulfilling prophecy that by the time you went through 50 and 60 that
was pretty much the end of the game maybe there is some merit in this what to me seems like the
excessively rosy alternative and perhaps there is something to be said for a little bit of
self-deception if it's going to make us feel better but we must remember that a little bit
of self-deception goes a long way and that this should not lead to a sense of self-delusion and
I'm going to try to in this second lecture where we are going to address the question of
psychosocial aspects of late adulthood building on what we said in the previous lecture on
biological changes and trying to steer a reasonable course between the harsh realities of the
inexorable process of aging on the one hand and the ways in which that kind of impact can be
attenuated indeed the many ways in which these later years can be Indian summers wonderfully
lingering sunsets and so on now here it's important to make a distinction because age is of
considerable important and I'm referring to chronological age as I mentioned in the previous
lecture we have a somewhat more differentiated view now calling the 65 to 75 year olds the
young old and the 75 plus group old old there's nothing magical about the ages of 65 and 75 of
course there was something magical about 65 because then what's your force to retire in which
case there are very important consequences to your life but that's no longer the case for most
people and I have already referred to my concerns about dragging midlife all the way to 65 which
is kind of like the last act and how can it be in the middle but let's not get into semantics at
this point and therefore it's important to point out that a lot of the picture of old age a wonderful
second adulthood and the wonderful time of life and the protracted some sunset and so on really
typically refer to individuals who are in the 65 to 75 year group and therefore even though the
roof doesn't come down at 75 and individuals may not necessarily get any less healthy or less
happy at 75 if you take large enough numbers of individuals 75 seems to carry you know give
or take a couple of years quite a bit of meaning about the decline in the actual functions physically
which we examined last time and mentally and otherwise which we are going to look at today
let's begin first of all with the immediate consequences of the changes in the in the brain
in mental function with respect to intelligence problematic a concept as intelligence may be
it's still useful it's a nice handle as long as we take a more sort of differentiated view
there are in fact two kinds of intelligence it's important to differentiate these two because
the fate is very different as you get older fluid intelligence which typically refers to
sort of how fast you learn immediate memory ability to solve problems etc this kind of kind
of raw brain as computer type functions definitely declines over life but the decline doesn't
start at 65 the decline is going on practically during the entire adulthood of the individual
on the other hand crystallized intelligence that has more to do with the proper use of
information with the manipulation of concepts with judgment that improves with age all the way
into the 60s these two are added up in the concept of omnibus intelligence so that overall
intelligence which as a result does not really register any dramatic loss or gain until the
60s so in that sense one doesn't really have to worry about am I losing my marbles for most
individuals there is no change except in the ways I described into the 60s now we had a very
false image of this until fairly recently because early studies of intelligence compared
cohorts of young people with old people the cross-sectional study you will remember from
our earlier discussion of one way of studying when you do that when this was done it was clear
that individuals in their 20s scored much higher than individuals past 55 well the conclusion
seemed obvious that you lose in fact scoring on an intelligence test and the immediate conclusion
is that functionally you become less intelligent this turned out to be the function of not decline
of intelligence but the fact that in those cohorts in those generations the younger people were much
better educated than the older people so when you factor in the effect of education years in
education you see that that immediately corresponds to the same decline so what you are seeing here
is the cohort effect of testing two different groups cohort difference up to different groups and
not change over time had you done a longitudinal study you would not have fallen in this trap
because you'd be dealing with the same group of people with the same level of education and if
you were to do that you see that except in the ways I described there isn't this kind of sharp
drop we indicated earlier now another very important component of mental functioning is
creativity particularly those of us are which are in the creative professions or the arts or
the more demanding intellectual fields we are not just interested in continuing to remember
the multiplication table but can we create new ideas can you generate ideas when initially
investigators looked at this looking at kind of people who buy reasonable criteria would be
seen as highly creative there seems to be a sharp rise in creativity from the 20s to the 30s which
is the peak and then one more slide down an inexorable decline in creativity all the way
down to the 70s then however when they took a more refined approach and began to look at
different fields it turns out that age has a differential impact in this respect so that
for instance when you look at people who are in the sciences the creativity proportion of
creative work done rises steadily into the 40s and does decline somewhat after the 60s the
same is true for the arts but not the humanities if you are a philosopher then in some ways or if
you are a literary critic if you do the kind of work which the humanists do that are basically
cumulative and very much use experience and knowledge that has been learned and I suppose
that one can even use the word wisdom then that kind of stuff does not decline and there are of
course countless examples of major figures in the humanities arts and the sciences that
continue to be very creative Picasso, Casals, Georgia O'Keefe, Churchill and so on and so forth
huge numbers of people in their 80s who are still giving concerts and who seem to be at the peak of
their powers well two things here first of all they may not necessarily be at the peak of their
powers that may still be very very good enough for people to shell out a lot of money to go and
listen to them in fact in some ways what performers may lose in in performance virtuosity may gain
in the ability to interpret this is not going to work if you are a ballet dancer but it will
work if you are a cellist second thing to bear in mind is that these individuals who remain at
this very high level of performance or creativity are almost always individuals who already had
attained this very high level earlier in their years it is very very unlikely that a late bloomer
is going to explode on the field at the age of 70 we don't want to say it's impossible but it is rare
so none of these great figures became great in their later years once again the question here is
a issue of attainment early maintenance later on once you got it you can hang on to it but you
have to get it on schedule and the schedule starts early often in childhood so this is the story of
the issue of creativity let's now move on to income work finances and how are people in these age
groups impacted by all this economists draw these what seem like heartless charts for non-economists
people being classified as consumers and so on and here we see there's a very close correlation
between sort of life phase and whether you are saving or this saving generating or spending
and clearly youth at least youth that are in school that are not working is not in a position of
saving they are in fact costing somebody to go through what it is that they need to do and in
middle age young adulthood middle age once you're established in your career all the way to let's
still use retirement as kind of a cutoff point that is the time when savings are accruing you are
accumulating capital and with retirement in this sort of what used to be the traditional pattern
there is now a switch to drawing from the monies you had made earlier whether these are
government-based support or individual savings or whatever you revert back to the consumer mode
of the pre-productive young individual that is kind of the general model of course all kinds of
modifications as we shall see shortly interesting changes across the years in this country in 1890
65 plus age group of men were in the labor force 70 70 percent of them were in the labor force this
is now pre-retirement times and therefore these people work not because they were crazy about
working but because that's the only way they could stay alive they had to work in order to earn a
living 100 years later in 1990 only 20 percent of this age group were in full force in the labor
force with women in the 65 plus age group interestingly there has been no change the dramatic
changes in the work patterns of women are in the younger groups than 65 plus now retirement which
has come about arbitrarily through through events that actually happened in Europe and place this
age of retirement on 65 had obvious consequences over the years and because of the undesirable
aspects of those consequences including forcing somebody out of a job simply because he or she
was 65 even though he was performing perfectly well became unacceptable and an important new
phase now began with the so-called uncapping of the retirement age now there have to be important
adjustments made to this for example universities were allowed a certain grace period before they
would adhere with this it is only the last four five years that they have been allowed to tell the
professoriate that they do not have to retire at 65 in fact presumably they can stay on teaching for
as long as they wish but since that would be in some ways difficult since it's going to make it
harder and harder to bring new blood into the system there are all kinds of both kind of
individual motivation as well as incentives produced to make senior professors retire retire
early or at least retire roughly at the time that people have been retiring which is between somewhere
between 65 and 75 nonetheless one out of five retirees now returns to work not necessarily full
time but to work anyway and this again presumably they do partly because of the financial rewards
of working perhaps because they need to work perhaps the income is not sufficient or because
they enjoy what they are doing and this is one way of keeping them in circulation one of the
things we are going to discuss later on which is really perhaps one of the key issues to bear in
mind in this age group is what happens to the individual as he or she gets older typically
he who has been working all the time outside rather than she at home although obviously that's
changing now is how what happens in terms of this person's engagement in public life in social
life what are the consequences of this engagement we will come back to this later on now what about
sources of income where does the this age group derive its income from if you once again sort
of average statistics the tremendous variability you see that social security provides 35% of
the income on average personal assets 26% continued earnings 23% other pension plans 14%
that yields 98% and then you have smaller percentages coming from SSI which is special
government assistance plus VA benefits and that rounds the figure to a hundred now the older group
of individuals in this country really have been in some ways quite advantaged during recent years
because social security benefits have risen higher than actual wages for those who are in the
workplace and once they retire at 65 this is kind of the oldest statistics right now they
have a no more than a 30% drop in income than compared to what they were doing between the ages
of 55 and 64 on the other hand this is compensated for by the fact that there is no tax on social
security older people get special benefits and they are in a position if necessary to move into
less expensive areas they don't necessarily have to live in very high-cost areas so there is no
sharp drop in income for individuals who have in fact produced this cushion these various cushions
to in fact help them maintain the lifestyle to which they have been used to now so the there is
no for for most people and we're really again talking about middle-class people who were already
in fairly good shape they remain in fairly good financial shape unless they get sick illness is
the big threat if you don't like if you don't have health insurance you are ruined and even with
health insurance illness often tends to be an expensive business now there is a tremendous range
of distribution of wealth in this country something that's amazingly enough is becoming more
exaggerated rather than less exaggerated which is the very opposite of the trend in in European
countries and here again the statistics are really quite compelling 1% of the higher earning people
in this age group have the have 30% of the wealth in the 65 plus age group 1% controls 30% of the
wealth in the 65 plus age group and 10% have 60% of the wealth of the 65 plus age group now
interestingly a high proportion of these individuals are women who have outlived their husbands who
have left this sizable legacy for them to control so even though women married to affluent men may
not have themselves produce this income they come to control large sums of money and of course
these individuals men or women are assiduously courted by all kinds of institutions hoping that
they will be benefit them with this largesse one of the issues that is of continued concern is what
is going to happen to the system whereby those working now support those who are not working in
the sense that they continue to be that middle segment of society that is producing the goods now
in 1945 for each person who had retired there were 31 people working by the current period this
had come down to 3 to 1 this is a dramatic change and it's anticipated by the year 2035 the ratio
will be 2 to 1 and here are of course all the concerns about you know what's going to happen to
social security and particularly this becomes an issue which is of tremendous concern when budgets
have to be cut and readjusted so unless you happen to be I already sort of out of the loop of being
self-sufficient and being poor is not fun anytime but being poor when you are old is particularly
nasty so that's one big group we have to worry about then you have this upper crust where they
are basically invulnerable to these kind of switches so the bulk of the people somewhere in
the middle range in terms of the comfort they have and as well as the concerns they have whether
they are going to be able to maintain this comfort for the rest of their lives let's move on now to
the issue of family what is happening in this respect now people are beginning of course to
lose more spouses now and typically that the person who's dying first is the husband or the men
and therefore there have to be adjustments in living patterns people who are not in this age
group and do not know about it often have this image of the elderly being kind of lonely and
alienated or at a far distance from family and so on or sitting in the cornoverine institution
none of these rather dismal images are true for the majority of people in this age group
70% live with a spouse or a family member so the family remains very central to this
5% live in an institution but this is a little misleading because if you compare those between
ages of 65 and 74 only 2% are in an institution but those who are 85 plus almost a quarter are in
an institution so there's a once again a big difference between the young old and the old
in this regard 25% live alone 75% on their home the balance do not now 80% of those who live alone
are in the 65 plus age group now one thing which is of course very reassuring is that
since they four out of five of them have children most of them remain in close touch with these
children in fact one third live within 10 minutes by car or some kind of public transportation
so that even though families are scattered all over this country and we are no longer
living in the old times where everybody was a member of the same village we can see that family
linkages continue to persist and I'm going to say more about this in more specific terms when
we talk about differences between the young old and the old old one of the pleasures of the later
years is the joy of being a grandparent now grandparent would combines the fun of having a
young person and doesn't have the as much of the pains because you're not responsible for their
well-being and so many older people get much satisfaction out of this but not everybody
wants to have a great deal to do with his or her grandchildren and investigators have classified
grandparents into sort of several types there is the formal type of grandparent
who is involved in the lives of the grandchildren and is interested but does not interfere does not
advise leaves leave the parents to to make the decisions and handle things there is the fun
seeking grandparents who becomes like a playmate of the kids and is indulgent and is a leisure
activity so fundamentally they have fun together you have the surrogate parent where there is
considerable care taking when parents are working this is more often a role taken undertaken by the
grandmother than the grandfather although this is also changing now among the couples that I
studied in the research we talked about in their 30s dual professional career the woman's father
was a retired physician and the mother was a retired nurse so the parents came every Wednesday to the
house and basically cleaned the whole house for them and took care of the kids when they come
so the parents have sort of Wednesday off courtesy of the grandparents you have the notion of the
sort of the old-fashioned notion of the grandparent as a source of wisdom here there is a tendency to
be more authoritarian and to have resources with which you also sweeten the authority and people
defer to this kind of grandparent this is again typically more of a grandfather role than a grandmother
role then you have the more distant grandparent who is benevolent and caring but rather remote
this is the sort of the holiday grandparent you see them only on major holidays otherwise
they do not have very much to do with each other that now brings to a close essentially sort of
an overall review of what happens at these ages in these major categories now for the balance of
this of this hour I want to turn more specifically to the question of where do individuals in this
life phase derive their major life satisfactions from so this is kind of the counterpart of
career success we talked about with respect to career it is the counterpart of marital success
when we were talking about marital associations where are the satisfactions and the joys coming from
at this time this is where the distinction between the young old and the old old come about
incidentally this this distinction was made some years ago by Bernice Newgarten who has been one of
the prominent researchers in this area she also is the one who came with this idea of a shift in
time sense from the past and the future and has done has made some very important contributions
to this field the rosy picture again primarily for those who have rather than those who do not have
really pertains to this earlier group actually despite the fact that I reject putting midlife
up to 65 the group of 65 to 75 year olds in many ways are closer to the people in midlife
then are they closer to the old old maybe what we need to do to satisfy everybody is create some
other phase of life and call it transition to late life and Levinson actually has this although
in the research he did the subjects were not in this age group therefore he had nothing to say
about this area so there may be a period between sort of the end of midlife which occupies a
chronologically appropriate place and entering into late life which then kicks in with age 65
and here this is really the new frontier it is this area where we can not just
not just with a promise that all is going to be fine but realistically tell these people
especially if you have the necessary advantages in life then you can really look forward to a
wonderful decade of 10 years in which you are still in pretty good shape unless you have some
specific illness if you have maintained yourself in good health and in good fitness there is nothing
that you can't do that you did earlier but you have to do it a little differently if you have
been a skier you continue to ski but maybe instead of going down the black lines now you go down the
blue lines if you play tennis you continue tennis or swim or whatever but you have to take more
frequent rests play shorter games you go back and think about the business of reserve one of the
way you can get around the issue of a narrow reserve is that you don't push the system too hard
you can still walk five miles if you wish but don't walk it at one time you can break that into
several segments so with with a few tricks like this with a few adjustments basically there is not
that much to worry about this past fall i led a travel study tour in the middle east and as you
could imagine in these kinds of journeys lots of the people are retired individuals and i was again
i've done this many times and i never cease to be amazed at the spanina and the interest and the
willingness of people in their seventies in fact to climb every hill to go up every castle
and walk endlessly so yes this is certainly possible provided as i said you are already
not the victim of some serious illness even then a great deal can be done now retirement or part-time
work one way or the other one has the satisfaction of knowing that one's life work has been done
and uh in the sense now is is coming which we will talk about next time more with a sense of
the ericssonian issue the life specific task of of of the sense that this is my life it isn't
exactly go as i wanted but it was good enough for myself the sense of integrity that comes from this
it very much fits this scheme the fears that in the past were expressed that people who
retire become depressed become ill etc really have not been substantiated it is not true
that right after retirement or in the immediate few years uh the rates of illness go up the
rates of depression go up nothing of the sort happens unless unless the person has retired
because of illness if the person has retired because of illness then there is a greater
likelihood that things are going to run down that there are going to be these negative effects
that follow but that is simply a continuation of the process of illness rather than uh the impact
of the retirement itself i mentioned earlier the decline in in roles and role demands as one of the
critical aspects of this phase of life now particularly men and we will then talk about women
we get the impression in fact it is inculcated in us that who we are is a function of what we do
this is especially true in the west and i would say especially true in the united states
if you meet somebody at a cocktail party or in some kind of social gathering or even you know on
the bus one of the first questions if there is a conversation on the bus one of the first questions
that comes up is what do you do which is another way of asking who are you because what you do
perhaps more than anything else defines who you are and therefore our choice of an occupation
to begin with the enormous investment of time we put into it over the years and the efforts we put
in the maintenance of that role becomes impossible to separate almost from our sense of identity as
to who we are so when you take that role away of the individual what remains very much depends on
who the person is if all you were was a doctor you cease being a doctor then you seem to disappear
then there is nobody left but if you happen to be the kind of physician who has somebody apart
from being a doctor then the fact that you're no longer practicing medicine doesn't mean that you as
an individual have now vanished so here you have to weigh both the advantages and disadvantages
of disengagement and there has been a lot of confusion about this now if we are going to adhere
to this model that after a period of time we are going to cut back stop or in some important ways
modify our work roles a because in a sense we want to make room for others to move in in
institutions that have a limited cadre of people that they can sustain such as universities
or because we are tired or because enough is enough or because we want to do something else
then inevitably there is going to be this change in role and disengagement is a fact of life for
individuals in this group but the impact of this disengagement has different interpretations whether
it's a good thing or a bad thing or what the consequences are what happens with disengagement
one thing that shrinks is what has been described as one's social space
following retirement or pulling back from work or in this this engaging in this disengagement
process what you do is that typically you interact with fewer people and less frequently
now some of this is simply a function of practical considerations for example older
individuals attendance at church for older individuals after a while tends to go down
this is not because they lose their faith this is not because they're not interested in attending
church but going to church becomes a major production if for example they no longer dry
so by necessity you are going to be sort of squeezed out of the kinds of contacts you had
which gave meaning to your life as well as provide pleasure to your life
i experienced this some time ago long before i was even midlife when i took a year of sabbatical
leave in england now as a professor i am reminded 10 times a day that i am a professor because
people call me by that name when i was in england writing a book nobody called me professor nobody
called me anything so after a while i wasn't sure who i was so you see that we need this kind of
external cues telling us who we are and a lot of this has to do with our professional roles
now the second factor is that people become more individualized we already referred to this
in different terms earlier we talked about interiority turning inwards contemplating
being more more sort of being than doing more contemplative than acting
cicero has wonderful descriptions of this life of leisure that follows a man who has been
prominent and active in politics as he was as a council of the roman empire and he describes in
growing terms how he withdrew to his villa in tasculum in the vicinity of rom where he engaged
in lengthy discussions and contemplation and writing of big major philosophical issues
more individualized yet at the same time you don't have the pool from the outside and again
this means how do you spend your time now some people in this age category have been dying
to reach this point so that they can devote their full attention to a hobby or an interest
that they always had and never had the time to fully pursue this may be a hobby this may be
reading books this may be travel this may be sitting and contemplating your navel it doesn't
matter this opportunity therefore is very much there now everybody agrees that social space shrinks
and people become more individualized as a result of this engagement the disagreement
among experts is this is this a natural process is this the best thing that could happen to people
and are people who disengage actively in the ways i described the ones that are most likely to be
best off some experts say yes others say no actually least disengage people are shown to be
healthier have higher morale and therefore you have sort of a contradictory set of findings
my explanation for this is that we should not fall in the trap of looking at people in this age
in this age group and assume that they are all the same because they are not simply because they
are between the ages of sixty five and seventy five this doesn't mean that they are now cut out from
the same mold and therefore maybe this ought to be more of an individual choice some people thrive
better with an active disengagement that is of their choice and therefore they lead
lives that are more solitary that are more centered on interacting with a few people
other people seem to thrive by remaining active and continuing continuing this kind of
highly engaged lifestyle so all this is now ages 65 to 75 and i think one can realistically say
that this is in fact a new frontier and we have in having rehabilitated what passed for midlife
we have now moved into this area but we have to be careful that in in singing the praises of this
period we repeat we provide people with hope and this does not become a hoax and and and this kind
of a every nice image that i portrayed unfortunately is not available to every american citizen
who enters this age group simply by virtue of entering this age group what happens in the 75
plus age category now aging and biology begin to assert themselves more inexorably you know when
you look back once again about the life cycle all the way back biology the influence of biology is
strongest at the very beginning and at the very end in fact very young children are much like
each other even though everybody is unique and the very old people are much more like each other
than people in between simply because the biological givens the playing field is so heavily
influenced by biology that there is much less opportunity for individual differences there is
less play in the system and therefore that is now the the realistic person without being
depressed over the fact has to recognize the fact that you have to now sort of change the name of
the game and do things a little bit differently here on the the the circumstances of your life
are more likely to be a function of the state of your health rather than your chronological age
so it doesn't matter ultimately whether you are 80 or 70 it is how is your body your health holding
up that's going to make a difference all things being equal the functional reserve we were talking
about earlier that gradually declines now for most individuals begin to fall below that requires
for everyday activities okay earlier I described that as something that will come into play when
you start running now it comes into play even when you're only walking so now there is need for
the adjustment in sort of your everyday activities similarly if there is going to be a decline in
mental functions the decline is going to be made itself felt here it's not inexorable it is more
likely to happen if it's going to happen this is when it starts happening people in their 80s
typically become more frail over 50 of those aged 85 or so have a severe enough disability
that they cannot use public transportation now you can very easily compute from that what the
consequences are of that to individual lives you have a chauffeur limousine you have nothing to
worry about you don't and you can't drive then you have more of a problem now in the previous lecture
I made a point which I want to modify a little bit it had to do with the benefits of giving people
growth hormone and I said do we want to spend thousands of dollars generating growth hormone
well my fundamental point still remains valid that since we came to everything for everybody
we have to sort of husband our resources but there is a financial argument here if in fact
by giving people growth hormone or some other kind of medication we can make them more mobile
than we save billions of dollars which otherwise has to be spent on the care of individuals who
are not able to take care of himself so compassion and love of humanity aside there is an economic
argument to keep the older individuals going as far as possible and reducing that period of disability
to as close to the time of death as we humanly can do and that is going to be a very critical piece
in our healthcare plan managed care etc with 75 the issue of this engagement becomes now more
prominent now you have an increasing cluster of of widowed women and of course more and more
people now are living in retirement homes and these range from places which are absolutely
wonderful places to be two places that are perhaps not so wonderful and and in natural
more of more of the same that has been going on earlier but now pigeons are coming home to roost
and therefore you begin to get gradually into a situation where increased limitation is going to
be increasingly interfered with your life those who are able to adapt to what's going on and this
is going to be one of the themes of next time are the ones that remain reasonably content and happy
so far as humanly possible to the very end those who can't suffer as a consequence
