Lecture 13 Late Adulthood, Biology of Aging and Health
We have now reached the last leg of our journey through adulthood and we will be addressing
the question of what is late adulthood and we shall do so in four installments.
First in this lecture we will look at the biological changes that underlie aging.
Next we will turn to the psychosocial aspects of late adulthood.
Then we will look at the entire issue of personality change through the lifespan with
special emphasis to the later years.
Then finally we shall turn to the question of death, the inevitable end of life, how
does one anticipate it, how does one deal with it, how does one grieve over it and perhaps
touch upon the question is that the end, is there possibly anything beyond death?
What is aging?
When you see someone who looks very old, what kind of an image does it evoke in our minds?
Here again inevitably there are various ways of looking and explaining what goes on yet
there is no question about the fact that aging is an inextricable part of life we have always
been aware of this and in some ways remains one of the mysteries in life, namely why do
we live on average a certain number of years, this has been increasing over the period of
history as we shall see but also from everything we know there are some definite limits that
define us as human beings, there is a certain capital which apparently we cannot exceed.
A few general comments before we get into the substance of this lecture, one is devastating
as its ultimate consequences may be aging is a natural process, it is not an illness,
aging is not an illness but aging predisposes us to get sick, so aging creates the vulnerability
on which illness is superimposed, second until fairly recently perhaps the past 50 years
and no longer than that the issue of large segments of the population getting old was
not something that concerned individuals and society, in the wild animals typically don't
get old, they get eaten up, they die, they succumb to some threat in the environment
and throughout much of human history, much of hominid history, the chances are that our
evolutionary ancestors were subject to the same kind of predation, some kind of externally
imposed or some form of illness which they couldn't deal with and so it is only recently
that we now have large and increasingly larger proportion of people who through one definition
or another can be said to be old or can be said to be showing the manifestations of this
process of aging.
Let's look a little bit more in closer detail to this whole issue of the lifespan and how
it has been changing.
Now here we have to be careful to understand that when we speak about the average length
of life this includes the fact of infants dying in high proportions in previous times
so infant mortality is one very important determinant of these figures but it's not
the only one.
Bearing that in mind so far as we can estimate, of course these are only estimates, we don't
exactly have statistics from these regions, in the ancient world in the Bronze Age period
average life expectancy was an astonishingly low 18 years, even through the classical period
of Greece and Rome, 22 years, middle ages 33 years, when you come to the period more
like several hundred years ago and finally to the turn of the century in this country
1900 we have an average length of life which is almost 60 years.
This is of course now changed and currently the average life expectancy is up 75 and when
we look at the details of the demographics of aging we notice that at birth average
life expectancy for males is 72 years and for females it is 78 years but if you make
it to age 65 then you have an excellent chance if you are a man of going on to become 80
and if you are a woman going on to become 84.
The segment of the population age 65 and upwards has been growing rapidly just to give some
general indices in 1900, 65 and plus age group accounted for 4% and by the year 2000 which
is very soon it is going to account for 15% and another 40 years after that to 20% of
the population.
Since the turn of this century the group of individuals in 65 to 74 bracket has been
increased 8-fold and the group of 85 plus has increased 22-fold.
These are rather striking figures and in fact they seem to indicate what we have seen so
far collectively a general pattern which is best seen by looking at sequential survival
curves over the past several hundred years when we do have information and when we look
at such curves what we see is that in earlier periods and this is still the case in third
world developing countries there is very high infant mortality.
The death rate is high in early years gradually evens out and then accelerates again.
As we move closer to the present age the current period then you see that the successive curves
get pushed further and further upwards.
What that means is that the number of children dying, the number of young people dying is
getting less and less and death is occurring more and more towards the tail end of the
curve.
If you push this to its logical conclusion you end up with a rectangularization of the
curve where hypothetically and we think in the best of all worlds what is going to happen
is that very few children or people in different stages of life are going to die.
They are all going to grow very old and then begin to drop very fast so that over a period
of a few years most people who have reached the end of the sort of logical end of their
life expectancy will no longer exist.
Now we are not quite there and I'm not sure when we will get there but this is the trend
that generally has been in evidence.
How can we explain this mysterious process of aging?
Now at the moment there are many theories but no fully satisfactory explanation.
One theoretical approach looks at factors that are inbuilt and therefore in some ways beyond
our control as it were.
For example one geriatrician Hayflick has shown in experiments that cells that multiply
as they are being cultured in a laboratory go on through a process of dividing and multiplying
but on average do not seem to be able to do this beyond 50 times.
As if they run out of steam as if there is something programmed in these cells that says
after so many times you self-destruct.
This is if in fact what is going on would be the one way of explaining through the sort
of the internal genetic biological capital specific to a species which determines how
long you can live and there is a lot of evidence that these limits in fact are fixed.
So even though human beings in larger and larger numbers are living longer and longer
so all the statistics of the centenarians increasing in large proportions, people post
85 increasing large proportions, the curve is in fact becoming more and more rectangular
but there seems to be an absolute limit a brick wall at around age 120 beyond which
nobody or very few people will ever pass.
So there is absolutely no evidence, no reassurance that no matter how much medical science improves
we will be able to extend the absolute limit of the lifespan beyond this fixed limit of
120 years or so.
And theories that also attempt to explain this same issue may stress more environmental
factors of toxic factors in the environment.
In other words something is happening to us rather than something is internally coded
and is simply being unfolded and all there is to that.
And of course if it's environmentally based then the opportunities of hopefully changing
that, preventing that become more possible even though manipulation of genes through
genetic engineering and other attempts are also now very much of a reality and it is
hard to know how far that frontier is going to be eventually pushed.
So much is changing, much continues to change and much remains to be seen as to the outcome
of all this.
How can we explain the process of aging?
What is aging?
When does aging begin?
Well Hayflick the same expert has a curious way of putting the process of aging.
He says life really consists of two phases.
There is the phase of ripening and there is a phase of rotting.
Rotting is the aging.
Now this is too pessimistic a way of looking at it.
Furthermore the process of aging really begins from the moment that you are born if not earlier
so we are simultaneously ripening and rotting.
But the emphasis is more on ripening in the first half of life and more rotting on the
second half of life.
What forms does this take?
How does this aging describe more palatable terms than suggested?
What forms does it take?
Well let's begin with sort of the superficial, the externally visible part and once again
to review when we say aging we are talking about a lifelong process which is accelerated
after the sixties on which illness is superimposed and we are talking about something that's
universal, progressive and fundamentally irreversible and ultimately some form of decline.
With regard to appearance that is obvious to all of us in more or less fashion.
What may not be very obvious is that even though earlier we mentioned height to be one
of the attainments that stays with you, in fact if you live long enough typically you
may lose one or two inches in stature because the vertebrae tend to shrink down and get
compressed but this is not a dramatic change.
So nobody who is tall becomes short as a result of getting older.
And there are changes in weight and this has to do both with diet, both also with changes
in metabolic rates as well as of course exercise, fitness and what we do.
Now these things are not, biology doesn't tell you when you should exercise, when you
shouldn't exercise, that's both a personal choice as well as a cultural or a socially
determined activity.
Weight tends to follow an inverted U-type curve.
That is to say you gain weight as you are growing into the middle years but as you come
out into the older years you tend to lose weight and therefore in the group that is
really getting into the older years past 70, 75, 80 you are likely to see very few people
who are obese but you will see lots of people who are overweight who are in their 50s.
Typically when we say physical changes of aging we think of changes in the skin, wrinkling
of the skin, the hair turning gray, hair loss and dryness of the skin and the reason for
all this has to do with what happens to the connective tissue that is the sort of the
supporting structure under the skin.
This infrastructure in the skin begins to get less flexible, less elastic, loses its
ability to pull back the elasticity and therefore the superficial layers of the skin begin to
collapse along fault lines and that's when you have wrinkles and in addition to that
the glands that are producing the necessary substances that keep our skins soft and pliable
and moist they are working less effectively and therefore the older skin tends to be a
drier skin.
When we talk about gray hair there is no such thing as a gray hair.
What appears like gray hair is a combination of hair of its natural color and hair that
is white.
So you have white hairs and hair that is colored but the combination from a distance will
look gray.
None of these have any significance to speak of with respect to the individual's basic
health.
Nobody has ever died of gray hair.
But nonetheless physical appearance is of tremendous importance to a lot of people because we are
very conscious of our physical appearance both with respect to sexual attractiveness
as well as the sense of conveying a feeling of being young and vigorous and particularly
in this culture and in western cultures generally and perhaps universally there is a premium
place on youth although this emphasis varies and we tend to overdo the emphasis on youthfulness.
We have to be careful and not simply assume that this is a question of sort of another
of the decadence of western culture because when anthropologists have done studies and
compared ideals of sexual attractiveness of physical attractiveness in various cultures
youthful skin youthful appearance almost always is near the top of the list.
There are ways of looking attractive at any age but all things being equal there seems
to be some intrinsic value placed to youthfulness and perhaps that's not difficult to understand.
Once again if you remember that a lot of this is presumably being driven by sort of evolutionary
considerations with the objective being reproduction youthfulness typically is translated to reproductive
capacity and signs of being older are typically associated with a gradual diminution or loss
of that capacity. So it's very important not to confuse the
appearance with the substance of getting old and because people would rather not look old
and look young especially again as I said in this culture we have a multi-billion dollar
cosmetics industry and millions of people dye their hair and cover their faces with
makeup and go to tremendous lengths including plastic surgery to counteract they hope or
at least modify the what appear like the ravages of time on one's appearance.
Finally it's important to realize that men and women pay a different sort of price in this respect.
This is clearly not only asymmetrical but also patently unfair but there is little doubt
that women traditionally have suffered more in terms of their perception of sexual attractiveness
or physical attractiveness because of the changes of aging than men. The reason for this is that
again traditionally the female sexual attractiveness has been determined by more by physical appearance
as well as other factors like personality background and so on so forth whereas in the case of men
their sexual attractiveness or their desirability as mates beyond sexual attractiveness has been
primarily defined by things like social status and so on so forth and relatively secondarily
by things like physical appearance and and what have you. So this is why with midlife by the
time you reach midlife what has happened and as the process of aging progresses there is more
of a change in physical appearance than there is in social status which if anything keeps getting
higher rather than being lost in the middle and early adult years and you can see why therefore
all things being equal typically typically an aging male is less likely to lose with respect
to sexual attractiveness than a woman getting older. Now this is changing and attitudes are
changing and also because women are now more healthier more attentive to their health not only
through makeup but through things like exercise we have the situation where lots of middle-age
men and women as well as older men and women appear as being attractive exactly by the same
criteria that we have been using younger individuals in the past but ultimately this is simply delaying
the mortgage and we are all going to look caught old unquote and so the question is is it going to
be possible with the dramatic changes going on in social roles and the fact that women are now
going to the same kinds of professions that men typically have so that is it going to be such
that a woman who is going to be let's say the CEO of a major company is going to appear more
attractive to men simply because of her whole higher social status because there is no question
that a man who ends up as the CEO of an organization is going to be seen to be much more
attractive as a matter of fact one can go back and say that one of the reasons people
work so hard to get ahead in their careers to reach these positions of higher status is because it
makes them more desirable mates more desirable sexual partners and therefore that that is one of
the key motivations why you want to succeed this is not true for everyone but we are talking about
sort of general trends so much for this what else is going on still in the category of
physical changes next of course come the census now this is self-evident and we see it all around
as well as in our own experiences vision begins to decline but this begins to happen already in the
30 plus years the lens gets thicker and less sensitive it becomes less elastic therefore
is able to adapt less therefore you need glasses and in fact the 65 plus group wears glasses or
some form of contact lenses in 95 percent of cases and 1 percent are classified as being legally
blind hearing also declines but the change is already in progress at around age 50
65 plus age group have 30 percent of them have impairment in hearing 10 percent use some kind
of hearing aid and 13 percent are considered deaf smell and taste also change there is loss of the
sensation of taste and smell not entirely but but significantly older individuals also tend to have a
dry mouth and in the 65 plus year group 25 percent have these changes at a fairly marked level now
one of the practical consequences of this is that the food doesn't taste as good as you get older
and you have to spice it more and this is very important for for people who take care of particularly
the the sort of the older individuals in that if the food doesn't taste good even it may taste
fine to the cook who may be 35 years old the older person is not going to eat it now you can't keep
loading on salt because that has health consequences but you can certainly load all the pepper
or the other condiments that you need to make the food palatable so a lot of these things
while real they are not things that devastate your life
what about internal changes we have already referred to the loss of muscle mass and that too
is in progress starting in the 50s there is loss of muscle size as well as muscle strength
and another very important change is osteoporosis which we discussed at great length which affects
both men and women but affects women more and there to recapitulate the answer is both possibly
hormonal replacement provided that it is safe for the particular woman but just as importantly
adequate dietary considerations and exercise there is gradual loss of cardio respiratory
reserve without getting into too much technical detail we lose about one percent of our capacity
of maximum oxygen uptake as we get older and cardiac output during exercise suffers a 40
percent loss in the 65 plus year group the nervous system there is loss of cells but there are plenty
of cells so we don't have to lose all of our marbles because we are losing a lot of cells
and changes in neural transmitters all of these things end up with a somewhat slower reaction
time particularly as the person moves into the truly older years now if you happen to be a
worker on a factory on an assembly line and as you get older the problems you are going to encounter
is not because you are getting physically weaker because you're not digging ditches but you may
be unable to keep up with the pace of production with younger people because of this somewhat
reduced this this slower reaction time the immune system immunity goes down this is why older people
are more vulnerable to infections in fact even reasonably healthy elderly individuals
during a flu epidemic when people die there are going to be many more who are in the elderly group
who are going to die than others who may get sick with the flu but not succumb to it now with
respect to changes in the reproductive capacity of women and men this issue has already been
addressed and we need not belabor it when we put all this together there is a distinctive pattern
which emerges which is a nice way of summarizing what is happening to the various systems of the
body as the body ages now in each system and that's for the moment focused on the
cardiorespiratory system the way that the heart and the lungs manage to deal with the
demands placed on it as we move about as we exercise when they are sitting around calmly
our heart rates are steady our blood pressure is steady we are breathing in a relaxed easy manner
but we have the capacity normally to get up and run and when we do that the system will respond
and it will rev up its method of dealing with the with the substances that are being produced by the
body as a result of the exercise and so we remain in an in an equilibrium although at a higher level
now when we rest things go back to the way they were so in each case we have built in a certain
reserve which enables us to exert this extra pressure beyond what we need for ordinary activity
now what happens with aging is that this reserve is gradually lost not entirely but
gradually diminished but we have to bear two important points in mind different systems
of the body show this kind of decline to variable degrees some don't show it at all for example
if we were to make a graph of what is happening with the various systems of the body we will see
that by plotting the levels of fasting blood glucose over the years nothing changes in the
body's ability to deal with this issue because it does not have any tolerance it does not allow for
any margin of not being able to function because otherwise you go into a malfunction so there is
no diminution in the body's ability to handle that normally when you look at something like
cardiac index it's one of the measures of the way the heart works there is a 30 decline over time
if you look at something like the way that oxygen maximum oxygen uptake is taking place
there is even a sharper decline up to 70 of the time so not all systems are losing their reserve
capacity at the same rate second particularly when it comes to the way that the heart and the lungs
and the muscles etc work what you are able to do your level of performance is a function of the
basic level at which your physiological systems are functioning and age as we have said affects that
but there is also the issue of fitness which is equally important so a person who is fit all
things being equal will outperform somebody who is not and therefore you have extreme examples
that if you have an elderly elderly man or woman in his 60s or even 70s who is a champion marathon
runner and has been for a while that person may well outperform somebody half his or her age
but under no circumstance that person is going to outperform his or her own records of 30 years
earlier so these two things eventually determine where we are now this is important because as we
go on talking about particularly in the next lecture what can individuals in their later years do
or can or cannot do we are not simply passively responding to what has happened to the body
as a function of the natural process of aging but what kind of lifestyle we have followed
what kind of fitness do we have because that is going to also make a good deal of difference
let's move on now from the sort of issues of natural decline normal process of aging
and cross into the area of illness and health I said earlier that this aging is not a disease
but aging makes us more vulnerable to illness and here we can plot the kinds of illnesses to which
we become more vulnerable as a matter of course in this particular society
and if we look at the diseases the large classes diseases the acute illnesses such as infections
and so on or chronic conditions such as arthritis or heart disease and the like we see that as the
individual when the individual is young then the illnesses predominantly that afflict that person
are in the acute category and not the chronic category as the person gets into the sort of the
40s these two lines cross and beyond that the prevalence of acute illnesses goes down among
the older groups and the prevalence of chronic illnesses sharply goes up basically the illnesses
to which older individuals gradually become more vulnerable really fall in several categories
first there is the hardening of the arteries and changes that take place in the circulatory system
the outcome of that is greater likelihood of heart disease and stroke for reasons we don't
understand cells have a greater tendency to begin dividing haywire and that's when you have cancer
so here is the second thing to be concerned about and then you have the more chronic conditions
of changes in connective tissue which does not sound too ominous but the connective tissue that
is the tissue that connects muscles to bones and is sort of the filler in the various organs of the
body as that begins to lose its elasticity and undergoes changes that's where bones and joints
start to creak that's why some 20 million americans have arthritis of one form or the other
death rates although in inevitable in the sense that everybody eventually dies
also vary both by sex as well as social factors like ethnicity just the purely social factor
but a combination of both genetic as well as social factors so when we look at persons who
are still surviving uh over age we see that the highest curves the longest living individuals
on average are white females that are up there we already saw this in terms of their higher
life expectancy figures black females and white males have very similar
death curves which is sort of the opposite of life expectancy curves and black males are the ones
who are most likely to die and this is true at all ages so that these curves in a way never cross
they move together so what is happening here is that first of all being female
protects you and being a white female has an additional advantage so the fact that white males
and black females have very similar curves is that one is bringing the benefits of whiteness
the other is bringing the benefit of femaleness and of course whiteness in this case overwhelmingly
refers to socioeconomic class the lifestyle kind of diet available to you availability of
healthcare all of the things that keeps us not only alive but well and the black male is paying
the double penalty of both being black as well as a male we take a closer look at the various
diseases that in fact result in death in different age groups and when we look at the
youngest group and these statistics are compiled in a way which do not quite fit the kind of
chronological divisions we have been following but in the youngest 15 to 24 year old age group
the most common cause of death is not illness but accidents and in this case are things like
heart disease cancer are not important causes of death accidents and suicide which is another form
of violent violence and homicide claim most of the lives but most important are accidents
if we jump to the middle years and this is the way of reviewing now cancer has become much more
prominent along with heart disease and accidents suicide homicide do not take as much of a toll
except that at this age for white males suicide is going to start taking off and for reasons without
quite understand white males end up having the highest suicide rates as they get older
as you move into the oldest age groups the preponderance of heart disease now accompanied by
cerebral vascular problems stroke primarily become much more prominent and accidents suicide
and homicide are much less so once again except for white males that have that peculiar condition
of higher rates of suicide so once more there are why when you die and what you die from
is not the same for everybody and we bring both in terms of our genetic makeup as well as whatever
causes these things different assets different liabilities with different outcomes finally
there is a condition that has now become very much of a problem in this culture one of the
consequences of lots of people living for far longer than they used to and I refer here to
Alzheimer's disease which is certainly a sort of the fourth threat in addition to the first three
I enumerated earlier as to what one begins to worry about as one gets older now there are some
4.4 million Americans who suffer from a variety of dementias which refers to a chronic irreversible
declines and disturbances of mental functioning and of these 15 percent are over 65 but at 65
itself only one person of this population is subject to this so this is not something that
you are going to start worrying about when in your 50s and early 60s you start having trouble
remembering names and and and things like that 20 percent are over 80 and of the dementias
70 percent are Alzheimer's disease so Alzheimer's disease is not the only form but it is the most
frequent form of dementias we know a good deal about what goes on during Alzheimer's disease but
we don't know why these things happen and the well-known changes in the brain are there are
the the neurofibrillator retangles there are senile plaques that consist of amyloid and without
getting into too many technical details there are definite brain changes that a pathologist can see
under a microscope in fact the only way where you can be absolutely certain of the diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease is after the person has died because a lot of the symptoms that appear as a
result of the Alzheimer's disease in and of themselves may not be possible to differentiate
from dementias of other types what happens with respect to symptoms now one of the hallmarks of
Alzheimer's disease is the its progressive nature it progresses maybe slowly maybe fast but once it
starts it is relent it is relentless and with respect to cognitive functions there is progressive
and serious decline in memory in learning in attention in judgment eventually the person
becomes disoriented in time and place doesn't know where he or she is and difficulties in
communication so you really are in some serious way interfering almost globally with all of the
functions of the brain the manifestations in behavior which are presumably secondary to these
changes in the brain lead to things like decline in personal hygiene and self-care in continents
in appropriate social behavior so there is a dramatic change in who the person is and this is
terribly painful probably more to the people who are dear to the individual than himself or herself
because you don't know what is happening to you at least so far as we can tell i'm not saying that
this is a happy state of mind but it's a very difficult situation not just for the patient but
for the caregivers as well and of course it results in an emotional tremendous burden both
emotionally financially and otherwise in taking care of these people finally there is the emotional
component of the Alzheimer's patient feeling depressed feeling agitated sometimes being hostile
paranoid which further complicates the management of these individuals now this is a this is a
condition that is under under great and relentless scrutiny and it is it is hoped that sooner or
later we will be able to crack the mystery of what causes what has come to be known as kind of
living death and here's an example where you begin to wonder whether it is really such a fantastic
thing to be able to live very long because if you are going to live very long and the price
for living very long is to spend the last several years of your life in this condition
then i am not sure how most of us would judge that as a as a blessing or a curse so before we
romanticize and there is a tendency to do this how great it is to live forever and ever we must
realize that under present circumstances at least there are both joys as well as dangers in getting
old and these things however fortunately mainly are problems of the post 75 age post 65 less to
less than extent age group as we will discuss in the next lecture we have now a far more differentiated
view of the aging population in fact we will see next time how the two are being separated from
each other the young old and the old old and when i have been referring to people getting old and
aging and these things are beginning to happen in a significant way mostly i am referring to
people who are in the 75 and plus year group what can we do about all this well uh at some level
nothing and that's the way it is as we said there is no point arguing with biology whether that is
in the form of a secular theory of evolution or god it's there and you have to take it however
there is a great deal that we can do there's a great deal that we can do not only modifying
how long we live given the limits but how well we live and here there are two approaches one is
through modification of one's lifestyle now there is not much to be gained by starting to modify
your lifestyle if you have one foot in the grave uh this in order to be effective has to start early
and it involves obvious things like smoking excessive use of alcohol
poor dietary habits lack of exercise a lifestyle that entails tremendous stress these things are
bad for us and this is one of the reasons why we get into difficulty later on and to the extent
that we are able to modify these behaviors at least temper them then we really have greater
control on what happens to us so we are not simply predestined uh to take whatever comes our way we
have some control in what's going on now an alternative approach is to come up with newer and
fancier drugs and there are some promising avenues here the search for the fountain of use in the
form of some magical silver bullet is as old as humanity most of it so far has been absolutely
useless but we are reaching a point now where for example the use of growth hormone clearly seems to
be able to rebuild muscle mass bone strength and affect cholesterol metabolism body fat and psychological
well-being so practically all of these things are sort of in the process of aging uh in addition
to the use of growth hormone we have already seen the tremendous benefits that women can derive from
estrogen similarly testosterone replacement may improve particularly when there's a deficiency
muscle mass strength you see a whole new field opening but i must confess that while i applaud
this and as a physician of course i am grateful for any kind of pill i can use to help people
i am more likely to put my money on changes in lifestyle for one thing that doesn't cost anything
and it costs it saves money whereas this kind of more fancy pills cost money and there is an ethical
issue involved here should we spend thousands and thousands of dollars helping somebody
remain stronger through the use of these fancy hormones when countless children die
for lack of a vaccine that costs 10 lousy cents in the best of all worlds we should be able to
have both in a realistic world we need to set priorities of what comes first
