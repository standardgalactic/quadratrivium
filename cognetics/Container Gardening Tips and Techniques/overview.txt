1. **Objective**: The goal was to enhance the curb appeal of the front entrance of a townhouse by creating a cohesive and inviting garden setting using containers at various levels.

2. **Design Elements**: We applied the 'thriller, filler, spiller' method, which involves:
   - A 'thriller': A tall, focal point plant like the ribbon bush or papyrus to draw attention.
   - A 'filler': Plants that have enough mass and texture to fill in around the thriller, such as bacopa or coral bells.
   - A 'spiller': Plants that cascade over the edge of the container, like sweet potato vine or heliotrope.

3. **Plant Selection**:
   - Coral Bells: To tie the garden from the front to the bench and carry the color blue through the containers.
   - Heliotrope: For its fragrant blooms and butterfly-attracting qualities.
   - Papyrus: As a vertical accent for a dramatic effect at the front entrance.

4. **Adjustments for Seasonal Changes**: In fall, we replaced the heliotrope with asters and added ornamental peppers for visual interest, which can be brought indoors if necessary. Pumpkins were added for seasonal flair and to tie the container planting to the changing season.

5. **Maintenance**: Occasionally, the papyrus stems needed trimming due to wind damage.

6. **Challenges**: The containers had to be chosen with the scale of the space in mind, ensuring there was enough space for people to move around on the landing areas.

7. **Tips for Viewers**: Encouraged viewers to use the same 'thriller, filler, spiller' method for their own container plantings and to adapt their choices seasonally.

8. **Future Session**: A promise to cover the challenges of landscaping a small deck and more design principles in the next session.

9. **Fall Update**: In fall, we added asters and ornamental peppers to the existing containers to create a festive and colorful autumn display. The sweet potato vine was trained to cascade over the edges of the pots, and seasonal pumpkins were included for additional interest. The cardinal vine provided a burst of red against the green railing on the landing.

In summary, we created a beautiful and welcoming front entrance garden by using containers with a thoughtful design approach that includes tall focal points, massed filler plants, and spillers that soften the edges and invite passersby to take notice. The seasonal updates ensure the garden remains fresh and appealing throughout the year.

1. **Garden Updates:** The garden has a mix of climbing vines (like black-eyed Susan vines), trailing plants (such as verbena binariensis), and annuals like Bacopa and Lantana to add color and attract pollinators.
   
2. **Herb Garden Maintenance:** We deadheaded faded flowers, like nasturtiums, to encourage new blooms and harvested herbs for culinary use, ensuring we cut above a set of healthy leaves to maintain plant health and flavor intensity.

3. **Container Changes for Summer:** We removed some cool-season annuals that were past their prime and replaced them with heat-tolerant plants like fountain grass and blue arrow reed. We also integrated verbena binariensis to tie the garden together and attract pollinators.

4. **Pest Management:** White fly nymphs were found on calendulas, which can still be managed with a strong blast of water or insecticidal soap to keep them edible.

5. **Harvesting Blueberries:** We're looking forward to harvesting blueberries from our container garden for a tasty morning treat.

6. **Plant Replacement and Monitoring:** We replaced pansies with blue arrow reed and verbena binariensis in a planter to maintain visual interest and attract pollinators. We also monitored and managed pests on tomatoes and other plants, emphasizing the importance of early intervention for pest control.

1. **Choosing a Planter**: Select a planter that can withstand the elements if placed outdoors, such as a plastic hanging basket, a wall-mounted pot, or a decorative container. If you're using a decorative one, line it with a material like cocoa mat and fill it with soil or another medium to anchor the plants.

2. **Materials for Fall Arrangement**: Use materials that will last through winter, such as:
   - Colorful twig dogwoods (Cornus)
   - Red twig dogwoods (Cornus)
   - Birches (Betula)
   - Corkscrew willows (Salix)
   - Rose hips (after blooming)
   - Ornamental grasses for texture and movement
   - Dried flowers or foliage, like fennel, goldenrod (Solidago), hydrangeas, and millet (Panicum virgatum 'Purple Majesty')

3. **Designing the Arrangement**: Follow basic container garden design principles:
   - Thrillers (tall plants) – Use vertical accents like purple majesty millet and ornamental grasses.
   - Fillers (mid-level plants) – Add color and texture with Joe Pie Weed and berries.
   - Spillers (plants that cascade over the edge) – Let some elements flow over the pot's edge.

4. **Final Touches**: Review your arrangement to ensure it has balance and consider adding additional elements, like more orange tones or gourds for extra color and interest.

5. **Enjoying the Arrangement**: Step back to appreciate the beauty of your container garden and enjoy the seasonal changes as plants mature and go through their natural cycles.

6. **Look Ahead**: In the next session, learn how to create privacy on a large deck using various methods and materials.

Remember, the key to a successful outdoor container arrangement is selecting the right plants and materials that will thrive in your climate and last throughout the seasonal changes.

1. **Tall Containers**: Use large containers to create height and visual interest in a small space. You can stack several smaller containers to achieve the desired effect. This allows for color, texture, and interest from the ground up. Succulents are particularly well-suited for this due to their subtleties and low maintenance.

2. **Vertical Accents**: Incorporate vertical elements like cleomy, purple majesty millet, and various narrow-leafed plants such as cordiline, spike, and formium. These can serve as focal points and provide structure to your garden design.

3. **Vines**: Train vines like climatis, honey suckle, climbing nasturtians, hyacinth bean vine, and morning glories on trellises, obelisks, or walls. Ensure the support is appropriate for the type of vine you're using; for example, climbing hydrangea requires a rough surface to hold fast.

4. **Intimate Areas**: Use containers to create separate, intimate spaces within your outdoor living area. Large containers can act as dividers and provide both privacy and accent points.

5. **Water Features**: Incorporate water features in containers to soften the view, enhance intimacy, and bring the garden experience closer to your living space.

6. **Designing Outdoor Living Spaces**: The next session will focus on designing an outdoor living space using containers, exploring various themes, and considering the practical aspects of gardening such as handling pests and diseases.

7. **Garden Center Visit**: In the next session, we'll visit a garden center to further explore the selection of containers and plants that can enhance your outdoor living space. We'll also delve into problem-solving for common issues like pests and diseases.

In summary, tall containers, vertical accents, vines, intimate spaces with containers, and water features are all great ways to utilize container gardening in small spaces to create a beautiful and functional outdoor living space. The next session will provide more detailed guidance on these topics and how to maintain your garden's health and vitality.

1. **Garden Containers as Centerpieces**: The presenter used repurposed saucers and plastic pots to create multi-tiered garden containers, ideal for succulents or edible plants. They ensured proper drainage by drilling holes and placed the bottom layer free for water drainage without damaging furniture.

2. **Sedum and Hens and Chicks**: These are great for green roofs and container gardens due to their shallow root systems. The presenter suggested using pre-divided plants or small plugs for easier planting.

3. **Watering**: It's important to water these containers thoroughly but ensure the plants aren't sitting in excess water by using an extra saucer as a base.

4. **Sprouting Jars**: The presenter demonstrated how to sprout seeds in a mason jar using cheese cloth and a rubber band, rinsing the seeds twice a day to prevent mold. They also introduced microgreens as a quick-growing and nutritious option, which can be grown vertically in a mini greenhouse setup.

5. **Microgreens**: These are similar to sprouts but grown with soil. The presenter used sunflower seeds as an example, showing that these greens can be ready to harvest in just two days.

6. **Recycling for Gardening**: The presenter encouraged using recycled food containers for sprouting or growing microgreens, highlighting a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach to gardening.

7. **Upcoming Session**: In the next session, the presenter promised to discuss fall and winter care for container gardens and also plant up an indoor container with ideas for holiday gardens. They invited viewers to join them in the next session.

1. **Bulb Update**: The bulbs planted in late fall are starting to sprout above ground. We have a layered planting with white stars (Snowdrops) that have already begun to sprout, followed by hyacinths which are just emerging. These were potted up for enjoyment indoors and will soon provide a spring bouquet. After blooming, the spent flowers should be removed, water provided, and fertilizer applied to encourage reblooming. When the frost danger has passed, these bulbs can be planted outdoors or left in their containers for fall blooms.

2. **Amaryllis**: An amaryllis was potted alongside paper whites, providing a subsequent display of flowers after the paper whites finish blooming. The paper whites have been up for about a month and are emitting a delightful fragrance.

3. **Care Tips for Indoor Plants**:
   - Protect plants from extreme heat and cold during transport.
   - Remove protective wraps immediately after bringing plants indoors to avoid ethylene gas buildup, which can speed up bloom fade.
   - For plants like poinsettias, ensure they're placed back in the light quickly to maintain their beauty.
   - Use foil to cover pots for light and drainage, and place pebbles in the bottom of the pot or tray to prevent waterlogging and make it easier to manage watering.
   - If growing flowering plants indoors, use artificial lights that provide both blue and red wavelengths for healthy growth and flowering.

4. **Extending Christmas Tree Life**: After the holiday season, you can extend the life of your Christmas tree by placing it outdoors in a cold, wind-protected location or in a spot where it can continue to receive sunlight. Decorate with berries, homemade feeders for birds, and other natural elements to enhance its visibility and appeal during the winter months.

5. **Container Gardening Highlights**: Containers are versatile and can be used to create a full garden, complement an existing landscape, improve views, or serve as multifunctional elements that provide food for humans, birds, and butterflies. The test gardens have demonstrated the variety of ways containers can be used year-round to add beauty and functionality to any space.

In summary, the indoor bulbs are sprouting, and with proper care, they will continue to bloom indoors or outdoors as the weather permits. The amaryllis is set to take center stage after the paper whites have finished their display. Indoor plants require careful handling during transport, ample light for health and flowering, and regular maintenance for optimal appearance. Extending the life of your Christmas tree can add a seasonal touch to your winter landscape, and container gardening offers numerous benefits for extending the enjoyment of plants year-round.
