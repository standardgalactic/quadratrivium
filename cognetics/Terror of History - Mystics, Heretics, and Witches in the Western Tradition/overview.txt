 In this lecture, Professor Yuval Noah Harari discusses three ways that medieval people, and indeed humans throughout history, have coped with the terror and uncertainties of existence. These responses are relevant to understanding how societies have faced the anxieties provoked by natural disasters, personal hardships, and the awareness of mortality.

1. **Religion**: The first response is to embrace religious beliefs that attribute the events of history and the nature of the world to a supernatural will. By accepting that a divine entity controls these events, individuals can find solace and meaning in their lives, as they are no longer solely responsible for their fate. This approach has been effective historically because it shifts the responsibility of controlling the uncontrollable to a higher power.

2. **Materialism**: The second response is to escape from history by immersing oneself in the material world. This involves seeking pleasure, comfort, and distraction through possessions, sensual experiences, and hedonistic pursuits. While this can provide temporary relief from existential dread, it is often an unsustainable solution as it requires constant consumption and can lead to further discontent or financial ruin.

3. **Aestheticism**: The third response is to create beauty and knowledge as a means of constructing meaning and understanding the world. This involves engaging with art, music, literature, and science to transcend the limitations of the physical world and find solace in the realm of ideas and aesthetics. This approach allows individuals to shape their own reality and find personal meaning in an often chaotic and terrifying world.

Professor Harari emphasizes that these responses are not mutually exclusive and that many people throughout history have combined elements of religion, materialism, and aestheticism in various ways to make sense of their lives and the world around them. In the following lectures, he will explore how Europeans from 1,000 to 1,700 AD created meaning and coped with the challenges of their time.

between 1000 and 1700, European society underwent a profound transformation from a feudal system to a more centralized and public one. This period saw the rise of new social relations and bonds of loyalty between kings or lords and their subjects, facilitated by the introduction and control of money by these rulers. The emergence of a bourgeoisie in urban centers led to an alliance with the church and the crown against the traditional nobility.

Kings began to centralize power and transform from feudal monarchs to early nation-states, a process that involved both political and cultural changes, including the creation of national identities. This was accentuated by the kings' use of sacred authorities, such as holy anointment and crown ceremonies, which presented them as semi-divine entities. The concept of the 'king's two bodies' distinguished between the human aspect of the king and their mystical role as a symbol of the state.

The late 13th to the early 14th century marked the emergence of the idea of sovereignty, where governments claimed a legalized monopoly on violence within their territories. This led to the development of new forms of coercion and control, including taxation, conscription, surveillance, prisons, mental institutions, and standing armies, as well as bureaucracies. These changes were accompanied by increased social anxieties and uprisings, such as the German peasants' revolt in 1525 and the witch craze, which were partly responses to these new forms of state power.

The rise of the rational state and the legalized monopoly of violence by governments were key developments that characterized the transition from the medieval world to the early modern period. This transformation set the stage for the subsequent emergence of the modern nation-state.

1. The term "Renaissance" was not used by people in the 12th century; they saw themselves as continuing and expanding upon classical knowledge and traditions.

2. The Renaissance, particularly in Italy during the 14th and 15th centuries, was a period where there was a conscious effort to reclaim and rediscover the great heritage of antiquity. This involved a shift from scholasticism and metaphysics to a focus on humanistic learning, including rhetoric, grammar, and literature—the humanities.

3. The Middle Ages, which spanned from the fall of Rome to the onset of the Renaissance, were seen by Renaissance thinkers as an interim period of barbarity where little significant progress occurred.

4. Secularization was a key part of European culture's evolution during this time, moving away from a world dominated by religion towards one grounded in the material and secular.

5. The scientific revolution from the 16th century onwards further shifted focus from religious explanations to empirical evidence and secular reasoning, leading to new ways of understanding the world.

6. High culture and popular culture were not clearly distinguished in medieval and early modern times. Mysticism was a high cultural pursuit that could influence popular movements, while heresy and millenarianism were sometimes both high-level intellectual debates and widespread social movements.

7. The distinction between high and low culture is tenuous when considering historical contexts. High culture is what survives in written form, while popular culture is harder to discern and is often filtered through the perspectives of those who recorded it.

8. Throughout the course, we will explore various aspects of culture, alternating between high cultural texts and practices and popular cultural movements, always aware of the limitations and biases that come with historical sources.

Checking Terror of History - Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition/04 - Mysticism in the Western Tradition.txt
1. **Preparation (Purgative Way)**: This stage involves purification and cleansing of the soul from its earthly attachments and imperfections. The mystic begins to recognize their sinful nature and the need for spiritual detachment, often through practices like asceticism or meditation.

2. **Illumination (Illuminative Way)**: In this stage, the mystic gains a deeper understanding of God and the divine mysteries. They experience moments of insight where they perceive the beauty and unity of the world and a sense of the presence of God. This stage is characterized by consolations, visionary experiences, and sometimes automatic writing.

3. **Dark Night (Unitive Way)**: This is a period of spiritual dryness and desolation, where the mystic feels cut off from God. It's a time of deep introspection, prayer, and suffering as the soul prepares for the final union with the divine. The mystic experiences a profound sense of emptiness and longing, which is actually a preparation for the most intimate phase of spiritual life.

4. **Spiritual Marriage (Unitive Way)**: This stage is characterized by the mystic's complete surrender to God, often described using the analogy of human marriage. The soul becomes one with God in a profound and mystical union that transcends human understanding. Some mystics report that during this experience, their individual consciousness merges completely with the divine, while others maintain a sense of self.

5. **Mystical Death (Unitive Way)**: In some cases, the mystic undergoes a period where they become unresponsive to the external world, experiencing a symbolic or literal 'death' to the physical realm. This is a total immersion in the divine presence and is often accompanied by profound peace and joy.

6. **Ecupenia (Transformation)**: After the mystical death, the mystic returns to consciousness with a transformed awareness. They are now permanently changed, having experienced the ineffable union with God, which imparts a new perspective on life and a heightened sense of divine presence.

Throughout these stages, the mystic undergoes profound changes both physically (with measurable changes in brain activity) and psychologically, culminating in a spiritual rebirth or transformation. The exact nature of these experiences can vary widely among different mystics, but they all involve a deepening relationship with God that is both transformative and ineffable.

1. Bernard of Clairvaux's approach to love as described in his work can be summarized in four stages:
   - First, learn to love yourself. This is the foundation, but it's not enough on its own.
   - Second, transition to loving God because, as Bernard suggests, this love is reciprocal and may lead to better treatment from God.
   - Third, recognize that God's love is beneficial and enriching, which can lead to a deeper appreciation of the divine.
   - Fourth, achieve a state of complete self-giving to God, loving God for Godself, which is the ultimate goal of mystical experience.

2. Bernard describes this fourth stage as a process where the soul, after humility and purification (akin to ascetic practices in the desert), becomes receptive to divine love. This is under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

3. The soul then enters into itself, guided by Christ's command to "stay yourselves in your hearts" (Hebrews 10:24), and emerges with grace to engage in acts of charity towards others.

4. The soul is likened to a bride uniting with the king, representing the union between the human soul and God. This union is so intimate that it transcends human understanding and language.

5. Bernard's mystical experience and his writings have had profound influences on Christian spirituality, shaping the Cistercian Order, influencing the development of Gothic architecture, and contributing to the rise of the Virgin Mary's cult in medieval Christianity. The feminine imagery of the soul as a bride reflects the broader cultural trends of courtly love and the veneration of the Virgin Mary during this period.

In essence, Bernard of Clairvaux's teachings on love and mysticism not only shaped individual spirituality but also had lasting impacts on the cultural and architectural aspects of medieval Christianity.

1. **Francis of Assisi**:
   - A wealthy young man from Italy who renounced his wealth and founded the Order of Friar Minor (Franciscans).
   - He was known for his deep love for nature and poverty, and he preached a message of love, humility, and peace.
   - In 1224, while in prayer, Francis received the stigmata, mystical wounds corresponding to those of Christ, making him the first recorded person to receive this injury.
   - His influence led to the creation of the Franciscan Order, which played a significant role in Christian history.
   - He composed "Canticle of the Sun," a hymn expressing his reverence for all creatures and elements of nature.
   - Francis died in 1226, but his legacy continued through the Franciscans and their adherence to his teachings of humility and simplicity.

2. **Dante Alighieri**:
   - An Italian poet born in 1265, Dante was a member of the Florentine nobility and deeply involved in the political strife of his time.
   - In his late teens or early twenties, Dante met Beatrice Portinari, whose beauty and virtue profoundly influenced him.
   - After Beatrice's death in 1290, Dante was politically exiled from Florence in 1302, marking the beginning of his journey through physical and spiritual exile.
   - His greatest work, "Divine Comedy," is an epic poem that chronicles a journey through three realms: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.
   - In "Inferno," the first part of the trilogy, Dante symbolically encounters the political and moral corruption of his time within the nine circles of Hell.
   - Guided by the Roman poet Virgil, Dante navigates through the underworld, eventually reaching Purgatory, where he is guided by Beatrice.
   - In "Purgatorio," Dante ascends the mountain of Purgatory, symbolically cleansing his soul and preparing for a vision of God.
   - In "Paradiso," the final part, Dante's journey leads him to ultimately behold the divine light, completing his mystical ascent and achieving an understanding of the love that moves the sun and the other stars (Aristotle's Unmoved Mover).
   - Dante completed "Divine Comedy" in 1320 and died in 1321, leaving behind a legacy that solidified his status as one of the greatest poets and thinkers of the Middle Ages. His work offers insights into medieval culture and spirituality, as well as a profound vision of the afterlife and the nature of God.

Checking Terror of History - Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition/07 - Jewish Mysticism.txt
1. **Kabbalah and its Purpose**: The purpose of Kabbalah, a branch of Jewish mysticism, is to restore the world to its divine origin. This is achieved through teshubah (repentance), which has the power to heal the world and bring about redemption.

2. **Historical Significance**: In the 13th century, Kabbalists in a small community in Castile were deeply engaged in these mystical practices, believing that their personal and collective spiritual work could influence the entire world's return to God. This theme remains relevant today, as seen in the teachings of groups like the Lubavitcher Hasidim.

3. **The Shema**: A key ritual in Judaism, the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9), is recited twice daily by observant Jews and is a central component of Jewish worship. It proclaims the unity of God and, when recited with deep concentration, can facilitate a mystical union between the individual and God.

4. **Crossing of Ideas**: Despite originating in a specific Jewish context, the concepts and practices of Kabbalah spread beyond the Jewish community by the late 13th and early 14th centuries, influencing Christian thinkers and mystics.

5. **The Renaissance**: By the 15th century, Kabbalistic ideas were integral to the Italian Renaissance, with figures like Pico della Mirandola acknowledging the influence of Kabbalah on human dignity and the special relationship between God and humanity as envisioned in Jewish mysticism.

6. **Christian Kabbalists**: Some Christians not only engaged with Kabbalistic thought but also learned Hebrew to better understand these texts. They were fascinated by the numerical and letter symbolism found in Kabbalah, which they believed could unlock deeper spiritual truths.

7. **Cultural Transformation**: Kabbalistic teachings and practices became an important part of European cultural transformation, with Kabbalists influencing Italian humanists and scientists. They even taught Hebrew, contributing to a broader understanding and interpretation of sacred texts.

8. **The Name of Jesus**: An example of the fusion of Christian and Kabbalistic symbolism is the belief that the name "Jesus" in Hebrew letters is one letter away from the tetragrammaton, the sacred name of God in Judaism, indicating the close relationship between divine names and the mystical significance of words and numbers.

In summary, Kabbalah has had a profound impact on Jewish thought and has also influenced Christian mysticism and the broader cultural and intellectual currents of Western history, particularly during the Renaissance. The mystical practice of returning to God through teshubah and the study of sacred texts like the Shema continues to resonate across different faith traditions.

Checking Terror of History - Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition/08 - Mysticism in Early Modern Europe.txt
1. **The Context of Mysticism**: Mysticism serves as a means for individuals to transcend the material world and its terrors, offering an escape from the oppressions of history, such as the conflicts of early modern Europe. Santa Teresa and Saint John of the Cross exemplify this by focusing on personal spiritual experiences during tumultuous times in imperial Spain.

2. **Santa Teresa de Ávila**: Known for her passionate love poetry and mystical writings, Teresa's life was marked by a dedication to religious reform within the Carmelite Order. Her ecstatic experiences and founding of monasteries demonstrate the empowering aspect of mysticism, which can transcend social hierarchies.

3. **Saint John of the Cross**: A contemporary of Teresa, he emphasized the dark night of the soul, a process of purification that leads to spiritual detachment and union with God. His poetry, such as "The Dark Night of the Soul," uses the metaphor of a lover's experience to describe the journey towards divine love.

4. **The Four Stages of Mysticism According to John of the Cross**:
   - Purgative way: Purifying the soul from imperfections and attachments.
   - Illuminative way: Enlightening the soul with the understanding of faith.
   - Unitive way: Achieving a state of constant union with God.
   - The Union: The ultimate stage where the soul is passive and overwhelmed by divine love.

5. **Mysticism as Empowerment**: Despite the contemplative nature of mysticism in the 16th century, mystics like Teresa and John of the Cross played active roles in the world, influencing society and challenging class and gender norms.

6. **The Thin Line Between Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy**: Mysticism often sits on a fine line between orthodox religious practice and heterodox beliefs, particularly when it comes to those who challenge established orders or anticipate radical changes, such as millenarian movements.

In conclusion, mysticism is a profound aspect of European culture and consciousness that has significantly shaped history by empowering individuals to transcend societal constraints and offering an alternative perspective to the material world. It is both an inner journey towards spiritual union with the divine and an external force that can influence the broader human experience.

1. The Christian understanding of eschatology, or the end times, has roots in the works of early Christian writers like Lactancias, who described a series of events culminating in the final battle between Christ and the Antichrist, followed by the Last Judgment and the end of history.

2. Jochakim of Theori, a 12th-century monk, proposed a different interpretation of eschatology, suggesting that history is divided into three ages: the age of God the Father, the age of the Son (from Jesus' birth to the present), and the upcoming age of the Holy Spirit. In this final age, humans will have direct access to God without intermediaries like priests or the church.

3. Jochakim's ideas influenced later medieval movements, such as those led by Francis of Assisi and the Flagellants, who believed they were living in the new age foretold by Jochakim, marking the beginning of the third age.

4. The figure of a sleeping king, destined to awaken and lead Christians against the Antichrist, became associated with Holy Roman Emperors like Frederick II, whose propagandists presented him as a messianic figure.

5. Millenarian movements, which often emerged from among the poor and oppressed, saw the end of the first millennium (AD 1000) as a moment of potential liberation and a thousand years of peace and plenty.

6. Norman Corn's "The Pursuit of the Millenium" highlights the connection between these apocalyptic movements and totalitarian regimes in modern history, as both can use the promise of a millennium to rally and control people.

Checking Terror of History - Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition/10 - The Church Under Attack.txt
1. **Pope Innocent III and the Albigensian Crusade**: In 1208, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade against the Catares (Albigensians), whom he labeled as heretical. This was a politically motivated move to expand the Kingdom of France into areas that were not yet part of it, under the guise of religious purity. The Catares, who believed in a dualist view of the world and were considered non-orthodox Christians, fought alongside Catholics from the south of France against the invading northern forces led by Peter II of Aragon, known as Peter the Catholic, who died in battle at Muret in 1213.

2. **The Defeat and Survival of Cataresm**: The Catares were brutally suppressed by the northern crusaders, leading to their near-extinction in some areas. However, pockets of Catarism survived for a long time, particularly in Montaillou, a village in the Pyrenees, where heretical beliefs persisted even a century and a half after the initial suppression.

3. **Franciscan Offshoots and the Flagellants**: The Franciscan order split into two main groups: the Fraticelles (radical Franciscans) and the Observants (regular Franciscans). The Fraticelles believed that the end of times was near due to the influence of Joachim of Fiore's prophecies, which suggested that the year 1260 would mark the beginning of a new era. The Flagellant movement emerged from this belief, with followers publicly flogging themselves as a way to atone for sins and bring about the millennium. The Church initially struggled to reconcile these movements with orthodox Christian beliefs, eventually condemning them as heretical.

In summary, the 13th century saw significant religious and political upheavals in the West, marked by the Albigensian Crusade, the survival of Catarism despite persecution, and the emergence of radical movements within Christianity, including the Franciscans and the Flagellants, which challenged orthodoxy and reflected millenarian expectations.

 The narrative begins with an anecdote about a begat who encounters three women and is asked to explain the concept of the Trinity. In his response, he cynically equates the Trinity with a sexual act involving himself, one of the women, and her alleged seducer. This story serves as an example of how religious concepts were often misinterpreted or misrepresented by those who opposed the Church or were simply corrupt individuals. The tale also highlights the prevalent views on women, who were frequently depicted as victims in such narratives.

The free spirits, or beguins and beguards, were laypeople who led a pious life but did not join formal religious orders. They were literate, often meddlesome, and defiant of ecclesiastical authority. Their lifestyle was a thorn in the side of the Church because they exemplified an alternative form of Christianity that was not under the direct control of the established Church hierarchy.

The late Middle Ages saw a proliferation of such secular religious movements, with individuals like Margarit Porret, a beguin from Henao, who wrote "The Mirror of Simple Souls." This work was a significant literary achievement and a mystical treatise that outlined the stages of grace and spiritual union. Despite her piety and adherence to Christian teachings, Margarit was eventually executed as a heretic in Paris, indicating the tension between such free spirits and the Church authorities.

The story of the beguin Margarit Porret and her association with an individual claiming to be the Angel of Philadelphia illustrates the complex and often perilous relationship between these free spirits and the established Church during the late Middle Ages. It also underscores the fluidity of religious identities and beliefs outside the confines of regular orders.

 The historical roots of the Christian self, which often sees itself as apolitical, have significantly influenced political thought and action, particularly in the context of the United States. This influence dates back to the English Reformation and Puritan Revolution of the 17th century, where radical religious ideas challenged the secular nature of power and royalty. The Puritans' belief that "there is no king but King Jesus" led to a series of radical political and religious movements in England, such as the levelers, diggers, fifth monarchy men, and early Quakers. These groups advocated for various forms of social equality, communal living, and biblical governance.

These English dissenters brought their ideas to America, where they saw the New World as a utopian haven—a "city upon the hill"—reflecting the heavenly Jerusalem on earth. This Puritan legacy has shaped American political life, often linking religious conviction with political action and millenarian visions of America's role in the world.

The persistence of this historical intertwining of religion and politics is evident today, as seen in a recent example where the current U.S. Attorney General, speaking at a university, invoked a phrase that originally came from a radical Puritan sermon of the 17th century, highlighting the enduring influence of these early ideals on American political discourse.

 The video and subsequent discussion touched upon the concept of messianism within Judaism and its impact on Jewish history and culture. Key points include:

1. **Messianic Movements**: Various Jewish messianic movements have emerged throughout history, including the Sabbatean movement led by Shabbatai Sevi in the 17th century and the Hasidic movement founded by the Baal Shem Tov in the 18th century.

2. **Sabbateanism and Its Aftermath**: The messianic claims of Shabbatai Sevi and his subsequent conversion to Islam led to a crisis of faith among Jews, which had lasting effects on Jewish communities.

3. **Hasidism as a Response**: Hasidism emerged as a spiritual movement that emphasized joy and sanctification of the everyday, offering an alternative to the expectations of a messianic era.

4. **The Role of Israel in Human History**: Judaism holds the belief that the Jewish people have a unique and redemptive role in human history. This is evident in the way Jews are often seen as carrying the weight of the world's suffering, as described in Andres Schwartz Bath's "The Last of the Jaws."

5. **Modern Examples**: The messianic belief that a Jewish leader could be the Messiah continues to this day, exemplified by some within the Hasidic sect of Lubavitchers who believe their late leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, to be the Messiah.

6. **Literary Reflections**: The role of Israel in history is also reflected in literature, such as "The Last of the Jaws," which portrays Jews bearing the collective pain of humanity.

7. **Conclusion**: The lecture emphasizes that while messianic movements have sometimes led to schisms and crises within Judaism, they have also contributed to new spiritual expressions and a reinvigoration of Jewish life and thought.

The story from "The Last of the Jaws" serves as a powerful illustration of the special role Jews believe they play in the world, echoing the sentiment that without Israel, the world might not exist. It underscores the deep-rooted belief within Judaism that Israel has a unique and critical place in human history.

1. **Fall of Constantinople (1453)**: The Ottoman armies conquered the Byzantine capital, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. The Greek scholars who fled to the West brought with them valuable manuscripts and knowledge that had been preserved in the libraries of Constantinople.

2. **Influence on Renaissance Italy**: These scholars primarily settled in Italy, particularly Florence, where their arrival coincided with a cultural renaissance that was already inclined towards esoteric and philosophical studies. The knowledge they brought was embraced and became a significant influence on the intellectual climate of the time.

3. **Patronage of the Medici**: The Medici family, rulers of Florence, supported the translation and dissemination of these texts. They entrusted one of their educated court members, Marsilio Ficino, with the task of translating these texts from Greek to Latin.

4. **Translations and Priorities**: Among the works received by the Florentines were the "Corpus Hermeticum," attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, and the "Asclepius." These were deemed more significant than the works of Plato at the time because they were considered older and thus closer to the original truths.

5. **Four Influential Traditions**: The Renaissance intellectuals engaged with four major traditions:
   - **Astrology**: The belief in a connection between celestial bodies and human destiny.
   - **Alchemy**: An ancient chemical practice that evolved into a spiritual pursuit for understanding the essence of life, originating from Chaldean and Babylonian practices and transmitted through Arabic scholarship.
   - **Magic**: Encompassing both elite high magic and popular practices, including the use of amulets and talismans.
   - **Hermeticism**: A set of religious, philosophical, and spiritual texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, which were believed to be contemporary with Moses and thus held great influence for their perceived antiquity and wisdom.

In the next lecture, the focus will be on hermeticism and its profound impact on Renaissance thought, as well as a more detailed exploration of the other three traditions.

Checking Terror of History - Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition/15 - Hermeticism, Astrology, Alchemy, and Magic.txt
1. The connection between material and spiritual worlds in Renaissance thought is often represented by the concept of ether or the fifth essence, which acts as a bridge between the microcosm (individual) and the macrocosm (universe).

2. Music was believed to be a way to connect with this universal harmony, as both the microcosm and macrocosm were thought to share the same harmonic qualities. This belief dates back to Plato and Pythagoras, who held that music is fundamentally mathematical in nature.

3. Marsilio Ficino, a Renaissance philosopher, extended this idea by suggesting that the movements of the stars and planets produce a cosmic music, known as the music of the spheres. He proposed that aligning oneself with this celestial symphony could reveal the universe's meaning.

4. This concept had a profound impact on early modern European culture, influencing art, literature, and alchemy. It can be seen in works like Sandro Botticelli's "Primavera," which reflects Renaissance ideas about magic, hermeticism, and astrology.

5. The influence of these esoteric beliefs is evident across various aspects of Renaissance culture, including the works of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and John Donne, who alluded to the music of the spheres and the interconnectedness of the cosmos.

6. The Renaissance's fascination with these mystical and cosmological ideas laid the groundwork for the later scientific revolution, which sought to understand and explain the universe through empirical evidence, even as it was still deeply rooted in these earlier metaphysical concepts.

7. The lecture emphasizes that the Renaissance was not just about art and humanism but also deeply engaged with cosmological, alchemical, and hermetic ideas, which were integral to the intellectual and cultural fabric of the time.

Checking Terror of History - Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition/16 - The Origins of Witchcraft.txt
1. **Witchcraft Reality vs. Academic Dismissal**: Margaret Murray's hypothesis that witchcraft was a survival of agrarian cults from prehistoric times was initially dismissed by academia. However, her ideas were later reconsidered and supported by subsequent historians like Carlo Ginzburg.

2. **Carlo Ginzburg's Contributions**: Ginzburg's work, particularly in "The Night Battles" (Benandanti), identified a group of people in the Friuli region of Italy who called themselves "Good Walkers" or "Night Walkers." These individuals had beliefs and practices that could be traced back to an agrarian cult, suggesting that such traditions had persisted through centuries of Christianization.

3. **Criticism and Support**: Ginzburg's work was criticized by some scholars, including Norman Cohn, who argued that Ginzburg was reviving Murray's theories. However, many agree with Ginzburg's archaeological approach to understanding the beliefs and practices associated with witchcraft.

4. **The Role of the Church**: From the 13th century onwards, the Church began to increasingly define and preoccupy itself with witchcraft as part of its mission to Christiize all aspects of society. This led to a new focus on witches in the late 15th century, particularly as economic and social conditions in Europe changed.

5. **Economic and Social Changes**: The penetration of the Church into previously unchristianized areas, along with changing economic conditions, contributed to a redefinition of witchcraft. This culminated in the witch hunts that occurred throughout Europe during the 16th century, resulting in the deaths of approximately 100,000 people, mostly women.

In summary, the understanding of witchcraft as it was perceived by the Inquisition can be seen as a response to the survival of prehistoric agrarian cults, which were eventually integrated into or clashed with the emerging Christian culture in Europe during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. The academic reevaluation of Murray's ideas, influenced by Ginzburg's work, has led to a deeper understanding of how these beliefs manifested in the historical record.

Checking Terror of History - Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition/17 - Religion, Science, and Magic.txt
1. The witch craze in Europe, particularly in Central Germany, coincides with the period of intense religious strife between Protestants and Catholics, especially during the early 17th century. This period saw devastating wars that also targeted individuals accused of witchcraft as a form of venting anger and violence.

2. The Reformation, which began in 1517, led to a significant mental shift away from the Catholic Church's dominance, allowing for a proliferation of religious ideas. This religious upheaval contributed to the rise of witchcraft persecutions as societies sought to establish and enforce orthodoxy.

3. The rise of science during this period challenged traditional beliefs and contributed to the marginalization of those practices considered superstitious, including wishcraft or witchcraft.

4. The Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 solidified the notion that rulers had the authority to dictate the religious affiliations of their subjects, further enforcing orthodoxy and potentially targeting non-conformists as witches.

5. In contrast to Central Europe, areas like Spain and parts of Italy, where the Inquisition was already established, did not experience severe witch hunts because the Inquisition had other targets, such as conversos (Jews who converted to Christianity) and later Protestants and heretical thinkers.

6. The presence of the Inquisition in these areas meant that mechanisms for persecution were already in place, targeting different groups deemed heretical or non-conformist, thus satisfying the societal need for conformity and orthodoxy without resorting to witchcraft accusations.

In summary, the witch craze was closely tied to the religious upheavals of the Reformation, the rise of scientific thought, and the desire for political and religious uniformity within states. The intensity of these factors in different regions of Europe determined whether witch hunts occurred and the targets of such persecutions.

 The inquisition, particularly the Spanish Inquisition, was an instrument of both the church and the state to enforce unity and orthodoxy, with the crown having control rather than the papacy. This state-sanctioned persecution targeted dissenters, witches, Jews, Muslims, and others accused of heresy or consorting with the devil. The actual executions were carried out by the state to assert its monopoly on violence, while the church played a role in the legal process that led to these executions.

Public executions, such as burnings at the stake or hangings, were highly theatrical events designed not only to punish but also to serve as a spectacle of power and hierarchy for the community. These events were popular and often served as a form of entertainment, drawing large crowds who witnessed the confessional acts of the accused, seeking forgiveness before their death. The executions aimed to reintegrate the guilty into the community by means of repentance and forgiveness, providing a sense of closure and catharsis for the onlookers. The recent execution of a convicted criminal like Mac Bay, where there was no public confession or repentance, illustrates how modern justice systems have evolved to differ from these historical practices.

1. The devil's image in monastic contexts often emphasizes his presence and danger, as seen in numerous stories and accounts of monks and monasteries.

2. Dante Alighieri provides a unique and vivid depiction of the devil in the Inferno, describing him as an immense, monster-like figure with wings resembling a bat, emerging from a lake of eyes, neither alive nor dead. He is depicted as a giant, frozen by his own wing beats, with three faces: one red, and two others, one yellowish and the other dark like that of a Nubian (a person from the region of the Nile).

3. In late 15th and early 16th century Europe, the devil's image becomes associated with antisemitic stereotypes, leading to representations that combine the concept of the devil with the visual and cultural tropes of Jews.

4. During witch trials, the devil was often described as a he-goat or a monstrous figure with features mimicking the physical characteristics of Jews. This period's depictions of the devil were intertwined with latent and sometimes overt antisemitism.

5. The devil's character in these confessions and representations was one of extreme sexuality, animalistic features, and a cold, neuter presence, leading armies of witches against Christianity.

6. In contrast to the monstrous depictions of the devil during this period, later literary works like Goethe's "Faust" and Milton's "Paradise Lost" would offer more nuanced and even sympathetic portrayals of the devil as a complex character with beauty, intellect, and free will, challenging the earlier demonizations.

 The Malleus Maleficarum, written by Henricus Institoris and Jacobus Sprenger in 1486, was a pivotal text that influenced the widespread persecution of witches in Europe during the late Middle Ages. The book emerged from a commission to investigate and report on alleged witchcraft and its origins, effects, and appropriate legal responses.

The Malleus is structured into three parts:

1. **Introduction to Witchcraft**: It establishes the existence of witchcraft as a reality sanctioned by divine will, with the devil, witches, and God's permission as the necessary components of this evil practice.

2. **Witchcraft's Methods**: This section details how witches allegedly perform their acts, which are predominantly carried out by women, and includes explanations of various supernatural powers attributed to witches, such as transforming men into animals or rendering them impotent.

3. **Legal Procedures Against Witches**: The final part outlines the methods for identifying witches, conducting trials, and administering justice, both within the church and secular courts.

The Malleus Maleficarum's influence was significant in shaping the beliefs and actions of both Catholics and Protestants in the persecution of alleged witches. It reinforced deep-seated fears and misogyny by portraying women as the primary agents of witchcraft, capable of engaging in nefarious pacts with the devil and causing harm through supernatural means. These beliefs led to widespread accusations, trials, and executions—mostly of women—throughout Europe, often resulting in brutal punishments such as burning at the stake. The Malleus thus played a crucial role in the construction of gender roles and the legal treatment of alleged witches during this period.

 In this segment, we explore the complex and often maligned practice of witchcraft in historical context, particularly during the Renaissance and early modern period. The discussion touches upon various elements associated with witches, including their familiars—spirits that take the form of animals like cats and then transform into human figures to provide sexual gratification to the witch. These familiar spirits are either incubi or succubi, depending on the gender of the witch.

The segment emphasizes the similarity between these accusations against witches and early Christian charges against pagans and heretics, which often involved prurient behavior, murder, and cannibalism. These same charges were later used against Jews, lepers, Muslims, and Native Americans in the New World, highlighting a pattern of othering through extreme and fabricated accusations.

The discussion also references the importance of dance in religious observation and as a means to connect with the divine or the occult. The use of phallic symbols and the act of sacrificing animals were common in these rituals and were frequently condemned by the church.

Furthermore, the segment points out that the roots of these accusations against witches go back to ancient practices of child sacrifice, which were later replaced by other forms of atonement or offerings in religious traditions like Judaism and Christianity. The historical context reveals that these accusations were not merely about religion or morality but were deeply entrenched in the human experience and the need to define and marginalize 'the other.'

In essence, the segment provides a critical examination of how witchcraft was demonized and framed as an abomination within Western society, and how such characterizations have been used throughout history to justify persecution and exclusion of various groups based on false premises and xenophobic beliefs.

 The case of Urbain Grandier and the possessed nuns of Loudun is one of the most famous cases of witchcraft and demonic possession in history. In 1634, Grandier, a Catholic priest, was accused by his rival Abbé Barre of using black magic to seduce and influence the nuns at a local convent. The ensuing investigation led to Grandier's arrest, trial, and ultimately his brutal execution by being burned at the stake in front of thousands of spectators.

Following Grandier's death, the alleged possessions at the convent continued. The prioress, Mother Jeanne de Angéliis de Sainte-Catherine, was believed to be possessed by seven devils. A Jesuit exorcist, Father Jean-Joseph Surin, was called in to perform exorcisms, which became a public spectacle. These exorcisms lasted for several years and were highly charged with sexuality and power dynamics.

During the exorcisms, the devils were said to be transferred from the nuns to the exorcist himself, causing him great physical pain. Eventually, after seven years, the prioress was healed, with the appearance of holy names on her body, marking the end of the possessions.

Mother Jeanne then went on a pilgrimage across France, becoming a celebrated mystic and a spiritual bridge between the spiritual and material worlds. Her story gained widespread attention and was documented by historians, influencing both religious beliefs and enlightened thought. The case has been the subject of various books, a novel, an opera, a play, and a movie, with different interpretations and depictions of the events. Ken Russell's film "The Devils" is particularly notable for its dramatic and sensational portrayal of the affair, capturing the era's blend of religion, politics, and sexuality.

1. The events surrounding the Salem witch trials have been politically corrected by the city fathers, who have created a museum that glorifies the victims and presents witchcraft as a benign pre-Christian tradition unrelated to the hysteria of the 17th century.

2. In contemporary society, some individuals claim to practice "wicca," a modern interpretation of what they believe to be an ancient tradition of witchcraft. However, historian E.P. Thompson's concept of "invented traditions" suggests that this idea of continuous witchcraft practices is more of a myth created to connect with the past.

3. There is a widespread belief among Europeans that witches existed and were part of a vast international conspiracy against God and the state, which reflects the deep-rooted fear of the devil inherent in Christian doctrine.

4. The lecturer emphasizes that while people do believe they are witches and that witches exist, the historical accounts of witchcraft, including nocturnal gatherings, pacts with the devil, and flying on animals, are unlikely to be true. These accounts were products of a mass delusion or hysteria during certain periods in European history.

5. The lecturer uses Goya's etching "The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters" as a metaphor for how reason can lead to irrational fears and beliefs, as seen in the phenomenon of witchcraft hysteria.

6. The terror of history often leads individuals to seek supernatural explanations for events and phenomena that rationality cannot explain, which can result in scapegoating and the persecution of those labeled as witches.

7. The lecture underscores the importance of understanding these historical periods as cycles of reason and irrationality, and how society oscillates between embracing rationality and seeking comfort in superstition or invented traditions.

1. The lecturer discusses the concept of sacred places and their significance in various cultures, from ancient Mayan ball courts with maize mazes to medieval European cathedrals. These places often hold unique power and are still revered today.

2. Examples of such sacred sites include Chichen Itza, the Pantheon in Rome, Stonehenge, and the Cathedral of Schacht. Each site reflects the cultural and spiritual values of its civilization.

3. The lecturer highlights how the Catholics of the Middle Ages revered natural elements like trees, fountains, and mountains, and how these elements were incorporated into their architecture, such as in the Cathedral of Schacht, where a maze on the floor represents a pilgrimage to the center of the world.

4. The lecturer reflects on the terror of history, particularly the 20th century, which saw great technological advancements alongside devastating events like genocides and wars. This contrast underscores the human need to create order and meaning from chaotic and often inexplicable events.

5. History is a tool used by elites to shape narratives and impose their will, but it also serves as a means for societies to cope with the uncertainties of life and the potential dangers of human actions.

6. The lecturer concludes by emphasizing that understanding these sacred places and the reasons behind them can provide insight into how humans have historically dealt with the fear and uncertainty of history.
