Lecture 16 The Origins of Witchcraft
Welcome to Lecture 16. In Lecture 15, the previous lecture, we look in some detail at
astrology, alchemy, magic, and in greater detail, to hermeticism. All those, shall we
say, movements or beliefs or forms of knowledge, because we had to think of them as forms of
knowledge, were really part of elite culture, part of a high culture discourse, which was
shared by only a few people who had, in fact, relationships with those in power.
Witchcraft, which we begin to discuss today, and which will occupy us for the last nine
concluding lectures, is a very different kind of phenomena. Witchcraft is a very different
kind of phenomenon. Witchcraft is essentially a combination of both learned discourse and popular
one. And the way in which witchcraft, as understood, explained, articulated by those in
power, and as suffered, in a sense, experienced by those below, is one of the topics of this
entire sections of lectures. That is to say, the way in which culture flows from top down,
the way in which the beliefs or ideas are articulated by those on top are imposed, or
those at the bottom. I also want, before I even begin this lecture, to make a distinction
here between witchcraft and the witch-craze. The lectures are really about the witch-craze.
And though I will go back and explain in luxury of detail what the witch-craze is, or was,
I want to begin by a kind of very brief reference to it, so that we keep this in a context. What
is a witch-craze? In Europe, in the Europe of the Renaissance, in the Europe of the
Scientific Revolution, between, let's say, the late 15th century, 1480s, and 1660s, in
that period of time, most Europeans, whether they are part of that Lenin elite, or whether
they are members of the lower classes, most Europeans believed that there were people
in the mist, mostly women, mostly all women, who consulted with the devil. And because
they believed this, or because they were forced to believe this, they went out and persecuted
these people, and in between the 1480s and the 1660s, between 80 and 100,000 people, most
of them, elderly women, were executed, either by fire, by burning at the stake, or by hanging
from the necks, in England, where execution by fire was not allowed. This is an extraordinary
phenomenon, and it is, in many respects, the underbelly, the counterpart of the other Europe,
the Europe of great monuments, the Europe of the culture, of the baroque, the Europe
of the rational state, the Europe of the Scientific Revolution. How did this happen? How did this
come about? What prompted these kinds of beliefs? They did not exist in the Middle Ages. No
one believed this in the Middle Ages, and they burst a merge out of the blue. In succeeding
lectures, I am going to provide both a context and an attempt at an explanation for this
phenomenon. But in this lecture, what I want to do is examine wishcraft, as opposed to
the witch craze within the European tradition. And I want to begin by, in a sense, burrowing
a definition from one of the most learned men of the 16th century, a lawyer, a philosopher,
a historian, a man named Jean Baudin. And he writes a very clear and central definition
from a sorcerer, or a witch, is one who, by commerce with the devil, has a full intention
of attaining his own ends, or her own ends. That is to say, that the very essence of wishcraft
is consorting with the devil, is, in a sense, creating ties with the devil in order to obtain
certain specific ends.
One of the things, of course, is that in Europe, from the late 15th century onwards, scholars,
kings sought to define the nature of wishcraft. The number of treatises written on this topic
are innumerable. People who explained, all of them following the lead of a great book
entitled, a great book only in its influence, in its nefarious influence, entitled The Malius
Maleficarum, which I will examine in detail in a later lecture. But from then onwards,
from the late 15th century onwards, Europeans, the learned elite, sought to define what wishcraft
was. People like James, the first king of England, they spent a great deal of his energies
writing treatises on whether witches, or whether the devil could essentially propagate or not,
whether Incubus and Sukub, or Incubus, could essentially have issue or not. And where did
they get the semen and so on? Extraordinary bizarre things which occupy the mind of Europe.
Probably more books we have written about wishcraft in this 150 years than they were
written about astronomy or science. The point, of course, is that by the 16th century, wishcraft
has now acquired a characteristic, a personality in Europe. And it is this definition of wishcraft
which comes to predominate in the 16th century, that lies and on the pins, lies on the need
and on the pins, the whole persecution of witches, the whole creation of a witch craze,
the construction of attacks against witches. This is remarkable because in an earlier period,
the Catholic Church has dismissed these charges and these ideas as preposterous. This is not
to say that some people were not accused of wishcraft or necromancy, which is essentially
the way which was described in an earlier period. That is to say, these cases occurred
from time to time and some people in the 13th and 14th century are in fact burned accused
of necromancy or wishcraft or consulting with the devil and that there are examples of this
and references of this in the learned literature of an earlier period still. But the Church
as a whole did not accept the idea that there was a vast conspiracy, that the kind of things
that we find in the 16th and 17th century were unacceptable and that the idea that witches
did have this power to consult with the devil and that they were organized in the ways in
which people thought they were organized in the later period were dismissed as sheer nonsense,
nothing that really they have nothing to do with the truth because of course the question
at hand here is the power of God and God in his incredible mercy will never allow the
devil to hold this power. So again the question which I hope to answer in the next two or
three lectures is why in the late 15th century and in the 16th century this idea of the earlier
church of earlier Europeans is overthrown and replaced by something else, what kind of social
and economic and intellectual elements or factors indeed influence the way in which people thought
of witches and of wishcraft. By in a sense drawing the boundaries of wishcraft so clearly by defining
what it was by identifying witches what you create is a discourse of wishcraft in the 16th
and 17th century which is going to lead inexorably to the massacre probably their first important
attempt of genocide. Let me remind you for example that the Spanish Inquisition which is usually
categorized as one of the greatest and most heinous crimes of humanity probably did not
kill more than 5,000 people between 1480 and the early part of the 19th century in Spain
whereas when we look at the witch craze and the trials of witches carry out throughout most of
Europe although not in all of Europe we're really talking about massive numbers for the early
modern period when you do not have the technology which we have today in the 20th century to perpetrate
huge mass killings. I think what we want to do here is to in a sense go back to the very beginnings
of wishcraft in the Western tradition and to compare and to place it within a kind of worldwide
sense of wishcraft. Historians have argued that witches are found in all cultures that you can find
witches in pre-Colombia Mexico or that you can find witches in ancient China or medieval China
that there are references to witches in the Bible. Saul goes to visit the witch of Endor in the cave
of the witch and to obtain something from the witch that it is something that it is universal. I
think I will be a bit reluctant to apply this universality as to the belief in wishcraft or as
to the presence of witches in other cultures. It is very clear that concepts of evil and good are
culturally specific and I will talk about that when I discuss the notion of the devil and Satan
later on and they afford when we identify or define something as witchcraft in another culture
what we are probably doing is essentially imposing our own concept of culture in other cultures that
is to say we are judging phenomena that we see in other cultures and essentially defining it in
our own terms. What I'm trying to say here very briefly and I follow Clifford Goetz on this is
that it's not always proper or correct to in a sense attribute the behavior of other cultures
and then know them or define them as witchcraft because as witchcraft is defined in the western
tradition it's all about the relationship between the witch that is to say male or female with the
devil and the concept of evil is very different in other cultures. So we could call witchcraft certain
things that we find in the new world or in Africa or in Asia but the people themselves in these
cultures may not in fact define them as witchcraft so we have to be careful about claims to the
universality of witchcraft even though we know that witchcraft is to this very day practice or at
least what we call witchcraft ourselves westerners called witchcraft is practice in many parts of
the world. What are the origins of witchcraft magic and so on? I think that historically we can say
and there is a great deal of work that has been done on the history of religions in the last few
years historically we can say that the first religions of mankind the very early religions
the first that we can somewhat testify to were vegetation religions were fertility cults in fact
many of the forms of vegetation religions and fertility cults remain alive in european culture
and i will go back to that in a few minutes so that essentially the first religions of mankind
were not religion at all and that there is an important boundary between what we might call
magical concept of the world and the religious concept of the world religion and magic are always
intertwined they are in a sense intertwined to this very day but there is however a great deal of
difference in the way in which you conceive magic or what we might call witchcraft and you conceive
religion magic is a way in which early men and women i don't want to use the term primitive man
because it is unjust in which men in earlier civilizations in the very early prehistorical
civilizations tries to contend and dominate the world how do you in a sense control nature
the terror of history about which i talk on the first lecture in which we met
that terror of history about which i will discuss at the very end of the series of
lectures is also was present for prehistorical man the man before the birth of religion before
the birth of history that is to say how do you deal with nature how can you be assured that the
sun which in fact provides heat and makes your plans grow will come out tomorrow there is a serious
of things in nature that have to be placated control and therefore you engage in a series of
ceremonies and incantations and so on which give you a sense of power over nature is the realization
that these things do not work that lead to religion which is of course the acceptance of the fact
that you cannot control the world that you have to surrender to the terror of history and that you
have to depend essentially on a deity or in a collection of deities depending on which in a
sense which society you live in this is a very important transition because there will be historians
who will trace the beginning of witchcraft in europe in the western tradition to many of these
practices which remain alive especially among rural populations so that the awareness of the world
has been impossible to control the awareness that we really have no power over nature that
the sun will come up every morning or will not come up but that there's nothing we can do to
control that it's also the realization that then we entered into a very different relationship
with the sacred with the world in the sacred so religion grows out of that and i want to point
out that to this very day and i want to point out this i want to repeat this and reiterate this
through all the lectures that follow that religion to to this very day that people to this very day
who might even be not religious very rational is still engaged in many respects in acts of magic
or acts which we might call almost acts of witchcraft it could be something very simple
it could be something as simple as how you get out of bed every morning or what hangs around
your neck or what things you touch at your door when you leave your home or the kind of practices
and incantation or your favorite shirt that you wear for specific dates or for job interviews or the
pen with with with which you always got good grades in your exams that we attribute to the physical
world some elements of magic which essentially gives us control over the world and that even
in the most lofty religions today there are elements which harken back to the very beginnings
of history and which can only be described as it were as attempts to control the world
to control nature around us i can go on describing these things because they are indeed a very
important parcel the things we hold in our hands because we think they bring us luck the kinds
of practices which are really bring us very close to that prehistoric man yearning desperately to
escape from the terrors around him this notion that witchcraft is really the result of having
consort with the devil and so on is grounded on the very popular belief a belief widespread throughout
the world and certainly pressing in our western culture that magic is real that you can gain
some powers by certain formulas that if one doesn't is because one has not repeated a formula
correctly that there is also in the world a dichotomy between good and evil at least in our
culture in western culture and i will talk about that in greater detail in a lecture later on
but that there is a duality to the world that that duality begins with our own awareness of the
universe sun and moon julio caro bar oja a great anthropologist in a great book entitled the world
of the witches the first part of which is essentially a kind of anthropological examination
of the roots of witchcraft of the roots of the world of witches this dichotomy between date and night
between sun and moon which creates in our culture in western culture the kind of dualistic
opposites the opposites good on the one side identified in our culture with light
evil identified in our culture with darkness the fears of the night which is still in many respects
have a grip on us and which of course had a tremendous grip on ancient man on prehistoric man
the fear when the sun dies when the sun sets and darkness is all around you and there is no way
to light the darkness as we do today which is reflected to this very day in the uncomfortable
sense of many people of being in the dark of walking in the dark of fearing darkness because
the darkness is identified with evil things with things that will essentially will destroy you
i always remember as a child that walking home in the middle of the dark everybody begins to
sing or whistle because it was a way in which you try to protect yourself from all the things
around you that you did not see so that this sharp dichotomy this sharp division between good and evil
is and i will add this again and again because i will go back to this in the later lecture
it's a very western phenomenon not present in other cultures but one which is deeply embedded
in the way in which we conceive of things so how do historians look at witchcraft and specifically
how historians look at the witch craze i cannot tell you the amount of books that have been written
on this topic it is a topic that has a specific and unique attraction for historians in the last
50 years and there are all kinds of opinions about this and they range and there is no
unanimity on this on what witchcraft is or what prompted or what led to the witch craze
some historians argue that the whole witch craze or the whole witchcraft is utter nonsense that
it was in many respects constructed by those in power and i will talk about that as a way
essentially of either creating escape for people escaping from history by persecuting others
a kind of escape goating that serve very specific political purposes and that it was
nonsense and that we cannot trust at all the evidence the historical evidence we have especially
for the 16 and 17th century because this is evidence that is obtained through coercion
and that it is an evidence that is planted in the mind of these poor people who are brought to trial
by the inquisitors or by those questioning them who in essentially lead the accused
eventually to the admission of charges which are utterly preposterous and which have no foundation
whatsoever so that this is a very important fact and we must realize that in discussing
witchcraft in the next eight lectures we are really drawing from sources which are always
with no exception hostile to witchcraft and to the witches that we do not hear ever hear
the voice of the witch we hear it only mediated by the questioner we have no document that tells us
what they really thought the people who are accused the people who are burned the people who
are hanged from the necks that we have only essentially the information and the sources
that are given to us by those in power and therefore this historiographical approach
which looks at the victims and which look at the victim and which look at witchcraft from the bottom
up that is to say the people who have been victimized by this kind of discourse of witchcraft
is the kind of historiographical tendencies that dominated the history of witchcraft with the
exception of some rather should we say preposterous writing that takes the whole thing seriously
and believes that yes there was essentially witchcraft it's a kind of historiographical tendency
that dominated the field until very recently however there is another point of view a historian
a margaret murray wrote a book in the early 1920s this is also related to the great work
which i will go back at the end of the of this course the great work by james fraser the golden
bow which examines folklore and peasant and folklore believes in europe and throughout the world
margaret murray argues that the witchcraft was a reality that the inquisitors were answering
essentially we are responding to a reality and that this reality was the survival in europe
of agrarian cults that is to say that many of the very primitive forms of relations that existed
in europe in prehistoric times had survived and that they manifested themselves in the 16th
century and i will discuss this later on in much greater detail and that this is what inquisitors
found that these practices were in fact taking place in europe and that they were people who were
practicing these kinds of uh which says ceremonies and beliefs and so on and until they are ferret out
by the inquisitors i don't have to tell you that margaret murray was in fact laughed out of academia
had ideas where dismissed altogether as being preposterous and in fact no one took them very
seriously until around 30 years ago or so went a great italian historian perhaps one of the most
the foremost historians in the last 50 years a man named carlo ginsburg wrote a book entitled
iben andante which had been translated into english as the night battles uh he went on to
write many other important books dealing more or less with the same theme of what carlo ginsburg
argued in the ben andante and i will revisit this book in a later lecture in greater detail
was that in fact in the area of the friuli you could identify a group of people who called
themselves the good walkers the night walkers who in fact had a system of beliefs which harken back
to an agrarian cult that you have preserved in europe through 1500 years of christianity
and years of pagan religions this cult had remained alive in a part of italy a kind of
isolated part of italy called the friuli in the beneto and that in fact what inquisitors
identified of which craft was essentially a practice that when harken back had nothing to do
with the devil or anything like that they have been criticisms of this uh noman kohn who wrote
the pursuit of the millenium one of the greatest scholars of millenarian history accused ginsburg
of resurrecting margaret murray's ideas and in fact this missing them not the story which carlo
tells carlo ginsburg tells in such wonderful detail but the idea that there was an agrarian
cult that have to buy i myself uh i agree with carlo ginsburg on this matter and i think i agree
also with the kind of archaeological work that he does i mean i'm not archaeology in the sense of
looking for ruins but that he carries out an archaeology of beliefs in which he traces back
many of these practices to other parts of europe to other part in asia and so on and he connects
all system of very kind of esoteric beliefs that culminate in this kind of beliefs
so in a sense what you have here is another interpretation and we will revisit this and
so on the point of course is that from the 13th century on we see a slow shift in the way in
which christianity begins to define wishcraft from tomas aquinas onwards we have a greater and
greater preoccupation as i will argue later on this greater preoccupation was a response to
changing economic and social and political conditions but what you have here is by the 13th
century by the 14th century you have a greater preoccupation with which craft and an attempt
within christianity itself within a learned elite to begin to define what which craft was
who was a which and how do we deal with witches this of course laid laid led in the late 15th
century to a complete new definition and preoccupation with witches beginning in the middle of the
15th century onward a series of economic and social factors changing conditions in the european
countryside the penetration of the church into areas which have not been fully christianized
until then let those tribunes of the new culture of the plains and i will talk about this dominicans
and franciscans the mendicant orders to come into contact with worlds that have not yet been
fully brought into christianity and the result of that emerging out of this calderon of new
definitions new social and economic conditions was essentially their wish grace and because
europe defined itself anew at the end of the 15th century close to 100 000 people as i said to you
mostly women pay with their lives thank you
