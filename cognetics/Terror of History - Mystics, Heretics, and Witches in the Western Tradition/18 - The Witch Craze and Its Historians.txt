Lecture 18 The Witch-Craze and Its Historians
Welcome to lecture 18.
In lecture 17 I began to, in a sense, create a context for the witch-craze by examining
religious and cultural developments.
And what I would like to do here is to look at the social and economic developments and
end the lecture with a discussion of torture and punishment and control in early modern
Europe and to, in a sense, tie this or relay this to the manner in which witches were executed,
the kind of theatricality of power that is displayed in witch trials.
I want to, in a sense, reiterate what I already said in lectures 2 and 3, which is, of course,
that I firmly believe that all this cultural phenomena has to be embedded within a kind
of social and economic and political and cultural and religious context.
That is to say that we cannot understand this phenomena unless we understand the kind of
context in which it happens, that therefore they are deeply imbricated into the kind of
social and economic changes that took place at the end of the Middle Ages.
In lectures 2 and 3 I provided a kind of overall, very broad context for the entire course running
from 1000 to 1600.
And what I want to do here is precisely to speak about the social and economic developments
at the end of the Middle Ages and throughout the 16th century.
And we begin where we always begin.
We begin, of course, with the rural world, with the peasants.
And that is so because by the 1500s the peasants represented a still close to 80% of the entire
population of Western Europe.
That is to say it is still, in spite of modernity, a deeply rural world.
And witchcraft is essentially a rural activity.
We forget sometimes that a great deal of the accusations of witchcraft have to do with
rural events such as the spoiling of milk, the curling of butter, the falling down of
a pile of logs or things like that, kind of inconsequential phenomena which cannot be
explained rationally and which is essentially attributed to witchcraft.
So in a sense it is with the rural world that we begin.
What is taking place in Europe in the late 15th and early 16th century?
One of the things that we know is that, and I have said this so many times that you must
be sick of it, that the rural community begins to break down at the end of the 15th century.
We saw it already in the demands of the German peasants asking for access to the commons.
That is to say that in the Middle Ages the rural community, the village had some kind
of, should we say, democratic equality.
Now I do not really believe that this was the case.
But there is at least some kind of rough equality in the village.
If you are a citizen of the village, which has a very specific meaning, that is to say
if you own property in the village, therefore you have access to the commons, and even if
you are holdings are very small, nonetheless you have a way of surviving.
By the late 15th century, a kind of changes that occurred, the rise of a class society
in Europe led to, in many respects, great social and economic differences within the
village community, which meant essentially that many peasants lost their lands, and this
lands are now in the hands of a few people in the village who control the village.
The rich people in the village who have now essentially even began the processes of privatizing
the commons.
The best and most clear sign of this is of course enclosure.
That is to say the fencing of commons, the fencing of lands, the marking of boundaries,
in the same manner in which we saw in the previous lecture how mental and cultural boundaries
have mapped out in this period, in the same manner it happens in the land.
The land is now encircled by fences.
It's closed down.
What you have as a result of this is of course, it's incredible social dislocation.
When we look at Essex Chire in England in the 17th century, we are going to see that essentially
this is one of the reasons for which accusations in Essex in the 17th century.
Essentially what we have here is an economic and social displacement, together with an
increasing population.
By some strange circumstances, the population of Europe which had been fairly stagnant until
the end of the 15th century begins to grow very rapidly.
This is due to the introduction of new crops, certain new methods of cultivation, certain
technological advances and so on.
The fact is of course that the new population leads to a dramatic increase in the number
of the poor.
If you read Thomas Muir Utopia, a great book which begins with a kind of, should we say,
analysis of the situation, the economic and social situation of England at the beginning
of the 16th century, you see that you see the masses of the poor going from town to
town begging and how they are essentially a spell from certain communities which do
not allow begging within the boundaries, how poor houses come into being and the mistreatment
of the poor.
I will say here and I will reiterate it later on that there is a connection between or there
is a very clear connection between economic standing or economic status, social status
and being accused of being a witch.
That is to say though we have some cases in which the people accused of witchcraft are
people in the open levels of society, nonetheless the majority of the people who are accused
of witchcraft are people who are in a very specific social niche.
That by the way is also the case in Iberia among those who are accused of being Judaizers.
That is to say that they belong to a very specific social class.
That is the class caught between the extreme poor and those on top of them and people who
feel squeezed by the economic and social changes.
It's not only that poverty has changed dramatically in terms of numbers, that is to say that they
are far more poor people in early modern Europe than there was in the Middle Ages, but that
the very face of poverty changes as well and the very attitudes towards poverty also change.
What happens in the late Middle Ages and in the early modern period is that poverty becomes
devalued.
That is to say the kind of Christians attributes of poverty are now shone as high.
This coincides of course with new ways of thinking about the economy, with the birth
of capitalism and with the secularization of the world.
Now in the Middle Ages this is also happening, but it's not happening to the extent that
it happens in the late 15th and early 16th century.
What we have here is that the poor begins to be seen no longer as in fact the child
of God, no longer as one who will get the kingdom of heaven, but someone who is essentially
outside the boundaries of society, who is marginalized and there is a great debate that
goes on in Europe in the 16th century about how you ought to treat the poor and the majority
of opinion is that the poor has to be confined or forced to work or indeed seen as malevolent
and evil.
There is something in his or her character that leads to begging and in fact begging becomes
an activity which now begins to be monitored.
You have to get a license to beg unless the king gives you a license to beg, you cannot
beg.
Begging becomes in fact one of the things that is closely associated with witchcraft
and it's very simple.
The kind of all formulaic ways in which people beg are becoming under attack.
Even to this very day in third world or so-called third world countries on less developed worlds
there is still an element of charity and poverty which remains.
If you come to the door of someone who is well to do with your little can asking for
food you will knock at the door and you will say a piece of bread for the love of God.
It's a formulaic phrase which was used throughout Europe in the Middle Ages and in the early
modern period.
Now in traditional societies or in the Middle Ages you will get perhaps a bit of food, a
piece of bread, a coin, arms and so on.
In the late Middle Ages and the early modern period it is not uncommon for the person
to reject you and since the beggar might be an old person meaning a woman who doesn't
have the way with all to live by herself and who is forced to beg there would be a kind
of relationship, a cursing that occurred.
You tell the beggar get out of here, get out of my door, you all hack, she will turn back
and say to you curse you then something happens to you that evening, you go to bed, you try
to make love to your wife, it cannot happen, who to blame?
Clearly that old beggar was a witch.
So in a sense what we have here is a social condition that leads to poverty, that leads
to begging, that leads to in a climate which has changed, in the attitude towards charity
and poverty which leads to conflict between those who have and those who have not and
to grow in distance between those who have and those who have not.
There is also as a result of the wars that we discussed in the previous lecture, as a
discuss of all the social changes, there is an imbalance between women and men in early
modern Europe, that is to say there are far more women than there are men and many of
these women are old, they are widows or they are women who lived on the edge of town and
who have very little income, poverty and age are also contributors to accusations of
witchcraft and therefore they live on the edge of town, they are people who have certain
knowledge and certain lore, they engage in practices of some kind of herbal medicine,
they are healers, they know about certain things not only because of their age but because
it's an activity usually and traditionally associated with women. Now one of the social
changes that occurred in this period is of course the rise of the medical profession and
doctors do not like the competition that is provided by these old women who are healers
or midwives, it is again not a coincidence that a good number of the women who are brought
on charges of witchcraft are midwives and that they are accused because of what they
do which is to deliver babies, half of which in fact die within a very short time because
that's the rate of mortality in early medieval and early modern Europe who are accused of
having in fact killed the babies for their own diabolical practices so that there is
in some respects also another social link between the rise of professional societies
and professional groups such as doctors who become essentially an identifiable social entity
in the 16th and 17th century and they attack against certain types of individuals who have
engaged in practices which are no longer acceptable by those in power. So in a sense what we have
here is greater controls on how you practice certain things, a distrust of the poor, distrust
of all people and so on. All of this takes place also in the midst of an extraordinary
change which is of course a great shift in the mentality of Europe which is in fact signal
by the rise of such institutions of control as the poor house, the prison, the mental asylum.
This is of course the great work of Michel Foucault and many many of his books. He discussed
the process by which Europe in the early modern period begins a processes of monitoring itself
but it is also begins a processes of controlling society. This is of course most evident in
attitude towards madness. Before you are a mad person, you are certainly someone who
is close to God, you are in fact allowed to circulate in society unless you are dangerous,
you could engage in all your eccentricities by the end of the early modern period, by
the end of the witch craze, the mad person will be placed in a confinement, will be in
a mental institution, in an asylum and he will become or she will become an object,
an spectacle, the great to do, the classes, the middle classes, the open elite will come
to places like the sanatorium at Bethlehem, Bethlehem, Bethlehem to examine and to see
and to be entertained by the antics of the mad, which is who is now confined to a very
specific institution. The prison system, of course there are dungeons and prisons in
the middle ages but the idea of the prison as a kind of, so we said a lynch pin of the
rising estate as a place where you confine those who are not to be allowed outside the
society is also part of that, together with that of course with these new forms of ordering
society, of monitoring society comes confession and there is a dramatic change that occurs
which is also of course the result of the reformation and the counter reformation, how
you confess, before in the middle ages you will go to the priest and you will confess,
you will confess your sin, I have sin, I have had evil thoughts. In the 16th and 17th century
when we have many manuals of confessions that instruct the priest essentially how to ask
questions about what you have done evil, what we have here is essentially a numerical enunciation
of sin, that is to say you are not going to tell me that you had evil thoughts or that
you did evil deeds but you now have to enumerate how many of them and any of us who is old
enough and grew up in a Catholic country remembers all confessions before Vatican Council the
second that the priest will always ask aha and how many times because essentially what
we are entering here is, and this is also of course related to the scientific revolution
that I discussed in the previous lecture, what we have here is that monitoring devices
in which you begin to create categories of sin, categories of behavior and so on, so
essentially what we have here is a world that is changed dramatically and a world in which
people who behave in certain specific forms no longer have a place and of course together
with that is the rise of capitalism, the discovery of the new world, think about what capitalism
mean and capitalism is born, that is to say the wish-craze is going on, is another manifestation
of the culture of the baroque but it is also a concomitant process which emerges out of
the development of new ways of conceiving the relationship between man and money. There
was always something to we say dangerous about accumulation of wealth, it is always felt
in the Middle Asia where there are people who are exceedingly greedy and who also accumulate
immense amounts of wealth but there was always the feeling, the very wealth sort of founded
feeling that accumulation of wealth, that the giving yourself to the pursuit of mammon
was in fact something that will lead you to hell, that a first, a camel will go first
with the eye of a needle, as I have said before in the lecture on San Francis, then a rich
man will enter the kingdom of heaven. And what we are talking about in the 16th century
and in the 17th century is the secularization of economics in the same manner in which art
have been secularized in the Renaissance, in the same manner in which politics have been
secularized by Machiavelli, in that same manner capital, money making, the way in which you
perceive your relation to the material world is transformed by the early emergence of capitalism
in the 16th century and by its consolidation in the 17th century, because how much money
should someone make as much as possible? Essentially what we are really talking about here is not
the art of making money and large scale trades and the discovery of a new world and a kind
of world wide circulations of goods, we are talking about the commodification of life,
the way in which commodities become exceedingly important, we are talking about social relationships,
personal relationships between owner and worker, between those who work for you and so on,
the old medieval world will still linger on and hang on in trade association and craft
associations and guilds and so on, but it is now very much under attack by this dramatic,
in fact, economic transformation, so in a sense capitalism is another one of those
factors that adds a great deal of anxiety because you are placing the world especially
for the great mass of peasants who want deeply not to change because the peasants are exceedingly
conservative and fear the great economic and social transformations, they want to retain
the old good ways when they broke the back working but they were not threatened essentially
by this dynamic changes that are taking place in European society and then of course think
of the anxieties of the new world, think that you are a peasant, now let me give you a very
good example of this, think that you are a peasant in a village along the road that leads
from Seville to Barcelona and there you are and you have been all your life in this village
and you have never seen anything of the world and you have been told by your priests on
teen times about the unity of the universe and the universality of Christianity and suddenly
in 1493 there is this crazy Italian called Christopher Columbus walking along this road
or marching along this road with 12 natives from the new world adorned by very sort of
flashy plumes, who are these people, where do they come from, what is this new world
where we are not told for years and years and years that there was essentially one universe
that Christianity has spread, hey these people have never heard of Christ, these people have
never heard of us, who are these people, the new world produced a tremendous shock on the
European imagination because it forced the Europeans to rethink the way the world was,
so in a sense imagine the world very differently, all the old authorities, all Pliny and John
of Mandeville, all those travel literature has to be discarded because there you have
a world that is so different altogether from the US in which the people are organized in
ways that are so different from the US that it forces the Europeans for the next 150 years
to rethink that, to rethink their own world and that of course filters down in the images
and that the poor sees that the peasants hear of about this distant and strange new world
where all kinds of bizarre things could take place, where all kinds of buildings that are
very different from any European building are, so in a sense the discovery of the new
world capitalism also adds to the general anxiety which we are discussing in detail in the next
lecture, the question of fear, the fear of the unknown, the fear of the new, the shock of the
new and then of course finally the rise, the final consolidation of the modern nation state,
I want to repeat what I have said many times before, the barbarian phrase that is to say
that idea that this new state, the new nation has a legalized monopoly of violence, what we
are talking about here is the way in which the rise of the rational state, the rise of the secular
state, the one in which sovereignty is well defined in which is a political activity separate
from religion, the state benefits from religion, religion consolidates the power of the state
but make no mistake about this, religion as Philip II have said is too important to
leave it to the Pope, religion serves here from the 16th century onwards a political purpose,
it is put in fact at the service of the state and it is deployed for greater means of control,
it is deployed as a way in a sense to exert authority over all those people who live within
your boundaries, who live within a very specific geographical location, who are part of a new
community that is now acquired its own identity, an identity which is different altogether from
the identity of those who live across the border, even two steps across they are different,
we are French, they are English, we are French, they are Germans, we are French, they are Spaniards,
that is to say a world in which each community has its own identity, the rise of the nation state
let as we shall see in the next lecture to new methods, to new manners of enforcing order,
to ascending armies, to new concepts of power, to new ways of representing royalty,
to new manners in which power is exercised, to new explanations, the peasants, the middling
sorts, the people at the bottom who have barely felt the presence of the state in the 14th and
early 15th century begin now to feel the effects of that revolution, the revolution that takes
place in England at the end of the 15th century, we call it the Tudor revolution or the revolution
that takes place in France after the end of the 100 years war with the emergence of Louis XI,
the spider king, or which takes place in Castile under the rule of Isabella, that is to say the
centralization of power, there is health to pay for the centralizing of power, the nation state
will exact a heavy toll on those who in a sense will be selected as targets for its own new power,
and one way in which the power of the state is made most evident is of course the inquisition,
and in this last part of the lecture I want to turn briefly to the persecutory mechanisms,
the use of torture and the kind of spectacles of power which are presented throughout Europe,
against witches, against Jews, against people suffering from leprosy, against dissenters,
against heretics, in that great processes which lead to the construction of national identities,
now the inquisition does not operate in Protestant countries, but where the inquisition does not
operate there are mechanisms that are similar to the inquisition, now think for example that the most
noted they will the best known inquisition is of course the Spanish inquisition,
and note here that the Spanish inquisition is of course an instrument of the estate,
that is to say that it does not in fact is not on the papal supervision, that it is under the
control of the crown, and that the crown uses it as a battering ram against dissenters to enforce
some kind of national unity, this is very clear and it has been very clearly proven by historians
and so on, but think of the estate now who has hand in hand with religion in the persecution
and execution of those who in fact are identified as evil or being enemies of Christianity,
of being consorted with Satan, it is in a sense a kind of shall we say trying to make things
be what they are not, the inquisition of course will never execute anyone, the church will not
execute anyone, they will and here is the word that is used they will release the guilty to the
hands of the estate that will do the killing, the state doesn't want the church to kill anyone
because the state claims the monopoly of violence, they claim the monopoly to execute people,
so that in a sense what you have is the formation of very elaborate persecretary mechanisms
that are going to be used by both Protestants and Catholics in the ferreting out of the enemy,
witches, Jews in Spain, conversors, Muslims practicing some kind of Islamic religion
under the guise of Christianity and then of course there is the way in which they are essentially
executed, all throughout the continent burning at the stake, in England hanging by your neck,
think about the body of the victim, think about the theatricality, the spectacle of the burning,
think about in a world without television, without newspapers, in which very few people
have books, think about the extraordinary psychological impact of this event, think about
of the mold in DC, in Washington DC or the greatest square where all the people come to in a sense
be witnesses to this process of punishing the body of that person who had been found guilty
and there is a procession that leads to the execution, even in a small villages there is
always a small procession and the people in the procession are arranged hierarchically
that is to say you have a very clear pedagogical purpose in the way in which you execute people,
you are telling all those who are gazing upon the spectacle about the very nature of power in
this society, who comes first, who comes second, everyone is compelled to be present at this act,
if you don't come in and you're a member of a guild you have to pay a fine for not being here
and there you put the body of the victim on display and everyone surrounds it and by the way
these are incredibly popular events, everyone comes to this, it's better than television,
you can go there and see the great show but there is something else too, in this moment,
in this spectacle, in this theatres of power you also make sure that the victim is going to in a
sense perform her or his duty, that she or he will confess to his or her crimes even if they
never took place, that she or he will ask for forgiveness, it is in fact an extraordinary
moment because it is a moment of inclusion, that is to say it's a moment of the ultimate
exclusion, you killed the individual and then at the same time you reinsert the body of the victim
of the guilty party into the body of the community, there is a closure to this, there is a dramatic
denouement, there is a great ending here because as you are facing the fire you confess your sins,
you ask all of those presence and the church and the king for pardon, to pardon you, you ask for
your forgiveness and there you go into your debt and in dying you are therefore reinserted into the
body of the community, part of the great tragedy of public executions or executions in any country
or something like that, the most recent one is that the family was left extraordinarily,
the execution of Mac Bay, the family was left extraordinarily in the air because there was
no repentance, if the guilty party is not going to repent he's not going to be executed in public,
if he's executed in public he's then going to in a sense provide a catharsis for all, thank you.
