00:00.000 --> 00:16.780
For all the preaching that chemistry professors do about lab safety, it's amazing how many

00:16.780 --> 00:21.480
advances have been made by those who ignored or broke those rules.

00:21.480 --> 00:26.360
As the powerful biological activity of certain small molecules has become more and more apparent,

00:26.360 --> 00:31.880
one of the classic methods of analysis, tasting, has become an absolute taboo in the chemistry

00:31.880 --> 00:32.880
lab.

00:32.880 --> 00:38.300
Yet, some great discoveries have been made by those who broke this very simple rule.

00:38.300 --> 00:42.580
Take the example of Ira Remsen, an American born researcher who had spent significant

00:42.580 --> 00:47.800
time in Germany in the 1870s, studying some of the most advanced chemical techniques of

00:47.800 --> 00:48.800
the day.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.520
Now, we're talking about the late 1870s, the same time as the boom of standard oil and

00:54.520 --> 00:56.360
petroleum processing.

00:56.360 --> 01:01.320
So, when Remsen returned to America to found the chemistry department at Johns Hopkins

01:01.320 --> 01:06.360
University, he chose to study products which could be extracted from coal tar, ostensibly

01:06.360 --> 01:11.240
for use as fuels, building materials and other industrial applications.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.440
But Remsen's fate and the taste buds of his collaborator, Konstantin Fahlberg, took him

01:16.440 --> 01:18.960
down a different path.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.440
One night, after a day in the lab, Fahlberg noticed that his hands were contaminated with

01:23.440 --> 01:25.840
a sweet-tasting substance.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.600
It seemed that Remsen's laboratory had produced something remarkably sweet-tasting.

01:30.600 --> 01:37.120
A quick investigation revealed that the sweet substance is what we now call saccharin, the

01:37.120 --> 01:40.480
age of the artificial sweetener had been born.

01:40.480 --> 01:45.880
In the century and a half since Remsen's isolation of saccharin, artificial sweeteners

01:45.880 --> 01:48.880
have proven to be a blessing and a curse to society.

01:48.880 --> 01:53.200
They clearly offer benefits in the reduction of calories in sweet foods and drinks.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.280
But at the same time, their overall effect on health is hotly debated and thoroughly

01:57.280 --> 02:00.800
researched even today.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.720
These health concerns, along with free market competition, have led to the discovery and

02:04.720 --> 02:09.160
development of a broad range of such sweeteners over time.

02:09.160 --> 02:14.200
And early versions of these products, like saccharin and aspartame, look downright foreign

02:14.200 --> 02:19.280
next to a molecule of sucrose, the molecule which they're all meant to mimic.

02:19.280 --> 02:24.600
But newer options are more closely structurally related to sugar itself, like a molecule of

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
sucralose.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.880
Now, we're all familiar with the molecule sucrose, or at least what it does.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.480
We use it as a sweetener.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.560
Now, the artificial sweetener sucralose is actually synthesized directly from sucrose

02:38.560 --> 02:40.760
as a starting material.

02:40.760 --> 02:48.240
In order to do this, I have to convert these three OH groups, or hydroxyl groups, into chloride

02:48.240 --> 02:49.760
groups.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.360
Once this is done, I've constructed my sucralose and I'm ready to take it to market.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.720
Now, sucralose costs a little bit more because it has to be synthesized in a lab from sucrose's

02:59.720 --> 03:00.720
raw material.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.300
So, it's going to be about 10 times as expensive to make.

03:04.300 --> 03:10.800
But in addition to being non-caloric, it's also 600 times as sweet as sugar.

03:10.800 --> 03:15.440
Now, I'm not John Rockefeller, but I think I sense a good business opportunity here.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.640
So today, we're going to cross a very palpable threshold in the study of organic chemistry.

03:20.640 --> 03:26.080
Today, we're going to begin considering the fundamental mechanisms by which one compound

03:26.080 --> 03:27.600
can become another.

03:27.600 --> 03:32.600
We'll take the first few steps in our journey to understand exactly how it is at some of

03:32.600 --> 03:38.040
the simpler molecules we've seen so far, and even more complex molecules like sucrose,

03:38.040 --> 03:43.520
can be altered in a meaningful, targeted fashion using the knowledge that we've acquired since

03:43.520 --> 03:45.360
the days of Woller's great accident.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.680
Remember, he's the one that produced urea from inorganic substances giving birth to

03:49.680 --> 03:51.920
the field of organic chemistry.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.920
Now, as complex and detailed as our understanding of the science of chemistry has become, it's

03:57.920 --> 04:02.560
sometimes easy to forget that the vast majority of our understanding of the science is rooted

04:02.560 --> 04:08.960
in just over 200 years of intense study by just a handful of highly influential thinkers.

04:09.920 --> 04:16.400
In the days of Loisier, Woller, and even Markovnikov and Zetsev, organic chemistry consisted of

04:16.400 --> 04:22.400
mainly blindly, albeit very hopefully, mixing reagents in an empirical search for order in

04:22.400 --> 04:25.280
the products that resulted.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.520
As we settled into the 1900s, however, things began to change.

04:29.520 --> 04:34.400
That large body of observational knowledge accumulated over a century had reached a critical

04:34.400 --> 04:39.480
tipping point, the point at which the sum of all former observations started to lead

04:39.480 --> 04:43.120
us to predictive rules about reactions.

04:43.120 --> 04:48.880
In short, observation had led to understanding, which in turn was slowly manifesting an ability

04:48.880 --> 04:54.320
to predict and design reactions.

04:54.320 --> 04:59.440
As we begin our investigation into some reaction pathways, we're going to revisit an old friend,

04:59.440 --> 05:04.400
Christopher Kelk Engeld, who did so much more for the science than just participating

05:04.400 --> 05:09.520
in developing the now familiar con Engeld-Prelog nomenclature convention.

05:09.520 --> 05:13.760
It's also Engeld, who's often credited with first proposing some of the fundamental rules

05:13.760 --> 05:19.520
governing organic reaction mechanisms, which are still in use today.

05:19.520 --> 05:26.240
In 1933, Engeld and his collaborator, E. D. Hughes, wrote a letter to the vaunted scientific

05:26.240 --> 05:28.160
journal Nature.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.880
In this letter, they laid out their argument for a systematic and predictive approach to

05:32.880 --> 05:40.960
understanding one of three basic reaction types in organic chemistry called substitution.

05:40.960 --> 05:46.880
Shortly thereafter, Engeld made this sense of change very clear when in 1934 he wrote

05:46.880 --> 05:48.960
the following of his own research.

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
Quote,

05:49.960 --> 05:55.440
The new work made it inescapably clear that the old order in organic chemistry was changing.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.360
The art of the subject was diminishing, its science increasing.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.820
No longer could one just mix things, sophistication in physical chemistry was the base from which

06:04.820 --> 06:08.920
all chemists, including the organic chemists, must start.

06:08.920 --> 06:09.920
End quote.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.040
Powerful words.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.840
Over the next three lectures, we're going to investigate the three general reaction types

06:16.840 --> 06:19.960
most often encountered in organic chemistry.

06:19.960 --> 06:25.420
Those are substitution, in which one substituent or functional group is exchanged for another

06:25.420 --> 06:34.460
elimination, in which substituents or functional groups are lost in favor of pi bond formation,

06:34.460 --> 06:39.580
and addition, in which pi bonds are sacrificed to form sigma bonds to new substituents or

06:39.580 --> 06:42.500
functional groups.

06:42.500 --> 06:47.740
So let's begin with substitution reactions and see if we can better understand how sucrose

06:47.740 --> 06:49.740
is turned into sucralose.

06:49.740 --> 06:54.420
Now, before we go quite that far, let's take a look at a simpler reaction than one might

06:54.420 --> 06:57.500
use to convert sucrose to sucralose.

06:57.500 --> 07:02.940
Here I have a hydroxide ion reacting with a methyl chloride molecule.

07:02.940 --> 07:10.300
Now the product of this reaction is a chloride ion and methyl alcohol, also known as methanol.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.140
The reaction if I were to draw as line angle formula would look something like this, in

07:14.140 --> 07:20.420
which the chlorine substituent from my methyl chloride has been replaced by the hydroxyl

07:20.420 --> 07:22.540
from the hydroxide reagent.

07:22.540 --> 07:27.540
So this is a classic example of a very simple substitution reaction.

07:27.540 --> 07:33.660
You'll notice that in my starting materials I have two different species, and in my products

07:33.660 --> 07:36.580
I also have two different species.

07:36.580 --> 07:40.900
So a substitution reaction is what we would call entropically neutral.

07:40.900 --> 07:46.100
It's not really driven or fought against by randomness, it's sort of on the fence on

07:46.100 --> 07:47.100
that.

07:47.100 --> 07:51.460
So what's going to determine whether these reactions occur or not is not the entropy,

07:51.460 --> 07:55.580
but the enthalpy, the strength of the bonds that are breaking and forming.

07:55.580 --> 07:59.060
Now any substitution reaction will have the same basic cast of characters.

07:59.060 --> 08:05.300
A nucleophile, a substrate, an electrophile and a leaving group.

08:05.300 --> 08:09.980
So let's define each of these individually before we proceed.

08:09.980 --> 08:13.940
Nucleophiles are defined as species which easily donate an electron pair to form a new

08:13.940 --> 08:16.900
chemical bond with another nucleus.

08:16.900 --> 08:20.540
Their name in fact literally means nucleus loving.

08:20.540 --> 08:25.100
In our example, the hydroxide ion with a complement of three electron pairs in a full

08:25.100 --> 08:28.580
negative charge is clearly the nucleophile.

08:28.580 --> 08:33.340
It's poised to donate one of those pairs to a new bond and in doing so to relieve that

08:33.340 --> 08:34.900
formal charge.

08:34.900 --> 08:41.220
An electrophile is a nucleus which, unlike the nucleophile, is deficient in electrons

08:41.220 --> 08:45.820
and is capable of receiving electrons from the nucleophile.

08:45.820 --> 08:50.580
In our example, the bond dipole created by the presence of the chlorine substituent makes

08:50.580 --> 08:57.980
the carbon of methylchloride electrophilic, or electron loving.

08:57.980 --> 09:02.780
In contrast to nucleophiles, leaving groups are those groups which easily withdraw their

09:02.780 --> 09:09.780
bonding electrons to become a separate stable species, like the chlorine from our methylchloride.

09:09.780 --> 09:14.340
Recall from our lecture on alkyl halides that withdrawing its bonding electrons and becoming

09:14.340 --> 09:19.300
a chloride ion is more acceptable to chlorine because its large electron cloud allows it

09:19.300 --> 09:22.980
to distribute its charge over a larger volume.

09:22.980 --> 09:29.820
Finally, we term the entire molecule undergoing substitution as the substrate.

09:29.820 --> 09:37.100
In our case, methylchloride would be the substrate for our substitution reaction.

09:37.100 --> 09:41.220
So let's think for just a moment about how a substitution might take place.

09:41.220 --> 09:46.060
With a nucleophile and a leaving group both in the mix, there are three possible permutations

09:46.060 --> 09:48.420
of such a reaction.

09:48.420 --> 09:53.540
One in which the nucleophile first attacks, establishing its bond, then the leaving group

09:53.540 --> 09:56.740
departs, breaking its bond.

09:56.740 --> 10:02.460
There's one in which the nucleophile attacks as the leaving group departs, and one in which

10:02.460 --> 10:07.900
the nucleophile attacks only after the leaving group has departed.

10:07.900 --> 10:12.740
The first of these three situations is impossible, since it would require that a transition state

10:12.740 --> 10:18.340
form in which the electrophilic carbon has more than eight valence electrons.

10:18.340 --> 10:22.900
Many organic professors will joke that to draw such a pentavalent carbon is to immediately

10:22.900 --> 10:24.740
fail their exam.

10:24.740 --> 10:29.660
And there is a modicum of truth in that statement, and I have a reputation to uphold, so we're

10:29.660 --> 10:32.060
not going to go there today.

10:32.060 --> 10:35.740
But the other two are equally valid possibilities.

10:35.740 --> 10:39.460
There's one in which simultaneous attack and departure maintains a balance of eight

10:39.460 --> 10:45.180
electrons around the carbon throughout the transition, and the other in which initial

10:45.180 --> 10:50.180
departure of the leaving group produces a carbocation intermediate with only six valence

10:50.180 --> 10:51.180
electrons.

10:51.180 --> 10:56.820
Non-ideal, yes, but a blatant violation of the octet rule like our pentavalent carbon?

10:56.820 --> 10:57.820
No.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.860
Now one of Ingalls' great contributions to the discipline of organic chemistry is his

11:01.980 --> 11:08.620
1933 description of these two possible pathways by which a substitution can take place.

11:08.620 --> 11:14.780
We call these reaction pathways SN1 and SN2.

11:14.780 --> 11:22.260
This is for nucleophilic substitution, so SN2 stands for substitution, nucleophilic,

11:22.260 --> 11:30.820
second order, and SN1 stands for substitution, nucleophilic, first order.

11:30.820 --> 11:35.300
These names are based upon the reaction mechanism which Ingalls was able to infer from changes

11:35.300 --> 11:39.340
that he made to reagent concentrations.

11:39.340 --> 11:44.380
Any mechanism, no matter how complex, will have what's called a rate limiting step.

11:44.380 --> 11:48.740
This is the slowest elementary step in the mechanism, and it defines the rate of the

11:48.740 --> 11:49.780
reaction.

11:49.780 --> 11:54.860
So just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so a reaction is only as fast

11:54.860 --> 11:57.700
as its slowest step.

11:57.700 --> 12:03.300
So the rate limiting step and all steps before it are affected to some extent by the concentration

12:03.300 --> 12:07.580
of the reagents involved in those steps.

12:07.580 --> 12:11.460
In other words, the rate of a reaction is proportional to the concentration of reagents

12:11.460 --> 12:17.140
in its rate limiting step, but it's unaffected by concentrations of reagents which participate

12:17.140 --> 12:19.260
after that.

12:19.260 --> 12:24.140
In chemistry, we use a rate proportionality constant, written as the lower case letter

12:24.140 --> 12:30.020
K, to produce what's known as a rate law for a given reaction.

12:30.020 --> 12:34.620
So let's take a moment and look at our two generic substitution reactions and try to

12:34.620 --> 12:39.940
get inside of Ingalls' head and see how he came up with his system.

12:39.940 --> 12:45.460
One of the possibilities involved the nucleophile attacking the electrophilic carbon at the

12:45.460 --> 12:48.780
same time that the leading group departs.

12:48.780 --> 12:54.660
Now when this happens, the entire reaction takes place in a single concerted step.

12:54.660 --> 12:59.100
Because there's only one step, clearly this must be the rate limiting step.

12:59.100 --> 13:03.660
And that means that the rate law for this reaction is expected to contain both the concentration

13:03.660 --> 13:09.700
of the nucleophile and the concentration of the substrate, meaning that altering the concentration

13:09.700 --> 13:13.700
of either one should affect the reaction rate.

13:13.700 --> 13:19.220
Because this rate order is two, it's got two different concentrations in it, Ingalls

13:19.220 --> 13:24.460
call this the SN2 reaction.

13:24.460 --> 13:29.540
Now if instead we go through our other possible reaction, one in which first a leaving group

13:29.540 --> 13:35.460
departs from the substrate creating a carbocation intermediate, which is then attacked by the

13:35.460 --> 13:41.420
nucleophile leading to product, we have a situation in which the slow initial step takes

13:41.460 --> 13:45.660
place before the nucleophile ever reacts.

13:45.660 --> 13:50.980
So the rate law for this particular reaction will not contain a factor for nucleophile

13:50.980 --> 13:52.660
concentration.

13:52.660 --> 13:57.140
It will depend only on the concentration of the substrate and because it depends on only

13:57.140 --> 14:03.420
one reactant concentration, Ingalls dub this a first order reaction.

14:03.420 --> 14:09.020
So Ingalls began the process of linking molecular structure with function and reactivity.

14:09.020 --> 14:14.100
He observed that not only did two substitution pathways exist, but that the tendency of reactions

14:14.100 --> 14:19.020
to proceed by one or the other was predictable based on correlated structural features in

14:19.020 --> 14:21.340
the starting materials.

14:21.340 --> 14:26.260
Ingalls sought to explain this in his famous 1933 letter to Nature, and this is what I'm

14:26.260 --> 14:31.060
going to try to explain to you now.

14:31.060 --> 14:38.060
The second order nucleophilic substitution pathway, SN2, is characterized by a bimolecular

14:38.060 --> 14:44.700
reaction in which a nucleophile attacks and a leaving group departs simultaneously.

14:44.700 --> 14:48.980
Because it's the nucleophile's attack which initiates the leaving group's departure,

14:48.980 --> 14:53.140
the attack must take place from the opposite side of the substrate in order to break the

14:53.140 --> 14:55.660
associated bond with the leaving group.

14:55.660 --> 15:00.380
We call this orientation a backside attack.

15:00.380 --> 15:04.940
This type of reaction is expected to take place in a single concerted step with only

15:04.940 --> 15:09.300
one elementary step in the reaction, so we expect the rate to be affected equally by

15:09.300 --> 15:14.060
the concentration of both starting materials.

15:14.060 --> 15:20.820
The key to a reaction running by the SN2 mechanism lies primarily in two factors, strong reactive

15:20.820 --> 15:27.620
nucleophiles like hydroxide and less substituted electrophiles like methyl chloride.

15:27.620 --> 15:31.180
So let's consider each of these factors individually.

15:32.180 --> 15:37.740
A strong nucleophile like hydroxide, it's inherently unstable, its high density of negative

15:37.740 --> 15:42.340
charge around the oxygen atom is the source of that instability, and hydroxide is going

15:42.340 --> 15:46.020
to seek to relieve it at its earliest chance.

15:46.020 --> 15:52.500
Now, another crucial feature is the degree of substitution at the electrophile.

15:52.500 --> 15:58.620
You see, hydroxide might be poised to attack, but it can't attack what it can't get to.

15:58.620 --> 16:02.860
So let's take a look at the substrate from our SN2 reaction.

16:02.860 --> 16:07.740
This is a molecule of methyl chloride, drawn in the usual format so that you can see the

16:07.740 --> 16:11.460
chlorine atom on one side and the methyl group on the other.

16:11.460 --> 16:15.860
But my hydroxide nucleophile has to attack from the opposing side.

16:15.860 --> 16:20.340
So what I'm going to do now is turn my ball and stick model into a space filling model,

16:20.340 --> 16:23.940
and then I'm going to turn that model so that you have the perspective of a nucleophile

16:23.940 --> 16:25.780
that's approaching.

16:25.820 --> 16:30.380
So I'm going to turn my substrate this way, and you can see clearly the electrophilic

16:30.380 --> 16:32.460
carbon is wide open.

16:32.460 --> 16:36.620
We can fit almost anything in there to react with it.

16:36.620 --> 16:42.860
But what if I were going to use an analogous substrate, which was tertiary, like say T-butylchloride?

16:42.860 --> 16:44.980
Let's bring that one up.

16:44.980 --> 16:48.580
And again, I'll convert this into a space filling model, and I'm going to rotate it

16:48.580 --> 16:51.980
in the same orientation.

16:51.980 --> 16:56.620
So now you're the nucleophile looking at a T-butyl substrate and looking at a methyl

16:56.620 --> 16:57.820
substrate.

16:57.820 --> 17:02.180
I think it's very clear which one you're going to be able to get to easier.

17:02.180 --> 17:06.780
So this is the reason why less substituted substrates find themselves in SN2 reactions.

17:06.780 --> 17:10.620
They're simply more accessible to the nucleophile.

17:10.620 --> 17:14.420
So we've seen what can happen when strong nucleophiles react with substrates of low

17:14.420 --> 17:17.900
substitution in an SN2 reaction.

17:17.900 --> 17:23.100
Now what if we reverse these conditions, and instead we attempt to react a weak nucleophile

17:23.100 --> 17:27.020
with a highly substituted substrate?

17:27.020 --> 17:30.940
Let's take a look at water reacting with T-butylchloride.

17:30.940 --> 17:34.220
Now water is clearly a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.580
It has lone pairs of electrons on its oxygen, but it lacks the negative charge which made

17:38.580 --> 17:42.580
the hydroxide attack with such urgency.

17:42.580 --> 17:47.780
T-butylchloride has three methyl substituents on the electrophilic carbon, making attack

17:47.780 --> 17:50.740
difficult even for a strong nucleophile.

17:50.740 --> 17:54.540
So what's going to happen in this situation?

17:54.540 --> 17:59.700
Well a patient nucleophile like water, with nowhere to attack, is going to simply wait,

17:59.700 --> 18:04.660
biding its time until something more accessible and reactive presents itself.

18:04.660 --> 18:09.300
In the case of T-butylchloride, this happens when the chloride ion departs on its own,

18:09.300 --> 18:12.780
leaving behind a carbocation.

18:12.780 --> 18:17.620
Now T-butylchloride is a distinctively more attractive substrate for two reasons.

18:17.620 --> 18:24.220
First, the electrophilic carbon now has only six valence electrons and a full positive charge.

18:24.220 --> 18:31.220
Second, its new planar arrangement of substituents means that it's much more accessible to nucleophiles.

18:31.220 --> 18:38.100
So this cation is practically begging to be attacked by even the weakest of nucleophiles.

18:38.100 --> 18:43.900
Water will oblige in short order, attacking the carbocation and completing the reaction,

18:43.900 --> 18:51.740
producing a protonated alcohol which quickly deprotonates to form a neutral molecule.

18:51.740 --> 18:56.740
So in this case, it's the formation of a carbocation which is the first and rate limiting

18:56.740 --> 19:00.020
of two steps in the reaction process.

19:00.020 --> 19:04.620
Because the nucleophilic attack happens after the slow formation of the carbocation, the

19:04.620 --> 19:09.500
nucleophiles concentration no longer affects the rate of this reaction.

19:09.500 --> 19:15.220
Now remember that SN2 reactions take place in one concerted step, requiring that the

19:15.220 --> 19:21.180
nucleophile attack the carbon bearing the leaving group and only that specific carbon.

19:21.180 --> 19:25.140
But if we've arrived at our first example of carbocation intermediates, so we have to

19:25.140 --> 19:29.380
consider the possibility that rearrangements, like those we discussed in our alkyl halide

19:29.380 --> 19:32.980
lecture, might occur.

19:32.980 --> 19:38.260
Take the example of 2-chloro-3-methylbutane reacting with water.

19:38.260 --> 19:43.660
Just as before, a chloride ion will depart from the molecule, creating a secondary carbocation.

19:43.660 --> 19:48.780
But in this example, the resulting carbocation will have that special recipe of a secondary

19:48.780 --> 19:53.340
carbocation adjacent to a tertiary carbon.

19:53.340 --> 20:00.260
So before a nucleophile attacks, the carbocation can rearrange by hydride shift to form a tertiary

20:00.260 --> 20:01.740
alcohol ultimate.

20:02.500 --> 20:08.180
Instead of that secondary alcohol that we may have initially predicted, the analogous

20:08.180 --> 20:15.540
reaction with 3-chloro-2-2-dimethylbutane would proceed with a secondary methyl shift,

20:15.540 --> 20:20.380
also producing a tertiary alcohol, but this time with a different connectivity of carbon

20:20.380 --> 20:25.180
atoms altogether.

20:25.180 --> 20:31.340
Alkyl shifts can also affect the product in cyclic substrates, such as 1-1-chloroethyl

20:31.460 --> 20:32.940
2-methylcyclobutane.

20:32.940 --> 20:37.060
I know that's a mouthful, but it's a very simple structure.

20:37.060 --> 20:41.060
But remember that the Bayer ring strain theory tells us that these 3 and 4-membered rings

20:41.060 --> 20:44.860
in particular are less stable than 5 and 6.

20:44.860 --> 20:49.060
So in this case, the carbocation can form adjacent to the strain ring, and the ring

20:49.060 --> 20:54.420
can then expand in a sort of alkyl shift, which leads to a product with 5-membered ring

20:54.420 --> 20:57.900
instead of 4.

20:57.940 --> 21:01.740
Now you've no doubt noticed that our reaction examples today all involved conversion of

21:01.740 --> 21:05.740
one tetrahedral carbon center into a different one.

21:05.740 --> 21:10.780
So this leads us to our final set of reactions for the day, substitution reactions involving

21:10.780 --> 21:12.780
chiral substrates.

21:12.780 --> 21:17.700
Now you'll recall that SN2 reactions have to take place by the backside attack, but

21:17.700 --> 21:22.980
SN1 reactions produce a planar carbocation intermediate which can be attacked from either

21:22.980 --> 21:26.740
side with equal efficiency.

21:26.740 --> 21:31.860
This leads to a difference in product composition from a stereochemical standpoint.

21:31.860 --> 21:38.860
Now if we were to react a chiral substrate by SN2, for example, enantiopur R2-chlorobutane,

21:40.180 --> 21:43.860
we can expect an enantiopur product to form.

21:43.860 --> 21:48.180
The identity of the substrate has not only changed, but the stereochemistry has been

21:48.180 --> 21:51.540
inverted as a consequence of backside attack.

21:51.540 --> 21:56.580
So this reaction would produce S2-butanol.

21:56.580 --> 22:03.180
In contrast, let's consider the SN1 reaction between water and R2-chlorobutane.

22:03.180 --> 22:07.380
In this case, our substrate must first convert to a carbocation, which can then be attacked

22:07.380 --> 22:11.020
by the nucleophile from either side.

22:11.020 --> 22:16.940
This leads to what we call a racemic mixture of 2-butanol, in other words, a 50-50 composition

22:16.940 --> 22:22.020
of both R and S enantiomers.

22:22.020 --> 22:26.700
So we've broken our two substitution mechanisms down to their elementary steps.

22:26.700 --> 22:31.820
Of course, for SN2 this means a bimolecular reaction in a single concerted step, but for

22:31.820 --> 22:37.060
SN1 there's a unimolecular rate-limiting dissociation of the substrate at the beginning

22:37.060 --> 22:39.540
of a two-step mechanism.

22:39.540 --> 22:44.660
An Engel proved long ago that the concentration of the nucleophile affects the rate of SN2,

22:44.660 --> 22:47.220
but not of SN1.

22:47.220 --> 22:51.860
This is a consequence of its absence in the rate-limiting step of the SN1 pathway.

22:51.860 --> 22:56.740
But reagent concentration is not the only way to alter the rate of an SN1 or SN2 reaction

22:56.740 --> 22:58.420
to our benefit.

22:58.420 --> 23:05.060
See, because the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms differ in the chemistry of their rate-limiting steps,

23:05.060 --> 23:09.340
it stands to reason their rates can be affected differently by changes in the surrounding chemical

23:09.340 --> 23:11.340
environment.

23:11.340 --> 23:15.520
Usually, this environment is a liquid solvent in which they're dissolved.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.740
So let's take a look at a few substitution reactions and ask ourselves how choosing a

23:19.740 --> 23:24.060
different solvent might change the rate of that reaction.

23:24.060 --> 23:32.300
We'll start with an SN2, a nice concerted mechanism taking place in a single step.

23:32.300 --> 23:36.700
Recall that SN2 reactions are characterized by the presence of strong nucleophiles, which

23:36.700 --> 23:42.620
tend to have high negative charge density, species like hydroxide.

23:42.620 --> 23:46.620
Now let's consider the effect of running an SN2 reaction between methyl chloride and

23:46.620 --> 23:50.660
hydroxide starting materials.

23:50.660 --> 23:56.820
The starting material includes the hydroxide with a full, localized negative charge.

23:56.820 --> 24:01.740
The reaction then proceeds through a transition state in which that negative charge is spread

24:01.740 --> 24:05.700
out across the nucleophile and the leaving group.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.580
So the transition state has less charge density.

24:08.580 --> 24:12.780
Of course, there are other factors making it less stable in the starting materials like

24:12.780 --> 24:16.740
the two bonds that are in the process of breaking and forming.

24:16.740 --> 24:21.700
But the fact remains that the activation energy of the reaction is simply the difference between

24:21.700 --> 24:23.740
the starting and final states.

24:23.740 --> 24:29.220
So anything we can do to close that energy gap will speed up the reaction.

24:29.220 --> 24:33.460
Anything we can do to destabilize that starting material more than the intermediate is going

24:33.460 --> 24:37.820
to result in acceleration.

24:37.820 --> 24:41.980
One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is to choose the right solvent.

24:41.980 --> 24:47.780
As you might imagine, solvents of low polarity like the hydrocarbon hexane don't interact

24:47.780 --> 24:51.980
well with charged nucleophiles, leaving them highly reactive.

24:51.980 --> 24:55.540
And therefore, these nucleophiles are more likely to attack.

24:55.540 --> 25:00.020
And the problem which sometimes arises in this situation is that charged nucleophiles

25:00.020 --> 25:06.020
simply aren't soluble at all in nonpolar solvents, so we have to choose very carefully.

25:06.020 --> 25:14.180
We sometimes classify solvents based not only on their polarity, but also on their acidity.

25:14.180 --> 25:23.100
We call solvents like acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and acetonitrile, polar A-protic solvents,

25:23.100 --> 25:26.100
because they lack any real acidic hydrogens.

25:26.100 --> 25:33.620
Conversely, solvents like isopropanol, ethanol, and water are called polar protic.

25:33.620 --> 25:38.460
See all of these solvents have a strong molecular dipole, but the real difference is the orientation

25:38.460 --> 25:40.860
of that dipole.

25:40.860 --> 25:45.140
You'll notice that all the A-protic solvents have a dipole oriented with the negative end

25:45.140 --> 25:49.900
near the surface of the molecule, while all the protic solvents have a dipole oriented

25:49.900 --> 25:54.820
just the opposite, with the positive charge density at the periphery of the solvent molecule,

25:54.820 --> 25:58.620
and the negative end buried deep within.

25:58.620 --> 26:03.500
So the interaction between solvent dipoles and the nucleophile in our example reaction

26:03.500 --> 26:08.220
is greater in magnitude than that in the transition state, owing to the stronger charge of that

26:08.220 --> 26:09.620
starting material.

26:09.620 --> 26:15.500
If we use a polar protic solvent like isopropanol, the positive end of its dipole is readily

26:15.500 --> 26:19.340
available to stabilize that charged nucleophile.

26:19.340 --> 26:24.220
This lowers the energy of the starting material and increases the activation energy barrier,

26:24.220 --> 26:27.860
slowing the reaction down.

26:27.860 --> 26:33.020
But if we use a polar A-protic solvent like acetone for this reaction, the positive end

26:33.020 --> 26:37.180
of the dipole is buried within the molecule of solvent and can't interact as well with

26:37.180 --> 26:38.500
the nucleophile.

26:38.500 --> 26:43.660
Instead, the nucleophile sort of sees more negative charge density at the surface of

26:43.660 --> 26:47.760
the solvent molecules, and this is very destabilizing.

26:47.760 --> 26:53.580
It raises the energy of the nucleophile and lowers the activation energy barrier, which

26:53.580 --> 26:54.900
results in a faster reaction.

26:57.940 --> 27:01.900
Now in the case of SN1 reactions, we tend to begin the rate limiting step with a neutral

27:01.900 --> 27:07.860
substrate like t-butyl chloride, and this neutral substrate dissociates into two ions

27:07.860 --> 27:10.460
in that rate limiting step.

27:10.460 --> 27:15.900
So since this reaction involves the formation of both a cation and an anion, either protic

27:15.900 --> 27:19.340
or A-protic solvents, that's usually not the big concern to us.

27:19.340 --> 27:21.260
We could use either one.

27:21.260 --> 27:26.540
But the overall polarity of the solvent is crucial, since stronger dipoles in the solvent

27:26.540 --> 27:32.580
can produce more stabilizing interactions with the charged intermediates.

27:32.580 --> 27:39.060
So while low polarity or polar A-protic solvents tend to accelerate SN2 reactions, polar solvents

27:39.060 --> 27:43.420
in general tend to accelerate SN1 reactions.

27:43.420 --> 27:49.220
This is a good general rule for prototypical substitution mechanisms I've shown you today.

27:49.220 --> 27:52.740
But you should be aware that we'll see many exceptions to this rule as we continue our

27:52.740 --> 27:56.580
course and the nature of these species becomes more complex.

27:56.580 --> 28:03.100
I'll be pointing them out and explaining what makes these exceptions occur as we reach them.

28:03.100 --> 28:10.060
So let's take a final look at the differences in the structures of sucrose and sucralose.

28:10.060 --> 28:16.460
The question that we're going to ask today is, when we want to convert sucrose into sucralose,

28:16.460 --> 28:21.780
do we need to use an SN1 reaction to complete the synthesis or an SN2 reaction to complete

28:21.780 --> 28:22.780
the synthesis?

28:22.780 --> 28:27.260
Now, the actual reagents that we'll need to complete the synthesis will come in a later

28:27.260 --> 28:31.820
lecture, so we'll be revisiting this synthesis at least one more time.

28:31.820 --> 28:36.780
But for today, let's just take a look at sucrose and sucralose and the changes that we want

28:36.780 --> 28:38.080
to make.

28:38.080 --> 28:45.180
There are three hydroxyl groups on our sucrose molecule, which need to be altered into chlorine

28:45.180 --> 28:46.460
groups.

28:46.460 --> 28:52.300
But not only that, we have two of them on primary carbons and we have another one on

28:52.300 --> 28:54.340
a secondary carbon.

28:54.340 --> 28:59.160
So this one is attached to a primary, this one is attached to a primary, and this one

28:59.160 --> 29:03.300
over here is attached to a secondary.

29:03.300 --> 29:08.580
But another piece of interest here is that that secondary carbon is chiral.

29:08.580 --> 29:13.420
And if you look closely, you notice that here I have inverted the stereochemistry, where

29:13.420 --> 29:18.380
in this perspective formula my hydroxide is falling behind the plane of the monitor,

29:18.380 --> 29:23.540
but in this depiction my new chloride group is coming out of the plane of the monitor.

29:23.540 --> 29:29.100
So not only do I have to alter my two primary substrate locations and one secondary substrate

29:29.100 --> 29:34.900
location, but I have to alter the secondary substrate location in such a way that it proceeds

29:34.900 --> 29:37.540
with inversion.

29:37.540 --> 29:43.340
Now all three of these are only congruent with an SN2 reaction.

29:43.340 --> 29:47.800
So when the time comes, we're going to have to select reagents to complete our synthesis

29:47.800 --> 29:50.860
by an SN2.

29:50.860 --> 29:54.020
So let's sum up the work of Ingold and his contemporaries that we've covered in this

29:54.020 --> 29:56.020
lecture.

29:56.020 --> 30:00.820
We've defined nucleophilic substitution reactions as the reaction between a nucleophile and

30:00.820 --> 30:05.700
a substrate to form a product and a leaving group.

30:05.700 --> 30:10.060
We discussed how these reactions are usually entropically neutral and tend to be driven

30:10.060 --> 30:15.220
by the enthalpies of the reactants and products.

30:15.220 --> 30:19.600
We discussed how nucleophilic substitution mechanisms are divided into two classes based

30:19.600 --> 30:22.900
upon the rate laws for each pathway.

30:22.900 --> 30:30.180
SN2 for bimolecular reactions taking place in a single concerted step and SN1 for reactions

30:30.180 --> 30:34.660
taking place in a sequence of steps beginning with the slow departure of a leaving group

30:34.660 --> 30:38.380
from the substrate.

30:38.380 --> 30:43.500
We took a look at the two most important factors influencing a substitution pathway.

30:43.500 --> 30:48.500
How strong nucleophiles and low substitution substrates favor SN2?

30:48.500 --> 30:55.020
While weak nucleophiles and highly substituted substrates favor the SN1.

30:55.020 --> 31:01.500
We also took a look at the effect each pathway has on the retention of chirality in substrates.

31:01.500 --> 31:06.860
Finally, we considered solvent selection for substitution reactions.

31:06.860 --> 31:11.940
We looked at how the high negative charge density in strong nucleophiles makes SN2 reactions

31:11.940 --> 31:20.180
tend to run best in low polarity solvents or polar aprotic solvents like acetone.

31:20.180 --> 31:24.780
We then considered SN1 reactions and how their charged intermediates make them tend to run

31:24.780 --> 31:32.900
poorly in low polarity solvents but usually run well in a very broad range of polar solvents.

31:32.940 --> 31:37.140
We concerned ourselves today with some of the very ideal conditions of nucleophile strength

31:37.140 --> 31:42.420
and substrate substitution to achieve an SN1 or SN2 reaction.

31:42.420 --> 31:45.900
Next time we're going to consider what happens when the factors influencing these pathways

31:45.900 --> 31:51.300
are in conflict with one another rather than conspiring to a specific substitution mechanism.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.420
I'll see you then.
