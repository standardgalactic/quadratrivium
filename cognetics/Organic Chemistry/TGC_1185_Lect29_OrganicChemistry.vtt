00:00.000 --> 00:19.560
Viking sailors, as early as the first century BC, may have discovered a miraculous talisman

00:19.560 --> 00:22.720
known as Sunstone.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.760
Narratives about historical figures of that time suggest that this stone could be used

00:26.760 --> 00:31.520
to locate the position of the Sun even on the cloudiest of days.

00:31.520 --> 00:35.880
Whether or not such navigational techniques were used remains a bit of a debate among

00:35.880 --> 00:38.560
archaeologists.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.760
But there are those who believe that this apparently fictional and fantastic stone is

00:42.760 --> 00:48.120
not myth, but historical reality.

00:48.120 --> 00:54.760
They believe that it's this, a piece of Icelandic spar, also known as the mineral calcite.

00:55.760 --> 01:02.640
Calcite is unusual among common minerals because of a property called birefringence.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.920
Calcite has the ability to refract light at two different angles depending upon the orientation

01:07.920 --> 01:13.560
of the electromagnetic waves making up the incident light.

01:13.560 --> 01:17.360
Those waves oscillating perpendicular to the surface of the stone refract at an angle different

01:17.360 --> 01:23.440
than the others, and this creates a second image when one looks through the stone.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.120
This is a curious phenomenon, but what does it have to do with navigation, or for that

01:28.120 --> 01:32.520
matter organic chemistry?

01:32.520 --> 01:36.880
Scientists now know that light from the Sun which penetrates the Earth's atmosphere undergoes

01:36.880 --> 01:40.040
a process known as scattering.

01:40.040 --> 01:44.580
Scattering happens when light encounters small particles in the air.

01:44.580 --> 01:48.000
Some familiar effects of this scattering are the blue color of the sky in the daytime and

01:48.000 --> 01:51.320
the reddish and orange hues of sunset.

01:51.320 --> 01:58.360
But a second effect, one which most of us are probably not familiar with, is polarization.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.840
The scattering that goes on as the light enters the atmosphere causes light which reaches

02:02.840 --> 02:08.720
the surface to have waves which are not randomly oriented, but rather are polarized or preferentially

02:08.720 --> 02:17.800
oriented in a direction which points back to the source, in this case, the Sun.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.860
A human eyes aren't capable of detecting the difference between polarized light coming

02:21.860 --> 02:26.880
directly from the Sun and diffuse light coming from other directions.

02:26.880 --> 02:31.960
But with its strong birefringent properties, calcite is.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.120
By scanning the horizon looking through the stone and comparing the intensities of the

02:36.120 --> 02:42.040
images one sees, a skilled navigator can pick out the direction of the Sun on even the most

02:42.040 --> 02:46.000
overcast of days.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.260
Now the notion that the ancient Norse sailors used this technique to navigate is a very

02:50.260 --> 02:55.560
romantic tale, but the problem has been lack of direct evidence in the form of archaeological

02:55.560 --> 03:00.720
samples of calcite from sites dating to 2000 years ago.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.820
There are those who believe that the calcite sunstones were used by these people and simply

03:04.820 --> 03:10.360
weathered away over the centuries erasing all direct evidence that they ever existed.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.720
Others still believe that the stories are pure fiction.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.320
It is certain, however, is this.

03:17.320 --> 03:22.560
In 2002, a block of the mineral calcite was found in the wreckage of an Elizabethan ship

03:22.560 --> 03:24.560
called the Alderney.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.080
The Alderney sank in 1592.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.840
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the discovery is the fact that this stone was

03:31.840 --> 03:40.280
found just a few feet from other navigational tools, a tantalizing find.

03:40.280 --> 03:45.200
But another tantalizing observation was made by physicist Guy Ropar at the University of

03:45.200 --> 03:48.200
Wren in 2013.

03:48.200 --> 03:54.040
Ropar was able to demonstrate that when properly trained in its use, a group of everyday people

03:54.040 --> 03:59.640
were able to determine the azimuth of the sun on a cloudy day to within one percent

03:59.640 --> 04:03.760
of its true location.

04:03.760 --> 04:09.240
If such a stone was ever used by the Vikings or Elizabethan sailors, one thing is certain.

04:09.240 --> 04:14.600
By the eve of the Industrial Revolution, some 300 years after the sinking of the Alderney,

04:14.600 --> 04:18.440
the technique seems to have been lost to the ages.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.040
Now we owe its rediscovery in the early 1800s to a French soldier, engineer and physicist

04:24.040 --> 04:29.840
Etienne Louis Malus.

04:29.840 --> 04:35.640
In the wake of discoveries by Ritter and Herschel, Malus, as the story goes, had taken an interest

04:35.640 --> 04:40.480
in optics and was contemplating the optical properties of minerals like that Esleinik

04:40.480 --> 04:44.000
spark crystal I just showed you.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.560
One day he was observing the beautiful properties of this material outside Luxembourg Palace.

04:50.560 --> 04:56.080
Now what Malus noticed was that if he looked at various objects through the crystal, he

04:56.080 --> 05:02.040
could see light of the same intensity regardless of how he rotated it.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.960
But then he turned and faced the palace and again rotated the crystal, looking at the

05:06.960 --> 05:10.880
light reflected by the palace's windows.

05:10.880 --> 05:16.120
What he saw was remarkable that the intensity of the transmitted light changed as he rotated

05:16.120 --> 05:17.440
the crystal.

05:17.440 --> 05:23.320
Clearly, something about the process of reflecting sunlight was changing more than just the direction

05:23.320 --> 05:27.080
of its propagation.

05:27.080 --> 05:33.760
When nonpolarized light strikes a smooth surface, like a window at a very specific angle, and

05:33.760 --> 05:39.020
this angle is also, by the way, specific to the material, now some of the light is reflected

05:39.020 --> 05:44.200
from the surface, but some of it is also refracted through the surface.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.880
When the reflected beam and the refracted beam are at a 90 degree angle to one another,

05:48.880 --> 05:54.200
the reflected beam will be plane polarized with all of its constituent waves parallel

05:54.200 --> 05:57.440
to the orientation of the surface.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.160
And what Malus saw through his Icelandic spar sample was simply his crystal either allowing

06:03.160 --> 06:07.920
that plane polarized light through when its edge was properly aligned or blocking it from

06:07.920 --> 06:11.000
view when it was not.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.280
So here is a sample of Icelandic spar or calcite.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.360
And I have on the table in front of me a small image.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.640
Now when I look at the image without my Icelandic spar, I see, of course, a single copy.

06:23.680 --> 06:30.360
But placing the spar on top, I can see a very clear double image.

06:30.360 --> 06:35.200
The source of the double image is the fact that light of different planes of polarization

06:35.200 --> 06:39.760
is interplaying with the crystal in different ways, reflecting and reflecting, refracting

06:39.760 --> 06:42.040
at different angles.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.480
Now if there's any doubt about this, it can be easily proven using a modern polarizing

06:46.480 --> 06:49.440
filter like the one I have here.

06:49.440 --> 06:55.160
If I look down through this filter at my Icelandic spar at the image on the other side,

06:55.160 --> 07:00.600
simply rotating my plane polarizing filter, I can make one image appear and the other

07:00.600 --> 07:07.440
disappear and vice versa simply by changing the arrangement of the plane of polarization

07:07.440 --> 07:10.160
which is allowed through.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.080
This is the principle on which polarized sunglasses work.

07:19.080 --> 07:23.960
Polarized lenses like the one I just used are made by creating long, carefully oriented

07:23.960 --> 07:30.440
polymer molecules which are dyed to produce striations too small for the human eye to detect.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.200
These striations give the coating a polarizing effect.

07:34.200 --> 07:38.320
The coating is oriented on lenses so that it preferentially absorbs light which is plane

07:38.320 --> 07:41.320
polarized parallel to the ground.

07:41.320 --> 07:46.040
In other words, it reduces the amount of road or ground glare you experience in your car

07:46.040 --> 07:47.120
or on the ski slopes.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.200
So we've seen how plane polarized light can be generated by passing light through polarizing

07:55.200 --> 08:01.240
media like the Earth's atmosphere or reflecting it from a flat surface.

08:01.240 --> 08:06.560
We've also seen how it can be detected by turning a second polarizer to either block

08:06.560 --> 08:10.960
or allow the plane polarized light to pass through.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.480
But we're missing one last critical piece of the puzzle.

08:14.480 --> 08:19.000
How does plane polarized light interact with organic samples?

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
What critical questions can we answer with plane polarized light that we couldn't answer

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
otherwise?

08:25.000 --> 08:31.760
Well, our tour of optical spectroscopy techniques has taken us through UV visible spectroscopy

08:31.760 --> 08:37.640
which can be used to monitor energy difference in molecular orbital systems and IR spectroscopy

08:37.640 --> 08:41.880
which allows us to detect the presence of functional groups and also to fingerprint

08:41.880 --> 08:48.120
organic molecules using the distinctive signature vibrations of their carbon skeleton.

08:48.120 --> 08:54.480
So we have the tools to probe certain structural features of molecules with light.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.800
But we have not yet addressed the question of chirality.

08:58.800 --> 09:04.280
Of course, we know by now that chirality is a critical property of many organic molecules.

09:04.280 --> 09:09.780
From drugs like thalidomide to the proteins in your body, the profound importance of molecular

09:09.780 --> 09:15.160
handedness has been a focal point in many of our lectures.

09:15.160 --> 09:20.160
We've discussed how Chris Engel had a prolific run at characterizing the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms

09:20.160 --> 09:25.800
in the late 1920s, helping chemists to develop strategies to design syntheses which lead

09:25.800 --> 09:29.760
to products with a desired stereochemistry.

09:29.760 --> 09:34.840
But so far, we've not covered how Engel could distinguish between the two different enantiomers

09:34.840 --> 09:39.480
and determine their relative populations in an otherwise pure sample.

09:39.480 --> 09:44.720
The UV visible and infrared spectra of R and S-thalidomide, for example, are expected

09:44.720 --> 09:47.800
to look exactly the same.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.520
Of course, determining whether a product is an anti-opure or racemic or anywhere in between

09:53.520 --> 10:02.040
for that matter can be critical to our understanding of the mechanism which formed it.

10:02.040 --> 10:07.120
The key to determining the relative abundance of two enantiomers in an otherwise pure sample

10:07.120 --> 10:13.360
is a technique called polarimetry, which relies on one very interesting property of chiral

10:13.360 --> 10:15.040
molecules.

10:15.040 --> 10:21.760
They have the ability to rotate the plane of polarization in polarized light.

10:21.760 --> 10:28.280
Now, a modern polarimiter conducts an experiment not terribly different than the one conducted

10:28.280 --> 10:32.680
by Malus two hundred years ago in France, although the parts are much smaller and the

10:32.680 --> 10:36.400
lamp life is less than ten billion years like the sun.

10:36.400 --> 10:42.480
Malus used the sun as a source of light, the windows of the palace as a polarizer, a crystal

10:42.480 --> 10:48.920
of Icelandic spar as the second polarizer, and his own eyes as the detector.

10:48.920 --> 10:54.720
So the goal in our experiment is going to be to first create plane polarized light and

10:54.720 --> 10:59.200
then to determine or verify the plane of its polarization.

10:59.200 --> 11:05.560
And to do so, all we need is two pieces of polarizing media and a light beam.

11:05.560 --> 11:10.600
Now these are modern polarizing media, they're filters that can be used just like the coating

11:10.600 --> 11:12.920
of sunglasses, for example.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.240
So if I hold one of these up, you can still see through it pretty well.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.480
I'm still there, right?

11:18.480 --> 11:23.280
But the light that was going through this polarizing filter was exiting with only one plane of

11:23.280 --> 11:27.720
polarization, although of course the camera couldn't tell.

11:27.720 --> 11:31.080
So in order to tell that I've plane polarized the light that's moving through my filter

11:31.080 --> 11:35.440
from my face, I can use a second polarizer.

11:35.440 --> 11:41.480
See if I align them parallel to one another, the image makes it to the other side.

11:41.480 --> 11:49.040
But if instead I align them perpendicular, the light can't traverse the second polarizer.

11:49.040 --> 11:54.960
So if I want to know the plane of polarization, I have to rotate my second polarizer until

11:54.960 --> 11:57.560
it is properly aligned with the first.

11:57.560 --> 12:04.360
This gives me a way to actually measure and detect the plane of polarization of polarized

12:04.360 --> 12:05.760
light.

12:05.760 --> 12:12.320
Now a modern polarimeter would use some type of a source lamp rather than the sun.

12:12.320 --> 12:16.680
Frequently we use sodium lamps because they create just several different wavelengths of

12:16.680 --> 12:18.480
light themselves.

12:18.480 --> 12:23.760
Nonetheless, for our polarimetry experiment, we want only one wavelength of light to get

12:23.760 --> 12:27.200
into our experimental sample compartment.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.640
So we'll place a monochromator after the lamp.

12:30.640 --> 12:35.640
Now in our case we're going to use our monochromator to isolate just one wavelength of light known

12:35.640 --> 12:39.960
as the sodium D-line, 589 nanometers.

12:39.960 --> 12:46.280
Alright now after this I'm going to place a polarizer in line after the monochromator.

12:46.280 --> 12:52.200
The polarizer, much like the windows of the palace, ensures that only one plane of polarization

12:52.200 --> 12:55.000
makes it into my sample compartment.

12:55.000 --> 13:03.200
So at this point we have plane polarized light of a single wavelength and countering a sample.

13:03.200 --> 13:11.120
The path of the beam finally passes through a second polarizer on its way to a detector.

13:11.120 --> 13:16.280
So if there's no change in the orientation of the plane of polarization, the rotational

13:16.280 --> 13:23.400
position of the second polarizer will have to be exactly the same as the first polarizer

13:23.480 --> 13:27.760
to maximize the amount of light reaching the detector.

13:27.760 --> 13:32.680
So if we were to rotate the second polarizer, when the flash of light is observed by the

13:32.680 --> 13:41.680
detector, we know that the plane of polarization of light exiting the spectrometer can be measured.

13:41.680 --> 13:50.280
Now, small organic molecules in solution aren't aligned like polymer strands in sunglasses

13:50.280 --> 13:51.780
though.

13:51.780 --> 13:56.900
Instead they tumble and move randomly, so they do not preferentially absorb plane polarized

13:56.900 --> 13:59.300
light like a pair of sunglasses.

13:59.300 --> 14:04.700
They do however interact with plane polarized light in a different way.

14:04.700 --> 14:11.400
See chiral molecules have the very interesting ability to rotate plane polarized light.

14:11.400 --> 14:16.580
As a plane polarized light beam of a specific wavelength passes through a chiral sample,

14:16.580 --> 14:22.260
the plane of polarization rotates so that when the beam exits the sample, the plane

14:22.260 --> 14:26.380
of polarization has a new orientation.

14:26.380 --> 14:30.820
So let's go back to the polarimeter.

14:30.820 --> 14:35.740
So here we have my operating polarimeter where my lamp monochromator and polarizer generate

14:35.740 --> 14:42.180
my monochromatic plane polarized light which traverse an empty compartment and exit through

14:42.180 --> 14:47.820
another polarizer which is oriented in exactly the same angle as the first, so my detector

14:47.820 --> 14:53.100
is firing away letting me know that the plane polarized light is getting through.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.740
Now let's place a sample in our polarimeter.

14:55.740 --> 15:00.500
Now placing a sample inside my polarimeter means that the beam will rotate, the plane

15:00.500 --> 15:04.260
of polarization, now the beam itself is still going straight, but the plane of polarization

15:04.260 --> 15:06.600
of my beam is rotating.

15:06.600 --> 15:12.160
That means that my instrument has to rotate the second polarizer to let the exiting light

15:12.160 --> 15:15.320
get through and reach the detector.

15:15.320 --> 15:20.000
So my instrument has rotated that second polarizer until the detector sees a maximum intensity

15:20.000 --> 15:22.280
of light.

15:22.280 --> 15:26.840
We call the angle between the initial and final planes of polarization alpha.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.500
This is the measured optical rotation and it's very simply measured by taking the first

15:30.500 --> 15:38.240
polarizer and the second polarizer and comparing the angle in between the two.

15:38.240 --> 15:44.220
We call this ability of chiral molecules to rotate plane polarized light optical activity

15:44.220 --> 15:49.100
and just as the ability to absorb light is an intrinsic property of a compound, so is

15:49.100 --> 15:51.560
its optical activity.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.860
This is to say that a given chiral compound rotates a certain wavelength of light by a

15:55.860 --> 15:58.900
known and constant amount.

15:58.900 --> 16:05.020
We call this the specific rotation of a compound and usually label it as a bracketed alpha

16:05.020 --> 16:09.740
with 20 and d annotations indicating that we're talking about the specific rotation

16:09.740 --> 16:15.660
of a compound at 20 degrees centigrade and in reference to that sodium d emission line

16:15.660 --> 16:20.540
which is 589 nanometers.

16:20.540 --> 16:24.860
So our observations so far lead us to derive an equation which is very similar to Beer's

16:24.860 --> 16:26.420
law.

16:26.420 --> 16:31.460
Just as absorbance is equal to the extinction coefficient times the path length times the

16:31.460 --> 16:37.820
concentration in Beer's law, so rotation of an enantiopure sample is equal to its specific

16:37.820 --> 16:43.140
rotation times the path length times concentration.

16:43.140 --> 16:50.260
So if I have a solution of 1 gram of enantiopure R-camper dissolved in 1 milliliter of solvent

16:50.260 --> 16:57.300
in a 1 decimeter cell, knowing camper's specific rotation of 44.4 degrees per gram per mill

16:57.300 --> 17:05.580
decimeter allows me to calculate that I should see a rotation of 44 degrees clockwise.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.080
Fantastic.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.980
So let's say that I do just that with a pure sample of camphor.

17:09.980 --> 17:17.140
I place the sample in the polarimeter, I collect my reading and the rotation is only 22 degrees.

17:17.140 --> 17:18.860
So what just happened here?

17:18.860 --> 17:24.900
I have pure camphor, but the observed rotation is less than the calculated rotation.

17:24.900 --> 17:31.020
Well what's going on here is that there's another form of camphor, the Esenantiomer,

17:31.020 --> 17:36.780
which rotates plain polarized light with equal efficiency but in the opposite direction because

17:36.780 --> 17:40.180
of its handedness.

17:40.180 --> 17:43.460
So this is where polarimetry deviates from Beer's law.

17:43.460 --> 17:48.620
You see in UV visible spectroscopy, there are no anti-absorbers which re-emit light

17:48.620 --> 17:54.860
absorbed by their counterparts thus cancelling them out, but in polarimetry there is such

17:54.860 --> 17:58.940
a counterpart, the other enantiomer of the compound.

17:58.940 --> 18:05.440
So for every degree that our camphor molecule rotates plain polarized D-line light and S-camphor

18:05.440 --> 18:13.260
rotates it back to the opposite direction to the same extent undoing that rotation.

18:13.260 --> 18:18.540
This explains why a pure sample of camphor may rotate plain polarized light less than

18:18.540 --> 18:20.260
expected.

18:20.260 --> 18:25.580
We have to include a term in our equation which accounts for the opposing rotation of

18:25.580 --> 18:28.540
the minor enantiomer.

18:28.540 --> 18:34.300
Now both terms of the equation share the same optical rotation and path length.

18:34.300 --> 18:39.040
So we can separate these algebraically and arrive at an equation which works for samples

18:39.040 --> 18:45.200
of a compound which aren't enantiopure.

18:45.200 --> 18:50.600
Here we have observed rotation equal to the specific rotation of the compound times the

18:50.600 --> 18:57.960
path length times the difference in concentrations between R and S enantiomers.

18:57.960 --> 19:03.200
This difference is also called the enantiomeric excess.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.460
Journal articles covering chiral synthesis will always include a measure of the enantiomeric

19:07.460 --> 19:14.020
excess of the desired chiral product reported as a percentage simply calculated by dividing

19:14.020 --> 19:21.960
the observed rotation by the calculated rotation and multiplying by 100%.

19:21.960 --> 19:27.320
Now it's worth pausing here to note that the enantiomeric excess of one stereoisomer

19:27.320 --> 19:31.420
is not the same as its total abundance in the sample.

19:31.420 --> 19:36.180
In our sample we had an observed rotation of 22 degrees and a calculated rotation of

19:36.180 --> 19:38.200
44 degrees.

19:38.200 --> 19:47.060
This makes the enantiomeric excess or EE of the R camphor in our sample 50%.

19:47.060 --> 19:54.240
But the total amount of R camphor in our sample is that excess plus half of the remainder

19:54.240 --> 19:58.840
since the remaining 50% of our sample were molecules of camphor which were canceling

19:58.840 --> 20:01.180
one another out.

20:01.180 --> 20:08.380
So the total abundance of the R enantiomer is 50% plus one half of the remaining 50%

20:08.380 --> 20:12.880
for a total of 75% R enantiomer.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.620
Now in general when organic chemists report their results in an article it's assumed

20:16.620 --> 20:20.960
that the reader can conduct this manipulation on their own so we usually see just a report

20:20.960 --> 20:26.800
of EE and not one of total abundance.

20:26.800 --> 20:31.860
The technique of polarimetry had early and profound influence on the link between chirality

20:31.860 --> 20:34.640
and biological systems.

20:34.640 --> 20:41.240
Louis Pasteur famously used this technique in 1848 to analyze tartaric acid salt crystals

20:41.240 --> 20:44.280
isolated from wine.

20:44.280 --> 20:49.320
Pasteur's experiments showed very clearly that biologically sourced tartaric acid had

20:49.320 --> 20:52.740
the ability to rotate plain polarized light.

20:52.740 --> 20:58.540
But tartaric acid synthesized in the laboratory did not.

20:58.540 --> 21:03.140
So in fact what was going on here was the term racemic was coined this way because it

21:03.140 --> 21:07.300
refers to an equal mixture of enantiomers and it's derived from the Latin for bunch

21:07.300 --> 21:12.860
of grapes because of this observation, a testament to the role of tartaric acid in our understanding

21:12.860 --> 21:16.740
of chirality.

21:16.740 --> 21:22.240
This lack of optical activity was a conundrum which led Pasteur to take a very, very close

21:22.240 --> 21:26.620
look at synthetic tartaric acid.

21:26.620 --> 21:33.700
When he did he noticed that carefully crystallized tartaric acid actually forms two different

21:33.700 --> 21:36.660
shapes of crystals.

21:36.660 --> 21:41.540
It was only when he painstakingly separated these crystals into two different groups by

21:41.540 --> 21:49.480
hand that he could recover the optical activity of tartaric acid.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.940
Examples of one shape could be combined to produce the optical activity of the tartrates

21:52.940 --> 21:57.660
recovered from wine production and the other, quite interestingly, though not surprising

21:57.660 --> 22:02.020
to us now, showed equal and opposite activity.

22:02.020 --> 22:06.020
So this may be the very first example of a chiral separation.

22:06.020 --> 22:10.900
Fortunately, we have better methods today than tweezers and careful observation that

22:10.900 --> 22:13.140
Pasteur had to use.

22:13.140 --> 22:18.580
But all of these methods find their origins in Pasteur's realization that the same compound

22:18.580 --> 22:27.600
can have two equal but opposite, optically active forms or enantiomers.

22:27.600 --> 22:32.720
But polarimetry has contributed even more to our understanding of organic reactions.

22:32.720 --> 22:37.520
One classic example of this is the work of Saul Winston, a Canadian chemist with a deep

22:37.520 --> 22:40.400
interest in carbocation.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.840
Winston spent much of his career investigating situations in which this familiar reaction

22:44.840 --> 22:51.020
intermediate seemed to act in ways that it shouldn't.

22:51.020 --> 22:55.740
One of these situations takes place in certain SN1 reactions.

22:55.740 --> 23:01.940
Winston used polarimetry to recognize that not all SN1 reactions proceeded with a total

23:01.940 --> 23:07.780
loss of stereochemistry, even though most of them in fact do.

23:07.780 --> 23:13.660
Winston was able to show, using polarimetry, that the same SN1 solvalysis reaction run

23:13.660 --> 23:18.960
on a chiral substrate in solvents of differing polarity not only proceeds at differing rates

23:18.960 --> 23:22.520
but with differing degrees of racemization.

23:22.520 --> 23:27.200
This is to say that a chiral substrate might produce a racemic product when reacted in

23:27.200 --> 23:33.240
higher polarity solvents, but with maybe a 50% EE when run in lower polarity environments

23:33.240 --> 23:38.000
in which a carbocation ion would be less stable.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.700
This led Winston to theorize the existence of concerted ion pairs in certain reactions,

23:44.700 --> 23:49.860
in which positively charged carbocation ions and negatively charged leaving groups still

23:49.860 --> 23:57.180
form but stay close to one another in what he called an intimate ion pair.

23:57.180 --> 24:03.380
So if a nucleophile attacks before the ion pair fully separates in space, the leaving

24:03.380 --> 24:09.320
group, though detached, can still block the face of the carbocation from which it came.

24:09.320 --> 24:14.720
Now this explains the lack of total racemization in a reaction showing SN1 kinetics, and it

24:14.720 --> 24:20.480
changed our way of thinking about the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms.

24:20.480 --> 24:25.560
See thanks to Winston's work and the technique of polarimetry, we realize now that nucleophilic

24:25.560 --> 24:33.360
substitution mechanisms are not necessarily an idealized SN1 or SN2, but rather a continuous

24:33.540 --> 24:40.060
continuum of mechanisms ranging from the classical SN1 with total racemization through SN1 involving

24:40.060 --> 24:46.500
ion pairs and having partial conservation of chirality to classical SN2 with complete retention

24:46.500 --> 24:50.500
of chirality.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.220
So let's review what we've covered today.

24:53.220 --> 24:58.540
We started with a bit of history, discussing how Etienne-Louis-Malus is often credited for

24:58.560 --> 25:03.640
first observing plane polarization of light from the sun using a palace window and a piece

25:03.640 --> 25:09.120
of Icelandic spar as polarizers, although Viking navigators may have actually beaten

25:09.120 --> 25:14.360
him to it by about 2,000 years.

25:14.360 --> 25:20.160
We saw how modern polarimeters operate on the same basic principles as in Malus's experiment,

25:20.160 --> 25:26.120
but the wavelength and plane polarization of the analytical beam are more controlled.

25:26.120 --> 25:31.660
We investigated the ability of chiral molecules to rotate plane polarized light, and we saw

25:31.660 --> 25:38.260
how their specific rotation is equal and opposite for two enantiomers of the same compound.

25:38.260 --> 25:43.020
It's this equal and opposite relationship which allows us to observe the optical rotation

25:43.020 --> 25:48.460
in an otherwise pure sample, comparing it to the calculated optical rotation of the sample

25:48.460 --> 25:53.460
to determine the enantiomeric axis, remembering that the enantiomeric axis is not the same

25:53.460 --> 25:56.440
as total abundance.

25:56.440 --> 26:02.760
Finally, we took a look at the work of Louis Pasteur and Saul Winsteyn, two scientists

26:02.760 --> 26:08.440
separated by a century, but both of whom were able to draw critical inferences about chirality

26:08.440 --> 26:15.440
in organic compounds by observing the interaction of plane polarized light with those compounds.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.120
Next time, we will move to yet another region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

26:22.620 --> 26:27.700
We're going to take a look at the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance, and how tiny

26:27.700 --> 26:34.180
atom-sized magnets in organic molecules interact with radio waves, and one another, to produce

26:34.180 --> 26:39.260
an effect which has become one of the gold standard identification tools of modern organic

26:39.260 --> 26:40.260
chemistry.

26:40.260 --> 26:41.260
I'll see you then.
