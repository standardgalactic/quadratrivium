0	17840	Last time we started considering how spectroscopists use light as a means of probing the structure
17840	20440	and behavior of molecular systems.
20440	25120	Specifically, we took a look at the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic
25120	31040	spectrum and how radiation of this energy is perfectly suited to excite electrons from
31040	36120	one molecular orbital to another, giving us a way to probe the energetics of these kinds
36120	37520	of systems.
37520	42200	Today, we're going to take a look at the red end of the visible spectrum and what lies
42200	44720	beyond that.
44720	50880	Just like UV light, infrared light from the sun is constantly bombarding us.
50880	55760	Like UV light, though, infrared light isn't associated with any particularly dangerous
55760	58240	health effects.
58240	63480	Infrared is still a very interesting part of the electromagnetic spectrum, though.
63480	68580	Objects at or near room temperature naturally emit this wavelength of light, and that includes
68580	70080	you.
70080	72800	Believe it or not, you glow in the dark.
72800	76760	The catch is that you glow in the dark at too long of a wavelength to be detected by
76760	78720	the human eye.
78720	84480	Now, scientists like those at NASA have developed cameras and telescopes capable of detecting
84480	90920	the infrared emissions of both small objects here on Earth and of celestial bodies on the
90920	96080	other side of the known universe, creating false color images like these in which the
96080	103080	detected infrared light has been shown as different colors.
103080	106240	But infrared light isn't just radiated.
106240	111680	Like all other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, it can also be absorbed.
111680	117240	And just as a warm object cools by radiating energy as I are light, so can an object be
117240	120000	warmed by absorbing it.
120000	125080	Now, last time I made it sound like Ritter was stricken with a divine inspiration to
125080	128680	look outside the blue end of the visible spectrum.
128680	134000	But in fact, his experiment was almost certainly inspired by one conducted earlier that year
134000	140400	by another English scientist, Sir William Herschel.
140400	146800	Herschel was a prolific astronomer, a composer and a mathematician, a true Renaissance man.
146800	152800	And he was the one who made a truly inspired discovery when he asked a simple question,
152800	159160	which color of light is most effective at heating a surface when shined on it?
159160	164360	To answer this question, he used a prism to diffract sunlight into a spectrum and placed
164360	172760	thermometers with blackened bulbs at regular intervals within that spectrum.
172760	178720	So let's bring up this IR spectrum, or visible spectrum, with infrared just outside of it.
178720	184840	So Herschel saw that the temperature indicated by his thermometers increased across the spectrum,
184840	187680	from blue to red.
187680	192440	And knowing what we do about the amount of energy contained in photons of different wavelengths,
192440	195520	it might seem a little bit counterintuitive at first.
195520	200880	But Herschel essentially proved that red light is absorbed more efficiently by objects that
200880	203420	are near room temperature.
203420	208840	But the pertinent result of Herschel's experiment wasn't the trend he saw in the visible spectrum.
208840	213360	His real breakthrough came when he wondered if the trend continued beyond the spectrum
213360	215400	that he could see.
215400	221320	And sure enough, when he placed another thermometer just beyond the red portion of the spectrum,
221320	226920	it read an even higher temperature than the one in the red light.
226920	233680	Clearly, there was some form of light beyond the red portion of the spectrum, prompting
233680	239120	him to call his new discovery, infrared light.
239120	244280	Today we're going to take a look at how modern scientists use Herschel's discovery to probe
244280	249840	the structures of organic compounds and make new discoveries today more than 200 years
249840	253360	after its initial discovery.
253360	257640	Modern spectroscopy in the infrared region is conducted using instruments very similar
257640	260760	to those used for the UV visible.
260760	264920	The simplest of these will follow the same format, starting with a light source, but
264920	269640	in this case a light source which emits powerful infrared light.
269640	274320	That light will again go through a monochromator which will selectively direct one wavelength
274320	277080	at a time through a beam splitter.
277080	282920	The beam splitter will split the beam into two, giving us two different beams of infrared
282920	288120	light, one traversing a reference cell, one traversing a sample cell which is exactly
288120	294160	the same but contains one additive and that's the molecules that we want to analyze.
294160	298880	As the beams exit, their intensities are measured by two detectors and compared.
298880	303960	Now there are much more sophisticated apparatus, but this is the simplest way to conduct and
303960	307480	therefore to understand infrared.
307480	314240	Okay, so now that we know how scientists shine infrared light on samples and measure which
314240	319880	wavelengths of light are absorbed, but we still need to try to understand exactly why
319880	321840	anyone would want to do such a thing.
325160	330400	Now to explain this, I want to show you a molecule called fluorinone on the big screen
330400	334880	here using my ChemDraw Chem3D software.
334880	338800	Now we're used to seeing molecules in this kind of configuration when we see them in
338800	341760	textbooks and papers.
341760	346080	Notice that all of the bond lengths and angles are identical and ideal.
346080	349400	The molecule appears perfectly planar.
349400	354120	Every bond in my benzene rings is exactly 120 degrees.
354120	357160	Everything looks exactly as it should, right?
357160	359240	But do molecules really look like this?
359240	360760	Do they really act like this?
360760	363120	Are they rigid, unmoving, and symmetrical?
363120	365720	No, of course not.
365720	371440	This representation is done using average bond angles and average bond lengths of a dynamic
371440	373240	set of bonds.
373240	378320	They really look more like this.
378320	383280	What's running right now is a dynamic simulation which approximates the random motions of each
383280	385680	atom within a molecule.
385680	390320	The bonds between and among those atoms are stretching, bending and twisting in many different
390320	391320	ways.
391320	395400	Just put more simply, bonds vibrate.
395400	398320	They don't all vibrate in the same way either.
398320	404440	Notice that the carbon-oxygen bond is oscillating very slowly compared to some of those carbon-hydrogen
404440	405880	bonds.
405960	410960	If you watch for a while, you can see not only individual bonds stretching and compressing,
410960	415840	but other sets of bonds are opening and closing like scissors and even twisting.
415840	422200	This is really evident when I turn the molecule to look at it edge-on.
422200	426320	Instead of being perfectly flat and planar, you'll notice that some of the vibrations
426320	432320	cause the molecule to flex and twist in and out of the plane that we usually use to represent
432320	434820	it.
434840	442540	Let me stop my simulation now and bring my molecule back to its idealized state.
442540	447220	So we're used to seeing the molecules drawn in this way, but to the eyes of a seasoned
447220	450900	chemist, it's apparent that they really aren't like this.
450900	455900	When it comes to actually modeling how molecules behave, we have to learn how to think of a
455900	463340	picture like this in terms of that animation that we saw previously.
463340	467760	In order to understand infrared spectroscopy, we need to begin to think of molecules in
467760	473220	terms of that dynamic model that I just showed you, rather than the rigid, idealized structures
473220	475580	that are so often depicted.
475580	479800	So let's begin breaking this down by looking at a set of much simpler molecules and how
479800	481300	they behave.
481300	487660	First, let's consider carbon monoxide, two atoms joined by a triple bond.
487660	493100	Now with only two atoms, there's only one possible bond vibration which can take place,
493100	496220	a stretching between the atoms.
496220	500700	But what if we move on to carbon dioxide, a molecule with three atoms?
500700	508980	Well, now we can conceive of vibrations involving a symmetrical stretch, an asymmetrical stretch,
508980	513900	a symmetrical bend, and an asymmetrical bend.
513900	522540	So there are actually four different ways in which a CO2 molecule can vibrate.
522540	527100	If we continue adding atoms, we find that the total number of these vibrations, which
527100	533820	we call vibrational modes, is equal to 3n minus 5, where n is the number of atoms in
533820	540040	a linear molecule, or 3n minus 6 for nonlinear molecules.
540040	544660	So this means that for a compound as simple as methane, we expect to find nine different
544660	549020	types of vibrations going on within that molecule.
549020	554060	Carbon has 24, and even more complex molecules like fluorinone have dozens or even hundreds
554060	561980	of vibrational modes, each with their own distinct frequency.
561980	567260	So we've now covered how IR spectroscopy is conducted, and the vibration of bonds and
567260	570100	sets of bonds in organic molecules.
570100	574660	And I'm sure by now you're wondering, what is it that brings these two apparently disparate
574660	577940	concepts together?
577940	579620	The answer is this.
579620	584900	Many bond vibrational frequencies are the same as those of infrared light.
584900	589420	And just as electronic transitions could be promoted by just the right photon in a UV
589420	594620	visible experiment, so can transitions in the vibrations of a molecule be introduced
594620	600260	by just the right infrared photon.
600260	605260	When a bond vibrating in a particular frequency encounters a photon of identical frequency,
605260	610100	that photon can be absorbed, increasing the amplitude of the associated vibration in
610100	612300	the process.
612300	616700	This is the absorption which is measured by the spectrophotometer.
616700	620860	Now the frequencies which correspond to the vibrations of bonds in organic molecules
620860	625500	are on the order of billions of cycles per second, or billions of hertz, much faster
625500	628820	than the model I showed you.
628820	632500	This produces some pretty unwieldy numbers for frequency, of course.
632500	638100	So in IR spectroscopy, we instead use a unit called wave numbers.
638100	643940	A wave number is simply the reciprocal of a photon's wavelength in centimeters.
643940	650020	For example, light with a wavelength of 5 microns, or .0005 centimeters, which is a
650020	659580	typical IR wavelength, will have a wave number of 2000, 2000 reciprocal centimeters.
659580	664100	Of course, as you might imagine, we have a pretty good idea of the vibrational frequencies
664100	667660	of different types of bonds near room temperatures.
667660	670620	It's actually easier to predict than you might think.
670620	676860	You simply have to think of atoms and bonds as though they were weights and springs.
676860	679060	Let me demonstrate this for you.
679060	684980	If I connect a set of light weights by a fairly stiff spring and give it some energy, the
684980	689380	vibrational frequency is expected to be fairly high.
689380	693620	And this is because the light weights have only a small amount of momentum which is easily
693620	700460	overcome by the strong spring in order to reverse the masses direction.
700460	705580	Of course, right now we have nothing to compare this to, so let's make a change and connect
705580	709280	a heavier weight to the same kind of spring.
709280	713620	You see that the spring needs more time to overcome the greater momentum of the larger
713620	720020	weight, causing the frequency of the oscillation to be lower.
720020	725100	I can also alter the frequency by adjusting the stiffness of the spring.
725100	729580	For example, connecting similar weights to a stronger spring means that the spring can
729580	734020	overcome the momentum of those weights more easily and reverse the motion of the mass
734020	736260	more quickly.
736260	741900	So we've increased the vibrational frequency in this case.
741900	747500	So larger masses and weaker springs lead to slower vibrations.
747500	752660	If we translate this phenomenon from the macroscopic example of weights and springs to the molecular
752660	759720	level, atoms would be our weights and the chemical bonds between them would be our springs.
759720	765020	We would say that larger atoms and weaker bonds lead to slower vibrations.
765020	770180	In other words, a C-H bond should vibrate faster than a carbonyl bond, which should
770180	774220	vibrate faster than a carbon-oxygen ether bond.
774220	781300	In fact, this is exactly what we see in IR spectroscopy.
781300	785220	Now there's one more catch to the science of IR spectroscopy.
785220	788220	It's known as the IR Selection Rule.
788220	794100	Now the IR Selection Rule states simply this, that a vibrating bond or set of bonds can only
794100	799820	absorb a photon of the same frequency if that vibration causes a change in the dipole of
799820	801680	the molecule.
801680	805420	No dipole change means no absorption.
805420	811420	Strong dipole change means a strong absorption.
811420	816380	So it should come as no surprise that functional groups which usually have strong dipoles in
816380	823300	their bonds are often powerful IR absorbers, while less reactive bonds like alkyl C-H bonds
823300	828660	tend to absorb very weakly or sometimes not even at all.
828660	833380	Now you've probably noticed that most functional groups contain good strong polar bonds to
833380	839700	at least one hydrogen or double and triple bonds among larger atoms, sometimes both.
839700	845020	So the signatures associated with the most common functional groups in infrared are typically
845020	851660	found at higher frequency regions of the spectrum, whereas the vibrations within the skeleton
851660	861380	tend to have absorptions in the lower frequency region of the spectrum on the other side.
861380	866620	The few but distinct absorptions caused by functional groups leads us to define the higher
866620	871860	frequency region of the IR spectrum as the functional group region, because it's often
871860	875460	where we find the information we need to catalog which functional groups are present in the
875460	878780	sample and which are not.
878780	882540	What this region tells us very little about the carbon-carbon bonds within the scaffold
882540	888540	of the molecule, which is usually fairly large with many complex vibrational modes.
888540	893340	Too many to consider individually, but these types of molecular vibrations tend to have
893340	898460	lower frequency IR absorptions, so we've labeled that region of the spectrum, the fingerprint
898460	904700	region, for the fact that its complexity makes it difficult to interpret but unique to each
904700	906260	molecule which generates it.
909620	915340	So, let's take a look at a few IR spectra and see if we can make sense of the information
915340	920980	that they contain, starting with the functional group region of some common hydrocarbons.
920980	925300	Let's take a look at three different hydrocarbons with which we're very familiar.
925300	933500	The saturated hydrocarbon pentane, one pentene, a terminal alkyne, and one pentine, a terminal
933500	934800	alkyne.
934800	938420	So these molecules are all very similar to one another structurally with one distinct
938420	945420	difference, that difference being that the degree of saturation or unsaturation is changing.
945420	950540	So let's begin by taking a look at the infrared spectrum of pentane.
950540	955020	Now we've taken these spectra from a database called the AIST database.
955020	958980	They're available online free of charge, so if you'd like to check them out for yourself,
958980	961140	be sure that you find the URL and have a look.
961140	966060	It's a very, very broad database with lots of really good data to see, certainly more
966060	967820	than I'm going to show you today.
967820	969620	So let's start with pentane again.
969620	970860	Here's my structure.
970860	974940	It's a simple hydrocarbon consisting only of carbon-carbon single bonds and carbon-hydrogen
974940	980740	single bonds, so I expect to see primarily evidence of those kinds of bonds in the molecule.
980740	985140	Now looking at the functional group region, which is over here on the left-hand side at
985140	990220	my higher frequencies and therefore higher wave numbers, I see that there's a very strong
990220	998380	absorbance at about 2900 wave numbers, and this is a classic signature for an SP3 hybridized
998380	1001780	carbon-hydrogen bond.
1001780	1005780	The rest of this is the fingerprint of the molecule, which corresponds to the backbone
1005780	1008540	atoms and their particular vibrations.
1008540	1013780	So this is a very simple infrared spectrum of a very simple hydrocarbon and a great place
1013780	1015820	to start.
1015940	1021980	When I move to one pentane, I'm going to introduce a few changes to the molecule, most notably
1021980	1027740	the hybridization of two of the carbon atoms which bear CH bonds.
1027740	1033100	By changing their hybridization state from an SP3 to an SP2, I'm going to increase the
1033100	1037780	S character of those bonds, and that means that I'm going to make them a little bit tighter,
1037780	1043460	a little bit tougher, and that means their frequency should increase ever so slightly.
1043460	1047340	So let's keep our eyes on the functional group region as I switch my spectrum over from
1047340	1050340	pentane to one pentane.
1053340	1058980	Here it is, a classic signature of an SP2 CH bond.
1058980	1065500	I now have an absorption not only at 2900 wave numbers corresponding to my SP3 hybridized
1065500	1071420	carbon-hydrogen bonds, but I also have a new absorption, which is taking place at about
1071460	1074140	3100 wave numbers.
1074140	1078420	Now remember, my axis here is transmittance, so my peaks are actually valleys.
1078420	1082020	So the lower the spectrum goes, the stronger the absorption is.
1082020	1087260	Okay, so let's move on to one pentane after we think for just a moment about what kind
1087260	1091140	of change we expect to see in the functional group region.
1091140	1095580	I'm going to be changing the hybridization state of at least two of my atoms here.
1095580	1099380	These two are going to go from SP2 to SP3.
1100380	1104860	Excuse me, they're going to go from SP2 to SP, and that means they'll have even more
1104860	1106260	S-character.
1106260	1111100	And having even more S-character means I expect to see, that's right, an infrared absorption
1111100	1113140	at an even higher frequency.
1113140	1117340	So let's make that change now.
1117340	1123540	Sure enough, here is my absorption at about 3300 wave numbers, a perfect signature for
1123580	1129580	an SP-hybridized carbon-hydrogen bond, just like the one I have in one pentane.
1132780	1137420	But remember, we talked about the importance of polarity and how IR is a great tool for
1137420	1141260	probing the structures and presence of functional groups.
1141260	1145380	So let's put some more functional groups in and see what happens to our IR spectra.
1145380	1149380	Let's compare one pentanol to pentanoic acid.
1149380	1154380	Both compounds, which we know, have very polar CO and OH bonds.
1156380	1162380	Well, the IR spectrum of one pentanol has a very clear signature for an OH.
1162380	1165380	It's this large, broad peak here.
1165380	1170220	Now the peak is fairly broad because OHs have a tendency to hydrogen bond to one another
1170220	1173420	and exchange back and forth between and among molecules.
1173420	1176980	And so this broadens their peaks out a little bit because their chemical environments can
1176980	1178980	change as the experiment progresses.
1178980	1181980	Nonetheless, I can see it very clearly here.
1181980	1186980	And on top of that peak, I can also see my SP3 carbon hydrogens.
1186980	1192980	So what I have here is a very obvious functional group region for an aliphatic alcohol.
1192980	1199980	Now if I make a slight change here and oxidize my one pentanol down to pentanoic acid, let's see what happens.
1202980	1205980	Okay, two changes that we can point to directly.
1205980	1209980	The first of which is that the OH peak has gotten broader,
1209980	1217980	and also that this very large absorbance has come into my spectrum at around 1700 wave numbers.
1217980	1226980	So we can easily explain this broadness here by, again, the exchange of my OH bond from the pentanoic acid,
1226980	1230980	not the bond itself, mind you, but the hydrogen being exchanged.
1230980	1236980	But what's causing the really, really powerful absorbance here at 1700 at a lower frequency?
1236980	1239980	That's the presence of a carbonyl.
1239980	1245980	Heavier carbon and oxygen atoms lead to lower frequency vibrations in that particular bond.
1245980	1250980	So once again, my functional group region has given me a very clear signal here.
1250980	1254980	I have an aliphatic organic acid.
1255980	1260980	Let's continue and do a few more functional groups.
1260980	1265980	How about the IR of ketones and esters, some more carbonyl-containing compounds?
1265980	1270980	Now we should be able to use what we know so far to get a rough idea of what these will look like.
1273980	1277980	Two pentanone is a very clean IR spectrum here.
1277980	1282980	Obviously aliphatic because we have strong absorptions here at about 2900.
1282980	1287980	Now the strong absorption isn't because the carbon-hydrogen bond is very polar actually.
1287980	1291980	The strong absorption is because there are so many of those bonds in the molecule.
1291980	1297980	But in addition to that, I have my carbonyl absorbing at about 1700 wave numbers.
1297980	1303980	So this is a very obvious functional group region for an aliphatic ketone.
1303980	1308980	It shares some of its features in common with my organic acids,
1308980	1312980	but it's missing the critical OH signal which would tell me it's an acid.
1312980	1317980	So you need to think in terms of not only what's present in your spectrum when you're doing an analysis,
1317980	1319980	but also what's not there.
1319980	1324980	The absence of peaks can be just as informative as the presence.
1324980	1330980	Now let's move on to butyl acetate, an ester compound.
1330980	1336980	Very similar, isn't it, to two pentanone, sp3CHs, and my carbonyl.
1336980	1340980	But there's another very strong absorbance which is working its way down into the fingerprint region.
1340980	1343980	But it's so strong that I can easily pick it out.
1343980	1344980	It's right here.
1344980	1352980	And this is one of the absorbances which is commonly caused by the presence of a carbon-oxygen single bond.
1352980	1357980	Remember double bonds are stronger so they create a higher frequency vibration.
1357980	1362980	Carbon-oxygen single bonds would be weaker but have the same sized atoms.
1362980	1365980	Therefore we see a lower frequency vibration.
1367980	1370980	One last look at the fingerprint region.
1370980	1374980	Let's take a look at the IR of amines, amines.
1374980	1380980	I'm going to compare a primary, secondary, and tertiary amine here.
1380980	1384980	First let's look at the primary amine, pentalamine.
1384980	1387980	Again, easily seen as an aliphatic.
1387980	1395980	And we also have two absorptions that are slightly higher in frequency than my aliphatic sp3CHs.
1395980	1398980	And those aren't from an alkyne proton.
1398980	1401980	Those are from the NH protons here.
1401980	1405980	This is from an asymmetric stretch and symmetric stretch mode.
1405980	1409980	In other words, it's the interpretive dance portion of the course now.
1409980	1415980	In other words, if you think of my head as a nitrogen atom and my hands as being the hydrogens,
1415980	1420980	there are two vibrational modes there because two hydrogen atoms means they can vibrate symmetrically
1421980	1425980	or asymmetrically relative to the nitrogen.
1425980	1429980	Hence two peaks in the NH region of my spectrum.
1429980	1435980	But what if instead I have a secondary amine like N-methylbutylamine?
1435980	1438980	Well let's watch the spectrum change.
1441980	1445980	A lot of similarity there in the functional group region but one very crucial change.
1445980	1449980	There is only one absorbance now in the NH region of the spectrum.
1449980	1455980	So this tells me that there's only a single NH and therefore only a single vibrational mode,
1455980	1458980	only a single stretching mode, which can appear.
1458980	1460980	And the trend continues.
1460980	1468980	If I move on to a tertiary amine like ethyl diisopropylamine, let's take a look at the spectrum.
1468980	1472980	Again, the functional group region looks very similar to the others,
1472980	1477980	except that there are now no NH stretches to be found whatsoever.
1477980	1484980	So we can not only detect the presence of amines, but we can detect whether they're primary, secondary, or tertiary,
1484980	1487980	simply using the functional group region of the spectrum.
1487980	1494980	So the high frequency region of the IR spectrum tells us about the presence or absence of functional groups.
1494980	1496980	But what about that lower frequency region?
1496980	1503980	If it's so complex that it defies dissection, why do we bother to collect that information?
1503980	1507980	Well, we call the low frequency region of the spectrum the fingerprint region,
1507980	1512980	because just like fingerprints, the complex set of vibrations within the skeleton of a molecule
1512980	1518980	give it a complex pattern in this region, which is unique to that particular molecule.
1518980	1522980	So just as a fingerprint can be compared to a reference to identify its owner,
1522980	1529980	so can the fingerprint region of an IR spectrum be compared to a standard to identify a molecule.
1529980	1534980	Let's work through a quick example here to see if I can illustrate my point.
1534980	1540980	I'm going to show you the IR spectra of four different aliphatic esters.
1540980	1547980	Butylacetate, isobutylacetate, secbutylacetate, and tbutylacetate.
1547980	1551980	All of these have the same molecular formula, and they all have the same kinds of bonds,
1551980	1557980	carbon-carbon singles, carbon-hydrogen singles, carbonyls, and carbon-oxygen singles.
1557980	1563980	So when we look at the functional group region of these molecules and try to tell them apart,
1563980	1566980	we're going to be a little disappointed.
1566980	1568980	Let's start with butylacetate.
1568980	1572980	We can break down the spectrum very easily.
1572980	1578980	2,900 wave numbers means it's aliphatic, lots of carbon-hydrogen bonds with sp3 carbons,
1578980	1584980	clear presence of a carbonyl, and also the clear presence of a CO single bond.
1584980	1587980	But what about all these other little absorptions in here?
1587980	1589980	Are they really useless?
1589980	1590980	No, they're not.
1590980	1594980	Because when I switch my spectrum from butylacetate to isobutylacetate,
1594980	1601980	I want you to keep your eye on the functional group region the first time.
1601980	1603980	Hardly anything has changed.
1603980	1609980	So looking at this from a functional group region perspective, the two spectra appear almost identical.
1609980	1613980	Let me go back again to butylacetate.
1613980	1618980	All the same maxima, all the same peaks, and essentially the same frequencies.
1618980	1620980	So could we tell them apart from one another?
1620980	1624980	And the answer, of course, is yes, as long as I have a reference spectrum.
1624980	1628980	If I know the specific pattern that occurs in the functional group region,
1628980	1632980	take a look at this now as I change the fingerprint region, excuse me.
1632980	1639980	Take a look at the fingerprint region as I switch the spectrum back to isobutylacetate once more.
1639980	1641980	We see some specific changes now.
1641980	1651980	If I switch to secbutylacetate, even greater difference, moving over to tbutylacetate, even more variability.
1651980	1657980	So even though I can't dissect every peak there and break them all down into their individual vibrational modes,
1657980	1661980	in the case of the fingerprint region of the spectrum, I don't have to,
1661980	1670980	because I can always go to a data library just like the AIST and compare it to the data that I see when I run my experiment.
1670980	1675980	So let's summarize what we've learned about FTIR spectroscopy today.
1675980	1679980	We talked about what lies beyond the red portion of the visible spectrum,
1679980	1686980	a form of radiation with lower energy than red light, earning it the name InfraRed.
1686980	1691980	We took a brief look at the layout of a very basic IR spectrophotometer,
1691980	1696980	and how, just like UV visible spectrophotometers, they split and compare light beams
1696980	1702980	which pass through reference cells and sample cells to determine the transmittance of a sample.
1702980	1705980	We looked at molecular structures in a new light as well,
1705980	1709980	not as a rigid construct of ideal bond lengths and angles,
1709980	1714980	but as a dynamic, vibrating framework with many degrees of freedom for its atoms to move,
1714980	1719980	and therefore its bonds to stretch and bend.
1719980	1724980	We covered how these vibrations tend to have frequencies corresponding to those of InfraRed photons,
1724980	1729980	and these photons can be absorbed when they encounter a bond vibrating at that frequency,
1729980	1734980	as long as the vibration causes a change in the overall dipole of the molecule.
1734980	1740980	We discussed factors affecting the rates of vibrations in both macroscopic systems and in bonds.
1740980	1746980	How lighter atoms joined by tighter bonds lead to higher vibrational frequencies.
1746980	1752980	Of course, this means that hydrogen-containing bonds, as well as double and triple bonds to larger atoms,
1752980	1758980	tend to appear at the higher frequency end of the IR spectrum, called the functional group region,
1758980	1762980	while vibrations in the carbon scaffold contribute more to the complex,
1762980	1769980	but equally useful, fingerprint region in the lower frequencies.
1769980	1774980	Next time, we'll turn our attention to a phenomenon different from absorbance,
1774980	1779980	a new form of interaction between light and matter, called optical rotation.
1779980	1782980	I'll see you then.
