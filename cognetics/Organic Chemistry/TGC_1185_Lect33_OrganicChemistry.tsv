0	17640	Potent alcoholic beverages from the waste product of yeast, drinkable water from the
17640	21960	sea, gasoline from crude oil.
21960	27280	Humanity has always had a deep interest in the purification of liquids to obtain commodities
27280	29600	of great value.
29600	35040	One of the earliest and most effective techniques to purify liquids relies on two simple physical
35040	45520	changes, boiling and condensation, which combine to create a familiar technique called distillation.
45520	49080	Most of us are predominantly familiar with this technique as a method of producing beverage
49080	50680	alcohol.
50680	55020	This application has been employed for so long that its true origins in human history
55020	57560	are lost to the ages.
57560	62500	What is certain is that many early civilizations independently discovered this trick, which
62500	68320	can be used to produce a beverage from such varied sources as fermented rice, bananas,
68320	72080	or even milk.
72080	76800	But ethanol is just one of many liquids which we find particularly useful in its purified
76800	77800	state.
77800	82800	In the 4th century BC, Aristotle observed this phenomenon related to water and wrote
82800	85780	on it in his work Meteorologica.
85780	91520	He wrote, salt water, when it turns to vapor, becomes sweet, and the vapor does not form
91520	94640	salt water again when it condenses.
94640	100280	Wine and all fluids that evaporate and condense into a liquid state become water.
100280	105640	Now, by sweet, what Aristotle meant was drinkable.
105640	110800	He had observed that seawater, wine, and all other common solutions of his day could be
110800	117820	made into fresh, potable water simply by boiling it, then recondensing the vapor in a new container.
117820	123220	Now, clearly seawater and freshwater were made from the same basic substance and modified
123220	130020	only by some admixture, which could be removed by this process.
130020	134980	Of course, in his day, Aristotle only had access to aqueous solutions, so his observation
134980	140700	that all fluids become water in this process would be a bit erroneous from a modern perspective.
140700	146240	But he did demonstrate an understanding that liquids can be vaporized, collected and recondensed
146240	151360	to form a liquid of a different composition than the original, a primary tenet of the
151360	154040	technique of distillation.
154040	158960	Now, Aristotle's observations weren't merely academic, either.
158960	162720	His ideas were applied in the centuries following his death.
162720	167400	For example, Greek sailors, according to the accounts from Alexander of Aphrodisius, boiled
167400	172060	seawater and suspended large sponges from the mouth of bronze vessels above them to
172060	173660	obtain drinking water.
173660	178500	Now, here Alexander is describing the desalination of seawater.
178500	184940	In the middle of the 1600s, an Englishman and physician named John French played a critical
184940	191500	role in thrusting distillation from the realm of an alchemical art to a chemical science.
191500	195500	He very eloquently writes in his now famous work, The Art of Distillation,
196200	201600	I shall not stand here to show where the art of distillation had its origin as being a thing,
201600	207600	little conducing to our ensuing discourse, but let us understand what distillation is.
210200	214100	In yet another of my favorite quotes of all time, French writes,
214100	219800	Before you take yourself to the work, propound to yourself what you seek and enter not upon
219800	224800	the practice until you are first well versed in the theory.
224800	229500	A more telling quotation of those times could not possibly exist.
229500	233500	French has always been on my list of top ten scientists I'd like to sit down for a beer
233500	238500	with, though perhaps in his case a whiskey would be a more appropriate drink.
238500	245500	In his time, French's work was the most influential universal compendium of distillation theory
245500	251100	and techniques that was ever published, a true asset to the growing science of chemistry.
251100	256900	Today, it offers us a fascinating insight into the change in thinking which was going on during his day,
256900	261600	a shift from the artistic and romantic descriptions of the alchemical world
261600	266600	to the factual and detailed observations of the chemical world.
268200	273000	But distillation is not simply an ancient technique relegated to the pages of history.
273000	280800	Modern fuels are particularly pertinent example of a more recent societal change made possible by this purification method.
280900	285700	A fantastic example of this is the refining of crude oil into useful materials.
285700	291700	And we owe a great deal of that practice to J.D. Rockefeller's standard oil company and his competitors.
293700	298900	You see, there's a good reason why we refer to fossil fuels as petroleum distillates.
298900	305600	It's because the refining process primarily relies on distillation to separate components of crude petroleum
305600	309100	based on little more than their boiling points.
309200	313900	Rockefeller's true genius was not to employ the technique. Now, that had been done long ago.
315200	320600	But what really helped to make Rockefeller successful was his realization that in addition to lamp oil,
320600	325300	he could use distillation to collect and sell many of the other products of various volatilities
325300	328300	which other companies simply treated as waste.
328300	331300	And this included octane for gasoline.
331300	335800	So just imagine that gasoline was once considered a waste product.
336500	341500	So distillation has found many uses through the ages, from producing potable water and alcoholic beverages
341500	343500	to refining oil and gasoline.
343500	347000	It also finds use frequently in the organic chemistry laboratory
347000	351500	as a method for isolating liquids of varying volatility from one another.
351500	357500	The applications of distillation go on and on, but in this lecture we'll take French's advice
357500	362500	and first take a look at the fundamental laws governing this influential chemical technique.
363200	367200	First, a bit of background on the process of vaporization.
367200	372200	All liquids exist naturally in equilibrium with just a little bit of their vapor,
372200	375200	even at temperatures well below their boiling points.
375200	379200	Now, the exact amount of vapor varies from one substance to the next
379200	386200	and depends on how well molecules of the same kind stick together through intermolecular attractions.
386900	393900	For example, under a given set of conditions, water will exert a lower vapor pressure than will acetone
393900	396900	because the water molecules can hydrogen bond to themselves,
396900	400900	causing them to prefer the liquid phase more than the gas.
400900	402900	This is easily observed.
402900	407900	Just place a drop of water next to a drop of nail polish remover on a countertop
407900	410900	and see which one evaporates first.
411600	417600	We measure the amount of vapor above a liquid in terms of the pressure that that vapor exerts.
417600	422600	So this property of liquids has come to be known as vapor pressure.
422600	425600	The higher the vapor pressure of a given liquid,
425600	430600	the faster and more easily it will be converted to the gas phase.
430600	435600	Now, we often report vapor pressures in units of torr.
436300	440300	One torr is equal to one millimeter of mercury in a barometer.
440300	445300	So, 760 torr is equal to one atmosphere of pressure,
445300	450300	the likes of which we would experience on a lab bench.
450300	456300	Now, increasing the temperature of a sample means increasing the kinetic energy in the molecules which make it up.
456300	459300	So, increasing the temperature of a liquid,
459300	465300	gives more of its molecules enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid and become a gas.
465300	469300	This increases the vapor pressure of the sample.
469300	476300	When a liquid is heated to a temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the externally applied pressure,
476300	482300	like the 760 torr of pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere, for example, the liquid boils.
483300	486300	When the pressure we are working against is one atmosphere,
486300	491300	we refer to this temperature as the liquid's normal boiling point.
494300	497300	This is most easily observed by heating a sample of pure water.
497300	503300	At room temperature, water's vapor pressure is only about 3% out of atmospheric pressure.
503300	508300	But as the temperature increases, more and more water increases.
509300	515300	But as the temperature increases, more and more water vapor can be seen forming at the liquid's surface,
515300	518300	until the water reaches 100 degrees centigrade,
518300	525300	at which point its vapor pressure is now one atmosphere, or 760 torr, and boiling takes place.
528300	529300	But that's pure water.
529300	534300	And our goal today is to show how we can separate mixtures of liquids from one another using this process.
534300	539300	So let's call on a few more great minds from the 1800s to help us with that.
541300	546300	Raoul's law, named for French chemist Fran√ßois-Marie Raoul, states that
546300	551300	the vapor pressure exerted by a component in a mixture of miscible liquids
551300	557300	is equal to its normal vapor pressure when pure, times its mole fraction in the mixture.
558300	565300	In other words, the vapor pressure of each component is proportional to the fraction of sample molecules it makes up.
565300	573300	So a solution which is 50% water at room temperature will only exert a vapor pressure of 1.5 torr instead of 3 torr.
576300	584300	Dalton's law, named for John Dalton, tells us that the sum of the partial vapor pressures exerted by all of the components of such a system
584300	588300	is equal to the total vapor pressure exerted by that system.
588300	592300	In other words, vapor pressures are additive.
594300	601300	For example, if our water was diluted to 50% using ethanol, we would have to include the vapor pressure of the ethanol
601300	604300	and the total vapor pressure of our mixture as well.
605300	609300	Now, ethanol's vapor pressure is about 50 torr at room temperature.
609300	615300	So it contributes 25 torr to the vapor pressure of the mixture according to Raoul's law,
615300	621300	giving the mixture about 26.5 torr total vapor pressure in accordance with Dalton's law.
622300	628300	So varying the amount of each liquid making up the mixture can alter that mixture's vapor pressure.
629300	636300	Finally, we're going to use ideal gas law, which is actually a combination of several other laws relating pressure,
636300	644300	volume, abundance, and temperature, all through a constant called the ideal gas constant, which we represent by the letter R.
645300	649300	So let's start our discussion about the process of vaporization and how it applies to distillation
649300	654300	in an object lesson using benzene and toluene to fairly simple hydrocarbons.
655300	660300	Now, I'll be using numbers for toluene and benzene, but I'll be representing the molecules as blue spheres and red spheres
660300	665300	throughout this demonstration so that we keep our attention on the physical behavior of the molecules
665300	667300	and not the structures of them themselves.
668300	671300	So here I have a beaker that's filled with benzene and toluene.
672300	676300	And this mixture of benzene and toluene is 50 mole percent of each.
677300	682300	Now that means that if I model my blue spheres as toluene and my red spheres as benzene,
682300	685300	I can begin to follow them as they change from the liquid to the vapor state.
686300	692300	Now, at a given temperature, the vapor pressure of toluene is normally 300 Tor.
693300	699300	And at the same temperature, the vapor pressure of pure benzene is normally 1200 Tor.
701300	707300	So I can use Raoult's law to calculate the vapor pressure exerted by each in my mixture.
707300	715300	For example, the vapor pressure exerted by toluene is equal to chi, the Greek letter chi, which is its mole fraction,
716300	719300	times the vapor pressure it would exert if it were pure.
720300	724300	In other words, the toluene should exert a vapor pressure of 150 Tor.
726300	733300	Now, a similar calculation for benzene allows me to predict that its vapor pressure above the liquid should be equal to 600 Tor.
734300	740300	And a quick check using Dalton's law tells me that this liquid will be boiling maybe on a cloudy day here in Washington D.C.
740300	745300	when the vapor pressure or when the atmospheric pressure is 750 Tor, which equals the vapor pressure.
747300	749300	Now, here's the interesting part.
749300	756300	If I take the vapor pressures of my liquids and use the ideal gas law, which allows me to predict that the pressures they exert
756300	760300	is proportional to the number of moles in the gas phase,
760300	769300	I calculate that the mole fraction of benzene in the vapor phase is 80 mole percent, not 50 mole percent.
770300	775300	So this means that in the headspace above my liquid, whatever vapor does form at this temperature,
775300	781300	is actually going to be enriched in benzene, which is the more volatile of the two components.
782300	787300	Now, this is very important to distillation and how it allows us to separate liquids.
788300	795300	So let's say that I could take a sample of benzene and toluene and place it in an apparatus in which it can vaporize
795300	802300	and in which that vapor is then channeled into a new region in space where it is then condensed back into a liquid.
802300	810300	Well, if I can do that, then the liquid I collect should be of the same composition as the vapor in that original sample.
811300	817300	So we use a device like this called the simple still, which consists of what we call a boiling flask, which is heated.
817300	825300	A still head whose job is to direct the vapor into another downward-facing region, which we call a west condenser.
825300	831300	Now, the west condenser has a water jacket to keep it cold, which induces condensation,
831300	836300	but that condensed vapor rolls downhill into a new receiving flask,
836300	841300	and it's directed that way through a flow controller or a vacuum adapter in this case.
841300	846300	So knowing what we know about how a mixture of benzene and toluene will vaporize,
846300	850300	if I run my still by adding heat to the boiling flask,
850300	855300	I expect that the vapor which is moving through the system will be enriched in the benzene,
855300	860300	and therefore at the end of my distillation run, when I remove my receiving flask,
860300	863300	it should contain 80 mole percent benzene.
863300	868300	So I've enriched my sample in the more volatile component through distillation.
869300	874300	So now that we've talked a little bit about the theory behind simple distillation, let's take a look at one in progress.
876300	882300	So I've constructed here a simple distillation apparatus, the type of which you might find running in an organic chemistry lab.
882300	887300	Currently, I'm distilling a mixture of 50-50 ethanol and water.
887300	892300	Now the apparatus consists of not only the elements we looked at previously in our slides,
892300	895300	but a few other practical pieces that help it work.
895300	899300	The first is this device called a lab jack, and the lab jack gives me a little bit of clearance
899300	903300	so that I can raise and lower my heat source when I need to.
903300	906300	On top of the lab jack is a stir plate.
906300	909300	Now this is also a heating plate, but I'm not using the heat,
909300	912300	because remember we talked about this in our previous lecture,
912300	916300	that it's not a good idea to put anything with organic solvents directly on top of a hot plate.
916300	922300	And since I'm working with ethanol, which in certain concentrations is flammable, I can't do that.
922300	926300	Instead, I've used a device which is called a thermowell.
926300	932300	A thermowell is a ceramic heater, and I'm controlling it with a little controller in the back here,
932300	936300	which is hidden from view, which regulates how much current is reaching the thermowell.
936300	940300	So that's how I set the temperature of the still just the way I like it.
940300	945300	Now right now, I have a round bottom boiling flask, which is clamped in place.
945300	948300	So this is the lowest piece of glassware in my apparatus,
948300	951300	and so I've clamped it on a ring stand so that when I lower the lab jack,
951300	954300	my heat source is removed from my organic sample.
954300	957300	So this is all about safety up to this point.
957300	960300	Now about the distillation.
960300	963300	The boiling flask contains a mixture of boiling water and ethanol.
963300	968300	And if you look very closely, you can actually see the vapor condensing within the still head here,
968300	972300	and a great deal of it is falling back into the boiling flask, and that's okay.
972300	977300	But some of that vapor traverses the still head into this arm,
977300	982300	which is in a downward sloping direction and is in line with a water-cooled condenser.
982300	987300	So this condenser here, actually, if I get wiped away some of the condensation that's on it,
987300	990300	you might be able to see this, has two concentric tubes.
990300	994300	The outside tube is actually plumbed to cold water,
994300	998300	which is circulating because of a pump that I have underneath the table.
998300	1003300	So it's constantly keeping the inner portion of this column cold.
1003300	1008300	That's why the vapor is condensing in this cold region and rolling downward,
1008300	1013300	where my vacuum adapter is directing the flow into a receiving flask.
1013300	1020300	You may notice that it's dripping downward, and that's actually the origin of the term distill.
1020300	1023300	It's from the Latin meaning to drop downward.
1023300	1026300	So if I'm really enriching my sample here in ethanol,
1026300	1031300	I should be able to detect that in the temperature of the vapor as it moves through the still head.
1031300	1034300	So I have an infrared thermometer here,
1034300	1037300	and I've placed a few white stickers on my apparatus
1037300	1043300	so that I can get the proper reflection of the IR light to measure the temperatures going on in this still.
1043300	1048300	Now if I point my thermometer directly at the boiling flask,
1048300	1053300	I see that at least the surface of the boiling flask is somewhere around 80 degrees centigrade,
1053300	1057300	77 according to my thermometer.
1057300	1062300	But if the vapor which is moving into the condenser is of a different composition,
1062300	1065300	then it should be a different temperature.
1065300	1068300	If I've increased the concentration of the more volatile component,
1068300	1072300	I should see a decrease in temperature as it moves up into the still head.
1072300	1076300	So let's take a look at the still head temperature, at least on the outside of the still head.
1076300	1080300	See, it's moving around quite a bit as the vapor sort of moves and swirls inside,
1080300	1084300	but my reading never exceeds about 70 degrees.
1088300	1092300	So even though I've been measuring the temperatures of the outside of the still,
1092300	1095300	or the glass surface, rather than the actual liquid and vapor,
1095300	1097300	we can see the trend occurring here,
1097300	1100300	that it's much warmer down here where the boiling liquid is
1100300	1103300	compared to the temperature of the vapor which is moving through the still head.
1103300	1106300	Now if this were a pure liquid, that should not be the case,
1106300	1111300	because boiling means that the liquid and the vapor are in thermal equilibrium with one another,
1111300	1113300	which clearly they aren't,
1113300	1118300	and that is the source of the purification that we get during a distillation.
1118300	1122300	So we've seen how we can separate or at least enrich a sample
1122300	1125300	in a more volatile component using simple distillation.
1125300	1130300	But what if we want a really highly purified sample of a particular liquid?
1130300	1133300	Remember, in our calculations before, with benzene and toluene,
1133300	1137300	we determined that we would only get a distillate of about 80 mole percent benzene,
1137300	1144300	but what if we need one that's 90 or 95 or even practically 100 percent benzene?
1144300	1150300	We have a tool that we can use to predict exactly how liquids and vapors will behave
1150300	1155300	to determine the outcome of a distillation and whether or not we need to take extra measures.
1155300	1159300	Now for that we use something called a liquid vapor composition plot.
1159300	1166300	And a liquid vapor composition plot, simply put, is a phase diagram for a binary liquid system at boiling,
1166300	1172300	as opposed to a binary solid system which is melting like we looked at last time.
1172300	1176300	So remember, we were operating in a specific temperature,
1176300	1181300	boiling a mixture of benzene and toluene, which was 50 mole percent benzene,
1181300	1185300	but created a vapor that was 80 mole percent benzene.
1185300	1192300	So at that given temperature on my plot, I can place those two percentages of benzene.
1192300	1200300	Here 50 for the liquid and here 80 for my vapor composition.
1200300	1204300	But these calculations in this experiment have been done many, many times over
1204300	1208300	at many, many different compositions of benzene and toluene.
1208300	1213300	So if we plot similar results for different compositions at their boiling points,
1213300	1218300	we start to see a pattern emerge within the plot and connecting the dots gives us
1218300	1224300	what looks a lot like our phase diagrams for a binary system that we've seen before.
1224300	1227300	So this is the origin of the liquid vapor composition plot.
1227300	1230300	It's a tool which allows me to predict the outcome of a distillation
1230300	1237300	without ever having to go into the lab and run one.
1237300	1241300	So let's say that I really do want a very, very pure sample of benzene.
1241300	1244300	Can I use distillation to achieve that?
1244300	1249300	Well, our calculations would suggest otherwise for a 50 mole percent mixture with toluene.
1249300	1254300	But what if I were to collect that distillate and then redestill it?
1254300	1258300	Well, I could build an apparatus like the one I've shown you here in which I have a boiling flask
1258300	1263300	and then an intermediate flask which is a collection flask for a first round of distillation
1263300	1267300	but is a boiling flask for a second round of distillation.
1267300	1272300	Now, if I were to run a system like this, I would expect my 50 mole percent benzene
1272300	1277300	to collect in the first flask as an 80 mole percent benzene solution.
1277300	1281300	But that 80 mole percent benzene solution, when heated,
1281300	1287300	I would expect to distill yet again and form a new condensate which is even more enriched.
1287300	1293300	Now, just how enriched it is, I can determine using my liquid vapor composition plot.
1293300	1298300	Now, it turns out it's 97 mole percent, so let's see how I figured that out.
1298300	1303300	Using the liquid vapor composition plot, I started with a liquid of 50 mole percent,
1303300	1309300	which gives me a vapor of 80 mole percent, which gives me a condensate of 80 mole percent in the receiving flask.
1309300	1313300	Now, I'm going to heat that 80 percent liquid that I've recondensed.
1313300	1321300	That creates a vapor which recondenses to form a liquid with a composition of 97 mole percent benzene.
1321300	1324300	Now, I've set it up here as two sequential distillations,
1324300	1328300	but we'd really like to be able to do this in a system in which we can run a single run
1328300	1333300	without having to build all of this, or take it apart and clean all of this at the end,
1333300	1335300	or use two different sources of heat.
1335300	1339300	So, in short, is there a simpler way that we can do this?
1341300	1345300	The answer is yes, and we call it a fractional distillation.
1345300	1348300	This is a fractional distillation scheme,
1348300	1353300	and I've really only changed my simple distill by one very important thing.
1353300	1357300	I've added what's called a fractionating column to it,
1357300	1361300	and the insertion of this fractionating column gives lots and lots of surface area
1361300	1366300	onto which my vapor as it ascends the column can condense and then revaporize,
1366300	1370300	and then condense and revaporize as it climbs up the column.
1371300	1376300	So, if I charge this flask with 50 mole percent benzene and then run my fractional distill,
1376300	1381300	let's take a look at what goes on inside this region, this fractionating column that I've added.
1388300	1392300	As I heat the sample, I'll see vapor beginning to ascend,
1392300	1396300	but every time it condenses along the walls, falls into a slightly warmer region
1396300	1400300	and revaporizes, it becomes more and more enriched in the more volatile component,
1400300	1403300	in our case, benzene.
1404300	1409300	At the, or near the base of that column, it's as though I were doing a simple distillation.
1409300	1411300	I get about 80 mole percent.
1411300	1414300	But if you look carefully about midway up that column,
1414300	1420300	you'll notice that far fewer of my toluene molecules are making it to this location on the column.
1420300	1424300	And if you go even higher, near the very, very top, really none of them are.
1424300	1428300	So, if I run this particular column as I've depicted it here,
1428300	1431300	collecting the vapor that exits through the top of the column,
1431300	1436300	I expect to get what is essentially 100% pure benzene in a single distillation,
1436300	1440300	starting with 50 mole percent benzene.
1440300	1442300	So, here's how I was able to do that.
1442300	1444300	I started with 50 mole percent,
1444300	1449300	but my column here is running not as though a single round of distillation had taken place,
1449300	1452300	creating an 80% benzene distillate,
1452300	1455300	but rather as though a second one had taken place,
1455300	1459300	giving 97% and then yet again a third one had taken place,
1459300	1466300	finally getting me right around the limit of my diagram here to about 100% benzene.
1466300	1469300	Now, when I do a single run in a fractional still,
1469300	1472300	which gives me a distillate of a purity that resembles that
1472300	1475300	of something that's been distilled twice or three times,
1475300	1481300	I report on the efficiency of my still using a term called theoretical plates.
1481300	1487300	Simply put, a 97% pure distillate would mean that my fractional still operates at two theoretical plates,
1487300	1492300	because it's as though I had distilled and redestilled a second time.
1492300	1497300	If instead my fractional still gives me 100% pure benzene in the first run,
1497300	1499300	then it's three theoretical plates,
1499300	1506300	because it's as though I've gone over and down three times on my liquid vapor composition plot.
1506300	1509300	So, I've made a small change to my simple still setup from last time,
1509300	1513300	inserting not only the fractionating column itself, which is here,
1513300	1517300	but I've also, you'll notice, packed a little bit of steel wool inside.
1517300	1522300	And the purpose of that packing is to give extra surface area on to which multiple rounds
1522300	1528300	of condensation and vaporization can take place as my sample ascends the column.
1528300	1533300	In fact, if you look very closely, you'll see plenty of condensation falling back down,
1533300	1536300	because it's formed before the vapor actually reaches the sidearm.
1536300	1540300	So, only the most volatile of components can get to the top.
1540300	1546300	Now, again, in this case, I have 50-50 ethanol and water in my boiling flask.
1546300	1550300	So, if I take a look at the temperature of the boiling liquid,
1550300	1555300	it's no surprise that the temperature is somewhere around the mid-80 degrees centigrade.
1555300	1559300	But as my sample ascends the column, let's say about halfway up,
1559300	1562300	I've got another sticker here so I can measure my temperature.
1562300	1567300	Now, in this case, the temperature of the ascending vapor is no longer in the high-80s.
1567300	1575300	Now, it's about 80 degrees.
1575300	1582300	And finally, at the top, if I measure the actual temperature of the vapor which is reaching my west condenser,
1582300	1590300	I see that that vapor has a temperature of about 75 degrees.
1590300	1594300	So, what I've shown you here is proof that as the vapor ascends,
1594300	1599300	the boiling point of the associated combination of ethanol and water continually decreases.
1599300	1603300	Now, knowing that the boiling point of ethanol is lower than that of water,
1603300	1609300	it should come as no surprise that my distillate, that is, that liquid which is dripping down from the far side,
1609300	1612300	is dramatically enriched in ethanol.
1612300	1616300	In fact, it's just about 95% ethanol by volume.
1616300	1622300	Now, powerful though distillation is as a technique, it does suffer from limitations.
1622300	1625300	You may have seen this product for sale before.
1625300	1629300	It's a grain alcohol beverage which is labeled 190 proof.
1629300	1637300	Now, that means the mixture is 95% ethanol by volume and 5% water.
1637300	1641300	If you ever saw this product on the store shelf, you might have wondered to yourself,
1641300	1646300	if you're going to make alcohol that strong, why not just go for broke and make it 200 proof
1646300	1650300	or 100% absolutely pure alcohol?
1650300	1655300	Now, there's in fact a very good reason that the manufacturer decided to stop at 95%.
1655300	1662300	It's because ethanol and water simply cannot be distilled beyond that proportion.
1662300	1669300	You see, Raoult, Dalton's and ideal gas laws are just that, predictions based on ideal behavior
1669300	1673300	in which gas molecules don't interact with one another significantly.
1673300	1679300	And as you can imagine, the truth is often quite different from that.
1679300	1682300	So because these laws are not rigorously accurate models,
1682300	1687300	we often see distortions in the behavior of systems which we're trying to distill.
1687300	1691300	Ethanol and water is actually a rather mild example of this.
1691300	1696300	The liquid vapor phase diagram for this system looks like this.
1696300	1701300	With a small local minimum at about 95% ethanol.
1701300	1704300	It looks an awful lot like something we saw earlier, doesn't it?
1704300	1708300	Right, it looks just like the eutectic point in melting of solids,
1708300	1715300	which was very interesting because it was the only composition at which the liquid and solid were of the same composition.
1715300	1722300	When the analogous feature is seen in a liquid vapor system, we call that mixture an azeotrope.
1722300	1727300	This is derived from Greek terms, meaning no change on boiling.
1727300	1734300	It's a very appropriate name because the vapor above the liquid is of exactly the same composition as that liquid,
1734300	1738300	making distillation of such a mixture futile.
1738300	1745300	A fractionating column, which reaches the moon, would not be sufficient to obtain pure ethanol by distillation.
1745300	1751300	We'd have to resort to other means to chemically dry the azeotrope to make it 100% ethanol.
1751300	1758300	From the perspective of an alcoholic beverage, it simply isn't worth all of the extra effort to remove that last little bit of water
1758300	1766300	from a product which is most likely going to be mixed right back in with another aqueous solution to prepare a drink.
1766300	1769300	So let's sum up what we've covered today.
1769300	1778300	We started with a mathematical explanation for why vapors above boiling mixtures tend to be enriched in the more volatile component.
1778300	1787300	We relied on the concept of vapor pressure and Raoult's, Dalton's, and ideal gas laws to support our prediction.
1787300	1795300	We used the results of these calculations to construct a phase diagram, which is commonly called a liquid vapor composition plot.
1795300	1802300	And we explored how these plots can be used to graphically predict the outcome of a distillation.
1802300	1810300	Next, we investigated a commonly used simple distillation apparatus, which diverts vapor from boiling mixtures into a condenser,
1810300	1816300	which then directs the recondensed liquid into a separate collecting flask.
1816300	1825300	We also looked at a fractional distillation apparatus, which differs by the insertion of a special column between the boiling flask
1825300	1832300	and still had, allowing multiple rounds of vaporization and condensation to take place in a single run.
1832300	1843300	This increased efficiency can be compared to the liquid vapor composition plot to give it a numerical value in the form of theoretical plates.
1843300	1853300	Next, we covered the phenomenon of azeotropes, which are undistillable mixtures of liquids which form because of non-ideal behaviors.
1853300	1858300	We saw how they manifest themselves as a local minimum within the liquid vapor composition plot,
1858300	1867300	making the vapor and boiling liquid identical in composition, thereby rendering distillation ineffective.
1867300	1874300	So over our last two lectures, we've covered all of the phrases which we commonly encounter in the lab, solid, liquid, and vapor,
1874300	1884300	and how transitioning from one state to the other can be used to purify and sometimes even identify substances in the lab.
1884300	1889300	In our next lecture, we will return our attention to a different physical property, solubility.
1889300	1896300	We'll see how this property can also be used as a very effective tool for isolation of non-volatile organic compounds
1896300	1899300	in a process known as liquid-liquid extraction.
1899300	1901300	I'll see you then.
1904300	1906300	Thank you.
