1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,920
In 1957, the German pharmaceutical firm GrÃ¼nenthal was enjoying sizable profits from its post-war

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,080
sales of the antibiotic penicillin.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,360
And as the company sought to reinvest those profits and continue growing its product line,

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:34,960
it developed a compound called 2-2-6-dioxo-piperidine-3-ill-1-H-isoindole-1-3-2-H-dione.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
That's a mouthful, isn't it?

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,880
This compound was touted as a miracle cure for a variety of ailments, all the way from

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,600
insomnia to colds to headaches.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,840
A global public made trusting by the miraculous benefits of drugs like penicillin welcomed

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,800
this new product into their medicine cabinets with open arms.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,480
In the early 1960s, the indications for this new wonder drug were expanded to include morning

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,560
sickness in pregnant women.

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,160
Within months of its introduction to world markets for this particular use, thousands

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,480
of reports of birth defects began rolling into government offices and countries which had

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,840
approved its use.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,960
Within a year or two, it became clear that this new indication for the drug was linked

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,720
somehow to this growing catastrophe.

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,080
Its use for this purpose was quickly stopped, though not before tens of thousands of lives

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,280
were tragically and directly affected.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
The drug that I'm talking about is, of course, the now infamous thalidomide.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,600
Most of us are at least familiar with the story of this drug's remarkable efficacy,

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,680
but also its remarkable ability to cause birth defects in growing fetuses.

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,120
Now, what you might not realize, however, is that these two biological effects are actually

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,640
the result of two different forms of the molecule sold under that trade name.

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Today we're going to investigate the phenomenon of stereoisomerism, the key to understanding

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,480
what a tragedy the thalidomide accident truly was.

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,360
Hi.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,000
Start today with an easy question, shall we?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,480
Did I just wave to you with my left hand or my right hand?

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Now I'm guessing anyone watching this lecture can easily conclude that was my right hand.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,800
But how did you know that it was my right hand?

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Well, you know that it was my right hand because, even though I have a thumb, four fingers and

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,800
a palm on both hands, what makes them different is the position and orientation of those substituents

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
on the hands.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,680
The direction of the palm, the fingers and the thumb are unique on the right hand as

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,880
compared to the left.

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,440
If I try to superimpose them, I can't make it work.

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
If I line the palms, my thumbs are on the wrong sides.

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
Yet if I line my thumbs, now the palms don't match.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,240
So in spite of the identical connectivity, I can't superimpose my hands with one another.

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,960
Clearly they are distinct objects which can interact with the world differently.

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,200
You don't believe me, just try to put a right-handed glove on your left hand.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,560
It's a completely different experience than trying to put it on the right hand.

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,600
Now, so far we've concerned ourselves with macro-scale objects and we're not done with

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,680
that yet, but let's take a few minutes and turn our attention to a geometry more relevant

45
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,560
to organic chemistry, the tetrahedron.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,800
See, carbon atoms can have up to four sigma bonds, meaning four different bonded substituents

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,920
arranged tetrahedrally about a central atom.

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,320
Now, when these four substituents are all distinct from one another, they actually create

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,840
two different possible arrangements which hold the same connectivity.

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, so let's take a look at this tetrahedral center here.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,880
It's got four distinct substituents and for now we're just going to use these colors,

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,760
red, blue, yellow, and green to indicate that they're all different from one another.

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,560
Now if I were to make an exact copy of this, but interchange two of the four substituents,

54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
look at what happens here.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,000
I've created two structures with exactly the same connectivity, but no matter how I translate

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,080
and rotate them, there's no way to make them superimposed with one another.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,160
Now these two hypothetical molecules have handedness, just like my hands did in our previous example.

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
And when we interchange two substituents on a central atom, just like we did here, we

59
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
produce a new molecule.

60
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,520
And when this happens, we call the central atom a chiral center.

61
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,280
In our current example, this is a tetrahedral center with four distinct substituents.

62
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,640
Now the result of course was that we had non-superimposable objects with identical connectivity.

63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,080
And when this happens, we call these two entities stereoisomers of one another.

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Now pairs of stereoisomers fall into several distinct categories and understanding each

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,640
of them is critical to understanding the physical and chemical properties of some of the organic

66
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,160
compounds that contain them.

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,560
So before we begin investigating these relationships, let me stress to you that they are just that,

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,720
relationships.

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,080
Just as you can be a brother to one person and an uncle to another, so can a given molecule

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,800
have various stereoisomer relationships to other similar molecules.

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Now the first class of stereoisomers that I'd like to look at are called enantiomers.

72
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,200
In most chemistry books, you'll find them defined as non-superimposable mirror images.

73
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,480
I prefer to think of them as a pair of compounds in which all of the atom connectivity is the

74
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,160
same, but all of the stereocenters are inverted.

75
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,800
So the simplest example of our tetrahedral center with just one stereocenter, this is

76
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,600
really the only possible relationship we could develop.

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,640
You can't invert a fraction of a stereocenter.

78
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,320
Now this is in fact a part of the thalidomide story.

79
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,840
The thalidomide, like many drugs, contains a chiral center.

80
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,320
One of these stereoisomers of thalidomide has the desirable pharmacological properties.

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,280
But the other stereoisomer, which was thought to be completely innocuous at the time, was

82
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,720
in fact a powerful angiogenesis inhibitor, which is a fancy way of saying that it inhibits

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,680
the development of blood vessels critical to proper fetal growth.

84
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,880
And what's worse is that this angiogenesis inhibitor crosses the placental barrier with

85
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,920
startling efficiency and doomed many fetuses to abnormal development.

86
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,960
Now you'll notice that interchanging two of the four substituents produced a mirror image

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,480
of the original, and of course that I couldn't superimpose them.

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,800
So we call them enantiomers of one another.

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,400
But when more than one chiral center, or center of handedness, is present in a molecule, the

90
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,360
picture becomes a little bit more complicated.

91
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,320
So let's take the example of a hypothetical compound with two non-identical stereocenters.

92
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,600
In my example I have one stereocenter with red, yellow, and green substituents, and another

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,200
with purple, orange, and gray substituents.

94
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,560
Now inversion of both stereocenters produces that mirror image which can't be superimposed.

95
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,040
So here I've made a set of enantiomers, which you'll recall I defined as compounds in which

96
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,000
all centers are inverted.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,440
But now that I have multiple stereocenters, it's possible to invert only one while leaving

98
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,600
the other one in its original state.

99
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,280
When I do this, the result is a compound with identical connectivity which is neither superimposable

100
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,400
nor a mirror image.

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,000
And these pairs of compounds have a different name.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
Their relationship is called diastereomers.

103
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,480
Sets of diastereomers are distinct from sets of enantiomers in that they can, and very

104
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,400
often do, have different physical properties like boiling points, melting points.

105
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,960
A third and somewhat unusual situation arises when a compound contains two stereocenters

106
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,240
which each have the same force of substituents attached.

107
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,520
Now in this instance, it's possible to have a situation in which a complete inversion

108
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,880
of stereochemistry leads to a mirror image, but that mirror image is exactly the same

109
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,680
molecule.

110
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
When this happens, we don't actually have two different stereoisomers, but we have a compound

111
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,520
that still has stereocenters or chiral centers.

112
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,960
So we give them a special name, mesocompounds.

113
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,240
Now not all stereoisomers contain chiral centers.

114
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,040
Now recall our definition of stereocenter is that interchanging two groups on that center

115
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,400
changes the identity of a molecule.

116
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,000
You also may recall that in lecture two, we learned that pi bonds have restricted rotation

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,160
owing to the side-to-side overlap of p-atomic orbitals, which can't be interrupted unless

118
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,040
we break the pi bond.

119
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,720
So this can lead to another kind of stereoisomerism.

120
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,120
Here's a molecule of what we would call beta-butylene.

121
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,480
Now since we can't rotate pi bonds, it's possible to have a compound like this with

122
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,040
two substituents, a methyl and a hydrogen on this, a methyl and a hydrogen on this carbon.

123
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,960
And I can create a second form of this beta-butylene molecule in which my two CH3 groups are on

124
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,640
the same side of the molecule instead of the opposing sides of the molecule.

125
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,920
And any effort I make to convert this molecule to this is thwarted by the presence of the

126
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,760
pi bond.

127
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,800
So two different isomers exist, even though these are not tetrahedral centers.

128
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Now the presence of the pi bond makes these two isomers distinct from one another, since

129
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,080
breaking the pi bond between the two carbons is necessary to achieve the kind of rotation

130
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,360
it would take to make them superimposable.

131
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,360
And since this sort of thing doesn't tend to happen on its own, we'll see later that

132
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,280
it takes a special set of circumstances to encourage that change.

133
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,800
Now since multiple isomers of compounds with stereocenters are possible, naturally we need

134
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,720
to come up with a labeling system to distinguish them from one another.

135
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,480
And several systems exist, but the most commonly employed is the con-angled pre-log convention.

136
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,440
In 1950, as the phenomenon and significance of chirality was just becoming understood,

137
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,240
two English chemists, Robert Kong and Christopher Engeld, began cooking up a methodology for

138
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,800
quickly and unambiguously distinguishing one stereoisomer from another by name.

139
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,880
A third chemist, named Vladimir Prelog, entered the discussion during a social event thrown

140
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
by the British chemical company Imperial Chemical Industries.

141
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
And this is one of those great moments in history in which the wallflowers among us

142
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,200
can really be proud.

143
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,120
Because as Prelog himself put it, everybody danced except for Engeld, Kahn and myself.

144
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,000
Not being proficient dancers, we drank beer in discussed chemistry.

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,200
Now I love this story, not only because it combines two of my favorite things, chemistry

146
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,720
and beer, but because the product of the discussion was a two-year collaboration leading to what

147
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,560
is today the most used method of communicating stereochemistry in naming organic compounds,

148
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,880
the Kahn Engeld prelog convention.

149
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,640
Kahn Engeld prelog convention gives us a way to assign a rank to all the substituents around

150
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,120
a particular stereocenter.

151
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,760
And we can then use these ranks to describe the geometric arrangement of a compound quickly

152
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,840
and easily.

153
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,920
So since the first step is ranking the substituents, let's concern ourselves with that for the

154
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,680
moment.

155
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,760
The system that Kahn Engeld and Prelog suggested was one of a sequential comparison of atoms

156
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,400
within the competing substituents around that central atom.

157
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,120
And the rules take a bit of getting used to, but in fact once you do get used to it they're

158
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,960
quite simple.

159
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,360
In short, we start from the chiral center and move out one bond at a time, comparing all

160
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,000
atoms encountered and the substituent with the first instance of the heavier atom wins

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
priority.

162
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,240
Any time a double or triple bond is encountered, the doubly or triply bonded atom is counted

163
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,440
twice or three times, respectively.

164
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,520
Now let's take a look at this rule in action.

165
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,640
And we're going to consider just the ranking of substituents for the moment and we'll add

166
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,320
those spatial arrangements later.

167
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,760
Let's begin with a molecule we've all heard of, this is Freon 151.

168
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,240
It's also called chlorofluoroethane and it contains a chiral center right there.

169
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:05,520
This carbon has four distinct substituents, chlorine, fluorine, CH3, and a hydrogen.

170
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,520
So to rank each of these substituents using the Kahn Engeld pre-log convention, I simply

171
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,000
move one bond out from the carbon and make a note of the atom I encounter.

172
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,840
In this case, a chlorine, a fluorine, a carbon, and a hydrogen.

173
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,400
Now the atomic numbers of these are 17, 9, 6, and 1 respectively.

174
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,440
So I can distinguish each of my substituents here based upon the first atom that I've encountered.

175
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,400
So I'll rank chlorine as 1, fluorine as 2, my CH3 group as 3, and my hydrogen as 4.

176
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,080
I've completed my ranking using Kahn Engeld pre-log.

177
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,800
But not all molecules are as simple as Freon.

178
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,160
Let's take the example of a naturally occurring compound called limonene.

179
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,280
You'll find limonene in the peels of citrus fruits.

180
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,240
And I've drawn for you here the line angle formula, but to do our Kahn Engeld pre-log

181
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,440
analysis I'm going to convert this into a more expanded formula.

182
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
Now take a look at this structure.

183
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,600
Can you find the chiral carbon?

184
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,920
Remember, it's a tetrahedral center with four unique substituents.

185
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,480
It's right there.

186
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Hydrogen.

187
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,920
Here's our second substituent.

188
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
And then the other two substituents actually are parts of this loop, one and the other.

189
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,760
And they're distinct from one another, which means this is genuinely a chiral center.

190
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,480
So let's start our analysis.

191
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,200
One bond out gives me three carbons and a hydrogen.

192
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,440
So I can assign my lowest priority substituent, but I still have three other competing substituents.

193
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
So let's go another bond out.

194
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,840
When I do that, I have a situation where I have a double bonded carbon, which means I

195
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,720
count it twice, whereas here I have carbons and hydrogens.

196
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,840
So when I take my inventory of all the bonded atoms that I've encountered, I have CCC for

197
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,560
this one, CHH for my substituent on the left side, and CHH for my substituent on the right

198
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,840
side.

199
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,740
So as I take a quick scan here, I see a tie and then I see a win.

200
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,480
So this substituent is going to be my top ranked substituent.

201
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,120
But I'm not done yet because I still have a tie for the second and third position, which

202
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,240
means I've got to go another bond length away.

203
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,600
When I do this, on the left hand side of the molecule, I get CHH, and on the right side,

204
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,800
I encounter another double bond to a carbon, meaning it's counted twice, or CCH.

205
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,880
So the substituent on the right side would be ranked number two and a substituent on

206
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,080
the left number three.

207
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,040
Now there's another gotcha to this system that I'd like to point out.

208
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,400
This is a favorite when I write an exam question, actually, and that is that the tendency becomes

209
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,400
to look for that heavy atom and say, that must be the top ranked substituent.

210
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,720
And a great example of this is a fluoxetine molecule, also marketed under the trade name

211
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,960
Prozac.

212
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,040
Fluoxetine contains a chiral center right here.

213
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,880
And if we looked at this and gave it a quick glance, we might notice there's a nitrogen

214
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
up here.

215
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,560
I've had a low carbon in hydrogen since the heavy atom is on the upward pointing substituent.

216
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,400
That must be a higher rank.

217
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,720
But the truth is, it's not, because con-ingled pre-log requires that I move sequentially,

218
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,920
one bond at a time, and make my comparison.

219
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,480
Once I have a win, I stop counting.

220
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:32,480
So my first bond out lets me assign the one and four to the oxygen and the hydrogen, respectively.

221
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,920
And to break the tie between my carbons, I go one more bond to get CHH on my top and

222
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,160
CCC off to the left here.

223
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,520
So this substituent has won, and I never even encounter the heavy atom.

224
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,280
So it's crucial when doing this ranking that you go bond by bond and stop as soon as you

225
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,480
found a difference.

226
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,960
This is how the con-ingled pre-log works.

227
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,520
So the ranking system proposed by con-ingled and pre-log gives us the basis for assigning

228
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,440
a universal stereochemistry designation to particular chiral centers.

229
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,040
But we have yet to define exactly how we use these rankings to define the geometry around

230
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,320
those stereocenters.

231
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,680
The most common use of these rankings is what's called the RS system of nomenclature.

232
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,160
In this system, each chiral center is given a designation of R or S, depending upon the

233
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,240
arrangement of rank substituents around the center, and it's done in the following way.

234
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,760
After we've ranked all four substituents, we place the fourth ranked substituent at

235
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,000
the back of the molecule.

236
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,680
And next we draw a curved arrow passing through the first, second, and third rank substituents.

237
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,640
If that arrow traces out a clockwise rotation, we call this the R enantiomer, from the Latin

238
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,680
for rectus or right.

239
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,760
If instead it traces out a counterclockwise path, we call it the S enantiomer from the

240
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,160
Latin for sinister or left.

241
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,960
So let's try this system out on the two enantiomers of 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane, remember freon

242
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
151.

243
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,720
Now again, we'll identify the chiral center and rank the four substituents with chlorine

244
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,680
as 1, fluorine as 2, carbon as 3, and hydrogen as 4.

245
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,280
In this case, the lowest ranked substituent is already pointed to the back, I can simply

246
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,680
draw my arrows and assign my stereochemistry.

247
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,320
So the molecule on the left is S, 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane, and the molecule on the right

248
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,080
is R, 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane.

249
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,000
Let's try that same exercise with limonene, the compound responsible for that strong aroma

250
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,920
of citrus fruits.

251
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,600
And you'll recall limonene has a single chiral center, and it's located here.

252
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,880
Now I've drawn the limonene structure with the hydrogen in the back of the molecule as

253
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:02,840
well, so I'm ready to determine its RS designation without having to rotate the molecule any further.

254
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,720
Counting for my substituents 1 through 3, I draw a circle which is clockwise.

255
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,920
So this enantiomer of limonene has an R stereocenter.

256
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Of course we can draw a limonene with the S stereocenter simply by reflecting this molecule.

257
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,480
And the enantiomer of limonene actually doesn't smell like citrus at all, but more like

258
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,640
pine tar or turpentine.

259
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,200
So one very useful aspect of the RS system is actually how simple it is to tell when

260
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,920
you're dealing with enantiomers or mesocompounds in cases with two similar chiral centers.

261
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,320
So let's have another look at 2,4-dichloropentane as an example.

262
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,120
Here I have two chiral centers in the molecule, but is this molecule chiral overall?

263
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,720
The answer is no.

264
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:00,920
If I assign chirality to each stereocenter in this example, I find that I have 2R4S2,4-dichloropentane.

265
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:11,040
Now the mirror image of this molecule is 2S4R2,4-dichloropentane, which is exactly the same molecule.

266
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,280
A simple translation and rotation allows me to overlay the two molecules.

267
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,800
But the other two possibilities here are the RR and SS enantiomers, and these are in

268
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,480
fact chiral because they are not superimposable with their mirror images.

269
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,840
So these two are a set of enantiomers.

270
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,600
Now, con-angle pre-law convention is not only used in tetrahedral chiral centers, but also

271
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,960
in designating the stereoisomers which contain double bonds, which are not chiral, like our

272
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
beta-butylene.

273
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,280
So here are my two different stereoisomers of beta-butylene.

274
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,400
And we've already heard cis and trans mentioned a few times as a means of conveying the relationships

275
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,920
between the substituents along this double bond which has restricted rotation.

276
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,360
So there are two different isomers here which cannot interconvert easily because of the

277
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,160
pi bond.

278
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,640
In one of them, the larger groups are at opposition, and in the other one, the larger groups are

279
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,520
next to one another.

280
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,200
And because the second substituent in this case is hydrogen, it's very easy to tell when

281
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,760
I say trans or cis exactly what I'm talking about.

282
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,440
Clearly I'm talking about the non-hydrogen-based substituents.

283
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,000
So we would call this a cis-trans nomenclature system.

284
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,360
But what happens when we get to a more complex molecule that doesn't necessarily have hydrogens

285
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
bonded to all of its stereocenter carbons?

286
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,520
Let's take this example here.

287
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,720
At this point, I've got a molecule which actually has one of its sp2 carbons bearing

288
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,280
two different substituents, in this case a ch3-ch2 group and a chlorine group.

289
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,720
So looking at each of the two carbons in the sp2 system, the first one is very easy to determine.

290
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,040
My higher priority substituent, which I'll use in my naming, is clearly the ch3.

291
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,720
But how do I determine the other two?

292
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,800
Well, this is the problem that con angle pre-log solves.

293
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:14,640
If I turn my attention to that carbon and its substituents, I reach a carbon and a chlorine.

294
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,280
So clearly the chlorine has higher priority.

295
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,440
So these two higher priority substituents are as far apart as possible.

296
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,760
They're on opposite sides of the molecule.

297
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,840
And so we use the letter E to designate this isomer.

298
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,400
Had they been on the same side, we would have designated it as a Z isomer.

299
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,280
And these names come from the German meaning same and opposite.

300
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,480
So let's apply this to a different type of molecule, one that you might find in nature.

301
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,440
Geranial is a compound produced by flowers, as is the compound neral.

302
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,640
But they produce different floral smells, distinctly different.

303
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,880
And yet when we take a look at these two molecules, we see that the bond connectivity is identical.

304
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,280
So what's the source of the difference here?

305
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,840
Well, the source of the difference is that they are stereoisomers of one another.

306
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,960
If I take a look at the line angle formula for geranial,

307
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,120
and I choose my two highest con angle pre-log substituents compared to that of neral,

308
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,920
in geranial they're at opposition to one another, meaning this would be an E stereoisomer.

309
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,520
Whereas in neral, they're on the same side of the molecule,

310
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,880
meaning that they would be Z stereoisomer.

311
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,160
So in this case, just as in the case of limonene,

312
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,920
inverting a stereocenter causes a completely different smell to form in the molecule.

313
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,960
They clearly react differently with U.

314
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,080
So the difference between smelling like a lemon or a pine tree, or different kinds of flowers,

315
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,400
all comes down to something as simple as the inversion of a stereocenter.

316
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
That's remarkable.

317
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:02,880
So let's wrap up our discussion today by taking one last look at thalidomide from a stereochemistry perspective.

318
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,200
We know now that it's the R-antimer of thalidomide, which has the desirable sedative properties,

319
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,720
but the S-antimer causes the defects in developing fetuses.

320
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,240
So if I wanted to draw the stereoisomer of this molecule with the desirable pharmacological properties,

321
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,680
I'd have to first rank all four substituents using conical pre-law.

322
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:33,000
I have one group attached by a nitrogen, one by a hydrogen, and two groups attached by carbons.

323
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:42,040
Of those two groups attached by carbon, one has a C-H-H set of bonds, and the other O-O-N.

324
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,640
So I now have all the information I need to rank my substituents.

325
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,840
And now I just need to place the lowest in the back

326
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,480
and draw the remaining three in a clockwise fashion to complete the structure.

327
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,800
I've drawn the sedative version of thalidomide.

328
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,120
So the logical question one might ask here is, if we know that the R-antimer of thalidomide has favorable properties

329
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:12,600
and the S-antimer is terribly, terribly toxic, can we simply remove the S-antimer from the product?

330
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,960
Well, in the case of thalidomide, this is unfortunately not possible.

331
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,320
And the reason why goes back to our last lecture on acid-base chemistry.

332
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,400
See, because the hydrogen on the chiral center is weakly acidic,

333
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,200
it can be removed by the weak bases in your bloodstream.

334
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,520
And it's then replaced to the molecule from both sides,

335
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,000
meaning that it can actually reform the S-antimer in your bloodstream.

336
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,360
So any attempt to get pure arthalidomide into the bloodstream would only result in its conversion

337
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,760
back to what we call a racemic mixture or an equal mixture of the two enantiomers

338
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,880
within a matter of minutes.

339
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,080
But everything we learn today is not in vain.

340
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,480
There are many pharmaceutical products in use today,

341
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,920
things as simple as anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, opiates like methadone,

342
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,120
and even our antidepressant, fluoxetine, all of which contain sets of stereoisomers.

343
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,800
In some cases, only one of which has the desired pharmacological property.

344
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,720
But because we are aware of the phenomenon of chirality,

345
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,600
we know that we need to test both of those for toxicity before we put our drugs on the market.

346
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,960
A lesson learned from Thalidomide.

347
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,160
So let's review what we've learned today.

348
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,440
We've explored the idea of handedness and how chemists have given this phenomenon

349
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,120
a different name, chirality.

350
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,920
We saw how tetrahedral centers and molecules can be chiral

351
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,880
if they contain four distinct bonded substituents.

352
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,680
And we saw how handedness can be inverted by interchanging two of those substituents

353
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,040
on such a chiral center, creating sets of stereoisomers.

354
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,280
We took a look at some examples of stereoisomers, including enantiomers,

355
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,440
in which all the chiral centers have been inverted.

356
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,200
We looked at diastereomers, in which some but not all of the chiral centers have been inverted.

357
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,400
And we also saw a special case in which equal and opposite chiral centers

358
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,120
invert rendering a molecule A chiral, even though it has those chiral centers in it.

359
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,080
We've explored how it is possible for compounds to have stereoisomers,

360
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,760
even when they don't have chiral centers.

361
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,720
Most notably, this happens when compounds have double bonds with distinct substituents

362
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
on those sp2 hybridized carbons.

363
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,640
Now, next we met Robert Kahn, Chris Engeld, and Vladimir Prelog,

364
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,640
who devised a system for ranking substituents around stereocenters

365
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,240
so that we could have a simple convention for describing them to one another.

366
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,000
And we saw how chiral centers are categorized by the direction in which

367
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,200
the three highest priority substituents are seen

368
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,480
when the lowest priority substituent is in the back of the molecule,

369
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,240
R for clockwise, S for counterclockwise.

370
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,440
Then we took a look at stereoisomers containing double bonds,

371
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,400
and how they can be described using E and Z designations,

372
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,800
and how substituents ranked using the Kahn Engeld Prelog convention

373
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,920
allow us to determine our priorities for that naming system as well.

374
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,520
And finally, we used the example of thalidomide to demonstrate

375
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,360
the power of stereochemistry and the profound differences in properties,

376
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,320
which can result from a change as simple as reflecting just one chiral center.

377
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,920
Next time we're going to begin a series of lectures,

378
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,040
in which we categorize, name, and explore the structures

379
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,520
of various classes of organic compounds.

380
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:44,840
I'm looking forward to that, and I'll see you then.
