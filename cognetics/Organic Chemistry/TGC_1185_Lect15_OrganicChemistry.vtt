00:00.000 --> 00:18.080
Ben Franklin is purported to have once penned that beer is the best evidence we have that

00:18.080 --> 00:22.640
there is a God that he loves us and wants us to be happy.

00:22.640 --> 00:27.040
The accuracy of this quote is disputed by historians, but its sentiment is one which

00:27.040 --> 00:31.200
most of us probably share during a night of celebration with friends.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.720
So we've already taken a brief look at the structure, properties, and reactivities of

00:35.720 --> 00:36.720
ethanol.

00:36.720 --> 00:40.880
This is one of the key components of that delightful concoction.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.200
Then, the next morning arrives.

00:44.200 --> 00:49.000
And those of us who took the most extreme advantage of old Ben's good-hearted observation

00:49.000 --> 00:54.960
might wake to a headache, sensitivity to light, fatigue, and a general sense that maybe Dr.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.760
Franklin led us a bit astray.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.240
Of course, I'm talking about hangovers, the general sense of awfulness that comes along

01:02.240 --> 01:09.880
with the buildup of metabolites of the very compound we enjoyed so much the night before.

01:09.880 --> 01:14.240
We're now familiar with the structure of ethanol, also known as beverage alcohol.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.200
And we're aware of the presence of an sp3 hybridized oxygen that it bears in the form

01:18.200 --> 01:20.920
of a hydroxyl group.

01:20.920 --> 01:25.880
But enzymes in the liver convert ethanol into a new organic compound, actually several

01:25.880 --> 01:31.040
of them, which are easier to remove from the human body, but some of which have a significantly

01:31.040 --> 01:34.080
less pleasant effect on your mood.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.920
Today we're going to be taking a closer look at at least one of the chemicals which participate

01:37.920 --> 01:43.920
in this rite of passage for beer enthusiasts and wine lovers alike.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.560
Now we will not concern ourselves so much with the biological pathways to these products

01:47.560 --> 01:51.640
which occur in vivo, meaning in living organisms.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.840
But rather we're going to take more of a look at how organic chemists imitate this chemistry

01:55.840 --> 02:02.840
in a beaker, an environment which we commonly refer to as in vitro, meaning in glass.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.520
But before we can discuss the details of their synthesis and reactivity, we must first familiarize

02:07.520 --> 02:12.000
ourselves with their structure.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.920
Last time we investigated the structure, synthesis and reactivity of alcohols and ethers, which

02:16.920 --> 02:23.440
have an sp3 hybridized oxygen, which is single bonded to a carbon and one other atom, either

02:23.440 --> 02:28.920
hydrogen to form an alcohol or carbon to form an ether.

02:28.920 --> 02:33.320
Today we will look at a different class of oxygen containing compounds known as aldehydes

02:33.320 --> 02:40.280
and ketones, those in which we still have only one oxygen atom, but it's sp2 hybridized,

02:40.280 --> 02:47.280
meaning that it's double bonded to just one carbon atom.

02:47.280 --> 02:53.680
So let's have a look at just the sp2 part of this type of motif here.

02:53.680 --> 02:57.140
So right now what's connected to this carbon is really not of consequence.

02:57.140 --> 03:01.720
What's important is to look at the oxygen and carbon and how they've been connected

03:01.720 --> 03:03.880
to one another.

03:03.880 --> 03:07.320
Remember that in our alcohols and ethers, the oxygen had two single bonds, but here

03:07.320 --> 03:10.580
there's a double bond between the oxygen and the carbon.

03:10.580 --> 03:15.560
This means that both the oxygen and carbon must have an sp2 hybridization state, and

03:15.560 --> 03:18.480
even more importantly that there's a pi bond.

03:18.480 --> 03:24.120
So if I rotate this molecule so that we can see the bond and on, you can clearly see the

03:24.120 --> 03:28.680
sigma bond containing electron density in between the two atoms, but also the presence

03:28.680 --> 03:33.400
of a pi bond, which gives electron density above and below that bond.

03:33.400 --> 03:38.280
And that's going to be crucial to not only the physical, but also the chemical properties

03:38.280 --> 03:40.480
of this type of compound.

03:40.480 --> 03:44.800
So let's have a look at some very simple carbonyl containing compounds.

03:44.800 --> 03:45.920
Let's start with formaldehyde.

03:45.920 --> 03:51.200
This is the simplest possible carbonyl containing compound with a carbon oxygen double bond

03:51.200 --> 03:55.640
and bond angles of 120 degrees all the way around this carbon, right?

03:55.640 --> 04:00.960
That's what we would expect for an sp2 hybridized atom.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.760
The next most complex is acetaldehyde, in which we've added a methyl group to the carbon

04:05.760 --> 04:08.640
which is attached to our sp2 oxygen.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.520
This has a formula C2H4O.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.600
We can get even larger by adding a methyl group to the other side and create something

04:16.600 --> 04:21.400
called acetone, compound with which we're all very familiar.

04:21.400 --> 04:27.720
And I can continue extending these alkyl chains if I'd like, creating, for example, methylethylketone,

04:27.720 --> 04:31.440
which is a common solvent used in adhesives.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.400
Now all of these share one structural feature in common.

04:35.400 --> 04:41.960
That is the carbonyl group, an sp2 carbon double bonded to an sp2 oxygen.

04:41.960 --> 04:46.040
I've highlighted those here so you can see them well.

04:46.040 --> 04:50.440
Some of them have hydrogens attached to those sp2 carbons.

04:50.440 --> 04:55.360
When they have these, we call those hydrogens aldehyde hydrogens.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.400
But there are others which don't contain this particular type of hydrogen.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.280
They contain carbons that are bonded directly to the sp2 carbon only.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.440
This location is called an alpha carbon.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.640
So you can already see where we're going to draw a distinction here.

05:10.640 --> 05:16.880
Those carbonyls with which have aldehyde hydrogens tend to get the name aldehyde.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.280
And those which have only alpha carbons attached to the carbonyl carbon tend to get names

05:21.280 --> 05:23.080
that end in OWN.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.760
These are ketones.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.440
From an IUPAC nomenclature perspective, we treat both aldehydes and ketones as functional

05:32.440 --> 05:36.720
groups because as we'll see soon, they're very reactive.

05:36.720 --> 05:41.320
So in this example, I have to choose a parent chain which contains the carbon which is double

05:41.320 --> 05:45.760
bonded to the oxygen making up the carbonyl group.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.320
So this is a butanal molecule.

05:48.320 --> 05:53.120
The AL suffix lets me know that I'm dealing with an aldehyde.

05:53.120 --> 06:00.000
In other words, a carbonyl which has at least one hydrogen attached to its carbon.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.760
My butanal has a methyl substituent.

06:02.760 --> 06:06.840
So now all I have to do is label my chain in such a way that the functional group,

06:06.840 --> 06:11.080
which is highest priority, gets the lowest possible number.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.160
So clearly, my best choice is to label it in this way.

06:14.800 --> 06:22.000
If I label the other way, my butanal functional group ends up with a number 4 instead of 1.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.760
So I'm going to choose the top numbering scheme.

06:24.760 --> 06:31.760
And this would make the name of my compound 3-methyl 1 butanal, except that we often don't

06:31.760 --> 06:33.280
see the 1.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.000
And the reason for that, of course, is that aldehydes by definition have to end the carbon

06:38.000 --> 06:42.160
chain because one of their bonded partners must be a hydrogen.

06:42.160 --> 06:46.160
So to say 1 butanal is a little bit redundant.

06:46.160 --> 06:52.320
Now in the case of ketones, I'm going to follow the same protocol.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.440
Let's name this ketone.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.760
I'll choose my parent hydrocarbon, the longest possible one which contains the carbon which

06:59.760 --> 07:02.840
is part of my group.

07:02.840 --> 07:10.200
So there's my functional group at the second carbon in making this a pentanone.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.440
So I'll look at my prefixes.

07:12.440 --> 07:18.440
I'll have a chloro because I've got a chlorine which is also attached to the parent hydrocarbon.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.800
Now I give my addresses to these in such a way that the ketone functional group gets

07:22.800 --> 07:29.600
the lowest possible number, meaning that when I construct my name, I'll have a 4-chloro

07:29.600 --> 07:35.080
to pentanone.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.960
So now that we know a little bit about naming and identifying these ketones and aldehydes,

07:38.960 --> 07:42.960
let's take a look at their physical properties and what the introduction of this carbonyl

07:42.960 --> 07:46.400
bond really does for them.

07:46.400 --> 07:51.800
We'll start with an aldehyde, a very simple one like this propanal molecule.

07:51.800 --> 07:56.960
The propanal molecule has a carbon-oxygen double bond which creates a dipole, the positive

07:56.960 --> 08:01.600
end of the dipole at the carbonyl carbon, the negative end of the dipole at the carbonyl

08:01.600 --> 08:04.800
oxygen.

08:04.800 --> 08:09.720
This means that it's going to have an electronegative oxygen with freelone pairs which can act as

08:09.720 --> 08:14.480
a hydrogen bond acceptor, in other words it can hydrogen bond with other compounds which

08:14.480 --> 08:20.520
have OH, NH, and FH motifs in their functional group.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.640
But the propanal itself doesn't have such a bond, which means that it can't hydrogen

08:24.640 --> 08:27.120
bond to other propanal molecules.

08:27.120 --> 08:32.540
So this is not an H bond donor, only an H bond acceptor.

08:32.540 --> 08:37.940
When we turn our attention to ketones, we see, for example, in propanone, the exact

08:37.940 --> 08:39.660
same issue.

08:39.660 --> 08:43.940
We have a carbon-oxygen double bond with the positive dipole at the carbon, the negative

08:43.940 --> 08:49.260
dipole at the oxygen, and again we have lone pairs which can participate in H bonding with

08:49.260 --> 08:54.260
other types of molecules, but they can't hydrogen bond to themselves because they don't have

08:54.260 --> 08:59.300
the requisite OH, NH, or FH bond.

08:59.300 --> 09:03.420
So when we look at the boiling points of these compounds, we see something very different

09:03.420 --> 09:09.220
than we saw with the alcohols and ethers because neither of them can hydrogen bond well.

09:09.220 --> 09:12.740
Their boiling points are actually quite similar to one another.

09:12.740 --> 09:17.140
Recall that in the case of ethanol and dimethyl ether, that the boiling points differed by

09:17.140 --> 09:19.500
about 100 degrees centigrade.

09:19.500 --> 09:24.580
So in this case, we can see a very clear manifestation of the fact that neither of these two can

09:24.580 --> 09:26.580
hydrogen bond to themselves.

09:30.220 --> 09:35.780
In addition to being polar, these compounds are also amphoteric.

09:35.780 --> 09:41.380
We can see this by looking at a molecule of, this is acid aldehyde, if we take a look at

09:41.380 --> 09:47.820
its conjugate acid, we can protonate that oxygen from the carbonyl and create a resonance

09:47.820 --> 09:50.620
stabilized conjugate acid.

09:50.620 --> 09:56.100
Now it's not terribly stable, as you can see, the pKa is negative 7, so it's very acidic,

09:56.100 --> 10:01.260
but it can form, and it does have the effect of increasing the positive charge density

10:01.260 --> 10:02.780
around the carbonyl carbon.

10:02.780 --> 10:06.300
This will be very important when we get to reactivity.

10:06.300 --> 10:12.900
Similarly, carbonyl compounds can act as acids, but they don't lose the protein that you might

10:12.900 --> 10:15.180
think they do.

10:15.180 --> 10:20.380
Even in the case of aldehydes, the hydrogen attached to the sp2 carbon is not the most

10:20.380 --> 10:21.380
acidic carbon.

10:21.980 --> 10:27.620
In fact, the one that's removed most frequently is the adjacent alpha carbon, and the explanation

10:27.620 --> 10:31.980
for this is that it forms not only what we call a carbanion, which puts some negative

10:31.980 --> 10:37.780
charge density down here at the site of its removal, but it also creates a new resonance

10:37.780 --> 10:44.500
contributor called an enolate, where that negative charge is up on what was the carbonyl oxygen,

10:44.500 --> 10:49.860
and this provides a lot of stabilization to the conjugate base and results in a pKa of

10:49.860 --> 10:52.980
about 20 for compounds like these.

10:52.980 --> 10:58.860
Okay, so carbonyl compounds are named differently, they have different hydrogen bonding behavior,

10:58.860 --> 11:03.820
and they're amphoteric with slightly different pKa values than alcohols.

11:03.820 --> 11:08.140
But what really distinguishes the carbonyl motif from alcohols and ethers, and gives

11:08.140 --> 11:11.860
them such different reactivity, is the presence of that pi bond.

11:11.860 --> 11:16.220
So I'm going to take this motif and show it to you one more time on its side, and we're

11:16.220 --> 11:20.300
going to see exactly why and how these bonds react the way they do.

11:20.300 --> 11:25.380
Let's try formaldehyde, the simplest possible carbonyl-containing compound.

11:25.380 --> 11:30.060
We're all familiar with formaldehyde, and especially its primary application, which

11:30.060 --> 11:35.500
is a biological preservative, or we call it a fixative.

11:35.500 --> 11:40.580
But this is not the form of the molecule that actually performs that fixation.

11:40.580 --> 11:45.500
Formaldehyde, as I've drawn it here, does not react with proteins, it does not fix them

11:45.500 --> 11:49.500
in place, and it does not preserve animal tissue in that way.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.180
So what's going on here?

11:51.180 --> 11:53.620
Let's turn it on its side.

11:53.620 --> 11:57.620
So again, here are the regions of space where I expect the electrons involved in my pi

11:57.620 --> 12:00.100
bond to be.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.460
But there's another region of space that I'm concerned with.

12:02.460 --> 12:07.300
It's the area that new incoming electrons have to reach in order to create a new bond

12:07.300 --> 12:12.620
to the carbonyl carbon, and break the pi bond to the carbonyl oxygen.

12:12.620 --> 12:17.340
That region of space looks like this, and it's called an antibonding orbital.

12:17.340 --> 12:22.060
So in order to populate that antibonding orbital, an incoming nucleophile doesn't come from

12:22.060 --> 12:27.580
the backside directly, as we would expect in a traditional nucleophilic substitution.

12:27.580 --> 12:32.660
Instead, it comes in from above and below and slightly behind.

12:32.660 --> 12:37.780
So let's try to represent the reaction of formaldehyde with water, and a little bit

12:37.780 --> 12:42.740
of hydroxide, which is naturally present in the water, and see if we can make its actual

12:42.740 --> 12:45.780
functional form that serves as a biological fixative.

12:45.780 --> 12:50.260
Again, here's my molecule of formaldehyde, but now I'm going to put it in water, which

12:50.260 --> 12:54.140
naturally contains a small amount of hydroxide.

12:54.140 --> 13:00.420
Now that hydroxide can act as a nucleophile, and it's going to attack my carbonyl carbon

13:00.420 --> 13:01.420
like so.

13:01.420 --> 13:05.860
Now I've highlighted my two different oxygens so we can keep track of them, but they're

13:05.860 --> 13:10.540
actually still just ordinary run-of-the-mill oxygen atoms.

13:10.540 --> 13:15.180
So as that attack takes place, not only do I form a new sigma bond, but I also break

13:15.180 --> 13:18.740
the original pi bond from the carbonyl.

13:18.740 --> 13:22.380
So I've created this negatively charged species in the presence of water.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.380
This looks awfully basic, doesn't it?

13:24.380 --> 13:27.700
And water, as we all know, is a weak acid.

13:27.700 --> 13:34.980
So the water will very quickly transfer a proton and give me a new kind of molecule.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.300
This is called methylene glycol.

13:37.300 --> 13:42.460
It's methylene glycol that reacts with the tissues and animal samples to preserve them.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.140
Interesting, isn't it?

13:44.140 --> 13:48.620
We say formaldehyde is a great preservative, but in truth, the equilibrium constant for

13:48.620 --> 13:55.340
this interconversion is about 40, meaning that in any given aqueous solution of formaldehyde,

13:55.340 --> 14:01.140
somewhere around 98% of it is in this state as methylene glycol.

14:01.140 --> 14:06.820
So a solution of formaldehyde in water really isn't a solution of formaldehyde at all.

14:06.820 --> 14:09.980
It's actually a solution primarily of methylene glycol.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.740
This is a good thing because it's the solution of methylene glycol, called formalin, which

14:13.740 --> 14:17.380
has the desired preservative properties.

14:17.380 --> 14:21.420
In the crucial reaction, it's the hydroxyls of methylene glycol, which are removed to

14:21.420 --> 14:26.500
produce two molecules of water and a new link to nitrogen atoms found in proteins that make

14:26.500 --> 14:29.260
up the tissues of biological samples.

14:29.260 --> 14:35.420
Two hydroxyls means two links, and this crosslinking of proteins, which blocks them in place, preserving

14:35.420 --> 14:40.140
the tissue in all the fats, carbohydrates, and other biologic molecules entombed inside

14:40.140 --> 14:43.220
the matrix of the protein.

14:43.220 --> 14:47.940
No hydroxyl groups, no crosslinks, but it all starts with the addition of formaldehyde

14:47.940 --> 14:50.020
to a preservative solution.

14:50.020 --> 14:54.700
In light of this, it's clear why formaldehyde is the go-to carbonyl compound for this purpose.

14:55.260 --> 14:59.580
First it's the smallest possible molecule with a desired chemistry, helping it find

14:59.580 --> 15:06.220
its way into those interstitial spaces within and between proteins in a biological sample.

15:06.220 --> 15:10.140
But before we head any further into reactions involving ketones and aldehydes, let's first

15:10.140 --> 15:14.900
take a look at a few ways to make them.

15:14.900 --> 15:18.420
Aldehydes and ketones can be produced by a number of synthetic routes, some of which

15:18.420 --> 15:23.220
we're ready to investigate, and others of which are going to require a little more foundation.

15:23.220 --> 15:26.900
Now for today, let's concentrate on emulating the chemistry that goes on in your body as

15:26.900 --> 15:30.740
you sleep off that night of fun.

15:30.740 --> 15:34.660
In your body, ethanol is recognized by your liver as a toxin.

15:34.660 --> 15:38.900
Whether or not your brain agrees, as soon as the ethanol hits your bloodstream, enzymes

15:38.900 --> 15:42.980
in your liver go to work preparing to eliminate it from your system.

15:42.980 --> 15:48.180
Now in order to attenuate the neurotoxic effects of the ethanol and prepare it for removal,

15:48.180 --> 15:53.100
an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase converts the offending intoxicant into a more

15:53.100 --> 15:58.580
oxidized state, that of acid aldehyde.

15:58.580 --> 16:03.100
The process of enzymatic oxidation is complex and involves the assistance of large, complicated

16:03.100 --> 16:08.380
biomolecules, but it essentially consists of the removal of the hydroxyl proton and one

16:08.380 --> 16:13.540
of its neighbors, thereby producing a double bond between the carbon and oxygen.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.980
Essentially this is an oxidative elimination reaction.

16:17.980 --> 16:21.660
We call it oxidation because the central carbon is gaining additional attachment to

16:21.660 --> 16:28.580
oxygen atoms, in this case trading a single bond to oxygen for a double bond.

16:28.580 --> 16:33.460
The product aldehyde is eventually metabolized further as the process continues, but in the

16:33.460 --> 16:38.340
meantime it interferes with mitochondrial activity, liver function, and a host of other

16:38.340 --> 16:43.500
biological mechanisms contributing to the condition which we colloquially refer to as

16:43.500 --> 16:46.780
a hangover.

16:46.780 --> 16:51.100
In the laboratory, ketones and aldehydes can be produced using various oxidizing agents

16:51.100 --> 16:56.900
which accomplish the very same task that the alcohol dehydrogenase does in your body.

16:56.900 --> 17:02.060
A classic example of this technique is the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone

17:02.060 --> 17:05.260
using chromic acid.

17:05.260 --> 17:09.740
In this multi-step reaction, the secondary alcohol is substituted for one of the OH groups

17:09.740 --> 17:14.420
on the chromic acid, creating a compound known as a chromate ester.

17:15.420 --> 17:19.540
This mechanism depends on the presence of an alpha hydrogen on the starting material.

17:19.540 --> 17:24.860
A secondary alcohol has only one of these, so this oxidation can only take place once,

17:24.860 --> 17:30.900
ending at the ketone stage in which the carbonyl carbon has no more hydrogens to give up.

17:30.900 --> 17:35.780
In the case of primary alcohols, however, two oxidations can occur, leading not to the

17:35.780 --> 17:42.060
desired aldehyde, but rather to a more oxidized compound called carboxylic acid.

17:42.060 --> 17:48.340
So how do we stop the oxidation at that desired point if that's what we want to do?

17:48.340 --> 17:52.820
Well the key to stopping the oxidation selectively at the aldehyde stage is in remembering that

17:52.820 --> 17:57.940
aldehydes and aqueous solution tend to form reactive hydrates, those geminal dials like

17:57.940 --> 18:01.260
we saw in the case of formaldehyde.

18:01.260 --> 18:05.260
So to achieve our goal, we have to substitute a different oxidizing agent which is soluble

18:05.260 --> 18:09.980
in an organic solvent so we remove water from the process.

18:09.980 --> 18:14.280
Pyridinium chlorochromate is one reagent which proves very useful in the oxidation of primary

18:14.280 --> 18:19.420
alcohols to aldehydes in particular because of its solubility in solvents like methylene

18:19.420 --> 18:23.420
chloride which are anhydrous.

18:23.420 --> 18:30.940
So this reaction with PCC, Pyridinium chlorochromate, is actually the organic chemistry equivalent

18:30.940 --> 18:34.300
of the biological effects of this.

18:34.300 --> 18:39.300
This is the drug dysulfiram, more commonly known by its trade name, Antibus.

18:39.300 --> 18:44.980
Now, Antibus is often prescribed to discourage alcohol abuse in alcoholic patients and it

18:44.980 --> 18:51.500
does so by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, that enzyme which continues the process of

18:51.500 --> 18:56.700
oxidatively breaking down the alcohol metabolite acid aldehyde into more manageable and far

18:56.700 --> 18:59.140
less toxic acetic acid.

18:59.140 --> 19:05.820
So this would be our small molecule version of shutting down that system.

19:05.820 --> 19:11.220
Now, Antibus binds to and shuts down enzymes in the liver which further oxidize acid aldehyde

19:11.220 --> 19:14.420
and move it along that natural process of removal.

19:14.420 --> 19:20.140
So stopping the oxidation process for ethanol at the aldehyde step like this causes an unusually

19:20.140 --> 19:25.380
high level of acid aldehyde to build up in a patient's bloodstream which in turn causes

19:25.380 --> 19:29.300
what could best be described as a super hangover.

19:29.300 --> 19:33.780
PCC simply accomplishes the same effect on the lab bench.

19:33.780 --> 19:38.900
The difference is that it does so by preventing aldehyde hydrate formation instead of enzyme

19:38.900 --> 19:39.900
inhibition.

19:39.900 --> 19:44.580
It can be done not only for ethanol, but for practically any primary alcohol starting

19:44.580 --> 19:48.700
material that we can imagine.

19:48.700 --> 19:53.380
That's important for a chemist to always be cognizant of reversibility in chemical reactions,

19:53.380 --> 19:58.980
which is to say that today's starting materials may be tomorrow's products and vice versa.

19:58.980 --> 20:03.060
Today it might be our goal to produce an aldehyde from a primary alcohol or a ketone from a

20:03.060 --> 20:06.020
secondary alcohol by oxidation.

20:06.020 --> 20:10.740
But if I can do that, then there's almost certainly a way to somehow produce the alcohols

20:10.740 --> 20:14.460
from the associated carbonyl compounds.

20:14.460 --> 20:19.180
So let's begin our discussion on the reactivity of these compounds in that spirit.

20:19.180 --> 20:24.060
Since we oxidized alcohol to form acid aldehyde previously today, we should be able to find

20:24.060 --> 20:27.300
a way to reduce the acid aldehyde back.

20:27.300 --> 20:32.500
That's right, catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyls leads to an addition product which

20:32.500 --> 20:37.380
hydrogen gas is added across the carbonyl double bond.

20:37.380 --> 20:41.900
So the mechanism is completely analogous to hydrogenation of alkenes.

20:41.900 --> 20:46.220
And this method is often chosen in industrial settings where gas handling equipment is available

20:46.220 --> 20:50.740
and inexpensive hydrogen gas offsets the cost of the equipment.

20:50.740 --> 20:55.180
But in the laboratory, where we usually want to perform reactions on smaller scale, we

20:55.180 --> 20:59.820
often turn to the use of hydride reagents.

20:59.820 --> 21:04.340
Both sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride can accomplish this modification when

21:04.340 --> 21:08.740
added to a ketone or aldehyde in protic solvent.

21:08.740 --> 21:14.380
You see, the boron or aluminum in these reagents are both extremely electropositive and they

21:14.380 --> 21:19.020
make bonded hydrogens act more like hydride ions.

21:19.020 --> 21:24.560
These hydride ions are very nucleophilic and will attack the carbonyl very efficiently.

21:24.560 --> 21:29.580
The resulting alkoxide simply removes a proton from the solvent to become the neutral alcohol

21:29.580 --> 21:32.980
product.

21:32.980 --> 21:38.680
Just as with alcohols, aldehydes and ketones are amphiprotic or amphoteric.

21:38.680 --> 21:43.180
So we have to consider the possibility that ketones and aldehydes might act as nucleophiles

21:43.180 --> 21:46.500
or electrophiles depending on their pH environment.

21:46.500 --> 21:51.460
Again, just like alcohols, compounds containing carbonyl groups are prone to reactions under

21:51.460 --> 21:55.580
conditions of extreme pH, either high or low.

21:55.580 --> 22:00.980
When placed in a basic environment, deprotonation of an alpha carbon can form a resonance stabilized

22:00.980 --> 22:03.220
enolate nucleophile.

22:03.220 --> 22:07.720
The removal of the alpha proton produces a carbanion, but one which can easily be drawn

22:07.720 --> 22:12.300
with its charge delocalized onto the oxygen atom of the neighboring carbonyl.

22:12.300 --> 22:17.580
So in this state, the conjugate base of an aldehyde or ketone can act as a good nucleophile,

22:17.580 --> 22:21.420
attacking electrophiles and forming new carbon-carbon bonds.

22:22.260 --> 22:26.740
Now, neutral ketones and aldehydes can be considered to be weakly nucleophilic based

22:26.740 --> 22:31.100
on the formation of an enaltautomer, which forms when a proton from its alpha carbon

22:31.100 --> 22:34.900
is relocated to the carbonyl oxygen.

22:34.900 --> 22:41.220
But neutral ketones can also act as weak electrophiles, owing to the dipole between the carbonyl-carbon

22:41.220 --> 22:42.900
and oxygen atoms.

22:42.900 --> 22:48.060
Now, what's particularly interesting about carbonyls is the role and the ability of these

22:48.060 --> 22:52.940
compounds to undergo nucleophilic attack without the loss of a leaving group.

22:52.940 --> 22:57.100
Instead, those antibonding orbitals of the carbonyl, which reach out above and below

22:57.100 --> 23:02.180
the plane of the group itself, can be attacked, breaking only the pi bond and preserving the

23:02.180 --> 23:05.700
connection between carbon and oxygen.

23:05.700 --> 23:10.860
Now that process is even more favorable in acidic conditions, when the carbonyl compound

23:10.860 --> 23:13.920
is protonated at its oxygen.

23:13.920 --> 23:18.100
Reaction at that site increases the electrophilic character of the carbonyl-carbon by creating

23:18.100 --> 23:22.560
a resonance contributor with a positive formal charge at that atom.

23:22.560 --> 23:29.680
So, basifying and acidifying are both viable strategies for activating ketones and aldehydes,

23:29.680 --> 23:31.840
inducing them to react.

23:31.840 --> 23:37.400
And no reaction is a better example of this property than the aldol condensation, a reaction

23:37.400 --> 23:43.440
between two carbonyl compounds which can be conducted under either basic or acidic conditions

23:43.440 --> 23:46.140
with similar efficiency.

23:46.140 --> 23:50.480
The first report of an aldol condensation was given by French chemist Charles Adolf

23:50.480 --> 23:53.800
Wertz in 1872.

23:53.800 --> 23:59.000
Now Wertz discovered that addition of a strong mineral acid to ethanol led to a strange new

23:59.000 --> 24:06.240
product which shared properties with both ketones and alcohols.

24:06.240 --> 24:10.640
The reaction of one ethanol with another takes place when a portion of the sample becomes

24:10.640 --> 24:13.440
protonated at the carbonyl oxygen.

24:13.440 --> 24:19.560
So a mixture of both neutral aldehyde and protonated aldehyde needs to be present.

24:19.560 --> 24:23.640
Now the protonated aldehyde has a resonance contributor with positive charge density at

24:23.640 --> 24:28.960
the carbonyl-carbon and the neutral aldehyde can tautomerize to form a species known as

24:28.960 --> 24:35.440
an enol, for alkene and alcohol motifs which combine to make it up.

24:35.440 --> 24:40.040
So in this system that I've just set up, we have an electrophilic protonated aldehyde

24:40.040 --> 24:45.080
and a nucleophilic enol-tautomer, all the ingredients necessary for an addition reaction

24:45.080 --> 24:47.240
to take place.

24:47.240 --> 24:52.760
As the enol attacks the protonated carbonyl, a new alcohol group forms.

24:52.760 --> 24:56.760
The enol then quickly deprotonates to reform a carbonyl group.

24:56.760 --> 25:06.920
Our aldol condensation is complete and a beta-hydroxy ketone has formed.

25:06.920 --> 25:11.560
So words first accomplish this reaction by increasing the electrophilicity of a portion

25:11.560 --> 25:14.360
of aldehyde using acid.

25:14.360 --> 25:18.760
It wasn't long however before it was realized that the same result could be accomplished

25:18.760 --> 25:23.840
by instead increasing the nucleophilicity of a portion of aldehyde by addition of a suitable

25:23.840 --> 25:24.920
base.

25:24.920 --> 25:30.880
So the addition of a base like hydroxide or methoxide can cause a portion of ethanol to

25:30.880 --> 25:35.640
become deprotonated at its alpha-carbon which can participate in resonance and form that

25:35.640 --> 25:38.960
resonance stabilized enolate.

25:38.960 --> 25:45.740
So the enolate nucleophile attacks a neutral but electrophilic carbonyl carbon, breaking

25:45.740 --> 25:52.120
its pi bond and promoting a series of steps which lead to the same exact product as in

25:52.120 --> 25:57.120
words' acidic reaction.

25:57.120 --> 26:01.780
Reactions like the aldol reaction are a shining example of how carbonyl chemistry is a very

26:01.780 --> 26:07.960
versatile tool in organic synthesis, often leading us to consider making the same products

26:07.960 --> 26:10.820
under either acidic or basic conditions.

26:10.820 --> 26:15.340
It gives us a choice of reaction conditions which is a very nice thing to have in a complex

26:15.340 --> 26:19.060
synthesis.

26:19.060 --> 26:22.660
But carbonyl-containing compounds don't just react with themselves.

26:22.660 --> 26:29.100
They make great nucleophiles and electrophiles to react with a large library of other compounds.

26:29.100 --> 26:33.540
Another commonly used reaction employing ketones and aldehydes as electrophiles is the

26:33.540 --> 26:35.940
reactions with alcohols.

26:35.940 --> 26:41.140
When we do this, we get compounds reminiscent of hydrates like methylene glycol, but one

26:41.140 --> 26:46.420
or both of the OH hydrogens has been replaced with an alkyl group.

26:46.420 --> 26:52.100
In the case of an aldehyde like formaldehyde, replacement of 1OH leads to what we call a

26:52.100 --> 26:58.220
hemiacetal, while the replacement of both gives us an acetal.

26:58.220 --> 27:01.940
When the carbon bearing the two groups is instead derived from a ketone, meaning it

27:01.940 --> 27:08.460
has two R groups attached to the carbonyl carbon, we call the resulting compounds hemiacetals

27:08.460 --> 27:10.460
and ketals.

27:10.460 --> 27:17.060
So let's take a look at how these two motifs can be created using formaldehyde as an example.

27:17.060 --> 27:21.700
Now the formation of hemiacetals and hemiacetals from aldehydes and ketones are accomplished

27:21.700 --> 27:25.220
in exactly the same way that their hydrates are made.

27:25.220 --> 27:31.220
We simply substitute an alkoxide in place of the hydroxide nucleophile.

27:31.220 --> 27:35.940
After one nucleophilic attack has taken place, there's no good leaving group to depart and

27:35.940 --> 27:38.220
make room for a second attack.

27:38.220 --> 27:45.600
Therefore the reaction stops at the hemiacetal or hemi-ketal stage.

27:45.600 --> 27:51.820
We can instead create acetals and ketals by mixing aldehydes and ketones with an alcohol

27:51.820 --> 27:54.260
under acidic conditions.

27:54.260 --> 27:59.860
Under these conditions the carbonyl group can be protonated, making it a good electrophile.

27:59.860 --> 28:05.180
It's then attacked by the weakly nucleophilic alcohol through an SN1 reaction.

28:05.180 --> 28:09.980
This forms a protonated ether which we know will quickly lose its proton to solvent because

28:09.980 --> 28:14.100
of its very low pKa.

28:14.100 --> 28:19.740
But under acidic conditions a second attack is possible because the hemiacetal or hemi-ketal

28:19.740 --> 28:25.260
formed can be protonated to create an oxonium ion in which a water leaving group can be

28:25.260 --> 28:30.300
displaced by yet another alcohol nucleophile.

28:30.300 --> 28:34.700
This leads to the acetal or ketal depending on whether the starting material was an aldehyde

28:34.700 --> 28:39.180
or a ketone respectively.

28:39.180 --> 28:44.020
Both acetals and ketals are very stable to strong bases in nucleophiles, but they can

28:44.020 --> 28:50.100
be easily converted back into their ketone or aldehyde counterparts using acidic hydrolysis,

28:50.100 --> 28:54.020
essentially just reversing the reaction by adding water.

28:54.020 --> 28:58.020
Now these characteristics make acetals and ketals very useful as protecting groups in

28:58.020 --> 29:03.820
synthesis, masking reactive carbonyl sites which can later be unmasked after doing other

29:03.820 --> 29:08.660
chemical modifications to other regions of the molecule.

29:08.660 --> 29:14.100
So today we explored the properties and the reactivity of some simple carbonyl compounds.

29:14.100 --> 29:18.540
We discussed how the carbon-oxygen double bond necessitates an sp2 hybridization state

29:18.540 --> 29:24.020
for both atoms, leading to a trigonal planar geometry about the carbonyl carbon, leaving

29:24.020 --> 29:26.820
two available substrates.

29:26.820 --> 29:31.020
When one or both of those substrates is a hydrogen, we have an aldehyde.

29:31.020 --> 29:35.740
When neither are a hydrogen, we have a ketone.

29:35.740 --> 29:39.580
We reviewed nomenclature of these compounds, how the carbonyl is treated as a functional

29:39.580 --> 29:47.500
group and the suffixes al and own are used to designate aldehydes and ketones respectively.

29:47.500 --> 29:52.100
We explored how these compounds can be produced by oxidation of alcohols, using either aqueous

29:52.100 --> 29:58.380
chromic acid in the case of secondary alcohols to ketones or peridinium chlorochromate in

29:58.380 --> 30:04.540
an organic solvent in the case of primary alcohols to aldehydes.

30:04.540 --> 30:08.260
We then turned the tables and considered the reduction of aldehydes and ketones, using

30:08.260 --> 30:13.820
a familiar reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, which essentially reverses the oxidation process

30:13.820 --> 30:16.740
producing the alcohol.

30:16.740 --> 30:21.580
We also met sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride, reagents which act as a

30:21.580 --> 30:27.560
source of hydride nucleophiles, turning ketones and aldehydes into alkoxides, which quickly

30:27.560 --> 30:32.260
convert to alcohols and protic solvent.

30:32.260 --> 30:36.760
We discussed how carbonyl compounds react in substitution reactions, including their

30:36.760 --> 30:42.260
nucleophilic enolates which form under basic conditions and their electrophilic characteristics

30:42.260 --> 30:44.900
when protonated.

30:44.900 --> 30:49.060
We surveyed how these characteristics affect reactivity in the aldol condensation between

30:49.060 --> 30:54.500
two carbonyl compounds and how they can take place under basic or acidic conditions leading

30:54.500 --> 30:57.900
to essentially the same products.

30:58.900 --> 31:03.660
Finally we considered how aldehydes and ketones can be reacted with alcohols under basic conditions

31:03.660 --> 31:11.380
to form hemiacetals and hemiketals, or under acidic conditions to prepare acetals and ketals.

31:11.380 --> 31:15.260
And of course along the way we compared how some of these reactions are merely a clumsy

31:15.260 --> 31:20.180
attempt by chemists to duplicate feats of synthesis which go on in your own body with

31:20.180 --> 31:24.900
remarkably greater efficiency, even if they do come with a little headache.

31:25.900 --> 31:29.860
And that's all for this lesson, but next time we'll continue our tour of oxygen-containing

31:29.860 --> 31:35.060
compounds by considering those which contain multiple oxygen atoms with differing hybridization

31:35.060 --> 31:36.060
states.

31:36.060 --> 31:36.740
See you then.
