0	18000	So far, we've explored the structure of the atom and how it leads to chemical bonding between atoms.
18000	24000	We've looked at how those chemical bonds lead to molecular structures and some of the tools chemists use
24000	27000	to communicate changes in those structures through time.
27000	35000	Now, it may seem daunting when you consider the sheer number of possible structures and how they all might interact with one another.
35000	41000	But many reactions follow similar pathways, and generally they obey similar rules.
41000	46000	So chemists group reactions into just a few fundamental classes.
46000	52000	And probably the simplest of all these reactions is the proton transfer reaction,
52000	59000	in which an acid in a base exchange one simple hydrogen nucleus.
59000	64000	Now, I can practically guarantee that you did some acid-base chemistry at some point today.
64000	69000	Did you maybe take an an acid after a spicy meal? That was acid-base chemistry.
69000	73000	Maybe you noticed some marble statues outside were looking a bit weathered.
73000	75000	You were observing acid-base chemistry.
75000	79000	Or maybe you put a little lemon juice on your seafood to cut down that fishy smell.
79000	85000	Congratulations, you're a chemist who just performed an acid-base reaction.
85000	89000	Now, many of us are familiar with some of the more fundamental properties of acids.
89000	95000	For example, they tend to dissolve metals, cause color changes in certain substances,
95000	99000	and may have very accurate odors or sour tastes.
99000	106000	Now, the Greeks actually grouped sour tasting substances into a class of compounds called oxen.
106000	112000	And that sentiment is still evident today, as the Latin word for vinegar, acetum,
112000	116000	serves as the basis for the modern English word, acid.
116000	123000	So the chemical name for vinegar, acetic acid, literally translates to acetic acid.
123000	127000	And people think scientists don't have a sense of humor.
127000	131000	Now, granted, the name is a bit strange, but it's a fitting tribute to how influential
131000	136000	that simple little molecule has been in human history.
136000	139000	But what exactly makes something an acid?
139000	144000	Is there a certain molecular feature which endows acids with their properties?
144000	149000	Now, the property of acidity was originally associated with sourness in the taste of materials,
149000	152000	but that's an empirical observation.
152000	156000	Surely there must be some structural motif, which all acids share in common,
156000	161000	and which endows them with the properties observed by the ancient Greeks.
161000	166000	It was our friend Antoine Lavoisier, who turned his attention to this question in the 18th century,
166000	171000	still using the traditional definition of anything sour tasting.
171000	176000	But he also theorized that there was some material, some essence of acidity,
176000	180000	which was common to all compounds of this class.
180000	186000	Unfortunately, Lavoisier mistakenly theorized that it was the element oxygen which did this.
186000	193000	In fact, this is how oxygen got its name from the Greek root oxy, meaning sharp or sour.
193000	199000	Of course, we now know that Lavoisier was on the right track with assigning acidity to a specific element.
199000	203000	He was just unfortunate enough to guess the wrong one.
203000	210000	Acidity is, in fact, a property granted not by the presence of oxygen, but by the presence of hydrogen.
210000	213000	Now, not just any hydrogen will do, though.
213000	220000	Hydrogens have to be removed as H plus ions, so there needs to be a specific type of chemical bond which allows us to do this.
220000	230000	And, of course, hydrogen ions are essentially protons, so I'm going to use those terms interchangeably today.
230000	233000	You may also be familiar with the term base.
233000	237000	In chemistry, bases are the alter ego to acids.
237000	242000	The presence of bases lowers the concentration of hydrogen ions.
242000	249000	And in all of our examples at the beginning of this lecture, acids were transferring their acidic protons to another base.
249000	254000	The hydrochloric acid in your stomach was reacting with a basic antacid.
254000	258000	The carbonic acid in rainwater was reacting with a basic limestone.
258000	265000	And the citric acid in lemon juice was reacting with the bases in the seafood.
265000	276000	Sometimes, the transfer of protons from one molecule to another happens with desirable results, and sometimes with undesirable results, but always with powerful results.
276000	284000	The transfer of protons from acids to bases is by far the most common and arguably the most influential reaction in all of organic chemistry.
285000	295000	So let's start our discussion about acids and bases by defining exactly what they are from a chemical perspective.
295000	299000	There are three ways in which chemists categorize acids and bases.
299000	305000	Irenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis systems.
305000	309000	Now, each of these is named for the chemists who first proposed the system.
309000	314000	And each was devised to be most useful in a specific situation.
314000	319000	Irenius acids increase the concentration of protons when added to water.
319000	325000	And Irenius bases increase the concentration of hydroxide ions when added to water.
325000	335000	In the Bronsted-Lowry system, acids are still defined as proton donors, but bases are instead defined as proton acceptors.
335000	346000	Finally, Lewis acids are those species which can easily accept an electron pair to form a new bond, while Lewis bases donate electron pairs to those bonds.
346000	352000	This may seem a little bit odd since the process I just described can take place without a proton being involved,
352000	362000	but this definition allows us to extend acid-base categorization beyond solutions in water, bringing it into solvents more commonly used by the organic chemists.
362000	372000	So we will revisit Lewis acid-base theory in many of our coming lectures, but for today we're going to focus on the Bronsted-Lowry definition.
372000	382000	So now that we've made the decision to continue our discussion today using Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases, that is, acids donating protons and bases accepting them,
382000	390000	we can turn our attention to modeling reactions involving this transfer more closely.
390000	398000	Now proton transfer reactions are usually very fast, reaching equilibrium long before other reactions can occur.
398000	408000	There are of course exceptions to this rule, but in general we can expect that a system will reach its most stable protonation state long before any other reactions can occur.
408000	417000	Just like the reaction between your lemon juice and your fish is finished before you even begin enjoying your meal.
417000	426000	Now the proton transfer reaction is in equilibrium. It's a state of dynamic interconversion between or among products and reactants.
426000	434000	In some cases, just a small amount of products coexist with reagents at equilibrium, and in others the roles may be reversed,
434000	440000	with a sample consisting of nearly all products and just a small amount of reactants.
440000	449000	The extent to which this equilibrium lies in favor of products and reactants is dependent on the strengths of the acids appearing in the equation.
449000	453000	So let's take a look at one of these reactions now.
453000	456000	No, the slide is not laughing at you.
456000	466000	HA is actually how organic chemists write a generic Bronsted-Lowry acid when it's really not too important to us what the rest of the molecule is comprised of.
466000	470000	So for the moment I'm going to use this designation.
470000	482000	So acids HA we expect will dissociate into a proton and whatever's left over, in this case a minus, and we call a minus a conjugate base.
482000	493000	So my proton dissociation reaction has taken place here now, and I have my acidic hydrogen and I also have what we call the conjugate base.
493000	505000	Now just like our Haber-Bosch process, we can model the dissociation of an acid as an equilibrium, and when we do this we can calculate an equilibrium constant.
505000	518000	So the equilibrium constant for this process is calculated as the concentration of protons times the concentration of conjugate base divided by the concentration of the conjugate acid.
518000	533000	Now we give it a special subscript here, A, and really this is calculated just like any other KEQ, but we give it the subscript A so that the reader knows that we're talking about this specific type of chemical reaction.
533000	541000	But the catch is that KA values can be very, very large or very, very small, and the numbers can become somewhat unwieldy.
541000	548000	So we often report on the strength of an acid using something called the pKa.
548000	553000	Now the pKa is simply the negative logarithm of KA itself.
553000	565000	So by doing this we've changed our number not only in magnitude, but we've also flipped the relationship over, whereas KA gets larger as the proton concentration increases, meaning a stronger acid,
565000	575000	the pKa actually gets smaller as proton concentration increases, meaning that a smaller pKa is equal to a stronger acid.
575000	589000	So using this system, a KA of 0.1 becomes a pKa of 1, while a KA of 0.01 becomes a pKa of 2, and a KA of 0.001 becomes 3, and so on.
589000	592000	These are much more manageable numbers.
592000	597000	Now pKa values are a valuable means of quickly comparing acid strengths.
597000	608000	For example, if I were to show you the pKa values for a few acids with which you're likely to be familiar, I can quickly scan that list, and I can say that mole for mole,
608000	614000	vinegar is about 100 billion times more acidic than ethanol.
614000	624000	Because their pKa values differ by 11, so their dissociation constants differ by a factor of 10 to the 11th.
624000	632000	Hydrochloric acid has a pKa of about negative 6, making it 100 billion times more acidic than vinegar.
632000	640000	So you can see how massive the scale of acidity can be, and we use pKa to navigate it more quickly.
640000	642000	But this is only half of the picture.
642000	651000	If proton transfer occurs between an acid and a base, we certainly have to consider the properties of the base partner, right?
651000	655000	So let's take a look at an example.
655000	662000	If we're interested in determining the extent to which a proton transfer reaction like this one would take place,
662000	669000	it's easier for us to think about if we break it down into two different acid dissociation reactions.
669000	676000	This would be the reaction between our acid and its conjugate base, and our reactant base and its conjugate acid.
676000	682000	So when I break my equation down into these two sub-equations, it's a little bit easier for me to see.
682000	691000	First I have the acid dissociation of Ha. That equilibrium constant is defined as Ka.
691000	698000	The second part of my reaction I can model as the acid association of this acid here, Ha prime.
698000	708000	So the equilibrium constant for the reaction as I've written it is the reciprocal of Ka for this particular acid.
708000	711000	So why would I want to break this down this way?
711000	722000	Well, the reason is I can calculate Keq for a total process using the product of the equilibrium constants for all of the processes which add up to create it.
722000	735000	In other words, the equilibrium constant for my proton transfer reaction is simply equal to Ka for the dissociating acid divided by Ka for the newly formed conjugate acid.
735000	742000	And in this way I can determine whether my equilibrium will shift to the right or the left or somewhere in between.
742000	747000	Remember that example about using lemon juice to cut down on the fishy smell?
747000	751000	Well, this is the proton transfer reaction that goes on.
751000	757000	The principal acid component of lemon juice is citric acid.
757000	763000	And the basic compounds in fish that give them that characteristic smell is called methylamine.
763000	768000	Now this is just one of many compounds, but they're all of a similar ilk.
768000	779000	And what goes on during this reaction is a proton is transferred from citric acid creating its conjugate base to the methylamine creating its conjugate acid.
779000	787000	So citric acid and methylamine react to form dihydrogen citrate and methyl ammonium.
787000	794000	So we want to move that acidic proton from one side to the other, but we don't know the extent to which it will occur just yet.
794000	801000	To do this, to determine how far it will go, we can take a look at the conjugate acid and conjugate base for the reactants,
801000	808000	and we find out that the conjugate acid in this particular pair has a pKa of 3.2.
808000	815000	If we turn our attention to the base, methylamine, and look at its conjugate acid, methyl ammonium,
815000	821000	we discover that the acid in this particular set has a pKa of 10.6.
821000	827000	So if we want to know exactly how far this equilibrium will shift, we want to answer that question,
827000	836000	to what extent will the reaction take place, we can simply compare the pKa values of citric acid to methyl ammonium.
836000	841000	So here I've done it as a keq, but remember the pKa's are here in the exponents.
841000	849000	So using this equation, I've determined that the equilibrium constant for this reaction is about 10 to the 7.4 power.
849000	852000	That's 50 million.
852000	856000	So let's think about what that means for the reaction.
856000	861000	That means that the equilibrium which will be established between equal amounts of citric acid and methylamine
861000	866000	will favor the products by about 50 million times.
866000	874000	So for every one of those smelly methylamines that remains in your meal, 50 million of them will have been neutralized.
874000	881000	That's pretty impressive.
881000	887000	Now so far we've managed to demonstrate how one can compare acid strengths and predict the outcome of a proton transfer reaction
887000	892000	using acid dissociation constants or pKa values.
892000	896000	Now these two parameters are a reflection of acid strength.
896000	901000	But what exactly is it that makes an acid strong or weak?
901000	909000	Can we predict these properties or are we at the mercy of empirical scientific observation to determine those values?
909000	913000	Well the answer to the question lies somewhere in between the extremes.
913000	918000	Careful consideration of a compound structure allows us to estimate its acidity
918000	922000	or make an assertion about the relative acidities of two compounds,
922000	927000	though not necessarily to predict their exact pKa values.
927000	932000	And since the loss of a proton by an acid always produces its conjugate base,
932000	938000	one way to predict acidity is to simply assess the stability of the conjugate base which forms.
938000	947000	More stable conjugate base means a stronger acid with a higher kA and a lower pKa.
947000	954000	In general there are two major factors which combine to affect the stability of these conjugate bases in organic compounds.
954000	958000	The first is the electronegativity of nearby atoms in groups,
958000	964000	which cause electrons to be pulled away from the basic site where the proton would be held.
964000	970000	The second is nearby pi systems providing the stabilizing effect of resonance.
970000	974000	And both of these factors affect stability in essentially the same way.
974000	982000	They're spreading out and delocalizing the charges that conform when a proton removal takes place.
982000	990000	So let's begin this exercise by considering the inductive effect on a simple organic acid with which you may be familiar.
990000	997000	We're going to start with ethanol and then we'll look at a few of its derivatives.
997000	1002000	So today we're going to compare the relative acidities of five different organic compounds.
1002000	1013000	Trifluoromethanol, difluoromethanol, dichloromethanol, a compound known as 2-2 dichloroethanol, and ethanol itself.
1013000	1017000	Now I've already arranged them in order of decreasing acidity.
1017000	1024000	And the total range of acidity here goes from a pKa of 12.4 to a pKa of about 16.
1024000	1032000	So stop and think about that. We're talking about 50,000 fold acidity increase as we add these chlorines and fluorines to the molecule.
1032000	1040000	So the logical question here is why does the addition of a halogen to this molecule have such an effect on acidity?
1040000	1045000	Well the reason behind this is easy to see when we compare three of these compounds.
1045000	1054000	I'm going to use trifluoromethanol, 2-2 dichloroethanol, and ethanol itself to try to explain this phenomenon.
1054000	1063000	Now we know already that halogens are very electronegative. Fluorine in fact is the most electronegative element of all.
1063000	1073000	So in our conjugate bases as I've drawn them here, I have a large quantity of highly electronegative elements very close to the basic site.
1073000	1081000	In other words, I placed really strong dipoles nearby that are pulling electron density away from the basic site.
1081000	1086000	Less electron density at the basic site means less negative charge.
1086000	1090000	And less negative charge means it doesn't attract and hold protons as well.
1090000	1098000	So this is our explanation for why trifluoromethanol is so much more acidic than a simple alcohol like ethanol.
1098000	1104000	Now I take a look at my dichloroethanol molecule here. A similar effect is going to take place.
1104000	1114000	But the dipoles are smaller because of the reduced electronegativity of chlorine and they're farther away in space from the basic site.
1114000	1119000	This means that the effect of the chlorine atoms will not be as strong as those from the fluorines.
1119000	1127000	So they will attenuate the negative charge at the basic site a little bit, but not quite as much as the fluorines did.
1127000	1132000	And finally, of course, we have ethanol, which doesn't have any electronegative elements attached.
1132000	1138000	And so there is no way for this conjugate base to distribute its negative charge and decrease its own reactivity.
1138000	1145000	So this leads to a more stable conjugate acid and explains why the pKa of ethanol is so much higher.
1145000	1154000	So there are three things at work here. The electronegativity of the attached elements, the quantity of those elements that are attached,
1154000	1159000	and the proximity of those elements or substituents to the actual basic site.
1159000	1165000	So smaller fluorines, closer in greater quantity, lead to a stronger acid.
1165000	1170000	But that's not the only factor. Remember, we also said that resonance was important.
1170000	1173000	So let's take a look at some acids in which that trend occurs.
1173000	1180000	Here are three organic acids, naphthoic acid, benzoic acid, and the very familiar acetic acid.
1180000	1185000	I've highlighted their acidic protons here in blue so that we can see where they are.
1185000	1191000	And now I'm going to switch these structures over to something that's a little bit easier to look at.
1191000	1196000	Now, my acetic acid has a pKa that's about a full unit above that of naphthoic acid.
1196000	1203000	So something about adding these rings of carbon atoms with sp2 hybridization is increasing the acidity,
1203000	1207000	which means that it's stabilizing the conjugate bases.
1207000	1213000	So let's look at those conjugate bases now and see if we can figure out what's going on.
1213000	1216000	Well, here are my conjugate bases with the charges in place.
1216000	1220000	And the first thing that I'd like to point out to you is that just because we have this carbonyl here,
1220000	1225000	common to all of them, this particular group, which we call a carboxylic acid,
1225000	1228000	we'll take a much closer look at this later in the course,
1228000	1231000	but that entire group can distribute some of that negative charge,
1231000	1239000	which explains why all three of these compounds have pKa values that are so drastically low compared to ethanol.
1239000	1243000	But why is benzoic acid more acidic than acetic acid?
1243000	1247000	And why is naphthoic acid even more acidic than benzoic acid?
1247000	1251000	The reason is that we can draw resonance contributors for these two molecules
1251000	1255000	in which the negative charge has moved into the ring.
1255000	1258000	I'm not going to draw those contributors for you, but I'm going to show you their general effect.
1258000	1262000	And that is to attenuate even more of that negative charge in benzoic acid
1262000	1265000	and even more so in naphthoic acid.
1265000	1270000	So again, the most stable conjugate base belongs to the strongest conjugate acid.
1270000	1277000	So the trend holds, this is why we have to consider not only electronegativity, quantity and proximity of groups,
1277000	1281000	but also whether or not those groups are in resonance with the basic site.
1282000	1286000	But not all acids are so simple.
1286000	1293000	Ethanol, trifluoroethanol, acetic acid and benzoic acid all clearly have just one acidic hydrogen,
1293000	1299000	because their other hydrogens are bonded strongly and directly to the carbon scaffold.
1299000	1303000	So their acid-base chemistry is limited to a simple two-state system
1303000	1307000	in which the molecule is either protonated or deprotonated.
1307000	1313000	We call these types of acids monoprotic, since they have just one acidic hydrogen,
1313000	1317000	which can be removed under all but the most extreme conditions.
1319000	1325000	Now this makes acid-base equilibria involving monoprotic acids very easy to model,
1325000	1329000	since there's only two potential states, protonated or deprotonated.
1329000	1333000	But let's take a look at that citric acid molecule one more time.
1333000	1340000	In our initial example, I fudged a little bit and implied that citric acid had just one acidic proton
1340000	1343000	and only one associated pKa value,
1343000	1346000	that which governs the removal of its most acidic proton,
1346000	1349000	producing the associated conjugate base.
1351000	1353000	But take a closer look at that conjugate base.
1353000	1355000	It contains other acidic hydrogens,
1355000	1359000	which might be removed if a proton transfer reaction were occurring.
1360000	1364000	This means that the citric acid can, and sometimes actually does,
1364000	1368000	lose two or even three protons in an acid-base reaction.
1369000	1373000	When an acid can do this, we refer to it as a polyprotic acid,
1373000	1376000	since it has multiple acidic hydrogens.
1378000	1381000	The conjugate bases, which still contain some acidic hydrogens,
1381000	1385000	have the very interesting property of being able to act either as an acid,
1385000	1387000	losing another proton,
1387000	1391000	or as a base, retrieving the proton that it had lost before.
1392000	1397000	Now, we call species like this, which can act as acids or bases, amphoteric.
1399000	1404000	So, modeling the behavior of citric acid in a proton transfer reaction
1404000	1408000	is actually a bit more complex than I had originally led you to believe.
1409000	1412000	To be sure that we're modeling the behavior accurately,
1412000	1416000	we must consider the fact that it can undergo three separate acid associations.
1417000	1422000	Citric acid to dihydrogen citrate, with a pKa of about 3.2.
1423000	1428000	Dihydrogen citrate to hydrogen citrate, with a pKa of 4.8.
1429000	1435000	And finally, hydrogen citrate to citrate ion, with a pKa of 6.4.
1436000	1438000	Remember that in our original example today,
1438000	1442000	we used citric acid to neutralize an equal amount of methylamine,
1442000	1446000	producing methyl ammonium ion and dihydrogen citrate ion.
1447000	1452000	But we now know that the resulting dihydrogen citrate ion can also react as an acid.
1453000	1456000	Of course, it's a weaker acid than citric acid itself,
1456000	1461000	since it's already accumulated some negative charge as a result of the loss of its first proton.
1461000	1464000	But since that dihydrogen citrate has a pKa,
1464000	1467000	just 1.6 units greater than citric acid,
1468000	1471000	we know that it can act as an acid about 50 times weaker.
1472000	1475000	So mixing equal amounts of methylamine and citric acid
1475000	1479000	will actually produce a mixture of about 98% dihydrogen citrate ions
1479000	1482000	and 2% hydrogen citrate ions.
1483000	1487000	Now this means that our original assumption is probably pretty valid
1487000	1489000	when you're only adding an equal amount of methylamine.
1489000	1492000	After all, 98% is a pretty good number.
1493000	1497000	Now, if we add another molar equivalent of methylamine, however,
1497000	1499000	for a total of two molar equivalents,
1499000	1503000	we can create a mixture which is nearly all hydrogen citrate.
1504000	1509000	And the addition of a third molar equivalent will all but completely convert that into citrate.
1510000	1515000	Now all this is true because the pKa of the methyl ammonium is somewhere around 11.
1515000	1517000	It's much higher than any of those three acids.
1517000	1521000	So we can decompose the citric acid all the way down to citrate
1521000	1524000	using the proper amount of a strong enough base.
1527000	1530000	So in truth, to neutralize one mole of methylamine,
1530000	1534000	we really only need to add one-third of a molar equivalent of citric acid
1534000	1536000	because that citric acid is polyprotic,
1536000	1541000	having three protons, all of which are acidic enough to react with the methylamine.
1542000	1546000	Now, I'd like to talk to you about one more special type of proton transfer reaction
1546000	1548000	called tautomerization.
1549000	1556000	Now, tautomers are defined as two neutral species which differ only by the position of a single proton.
1557000	1561000	An example of this is a compound with which we're familiar, acetone.
1561000	1565000	Now, you may not think about the CH protons of acetone
1565000	1567000	as being very acidic,
1567000	1572000	but they actually can be removed in small quantities by strong enough bases.
1572000	1576000	And when this happens, the proton can be relocated to the oxygen atom,
1576000	1579000	creating a species where the proton has been moved,
1579000	1581000	so I'm going to have to put some charge units in here
1581000	1586000	because I've moved only the hydrogen nucleus up to that oxygen.
1587000	1590000	Now, naturally, we can take a look at this and say to ourselves,
1590000	1593000	the acetone looks an awful lot more acidic than the proton.
1593000	1595000	Naturally, we can take a look at this and say to ourselves,
1595000	1597000	the acetone looks an awful lot more stable.
1597000	1599000	There's no charge separation,
1599000	1601000	and the oxygen has two bonds instead of three.
1601000	1606000	There are many things about this structure which make it look much more stable than this.
1607000	1610000	But this species has got a card to play.
1610000	1613000	It has an sp2 carbon separating those charges,
1613000	1619000	which means that it can relocate the pi electrons associated with the carbon-oxygen double bond
1619000	1624000	to create a new neutral species in which the proton still remains on the oxygen.
1625000	1628000	So removing this rather unstable intermediate,
1628000	1635000	I can see that I now have two essentially similar stability species which can exist.
1635000	1639000	So the key to this is that sp2 carbon in the middle there.
1640000	1642000	Now, when that's not available,
1642000	1645000	we can still have a proton transfer within a molecule,
1645000	1648000	but we create something different called a zwitterion.
1648000	1654000	A zwitterion is something that differs from the neutral species only by the relocation of a proton.
1654000	1658000	But in this case, our zwitterion, like the amino acid glycine,
1658000	1661000	cannot attenuate that charge that is built up.
1662000	1666000	So in the charged species, we now have an sp3 carbon in between,
1666000	1671000	which means that there is no way to move electrons from one site to the other
1671000	1673000	in an attempt to neutralize that charge.
1674000	1678000	Now, even though that's true, this equilibrium does actually exist,
1678000	1681000	and we do find glycine in its zwitterionic state,
1681000	1684000	zwitter being the German word for hybrid.
1685000	1691000	The reason we find it in that state is that the pKa of a neutral carboxylic acid like this one
1691000	1693000	is somewhere around 4,
1693000	1701000	whereas that of the charged ammonium motif here is somewhere around 10 or 11.
1701000	1705000	So it's just like a proton transfer between, say, citric acid and methyl ammonium,
1705000	1709000	except that they've been tied together by an sp3 carbon.
1709000	1713000	So these are the two types of intramolecular proton transfers,
1713000	1717000	which we'll need to understand to navigate some of our future chemical reactions.
1720000	1725000	So today we tackled the first of many reactions that we'll be studying over the course,
1725000	1727000	the proton transfer reaction.
1728000	1732000	We started by discussing the three classifications of acids and bases,
1732000	1734000	specifically the Arrhenius definition,
1734000	1738000	in which acids are proton donors and bases hydroxide donors.
1739000	1741000	We looked at Bronsted-Lowry definition,
1741000	1745000	in which acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors.
1745000	1747000	And finally at the Lewis definition,
1747000	1750000	which focuses on the electron accepting ability of acids
1750000	1753000	and the electron donating ability of bases.
1754000	1757000	We then turned our attention to the reaction between acids and bases,
1757000	1760000	and how the pKa of competing acids can be used
1760000	1763000	to predict the outcome of a proton transfer reaction.
1764000	1769000	Then we took a look at exactly what it is that makes one acid stronger than another.
1769000	1772000	We discussed how the stability of the conjugate base is often the key
1772000	1775000	to predicting the acidity of a particular compound,
1775000	1780000	and how distribution of charge usually goes hand in hand with that stability.
1781000	1784000	Next we addressed polyprotic acids,
1784000	1786000	which have multiple acidic protons,
1786000	1788000	and the formation of these amphoteric species,
1788000	1792000	which can act either as an acid or as a base.
1793000	1798000	And finally we took a look at two kinds of intramolecular proton transfer reactions.
1798000	1800000	We saw how in some molecules,
1800000	1806000	that intramolecular proton transfer can produce new neutral forms called tautomers.
1806000	1809000	And in others it can generate charge separation,
1809000	1812000	and we call those species zwitter ions.
1814000	1815000	In our next lecture,
1815000	1818000	we're going to turn our attention back to structures again,
1818000	1822000	discussing a fascinating and crucial concept in organic chemistry,
1822000	1824000	the handedness of molecules.
1824000	1826000	I'll see you then.
