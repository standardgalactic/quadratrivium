1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,280
In 1815, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history took place at Mount Tambora

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,480
in Indonesia.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,480
This colossal volcanic eruption ejected an unfathomable amount of volcanic ash and debris

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,560
into the atmosphere, blocking out a significant fraction of the sunlight reaching the Earth's

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
surface.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,800
This sent parts of the world into a chill from which they did not awaken until the following

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
year.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,400
In the middle of the year of 1816, this cloud drifted over Western Europe, leading to what

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,160
is sometimes referred to as the year without a summer, which brought a devastating famine.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,920
The result of this was a sustenance crisis, the likes of which the Western world has not

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,520
seen in the 200 years since.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,720
Particularly hard hit in this crisis was the nation of Germany, where food riots, demonstrations,

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,640
and looting were commonplace that year.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,080
One can only imagine how suddenly an incomprehensibly difficult life must have become for the people

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,200
of Europe as this crisis played itself out.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,880
One of those people was a 13-year-old boy by the name of Justice Liebig.

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,080
Many historians believe that his traumatic event taking place at such a formative age

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,320
so shook this young man's faith in Mother Nature to provide that he dedicated his life

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,520
later to researching agricultural chemistry.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,440
His motivations aside, it's undeniable that Liebig's contributions to the field of chemistry

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,320
in the decades following the year without a summer opened up a whole new world of chemicals

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,720
to study.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,360
Specifically, those chemicals involved in the biology of plants.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,240
Liebig earned his doctorate in 1822 at the University of Erlangen in Bavaria.

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,560
After that, in his laboratory in Gießen, Germany, and later Munich, Liebig spent much of his

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,800
career characterizing and synthesizing a broad range of biologically relevant compounds

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,960
from plants.

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,960
So prolific was his work that he's often cited as the father of agricultural chemistry,

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,360
a well-deserved acknowledgement.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,520
Today, we will swing a pretty wide turn in our study of organic chemistry.

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,840
We're going to move from the realm of the harsh reaction conditions and unfamiliar materials

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,800
of our synthesis lectures into a more biologically oriented look at organic chemistry, and we're

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,520
going to start with one of the classes of compounds that Liebig himself studied.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,500
Now, from the sweet ingredient of sodas like this sugar to the fibrous particles making

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,040
up this wood to the tough shell of crabs and lobsters, all the members of this extraordinarily

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,720
diverse family of materials have one thing in common.

37
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,200
They're all made up of the same general class of organic compounds, carbohydrates.

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,760
In modern culture, we're trained to think of carbohydrates as not much more than a

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,280
dietary source of calories, but we're about to see that carbohydrates make up not only

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,720
small molecules of caloric value, but also other familiar materials like clothing, building

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,640
materials, joint supplements, and even body armor.

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,120
In short, we will take a look at these and other biologically important materials crafted

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,840
from carbohydrates from the perspective of an organic chemist.

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,160
Before we break into the exciting and complex world of materials fashioned from carbohydrates,

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,800
let's begin by defining a carbohydrate.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,240
This term is sometimes confused by students with the similar sounding hydrocarbons that

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,720
we encountered earlier in our course.

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,360
The distinction here is that the hydro of hydrocarbons refers to just hydrogen, while

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,880
the hydrate of carbohydrates refers not just to hydrogen, but to water, which includes

50
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,400
one half molar equivalent of oxygen.

51
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,000
So as I mentioned before, carbohydrate refers to a compound composed of carbon and water

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
in equal parts.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,240
So they'll have a generic formula of CnH2oN.

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,320
Now we've come pretty close to carbohydrates before with some of the compounds that we've

55
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,640
looked at previously.

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,960
Take the example of glycerol.

57
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,920
Now glycerol's formula is C3H8O3.

58
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,120
So it's got a little bit too much hydrogen in the formula to meet our requirements to

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,640
be classified as a carbohydrate.

60
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,440
But I can modify my glycerol structure slightly to make a carbohydrate.

61
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,520
So let's bring up two copies of glycerol here and modify them to create a carbohydrate.

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,760
I've got to get rid of two hydrogens.

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,120
So let's start by removing two hydrogens from the end of my glycerol molecule.

64
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:17,240
When I do this, I can insert a carbon-oxygen double bond, creating C3H6O3, a carbohydrate.

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,920
But I can also remove two hydrogens from the center.

66
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:30,360
If I remove two hydrogens from an interior motif here, I get C3H6O3, also a carbohydrate.

67
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,160
But I've changed the names to glyceraldehyde and glycerone in my two structures.

68
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,920
Glyceraldehyde because the carbonyl is a terminal position like it would be in an aldehyde.

69
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,120
Glycerone because the carbonyl is in an interior carbon just as it would be if these groups

70
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
were aliphatic and I were dealing with a ketone.

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
So what I've done here is created three different classes of compounds.

72
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,840
Glycerol would be considered a sugar alcohol, whereas my glyceraldehyde and glycerone are

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,600
sugars which we call individually aldoses and ketoses, referring to whether the carbonyl

74
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,520
is internal or external.

75
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,760
Now I've mentioned Alexander Butlerov before, most notably as the mentor of two of the most

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,840
revered and mutually repulsed chemists of the 19th century, Markovnikov and Zetsev.

77
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,040
And just as he's contributed to many other fields, the history of carbohydrate chemistry

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,720
would not be the same without him.

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,840
In 1861 Butlerov published a paper entitled, Formation of a Sugar-like Substance, in which

80
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,400
he detailed a synthesis using formaldehyde and a base to form what he believed to be

81
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,840
simple sugars.

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,120
He named his new substance Formos, for the formaldehyde starting material he used and

83
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,760
the class of compounds which he believed he created, sugars.

84
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,760
In a sense Butlerov was right, but he created not just one sugar, but a mixture of sugars

85
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:07,560
which interconverted through a series of aldol reactions, forming a concoction of carbohydrates.

86
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,000
Now in Butlerov's day, a quick taste would be all it took to make his observations publication-worthy.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Today of course we cringe at the idea of tasting anything prepared in the lab, and we require

88
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,960
a bit more detailed analysis to identify the structures of the compounds that we make.

89
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,040
Butlerov was unable to surmise that there are many, many carbohydrates which can be

90
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,760
produced and isolated from one another, using techniques more modern to the science of organic

91
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,080
chemistry.

92
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,400
These carbohydrates are broadly classified by the number of sugar molecules which we

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,080
combine to make them up.

94
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,120
Actually an individual simple sugar molecule can be connected to another one, in several

95
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,040
ways which produce chains of varying lengths and geometries.

96
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,600
And these larger structures, built of simple sugars, are still referred to as carbohydrates

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,120
but we call them complex carbohydrates, and these are classified based on their lengths

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
and geometries.

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,000
But we're getting ahead of ourselves, let's step back and consider the most fundamental

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,600
of carbohydrates first.

101
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
There are those which cannot be hydrolyzed into simpler carbohydrates, and those are

102
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,040
the ones we want to deal with now.

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,880
We call these kinds of sugars monosaccharides.

104
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,760
When two such units are joined together in a condensation reaction, we get a disaccharide.

105
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,600
And finally we have polysaccharides, which can have anywhere from just a few to literally

106
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,520
thousands of condensed monosaccharide units.

107
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,600
So let's start at the beginning, the simplest class of carbohydrates, monosaccharides.

108
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,120
As I mentioned before, we break down these simple sugars into two major classes, aldoses

109
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,160
and ketoses.

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I've prepared the structures of four different aldoses for you here, so we can see their

111
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,480
structural similarities and differences.

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,240
Now the striking structural similarity here, of course, is that we have an aldehyde carbonyl.

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,040
So we call this molecule an aldotryose.

114
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,120
Aldo indicating that we have a carbonyl at the end of the chain, triose indicating that

115
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
there are three carbons in the chain.

116
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,920
So similarly we would call this one aldotetrose, aldo for a terminal carbonyl, tetrose for

117
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,160
four carbons in the chain.

118
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,680
And the trend continues through aldopentose and aldohexoses and beyond.

119
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,200
Now we use a very similar naming system for ketoses, that is when the carbonyl bond is

120
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
interior.

121
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:47,160
For example, this molecule would be a keto because the carbonyl bond is internal and

122
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,840
a triose because there are three carbons, so I have a keto triose.

123
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:01,240
My next example would be a keto, tetrose, and so on through the remainder, a ketopentose

124
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,080
and a ketohexose.

125
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,200
But defining the number of carbons in the chain and the location of the carbonyl bond

126
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,880
in a simple sugar isn't enough to let us unambiguously identify carbohydrates.

127
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,960
You see, all along a chain of hexoses, pentoses, tetroses, and even trios, there are one or

128
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,480
more chiral centers.

129
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,640
Now, particularly in the case of longer monosaccharides like hexoses, chirality can generate a large

130
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
number of potential stereoisomers.

131
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:37,440
Now that's why I drew my sample molecules in the previous slides in a Fischer projection.

132
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,100
Remember a Fischer projection is created by drawing a compound so that all of the horizontally

133
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,640
depicted bonds are coming out of the plane and all the vertical ones are falling back

134
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,040
behind the plane.

135
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,080
Now Fischer won his Nobel Prize in part for his characterization of the structure of glucose,

136
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,720
and a large part of his technique for this was to use his systematic form of projection

137
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,320
which made all of the stereochemical relationships in these complex molecules evident.

138
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,160
So let's begin with the simplest of all carbohydrates, the triose glyceraldehyde.

139
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,720
You can see clearly that glyceraldehyde has only one chiral center, so this will be a

140
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,600
relatively easy puzzle to solve.

141
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
As a general rule, we draw monosaccharides in a Fischer projection with the terminal

142
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,840
carbonyl at the top and then going downward.

143
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,720
So we can then number the carbons of the chain from top to bottom to facilitate the discussion.

144
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,000
Now notice that only C2 of glyceraldehyde is chiral, so I can draw two enantiomers, one

145
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,960
of which was named plus glyceraldehyde and the other minus glyceraldehyde.

146
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,720
Now remember, this was a long time before the Kahn Engel pre-log rules had been proposed,

147
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,360
and Fischer had only physical properties of saccharides to go on for identifying their

148
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,200
stereochemistry.

149
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,640
So he designated glyceraldehydes as plus and minus based on their ability to rotate a special

150
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,560
kind of light called plane polarized light.

151
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,880
We're going to discuss this phenomenon in detail during our spectroscopy lectures.

152
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,720
But for now, let's just say that the plus and minus glyceraldehyde designations stand

153
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,240
for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of that light.

154
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,960
Now if I start with glyceraldehyde and build larger monosaccharides by adding new interior

155
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,080
carbons to the chain, I'll call my construct a D-sugar.

156
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,040
If instead I start with a minus glyceraldehyde, I'll have to call that construct an L-sugar.

157
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,080
The D and L designations are again based on the molecules interaction with light, D for

158
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,560
clockwise from dextra and L for counterclockwise from livra.

159
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,920
For example, I can create D-erythros by inserting one new carbon into the chain of D-glyceraldehyde.

160
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,600
I can also make a molecule of D-threous in the same way by changing the chirality of my

161
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,760
newly inserted chiral center.

162
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,500
So not surprisingly, the introduction of a second chiral center has led to the possibility

163
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,300
of diastereomers for my aldotetroses.

164
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,960
Of course, I could instead have an L configuration for the bottom chiral carbon of my fissure

165
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:24,700
projection leading to the other two possible stereochemistries, L-aldotetroses, each a mere

166
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,900
image of one of the D-aldoterroses.

167
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Now this interesting set of stereoisomers in the fissure projection combined to produce

168
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:41,300
a new relationship in stereochemistry known as erythro and threoenantiomers.

169
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,260
When aligned in a fissure projection orientation, if similar groups are on the same side as

170
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,900
they are in erythros, then we use a prefix erythro to name that enantiomer.

171
00:13:51,900 --> 00:14:00,300
Conversely, if groups of interest are at opposition, we use the threo designation.

172
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,580
As the size of the monosaccharide grows, so do the number of possible stereoisomers.

173
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,940
And by the time we reach hexoses, there are eight stereoisomers possible for D-aldohexoses

174
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,100
and four for D-ketohexoses.

175
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,980
Things get out of hand pretty quickly here.

176
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,900
Now fortunately, there are just a handful of these which tend to make appearances in

177
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,620
natural systems.

178
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,740
And two of the most frequent are the aldohexose known as glucose and the ketohexose known

179
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,120
as fructose.

180
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,200
For simplicity's sake, we'll be using just these two monosaccharides as examples as we

181
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,100
go forward in this lecture.

182
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,480
But keep in mind that the chemistry we're about to see can easily be applied to any

183
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,720
of the dozens of small saccharides that can be created with just a few carbons in the

184
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
chain.

185
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,420
So far, I've drawn all the carbohydrates under investigation today as linear compounds.

186
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,600
But you may recall from our lecture on carbonyl compounds that a carbonyl activated by acid

187
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,360
in the presence of an alcohol forms a motif called a hemiacetal.

188
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,160
Well, in the case of monosaccharides, we have both a carbonyl and an alcohol available to

189
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,280
participate in this kind of chemistry intramolecularly.

190
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,980
When this reaction takes place between the carbonyl of a carbohydrate and one of its

191
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:27,040
own hydroxyl groups, a relatively stable ring of five or six atoms can sometimes form.

192
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,120
We call these cyclic sugars furanose, in the case of a five-membered ring, and pyranose,

193
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,000
in the case of a six-membered ring.

194
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,820
Each of these is named for the cyclic ether which makes up their backbone.

195
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,120
The result of this is an equilibrium interconversion between the acyclic, aldose, or ketose form

196
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,040
and the cyclic, furanose, or pyranose form.

197
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,440
So let's take a look again at glucose, an aldohexose with a fissure projection which

198
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,840
looks like this.

199
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,240
Now we see yet another reason why fissure projections are so useful.

200
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,800
Since all of the carbon-carbon bonds are already aligned so that they curve in on each other,

201
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,960
the cis-trans relationships of groups within the cyclic form are very easy to determine

202
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,160
from this projection.

203
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,440
I simply turn my fissure projection on its side to get a better look at the forming ring.

204
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,240
For example, hydroxyls which are erythro to one another in the aldohexose will be cis

205
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,320
to one another in the resulting pyranose.

206
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,960
If I complete the cyclization in this fictitious orientation, I get what's commonly known as

207
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,880
a Hayworth projection, with a planar six-membered ring, which we all know can't exist, yet

208
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,600
we do this anyway sometimes because it so clearly shows the cis-trans relationships in

209
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
the cyclic form of the sugar.

210
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,040
Now once the ring is placed into a proper chair conformation, we see that there's still

211
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,960
one stereochemical consideration left.

212
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,880
Since the carbonyl is planar, the attack on that motif during cyclization can take place

213
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,600
from either face, meaning that there are really two different enantiomers of any pyranose

214
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,800
or pyranose sugar, which we sometimes call animers, and we designate these as alpha and

215
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,200
beta animers.

216
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,760
In the case of D-leucopyranose, all of the existing hydroxyl groups can be placed in

217
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,880
the equatorial position simultaneously, so it's not much of a wonder why this sugar

218
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,720
likes to exist as a pyranose ring, right?

219
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,320
If the newly formed hydroxyl is in the axial position, we call this an alpha-anomer.

220
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,320
If the new group is instead in the equatorial conformation, we have the beta-anomer.

221
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,240
By convention, we assign the designation of C1 for the terminal carbon at the closest

222
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,440
to the carbonyl end of the uncyclized carbohydrate and number each carbon from there sequentially.

223
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,720
So the anomeric C1 group of glucopyranose is a crucial site for modification in both

224
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
the lab and in nature.

225
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,600
This inspection of glucopyranose reveals that the C1 is the only carbon bonded to a

226
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,960
pair of electron withdrawing oxygen atoms.

227
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,320
So it's the most electrophilic and most likely to participate in substitution reactions,

228
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,320
like this very simple reaction between alpha, D, glucopyranose, and acidified methanol.

229
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,600
This reaction generates an equilibrium mixture of both the alpha and beta-functionalized

230
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,920
monosaccharide.

231
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,440
When the C1 is modified this way, we call the product a glycoside, and the newly added

232
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,160
group an eglycone.

233
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,760
So let's take a look at a glycoside that has some historical relevance.

234
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,760
This is a molecule called salicin, and salicin is a glycoside with anti-inflammatory properties,

235
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,320
and it's also present in the bark of willow trees.

236
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,040
Recent Greeks knew that chewing on the bark of a willow tree gave pain relief and alleviated

237
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,080
headaches and joint problems.

238
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,040
What they didn't know was that what they were doing while chewing the bark was extracting

239
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,560
this particular compound, salicin.

240
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Now salicin consists of a glucopyranose, which is bonded to a hydroxybenzyl alcohol, a glycon.

241
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,560
And once this compound has been ingested, the water in your bloodstream and the enzymes

242
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,560
in your blood go at breaking this down through a hydrolysis reaction.

243
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:45,060
It takes a water molecule to break that link, separating the glucopyranose from the hydroxybenzyl

244
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,560
alcohol.

245
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Now at this point, the hydroxybenzyl alcohol is oxidized by other enzymes in your body

246
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
in preparation for removing it.

247
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:01,560
And in doing so, it creates salicylic acid, the same compound into which aspirin degrades

248
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,560
to give joint pain relief, headache relief, and other beneficial properties as well.

249
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Now, all of this amazing and rich chemistry is done with a few monosaccharides and an

250
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
endless library of glycones.

251
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,060
But I believe that you were promised more.

252
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,560
I still owe you an explanation of disaccharides and polysaccharides.

253
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,560
So let's get started on those.

254
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Our last topic was a perfect lead into disaccharides.

255
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,560
We looked at how glycosidic linkages conform to almost anything with an amine or alcohol

256
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,560
group on it, really anything that's nucleophilic.

257
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,560
And if you were really on top of your game, you might have wondered if all those other

258
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,560
alcohol groups on the sugar might make it possible for one sugar molecule to bond to

259
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
another using the same motif.

260
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Now, if you had that thought, give yourself a gold star.

261
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
You are spot on.

262
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Although theoretically it's possible for any hydroxyl of one monosaccharide to form

263
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,560
a glycosidic linkage with another, there are three arrangements which we principally

264
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
see in nature.

265
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,560
And we distinguish these linkages by numbering the monosaccharide acting as the

266
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
glycone with prime numbers.

267
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
So check this out.

268
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Take the system 1, 1 prime, 1, 4 prime, and 1, 6 prime.

269
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,560
These are the linkages that we most often see in nature, meaning that the C1 will

270
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,560
link to a different oxygen from one of the carbons in the other saccharide.

271
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Now, a familiar disaccharide with this 1, 4 prime linkage is maltose.

272
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Maltose is formed by the glycosidic linkage of two glucose units through an alpha

273
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
anomer.

274
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Now, here one glucose acts as the glycoside, bonding through its C1, and the other acts

275
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,560
as the aglycone, bonding through its C4 prime.

276
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,560
And notice that this leaves the C1 prime to interconvert between enantiomers through

277
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,560
an equilibrium process so this disaccharide can still open and close in at least one

278
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
of its rings.

279
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Maltose is most familiar as the starting material for beer, made by the hydrolysis

280
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,560
of starches from grains in the first part of the brewing process.

281
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,560
Much of the maltose is consumed by the yeast, which are used to brew the beer,

282
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,560
but a small amount is retained in the beverage.

283
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,560
So the next time you have a beer with your friends, take a sip and pronounce.

284
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,560
That has some lovely 4-0-alpha-D-glucoparanosyl-D-glucopyranos notes.

285
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,560
You may wind up drinking alone after that, but at least you are telling the truth.

286
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Now, the 1-6 prime linkages are less common, but they do exist in a few disaccharides.

287
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,560
They're actually more relevant to polysaccharides, as we'll soon see.

288
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,560
One example of this type of linkage in a disaccharide is Gentio bios,

289
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,560
a 1-6 prime disaccharide between two glucose units.

290
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Now, by connecting to the aglycone at its 6 prime carbon, which is not part of the

291
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Pyranos ring, additional conformational flexibility is introduced,

292
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,560
making a nice building block for branched polysaccharides.

293
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Now, a prime example of a 1-1 prime linkage is the familiar sweetening agent, sucrose.

294
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Sucrose consists of a glucose and a fructose unit linked by a bridging oxygen

295
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,560
through one another's anomeric carbons.

296
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,560
So, in this unusual case, both sugars are acting as glycosides for themselves

297
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
and as aglycones for their bonding partner.

298
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Since both anomeric carbons are occupied by the glycosidic linkage,

299
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,560
sucrose has no free anomeric carbon to open back up in equilibrium with the cyclic form.

300
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Now, this is important because sugars are much more prone to oxidative degradation

301
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
when in their acyclic forms.

302
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,560
So, this makes sucrose much slower to oxidize than other disaccharides

303
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,560
and therefore a popular choice for use in preserves.

304
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Polysaccharides, as you might expect from the name, are simply longer chains of sugars

305
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,560
in which most of them are acting as both glycosides and as aglycones.

306
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Perpetuating a polymer built from monosaccharide units.

307
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,560
Many materials with which we're familiar are made from polysaccharides.

308
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,560
For example, cellulose in the cotton fibers in these cotton balls.

309
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,560
It's made up almost exclusively of D-glucose units

310
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,560
attached by beta-1-4-prime glycosidic bonds.

311
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,560
That same material makes up about one half of the matter.

312
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,560
That same material makes up about one half of the mass of dry wood.

313
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Cellulose combines into closely packed fibrils

314
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
which interact with one another by a hydrogen bonding,

315
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,560
forming a strong, tough, insoluble material.

316
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Now, cotton balls and lumber don't seem terribly appetizing to me as a human,

317
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,560
but certain animal species, most notably cows and termites,

318
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,560
have symbiotic bacteria living in their digestive tract

319
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,560
which help them to break down the cellulose in those materials

320
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,560
and use them as a food source.

321
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Now, by contrast, switching the beta linkage to an alpha linkage gives us amylose,

322
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,560
a starch which curves on itself into a helix.

323
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,560
It can be digested and used as a source of nutrition for higher order animals,

324
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,560
even those without bacterial help or four stomachs to help break it down.

325
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Now, if we take amylose and branch it out every 30 subunits or so

326
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,560
by cross-linking another chain at a six prime position,

327
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:50,560
we get amylopectin, a water-soluble thickening agent used in cooking applications.

328
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,560
More extensive branching of the same kind leads to glycogen,

329
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,560
one of the human body's primary energy stores.

330
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
If you have enough glycogen stored up in your muscles,

331
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,560
you're just a hydrolysis reaction away from additional glucose molecules

332
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,560
for use as energy to help you run that marathon or finish that workday.

333
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,560
As a final example of polysaccharides,

334
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,560
let's take a look at the remarkable armor which protects insects and arthropods

335
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,560
from cicadas to crabs.

336
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,560
You might find it hard to believe that the same class of materials

337
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
that's used to sweeten soft drinks can also make up armor

338
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,560
which protects sea creatures and insects from predators.

339
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,560
But it does.

340
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Chitin, the material from which this tough exoskeleton is made,

341
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,560
is a polymer of a glucose derivative called n-acetylglucosamine.

342
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,560
N-acetylglucosamine is a pyranose form of glucose

343
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,560
with an amide-functional group substituted here at the C2 position of the ring.

344
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Now, polymerize this molecule through beta-1,4-prime glycosidic bonds

345
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,560
and you have chitin, a material so tough that once formed it can't grow with the animal.

346
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,560
This is why crabs and some insects periodically molt,

347
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,560
shedding their chitin armor and producing a whole new, slightly larger suit of armor

348
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,560
once the old one's been shuffled off.

349
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,560
But the secret to chitin's strength is not only in the glycosidic linkages,

350
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,560
but also in the amide-functionality added to that sugar ring.

351
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Now, you can see here that when multiple strands of chitin are aligned,

352
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:34,560
the aminitrogen and carbonyl from one chitin can hydrogen bond to others on a separate strand.

353
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,560
This H bond network contributes to the remarkable strength of chitin,

354
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
which protects against predation.

355
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,560
It's also the reason that crustaceans and insects have to molt,

356
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,560
shedding their old exoskeletons during periods of concerted growth

357
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,560
during which a new exoskeleton is formed.

358
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Now, the toughening provided by this hydrogen bonding network

359
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,560
can simply be turned off again by modifying the amine group of glucosamine yet again.

360
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,560
In the body, our joint cartilage is made up partially of glucosaminoglycans,

361
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,560
which are long polysaccharides, consisting of alternating acetyl glucosamine

362
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,560
and another modified sugar called uronic acid.

363
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,560
As opposed to tough and flexible chitin,

364
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,560
glucosaminoglycans like this one are springy and lubricating

365
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,560
because the hydrogen bonding network is disrupted by the acetyl motif,

366
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,560
which allows one chain to slide along the other more easily.

367
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,560
This is the reason that many believers religiously take doses of glucosamine

368
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,560
in the hopes of limiting cartilage loss associated with arthritis.

369
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
So let's sum up for the day.

370
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Today we discussed carbohydrates, a broad and diverse class of compounds

371
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,560
with the chemical formula CNH2ON.

372
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,560
We took a look at Fischer projections of the two main classes of simple carbohydrates,

373
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,560
those being aldoses and ketoses, which differ by the location of their carbonyl motif.

374
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,560
We then discussed the stereochemistry of simple carbohydrates

375
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,560
and the concept of erythro and threoenantiomers.

376
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,560
After that, we discussed the cyclization of simple sugars

377
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,560
by reacting a hydroxyl with the carbonyl in an intramolecular reaction

378
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,560
to form a hemiacetal,

379
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,560
and how the most common of these are 5-membered furanose and 6-membered purinose rings.

380
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,560
We also recognized that the hemiacetal carbon can have two distinct stereochemistries,

381
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,560
leaving us to label it an anomeric carbon.

382
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,560
We looked at how these cyclic sugars can react through their anomeric carbon

383
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,560
to form alpha and beta glycosidic linkages to new groups called aglycones.

384
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,560
When the aglycone is another sugar itself, we form a disaccharide,

385
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,560
like maltose from beer or sucrose in fruit preserves.

386
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,560
We discussed the 1,4' 1,6' and 1,1' glycosidic linkages,

387
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,560
and how the 1,4' linkage is well suited to formation of long polymer strands.

388
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,560
The 1,6' linkage imparts branching to such polymers,

389
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,560
and the 1,1' linkage in sucrose prohibits its two sugar units from opening and oxidizing,

390
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,560
making it a perfect choice for food applications because of its resistance to oxidation.

391
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Finally, we considered polysaccharides of glucopyrinose, including cellulose,

392
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,560
which has beta glycosidic linkages, giving it tensile strength,

393
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,560
in contrast to amylose and amylopectin,

394
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
which have alpha glycosidic linkages,

395
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,560
endowing them with a higher solubility and making them more digestible for humans.

396
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,560
We also saw how some animals like arthropods and insects

397
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
chemically modify the glucoside subunits of cellulose

398
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,560
to form even more powerful sets of interstrand hydrogen bonds,

399
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,560
which endow their exoskeletons with formidable physical properties.

400
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Next time, we're going to take a look at a very special Aldo pentose,

401
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:13,560
ribose, and how it acts as the central piece of one of nature's most awesome molecular creations,

402
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
DNA.

403
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I'll see you then.
