0	18400	Chemical bonds form the basis for not only organic chemistry, but indeed for all of chemistry.
18400	23840	And as we saw last time, just how important bonding is in determining the chemical properties
23840	26040	of elements.
26040	32080	So with the cosmos consisting of fewer than 100 naturally occurring elements, lack of
32080	37080	a way to bond multiple atoms of those elements together to create more complex materials
37080	39280	would lead to a pretty dull universe.
39280	44560	Now, fortunately for us, chemical bonding provides a way to take relatively simple
44560	51080	atom and combine it with other atoms, thereby creating a set of combinations so vast that
51080	55280	it's virtually infinite.
55280	59960	Bonding is, in fact, much more than just a way to connect atoms together.
59960	64320	Bonding has a way of changing atoms themselves in ways which alter their physical properties
64320	71560	and reactivity, and it can do so so profoundly that many materials of identical atomic composition
71560	75000	have drastically different chemical and physical properties.
75000	78880	Let's take the example of carbon, the star of our show.
78880	85240	Now, carbon atoms are so keen to bond to other atoms that atomic carbon is essentially unheard
85520	89400	of under the conditions we experience here on Earth.
89400	94520	And even when pure, a sample of carbon will take on one of several different bonding schemes,
94520	100720	which lead to some very familiar but strikingly different materials from our everyday lives.
100720	103040	This is graphite.
103040	107680	It's the principal component of bituminous coal, valued for its softness, giving it the
107680	110280	properties of a good lubricant.
110280	115040	It also makes up the lead in modern pencils, which isn't really lead at all.
115040	120800	It consists of pure carbon in a bonding arrangement which looks like this.
120800	125320	It consists of vast sheets of carbon atoms bonded together along a plane.
125320	129040	Now, take a look at this sample of carbon.
129040	132080	This familiar form of carbon is diamond.
132080	137960	And diamond is famous for its clarity and its hardness, exactly the opposite from graphite,
137960	140880	which is valued for being dark and soft.
141440	145880	Now, diamond gets these properties not because its composition is any different.
145880	147960	They're both pure carbon.
147960	152440	It gets the different properties because of the nature of the bonds holding the atoms
152440	153440	together.
153440	158480	Now, we call materials like these, these samples of pure elements, which differ only by the
158480	162680	way in which their atoms are bonded, allotropes.
162680	166920	And these two allotropes of carbon offer a clear example of just how critical it is
166920	173280	to understand chemical bonding in order to understand how organic compounds will behave.
173280	179320	So, let's investigate exactly why and how atoms bond to one another, and see if we can't
179320	184320	explain why graphite and diamond have such drastically different properties, even though
184320	188440	they're made up of exactly the same types of atoms.
192360	194120	So let's take a look at an atom.
194720	202040	Now, atoms are comprised of three types of subatomic particles, positively charged protons,
202040	207800	uncharged neutrons, and negatively charged electrons.
207800	212440	Niels Bohr is most famous for many of his scientific accomplishments, but the most notable is his
212440	219560	model of the atom, in which a dense, positively charged nucleus containing protons and neutrons
219640	226680	is surrounded by a cloud of very small, fast-moving electrons carrying negative charges.
226680	231960	Now, each of these three particles plays a role in the properties of a given atom.
231960	237120	So most of us have seen cartoon representations, which look like the one I have here.
237120	242000	But in truth, the relative positions of the particles in this particular model are accurate.
242000	247280	The scale has been drastically distorted to make the system easier for us to view.
247720	253480	Now, in reality, if the electron cloud were the size I've represented here, the nucleus
253480	259760	itself would only be about 40 microns wide, about the size of a dust mite, a little bit
259760	262520	smaller than the width of a human hair.
262520	268280	Now, instead, let's bring that nucleus back to the scale that we used today.
268280	274520	If I use this nucleus as my scale, the electron cloud surrounding it is going to be several
274520	276360	kilometers wide.
277000	280680	OK, so let's go back to our representation, the way that it was, so that we can study
280680	282680	these different parts of the atom.
282680	288280	Now, protons in the center provide the atom with its identity.
288280	292640	Our example here is a nucleus with six protons, so this would be a carbon atom.
292640	297080	Regardless of the number of other subatomic particles in the structure, the nucleus with
297080	301360	six protons will always be carbon.
301360	307000	The green neutrons that accompany those protons at the center of the atom do not alter its
307000	308400	identity.
308400	311960	So our example here has a carbon atom with six neutrons.
311960	317680	So this would be an isotope of carbon, which we call carbon 12.
317680	322840	But if I add an extra neutron to the nucleus, I still have carbon, but it's got a little
322840	327600	bit more mass, and we call this carbon 13.
327600	333240	If I add yet another neutron, still carbon, but now it's carbon 14.
333240	339040	So we call these combinations of neutrons that can accompany a specific number of protons
339040	342240	in the nucleus isotopes.
342240	347040	So neutrons have their place in organic chemistry, but it's really not in today's lecture, because
347040	352640	they don't have a tendency to affect the chemical properties of elements very strongly.
352640	356920	So we're going to concentrate more on protons and electrons for the rest of the day.
356920	360200	So let's get on to the electrons now.
360200	364460	Electrons most directly affect the charge of an atom, and in order for this atom here
364460	370560	to be neutral, we have to have the same number of electrons as we do protons.
370560	376760	So our central nucleus has six protons giving it a positive charge of six.
376760	383000	Therefore our electron cloud must have six electrons as well to create a neutral atom.
383000	387560	And when the number of electrons in the cloud is not equal to the number of protons, we'll
387560	393960	have a charged species resulting from that, and we call these charged species ions.
393960	399200	So if I were to add an extra electron to my atom here, I now have seven electrons and
399200	406280	six protons, meaning I'll have a negatively charged species, which we call an anion.
406280	412000	If instead I remove two electrons, so now I have my original six protons and only five
412000	418560	electrons, I form something called a cation, which carries a positive charge.
418560	423200	Now as the discrepancy in the population of electrons and protons grows, so does the
423200	425520	charge in the ion.
425520	429080	For example, a carbon atom with seven electrons in its cloud would have a net charge of negative
429080	433880	one, and a carbon atom if it could have eight electrons in its cloud would have a charge
433880	437600	of negative two, etc.
437600	442640	Now what I'd like to focus on now is what made Bohr's model truly unique when compared
442640	444840	to its predecessors.
444840	449760	And this is that Bohr's model was the first to suggest that electrons are not spread evenly
449760	454240	through the volume of an atom, but rather that they only made up the outer portion of
454240	456480	the atom.
456480	462360	Now furthermore, he suggested that there are distinct energy levels around the nucleus,
462360	466120	each of which can only hold a finite number of those electrons.
466120	471320	And they fill sequentially from the smallest to the largest.
471320	476320	He also postulated that each energy level was divided into specific volumes which could
476320	482320	only hold two electrons each, and we call those volumes orbitals.
482320	486560	Now as we'll often do for clarity in this course, we'll concern ourselves only with
486560	490360	the first three rows of the periodic table.
490360	495280	So when we apply this constraint, we see that there are three rows in the table, each of
495280	501280	which represents the filling of a different energy level by those electrons.
501280	505880	Now if we limit ourselves to neutral atoms, meaning the addition of electrons must match
505880	511080	the rate at which we add the protons, each of the first three rows of the periodic table
511080	515080	represents the filling of those different energy levels.
515080	520120	Since energy levels fill from lower to higher, only the highest energy level in any atom
520120	522160	can be unfilled.
522160	526240	We call that outermost energy level the valence shell.
526240	532240	So let's begin constructing an atom by adding protons and electrons to our hypothetical atom.
532240	536520	One pair at a time, tracking our progress through the periodic table.
536520	539320	Our first pair gives us a hydrogen atom.
539320	544200	Now obviously the first energy level will be the valence shell for this atom.
544200	548020	Currently it has one electron in that first level.
548020	554620	With the addition of a second pair, another proton and another electron takes us to helium.
554620	558660	Now helium has two electrons in the first energy level, so the first energy level is
558660	561900	still the valence shell.
561900	567620	But as we prepare to continue, we notice that the first energy level is completely filled.
567620	572460	So the third electron has to be placed in the second energy level.
572460	575860	So now we've begun a new row in the periodic table.
575860	580620	A row of elements with their valence shell in the second energy level.
580620	585300	Now the second energy level is much larger than the first, so it can hold as many as
585300	587220	eight electrons.
587220	598700	So as we progress through beryllium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon, we see
598700	601580	that the same energy level is being populated.
602580	606740	And as we round out our trip through the first three rows, we begin populating the third
606740	612220	energy level, which can also hold only eight electrons.
612220	621740	Now the filling of this energy level comprises sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus,
621740	626220	sulfur, chlorine, and argon.
626220	630860	Now in truth, the third energy level can hold even more electrons, but it's usually
630860	635420	just these eight which are of interest to us in introductory organic chemistry courses.
635420	639420	So we're going to stop populating our periodic table there.
639420	644700	So what is it about the structure of atoms, which really drives chemical bonds to form?
644700	650220	And why is it that there's a periodic trend in the number of bonds atoms tend to form?
650220	654380	Now the answer to these questions is deeply rooted in a concept which we'll visit time
654380	658580	and time again in this course, a concept called free energy.
661700	666220	The free energy of a substance is simply a measure of its stability.
666220	671420	It tells us something about how much potential the system has to do work.
671420	676020	And just as physical processes tend toward lower energy states, like a ball rolling down
676020	682220	a hill, or heat transferring from a hot radiator into a cold room, it's the more stable states
682220	686620	of matter which will tend to form in chemical processes as well.
686620	691900	Now this concept was developed by American chemist Willard Gibbs in the late 1800s.
691900	696940	And Gibbs modeled the free energy of a system as a function of two important factors.
696940	701980	So let's take a look at a process which will actually allow us to demonstrate how these
701980	703220	factors push a reaction.
703220	708180	And I'm going to start with an organic compound with which most of us are familiar.
708180	713300	This is a molecule of propane, the type of which you might find in a backyard grill.
713300	716780	So you probably didn't think that you were doing organic chemistry the last time you
716780	721420	grilled a steak on your patio, but the truth is actually something different.
721420	725300	You see, propane can react with oxygen.
725300	730340	And when one molecule of propane reacts with five molecules of oxygen gas, it produces a
730340	732220	few things.
732220	735480	First it produces carbon dioxide.
735480	739500	It also produces a little bit of water.
739500	741420	But it also produces something else.
741420	744780	In fact, what we're after is not the carbon dioxide or the water.
744780	750020	When we start our barbecue grill, what we're after is another byproduct of the reaction,
750020	752020	heat.
752020	754100	Now chemists have a different name for this.
754100	759460	We call it enthalpy, and we represent it with the letter H.
759460	764220	We can determine the approximate enthalpy change during a reaction simply by taking an
764220	770760	inventory of all the bonds broken and all the bonds formed in our reaction.
770760	776280	So in the case of reacting propane with oxygen in what we call a combustion reaction, the
776280	781480	breaking of two carbon-carbon single bonds, eight carbon-hydrogen single bonds, and five
781480	788540	oxygen-oxygen double bonds actually releases more energy than the formation of six carbon-oxygen
788540	792360	double bonds and eight hydrogen-oxygen single bonds.
792360	797440	So we can use this bond inventory to predict that this reaction should generate heat.
797440	802080	Now the second byproduct of this reaction is randomness, and this is something you may
802080	805280	not have thought of quite as much before.
805280	808880	Think about this as being the exhaust from the burning of the propane.
808880	814440	Now you'll notice that I've converted one molecule of propane, five molecules of oxygen
814440	819880	into three molecules of carbon dioxide, and four molecules of water.
819880	825400	So I've increased the randomness, or what chemists call entropy of the system, because
825400	831800	I've turned six molecules of gas into seven, so I'm making larger quantities of smaller
831800	834840	molecules throughout my reaction.
834840	839520	It is these parameters, the enthalpy and the entropy of a reaction, which we can use to
839520	842560	estimate the driving force behind the process.
842560	845520	So let's take a look at how we actually do this.
845520	850480	The Gibbs free energy equation for any system at any state is simple.
850480	856680	The Gibbs free energy is equal to the enthalpy of that system minus the absolute temperature
856680	863600	at which that system currently rests, so this would be temperature in Kelvin's, multiplied
863600	868880	by the total entropy for that system in a given state.
868880	873760	Now the problem with this is that we don't actually know this number.
873760	879960	We can't calculate absolute entropies or absolute enthalpies for a given system.
879960	883520	But remember that chemical reactions are all about change.
883520	887120	There's an initial state and a final state, and it's the difference in the free energy
887120	891020	between those two that really matters.
891020	896600	So if I take the Gibbs energy equation for the final state of a reaction and the Gibbs
896600	902720	energy equation for the initial state of the materials in my reaction, I can simply subtract
902720	908960	one from the other, and this gives me a more usable equation in the form of the difference
908960	913760	in free energies, equaling the difference in enthalpies, minus the absolute temperature
913760	916600	times the difference in entropies.
916600	920640	Now this is a long equation with a lot of letters, so chemists like to shorten it by
920640	924360	using the Greek symbol delta to represent change.
924360	929000	And when we do this, we get the familiar form of the Gibbs free energy equation.
929000	932560	Delta G equals delta H minus T delta S.
932560	934520	Okay so that's enough math for a moment.
934520	938080	Let's apply this to the system that we looked at earlier.
938080	943600	Remember we took propane and reacted it with five equivalents of oxygen to produce seven
943600	947040	equivalents of exhaust gases or products.
947040	952560	And in doing so we create some heat, we increase the randomness of the system.
952560	957880	So in this case, because it releases heat, the system's energy has gone down.
957880	962400	So the sign of my enthalpy change will be negative.
962400	967100	And because I've increased randomness, the delta S term of my equation will necessarily
967100	968660	be positive.
968660	973220	So in this case, I've got an equation where my free energy change is equal to a negative
973220	976620	number minus a positive number.
976620	980660	In other words, delta G has to be negative for this process.
980660	986460	So reactions which trend in this fashion, releasing heat and increasing randomness, tend to be
986460	989540	what we call spontaneous.
989540	994260	Now spontaneous is a little bit different than the term that we use colloquially.
994260	998420	When chemists talk about spontaneous processes, we're talking about a process which is favored
998420	1002980	simply because the energy of the products is lower.
1002980	1006740	Now we can think of that as a situation where a reaction is going downhill.
1006740	1012380	So don't let this name fool you because sometimes the term spontaneous invokes thoughts of speed.
1012380	1017540	But here we're using it to mean proceeding without any outside perturbation.
1017540	1021540	So a spontaneous reaction will eventually happen on its own.
1021540	1023340	But it may not happen at all.
1023340	1027780	For example, ordinary temperatures and pressures, the conversion of diamond into graphite is
1027780	1030100	actually spontaneous.
1030100	1034180	But thankfully, it takes geologic time scales for this to occur.
1034180	1041700	So on the time scale of a human lifetime, your diamond jewelry is safe.
1041700	1047620	So one can easily guess that entropy or disorder, it's not on the side of chemical bonding.
1047620	1051660	So bonds attach freely moving atoms into higher order structures.
1051660	1056180	So there's an entropic penalty for bonding which must be overcome somehow if we expect
1056180	1058700	a bond to form at all.
1058700	1063700	So the key to chemical bonding is its effect on the enthalpy of a system, or the energy
1063700	1066660	released when a bond forms.
1066660	1071940	If this process of fixing atoms in space relative to one another is going to be spontaneous,
1071940	1078100	there must be something about the linkage which lowers the chemical potential energy.
1078100	1080620	But what's the driving force?
1080620	1085580	Well, the answer to that question is the octet rule.
1085580	1090540	An observation first made by Irving Langmuir in 1919.
1090540	1094820	He noted that atoms of smaller elements seem to have an unusual stability when the outermost
1094820	1099140	energy level of their electron cloud was filled with electrons.
1100100	1105100	Now octet rule might be a somewhat unfortunate choice of a name since it creates the conundrum
1105100	1110220	that the first principle energy level can only hold two electrons, not eight.
1110220	1114300	But the general spirit of the rule holds even for that energy level.
1114300	1120340	Having a full outer energy level, or valence shell, lowers the energy of an atom.
1120340	1125300	So you probably noticed in our previous discussion on energy levels in the electron clouds that
1125300	1132780	only helium, neon, and argon naturally have these completely filled outer energy levels.
1132780	1139300	This makes helium, neon, and argon particularly stable and unreactive, earning this column
1139300	1143980	of the periodic table the moniker noble gases.
1143980	1148540	But of our first 18 elements, only three of them have a naturally filled valence shell
1148540	1151860	when they're isolated neutral atoms.
1151860	1156900	So how is it that the atoms of other elements under consideration today can achieve a similar
1156900	1157900	condition?
1157900	1161780	And the answer to that question is chemical bonding.
1161780	1168460	Now so far we've established that very few elements in their isolated, neutral state
1168460	1170780	naturally have filled outer energy levels.
1170780	1175660	And we've also noted that having such a filled outer energy level lends extra stability to
1175660	1177300	atoms.
1177300	1182120	So all other atoms aspire to have the electron configuration of a noble gas, and we call
1182120	1185380	this tendency the octet rule.
1185380	1189660	I've already mentioned that the most available method for atoms to create that full valence
1189660	1191340	shell is a bond.
1191340	1193220	But what is bonding?
1193220	1198940	Well, chemical bonding, simply defined, is an energetically beneficial interaction between
1198940	1205420	atoms which requires them to maintain a specific distance from one another in space.
1205420	1209900	Bonds are so small, and when bonded, the distance is between them so short that a special unit
1209900	1213100	of distance has to be created, called an angstrom.
1213100	1216540	And we use this unit of distance to measure bond length.
1216540	1220980	It's about one ten billionth of a meter.
1220980	1225860	In introductory chemistry courses, we often teach that there are two kinds of bonds, ionic
1225860	1227860	and covalent.
1227860	1232780	But the truth is that there's a continuum of bonds, with ionic at one extreme and covalent
1232780	1234580	at the other.
1234580	1239180	And these two modes of bonding are distinct, but both are driven by the same drive for
1239180	1242420	atoms to obtain that full valence shell.
1242420	1249220	And the easiest way to understand this continuum of bonds is to first discuss the extremes.
1249220	1255620	Ionic bonding occurs when atoms of significantly different electro-negativity come together.
1255620	1261140	Simply put, electronegativity is a measure of how hungry an atom is for electrons.
1262140	1267100	And in general, if we neglect the noble gases, electronegativity increases as we move from
1267100	1272100	left to right across the periodic table, because the nuclei of atoms are becoming increasingly
1272100	1275740	positively charged.
1275740	1279620	Electronegativity also increases from bottom to top of the periodic table, because the
1279620	1284620	electron clouds are becoming smaller, screening the nucleus from the outermost electrons the
1284620	1286620	least.
1287620	1292300	For example, fluorine is the most electronegative of all elements, because within the second
1292300	1296300	row it has the most positively charged nucleus with nine protons.
1296300	1300580	And because it's small electron cloud with only two energy levels, makes the positively
1300580	1305060	charged nucleus better able to attract that extra electron.
1305060	1309820	If we move down and across our small portion of the periodic table, at the opposite end
1309820	1316100	we find sodium, which has just one weakly held electron in its outermost energy level.
1316100	1320060	This means that sodium is instead very eager to give up an electron.
1320060	1325180	And we call sodium either very electropositive or not very electronegative.
1325180	1326940	Either description works.
1326940	1331980	The combination of these two elements leads to a classic example of an ionic bond.
1331980	1336500	An atom of sodium having just one electron in its outermost energy level gives up that
1336500	1341020	electron to achieve a full outer energy level.
1341020	1345740	And fluorine, on the other hand, having seven electrons in its outer energy level, needs
1345780	1348140	to gain one to achieve an octet.
1348140	1352820	And adding one more gives it eight electrons in its valence shell.
1352820	1357300	So if sodium is very electropositive and needs to lose the electron to achieve an octet,
1357300	1361780	the fluorine is very electronegative, needs to gain an electron to achieve an octet, it
1361780	1365340	seems obvious that the two can strike a deal.
1365340	1369780	The unwanted electron from sodium is fully transferred to the fluorine, giving both an
1369780	1374420	octet, but also ionizing them in the process.
1374420	1377740	So sodium now has a charge of plus one.
1377740	1380340	And fluorine now has a charge of minus one.
1380340	1385260	And it's the electrostatic attraction between these two ions, which holds them together.
1385260	1390140	And we call this ionic bonding.
1390140	1394020	The alternative end of the bonding spectrum is the covalent bond.
1394020	1399100	When we pair two atoms of very similar electronegativity, neither is particularly willing to exchange
1399100	1401740	electrons with the other.
1401740	1403740	There are two atoms of fluorine.
1403740	1409740	With equal electronegativity, neither is willing to donate an electron to form an ionic bond.
1409740	1412900	But there is a second solution to the problem.
1412900	1416580	The sharing of electrons rather than the transfer.
1416580	1420140	So if the two fluorine atoms come together in an arrangement in space which allows them
1420140	1425580	to share one extra electron each, each atom has been fooled into thinking it has its own
1425580	1426940	octet.
1426940	1431820	And this is the driving force behind covalent bonding.
1431820	1435100	But the complexity of electron sharing doesn't stop there.
1435100	1440300	Two oxygen atoms, for example, must each donate two electrons to a bond, joining these atoms
1440300	1442560	in an oxygen molecule.
1442560	1448140	We call this arrangement a double bond, since two pairs of electrons are shared.
1448140	1452780	So now that we understand the process by which fully ionic and fully covalent bonds help
1452780	1458180	atoms to satisfy their octets, let's turn our attention back to that continuum of bonds
1458180	1459860	that I mentioned earlier.
1459860	1464260	Naturally, oxygen atoms need not bond only to other oxygen atoms.
1464260	1469600	We can instead envision a system in which an oxygen atom satisfies its octet by bonding
1469600	1473220	covalently to two hydrogen atoms.
1473220	1478860	In this case, we've bonded a more electronegative oxygen to a less electronegative hydrogen
1478860	1480380	atom.
1480380	1483940	And the electronegativities of each are not as drastically different as in our sodium
1483940	1490740	fluoride example, but they're not exactly the same as in our example of oxygen gas either.
1490740	1495300	So we expect sharing to take place, but the sharing is unequal, meaning that the bonding
1495300	1501500	electrons spend more time in the proximity of the more electronegative oxygen atom.
1501500	1506140	The result of this is what we call a polar covalent bond, which gives water its high
1506140	1509740	polarity among common solvents.
1509740	1513180	As the course progresses, we'll see many examples in which the relative polarity of
1513180	1516860	bonds is the driving factor in chemical reactions.
1516860	1521580	So it's important to understand this type of bonding early in the course.
1521580	1525500	In the previous section, we concerned ourselves only with the principal energy levels of an
1525500	1529620	atom's electron cloud and how they affect the bonding behavior of different pairs of
1529620	1531740	atoms.
1531740	1536160	But the representation that we used to show the relative energy of electrons didn't really
1536160	1541160	convey their true positions around the atom, just their approximate energies.
1541160	1545680	Simply put, our diagrams conveyed the energetics of bonding, but didn't finish the story by
1545680	1551000	telling us about the spatial arrangement of those bonds about the central atom.
1551000	1555440	To understand this geometry of bonding, we need to invoke one more fundamental component
1555440	1559880	of atomic structure, atomic orbitals.
1559880	1563360	You see, all valence electrons are not equal.
1563360	1567480	There's more to defining the orbits of electrons than just the principal energy level in which
1567480	1569960	they reside.
1569960	1574520	In order to show the specific volume of space in which each electron resides within an energy
1574520	1581400	level, we have to introduce a second level of organization, atomic orbitals.
1581400	1585400	Once again, we're graced by the simplifying fact that our discussion only entails the
1585400	1590080	first three rows of the periodic table, through which relatively simple progressions of atomic
1590080	1592080	structure evolve.
1593080	1597680	Now, all energy levels contain a single S orbital.
1597680	1602320	And S orbitals are spherical in shape, and increase in size with increasing principal
1602320	1604280	energy level.
1604280	1608360	This is to say that the one S orbital is smaller than the two S, which again is smaller than
1608360	1611360	the three S.
1611360	1616760	And since each S orbital can only hold two electrons, the remaining six electrons, from
1616760	1621720	the second and third principal energy levels, have to find another home.
1621720	1627040	And they do this in an array of three distinct P orbitals per level.
1627040	1634240	Now, just like S orbitals, P orbitals increase in size with increasing principal energy level.
1634240	1639560	But unlike S orbitals, P orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell, with a node at the nucleus
1639560	1641080	of the atom.
1641080	1646080	So if we were to plot out the energy of all the atomic orbitals in argon, the largest of
1646080	1651200	the atoms under consideration today, we would see something like this.
1651200	1659880	This would be a one S2, two S2, two P6, three S2, three P6 configuration.
1659880	1664120	Now notice that all three P orbitals of any given energy level are slightly higher in
1664120	1669760	energy than the corresponding S orbital, but equal in energy to one another.
1669760	1674840	Now chemists use the word degenerate to describe energetically equivalent orbitals like these
1674840	1676280	groups of P orbitals.
1676400	1681360	So I'll be using this word from time to time as well.
1681360	1686640	And now that we understand the size and shape of atomic orbitals, we can begin to understand
1686640	1692200	how these regions of space can overlap to produce new covalent bonds.
1692200	1696720	The two major classes of covalent bonds pervade the science of organic chemistry, and we
1696720	1700600	call these classes sigma bonds and pi bonds.
1700880	1706840	Sigma bonds form whenever orbitals overlap along the internuclear axis, such as two esatomic
1706840	1709640	orbitals overlapping.
1709640	1713800	Atoms with available P orbitals can also accomplish this type of bonding by overlapping one lobe
1713800	1716480	of a P orbital.
1716480	1721440	Placing electron density directly between the two positively charged nuclei screens
1721440	1725600	them from repelling one another, creating a very strong bond.
1725600	1730520	In fact, sigma bonds are so stable that they're always the first type of bond to form between
1730520	1732560	two atoms.
1732560	1737320	It does, however, create a bond around which the attached atoms can spin, like the axle
1737320	1743680	of a vehicle, giving these bonds what chemists call free rotation.
1743680	1748840	But pi bonds, on the other hand, form when P atomic orbitals overlap in a side-to-side
1748840	1752320	fashion as shown here.
1752320	1757520	Now notice that there's no electron density along that internuclear axis, but rather above
1757520	1760720	and below the bonded atoms.
1760720	1765240	This makes pi bonds a little bit weaker than sigma bonds, but also gives them some very
1765240	1770560	interesting properties, like restricted rotation, and in many cases greater reactivity since
1770560	1773680	their electrons are easier to remove.
1773680	1777440	So we'll explore both of those properties a little bit later in the course.
1777440	1782080	So far we've discussed atomic structure, the energetics driving bonding, and some of the
1782080	1785800	simpler ways in which orbitals can overlap to form new chemical bonds.
1785800	1789600	We've covered quite a bit, but there's still one last very important process which helps
1789600	1796960	us explain exactly why atoms take on the geometries they do when bonding.
1796960	1801760	So let's begin by taking a look at a methane molecule.
1801760	1806040	Now you'll notice that I've drawn the atoms here around a central carbon of methane in
1806040	1813280	a tetrahedral arrangement, and all four bonds are evenly spaced around that central carbon.
1813280	1819360	We know this is true from experimentation, but the atomic orbitals, those S and P orbitals
1819360	1824400	that I showed you previously, they don't have this tetrahedral geometry.
1824400	1829040	So if the sigma bonds holding each hydrogen to the central carbon were produced by either
1829040	1833360	a P orbital or an S orbital from the central carbon, the resulting molecule would have
1833360	1842040	a very unusual geometry, and yet here we have this beautiful elegantly symmetrical molecule.
1842040	1847040	That elegant simple symmetry of methane was actually a puzzle to chemists until the renowned
1847040	1854560	physical chemist Linus Pauling published a theory on orbital hybridization in 1931.
1854560	1858600	Pauling postulated that atomic orbitals could combine with one another, creating new sets
1858600	1863280	of orbitals with some S character and some P character.
1863280	1869400	So according to Pauling's new idea, any number of S and P atomic orbitals can combine to
1869400	1873320	form an equal number of degenerate hybrid orbitals.
1873320	1878520	And these new orbitals are neither S nor P, but a mixture of the two, having properties
1878520	1880200	of both.
1880200	1884440	And this led Pauling to refer to them as hybrid orbitals.
1884440	1890920	For example, one S and one P orbital can combine to form two SP hybrid orbitals.
1890920	1897320	Each of the new hybrid orbitals has about 50% S character and 50% P character.
1897320	1901400	The influence of both contributing atomic orbitals is evident.
1901400	1906920	Both can form sigma bonds and are at a 180 degree angle to one another.
1906920	1911560	Now this phenomenon extends to hybridization of one S and two P orbitals to form three
1911560	1914800	equivalent SP two orbitals.
1914800	1919480	These orbitals would be 120 degrees apart, and it also applies to the combination of
1919480	1926640	one S and three P orbitals to form four SP three hybrid orbitals, all of equal energy
1926640	1932560	and identical geometry spaced 109.5 degrees apart.
1932560	1937320	So in the case of SP three hybridization, the hybrid orbitals all point at the corners
1937320	1939480	of this tetrahedron.
1939480	1945040	This leads chemists to call atoms like methane, at least the central carbon of methane, tetrahedral
1945040	1946040	atoms.
1946040	1949960	Now remarkably Pauling's theory was spot on.
1949960	1954600	Hybridization is a perfect explanation for the symmetry of the methane gas molecule.
1954600	1960400	It's four identical carbon-hydrogen bonds spaced evenly can only be explained by Pauling's
1960400	1963960	new hybridization theory.
1963960	1967080	So let's sum up what we've covered today.
1967080	1971880	We've discussed the structure of the atom, how positively charged nuclei are surrounded
1971880	1977600	by a highly ordered cloud of orbiting negatively charged electrons.
1977600	1982600	We consider the octet rule, and how it is an atom's desire to have a full valence shell
1982600	1986920	which drives the process of chemical bonding.
1986920	1991720	We saw how atoms of drastically different electronegativity can exchange electrons completely
1991720	1998880	to form ionic bonds, which are then held together by an electrostatic attraction.
1998880	2004600	We also took a look at purely covalent bonds, in which atoms of identical electronegativity
2004600	2009320	share one or more pairs of electrons between themselves to increase their valence electron
2009320	2013960	count without altering their charge.
2013960	2018120	We also talked about how smaller differences in electronegativity between covalently bonded
2018120	2022120	atoms can lead to what are known as polar covalent bonds.
2022120	2026920	We studied how the principal energy levels of larger atoms can be divided into finer structures,
2026920	2031000	which are used to explain the two types of chemical bonding most often encountered in
2031000	2032840	organic chemistry.
2032840	2037800	How strong, freely rotating sigma bonds form along the inter-nuclear axis of the two bonded
2037800	2044360	atoms, and how somewhat weaker rotation-restricting pi bonds form by a side-to-side overlap of
2044360	2046600	p orbitals.
2046600	2051240	And finally, we took a look at how hybridization of atomic orbitals can create sets of hybrid
2051240	2057680	orbitals which explain the observed geometries in most organic molecules.
2057680	2062240	So now that we understand a bit about the process and geometries of chemical bonding,
2062240	2067520	our next task will be to put some atoms together into molecules and survey a few of the many
2067560	2070760	ways that chemists draw the resulting molecules.
2070760	2073120	This is our topic for next time, and I'll see you then.
