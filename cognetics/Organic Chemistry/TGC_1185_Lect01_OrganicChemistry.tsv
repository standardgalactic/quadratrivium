115560	118400	Most of our understanding of the chemistry of carbon based
118400	121640	compounds has been accumulated since the discovery of some
121640	126680	of the most fundamental elements less than 300 years ago. In
126680	130040	fact, it was only about 3000 years ago that ancient Greek and
130040	133040	Chinese thinkers were the first to postulate the existence of
133040	138400	fundamental substances at all. But Mother Nature got a head
138400	142360	star on us about 3 billion years ago, when the first living
142360	146200	organic chemist on Earth came into existence. Here's one.
147160	151240	Cyanobacteria believed by most to be the first living organisms
151240	155400	to inhabit the face of the Earth. Fossil evidence shows that
155400	159040	these bacteria took up residence here about 2.7 billion years
159040	164200	ago. Now these little creatures fed, grew and self replicated.
164760	169440	They contain lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, all the usual
169440	173040	suspects from a modern biochemistry course. And for the
173040	177040	basis of their biochemistry, the central element upon which they
177040	179720	built the molecular machinery which sustained their own
179720	185640	existence, they chose carbon. Through the process of evolution,
186160	188920	the foundations of their biochemistry were passed on to
188960	193280	each and every living thing that has ever lived on Earth. As
193280	196240	unicellular organisms continued to evolve and their chemical
196240	200160	systems grew in complexity, more ordered eukaryotic cells formed
200160	203960	with organelles to carry out specialized functions. Then came
203960	207360	multicellular aquatic organisms and terrestrial plant life and
207360	214520	animals. But through 2.7 billion years of evolution, to the best
214520	219120	of our knowledge, life as we know it has never, not once
219360	222760	abandoned its choice of carbon as the foundation onto which it
222760	227440	builds its most essential chemistry. With almost 100
227440	230680	naturally occurring elements and such an expansive time frame,
231200	234960	you might think that somewhere, sometime under some set of
234960	238880	environmental stresses, life would try a different element and
238880	243640	have some success. Yet all evidence points to the contrary,
244080	246800	it simply hasn't. But why?
249160	252280	Carbon is not the most abundant element on Earth, nor is it
252280	256200	particularly scarce. It's easily made in the furnace of a star
256240	260680	like our sun. But then so are the other 25 of the lightest 26
260680	265200	elements in our universe. At the sixth smallest in size, its
265200	268240	atoms don't have an unusually complex or simple structure to
268240	272080	them. Can't stack up to the ferocious reactivity of elements
272080	276840	like fluorine, nor is it rock stable like helium. At a glance,
276840	281880	it seems that there is nothing special about carbon. But in a
281880	285760	way, that is just what makes carbon such a perfect choice to
285760	289880	serve as the scaffold for the chemistry of life. It strikes the
289880	293800	right balance of properties, which make it uniquely suited to
293800	297960	its role in living systems. And it's this balance that makes
297960	301800	carbon the undisputed centerpiece of living systems.
304240	307920	But carbon's story doesn't end there. Not only is it central to
307920	311400	the chemistry of life, but it also serves as a structural basis
311400	315400	for materials of incredible strength, fuels with tremendous
315400	318400	amounts of stored chemical energy, and life saving
318400	324280	medicines. Carbon's story is nothing short of incredible. So
324280	327040	incredible that we've honored it with something no other element
327040	332440	has its own branch of chemistry. And we call this branch organic
332440	332920	chemistry.
336080	338240	Today, I would like to discuss the essentials of organic
338240	343240	chemistry. We'll be looking at what organic chemistry is, how
343240	346960	organic chemistry is practiced, and where we can find organic
346960	352360	chemistry operating in our world. And don't fall into the trap of
352360	356200	thinking about the science that goes on in laboratories. Organic
356200	359280	chemistry is going on in places many of us may not typically
359280	363600	imagine. We can find it at work all around us in places as
363600	367360	distant and exotic as deep within the Earth's crust, or
367360	372280	interstellar space. It's also all around us going on right now
372320	376400	inside countless manufacturing facilities around the world. It's
376400	379440	powering the engines of the vehicles passing by this studio. And
379440	382040	it's even going on in your own body right now.
384760	387520	During our time together today, I'll be discussing what is
387520	390720	arguably one of humanity's greatest intellectual achievements,
391080	395560	the science of chemistry. Then we'll explore how our growing
395560	398320	understanding of how to manipulate the molecules of life
398560	401840	eventually led us to establish the discipline of organic
401840	408080	chemistry. Next, we will briefly discuss the structure of the
408080	412560	fundamental unit of all known elements, the atom. We'll also
412560	415360	take a look at a portion of the well-known tool of chemists, the
415360	418560	periodic table of the elements, which helps us to predict their
418560	422160	behavior and their properties. Here we will be answering the
422160	426080	question, what is it about carbon that makes it nature's choice
426080	430000	to serve as the basic scaffold for many of the molecules we
430000	435680	depend on to sustain and improve life. Finally, we'll take a
435680	438440	look at a few real world examples of how carbon atoms come
438440	441680	together to form the backbones of the molecules that become our
441680	446040	building materials, food, fuels, drugs, and so much more.
448960	451840	By the end of our discussion, I hope that you'll have a deeper
451840	455920	appreciation of organic chemistry, of its definition, its
455920	459160	origins, and how it helps to improve the quality of life of
459160	463320	nearly every human on the planet. If I'm able to succeed in
463320	466680	that endeavor, I invite you to stay for the next 35 lectures to
466680	470920	learn even more about this well understood, but ever evolving
470920	476760	and growing branch of chemistry. So first, let's define the
476760	481760	science of chemistry. Scientists define chemistry as the study
481760	485520	of matter and its properties, particularly those of atomic and
485520	490040	molecular systems. One of the defining tenets of chemistry is
490040	493480	the idea that all substances can be broken down into their
493480	497040	basic elements, which can no longer be subdivided while still
497040	499880	retaining their identity. Ancient Greek and Chinese
499880	503240	civilizations are often credited with first theorizing the
503240	506400	existence of fundamental elements that combine to form all
506400	510920	other substances. Both of these civilizations postulated that
510920	516000	air, water, earth, and fire were among these elements. Of
516000	519440	course, today we know this list to be inaccurate. Now, the
519440	523040	realization of this began in the 18th century, when a French
523040	526800	chemist and nobleman named Antoine Lavoisier became the
526800	530240	first to catalog the existence and properties of some of the
530240	535680	elements as we know them today. Lavoisier started to develop
535680	538640	this catalog when he challenged the two millennium old notion
538640	542120	that water is an element. He knew that if water were an
542120	544880	element, then he should not be able to decompose it into
544880	549120	simpler substances. But he noted that heating water in the
549120	552440	presence of iron in a closed system had two intriguing
552440	557240	effects. First, it turned the iron to rust, which appeared to
557240	561920	increase the mass of the iron sample. And second, it produced
561920	565880	a vapor which could be collected separately and then burned in
565880	572240	air to regenerate water. What was going on here was that the
572240	575800	iron was acting as a sink for oxygen, pulling the oxygen out
575800	579320	of the water to become iron oxide and leaving hydrogen gas
579320	583800	behind as a byproduct. Any doubt that water had in fact been
583800	587280	decomposed was eradicated when Lavoisier showed that he could
587280	591960	burn the collected gas to reform his water. So, Lavoisier had
591960	595920	successfully disassembled and then reassembled water in the
595920	602160	1700s. Lavoisier's tinkering proves that contrary to ancient
602160	606960	thought, water is not an element, but instead is made up of
606960	611440	more basic materials in combination with each other. But
611440	614160	Lavoisier's best efforts to decompose the resulting gases
614160	617280	from his first experiment failed, prompting him to
617280	621120	categorize those as elements. Now, since it could be burned in
621120	623800	air, at least the gas that he collected, could be burned in air
623800	630960	to produce water, he dubbed it hydrogen, meaning water maker.
630960	634040	Lavoisier's classification techniques quickly gained favor
634040	637240	in the scientific community and the list of identified elements
637240	642000	rapidly grew in the decades following his work. In the late
642000	646600	1800s, a Russian chemist by the name of Dmitry Mendeleev took
646600	650680	notice of something extraordinary. Mendeleev realized
650720	653560	that when he listed the known elements in order of increasing
653560	658240	atomic mass, they formed a series of materials, some of which
658240	662760	seemed to have similar sets of chemical and physical properties.
662760	665760	And when he spaced these elements so that similar properties
665760	669720	repeated every eight positions in the list, he could account for
669720	675000	all the known elements of his day. But what is even more
675000	678760	amazing is that the gaps left in Mendeleev's table allowed him
678760	682240	to predict the properties of yet undiscovered elements, all of
682240	687120	which eventually turned up. Mendeleev's true genius was to
687120	690720	visually demonstrate this repeating pattern by wrapping
690720	694080	the lines of atoms into rows, much like lines of text in a
694080	698280	paragraph. And by doing this, he created a table with columns of
698280	702640	elements sharing similar chemical properties. We call these
702640	707320	columns from his table groups of elements. More than 200 years
707320	710800	later, his pivotal invention has been refined and expanded into
710800	717520	what we know as the modern periodic table. So we've seen
717520	719960	that chemistry is the study of matter and its properties.
720600	723240	Given that all objects in the universe can be classified as
723240	726840	matter, and that nearly all of this matter is made up of atoms
726840	729760	and molecules, you can understand why chemistry is an
729760	735920	extremely broad field of study. And with such a tremendous field
735920	739840	of cover, it's easy to see why those practicing the science
739880	743280	divide their interest into subdisciplines, like biological
743280	748800	chemistry, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and more. And
748800	751520	while each subdiscipline is a topic worthy of study and
751520	754800	appreciation, for the duration of this course, we will be
754800	758320	interested in organic chemistry. Although there will
758320	761280	inevitably be times when organic chemistry bleeds into these
761280	770280	other realms. So what is organic chemistry? When most people
770280	773520	think of the word organic, they may think of expensive
773520	776440	salad greens, health food stores or sustainable farming
776440	779880	techniques. But to the chemist, the word organic means
779880	784320	something very different. Organic chemistry is most simply
784320	789240	defined as the study of carbon based molecules. Compounds
789240	792720	such as the hydrocarbons and gasoline, the sugars in the
792720	796000	foods we eat, many modern materials ranging from
796000	799480	explosives to plastics are all built on carbon based
799480	806200	backbones, and therefore all fall into this category. The term
806240	809840	organic as it pertains to the study of chemistry was coined in
809840	814080	the late 1700s. It's a reflection of a common paradigm of
814080	817840	that day, that only organisms could create these kinds of
817840	821960	carbon based molecules. See, scientists of that day had
821960	824760	already successfully isolated carbon based compounds like
824760	829200	urea from biological sources. And it was commonly presumed that
829200	834240	living things possessed a special trait known as vitality that
834240	837080	was necessary to produce the chemicals of living systems.
839560	844640	This dogma persisted for many decades, until 1828, when
844640	849120	German chemist Friedrich Voller produced urea without the aid of
849120	853800	a living organism. Voller simply heated the inorganic materials
853840	857760	ammonia and cyanic acid in an attempt to synthesize another
857800	862480	inorganic material called ammonium cyanate. But much to his
862480	868440	surprise, the product of his synthesis was instead urea. Since
868440	871680	then, Voller's synthesis has become the stuff of chemistry
871680	876240	lore. Many chemists point to it as a seminal moment in chemistry
876360	880240	when vitalism was disproven, and scientists began to realize
880240	883680	organic compounds could be made and manipulated, not just in
883680	890000	living things, but in a beaker as well. In the nearly two
890000	892360	centuries since Voller's inspiration will all be at
892360	896160	accidental synthesis. Organic chemists have classified and
896160	899120	created millions of organic compounds that enhance the
899120	907440	quality of life of nearly everyone on Earth. With over 100
907440	911040	elements in the modern periodic table, we're forced to ask the
911040	915440	question, What makes carbon so special? Why does carbon get
915440	919320	its own branch of chemistry? Now, the answer to this question
919320	924200	lies in a balance of three key factors, abundance, complexity,
924680	929040	and stability. When we compare carbon to the other elements
929080	932000	in the first three rows of the periodic table, we'll see that
932040	936160	only carbon is able to blend these three factors in a unique
936160	942400	way. Let's start by comparing abundance. If we were to make a
942400	945280	table of the estimated relative abundance of elements in our
945280	950000	solar system by mass, we'd see something like this. Many of the
950000	953160	elements are so vanishingly rare that they don't even register
953160	957520	on our chart. Hydrogen is the clear winner at about 73
957520	962320	mass percent, followed by helium comprising 24% and then
962360	967440	oxygen at about 1%. So out of more than 100 known elements,
967480	971200	just this trio makes up 98% of all the matter in our solar
971200	975920	system. But coming in at number four is carbon, making up
975920	979560	somewhere around one half of 1% of all the matter in the solar
979560	983160	system. Now, based on this information alone, you might
983160	985800	expect to find subdisciplines of chemistry focusing on the
985840	990280	chemistry of hydrogen, helium or oxygen as well. Yet these
990280	996000	subdisciplines do not exist. These numbers are a bit different
996040	999680	when we consider just the earth or even portions of it. Now, the
999680	1002120	truth is, we're not quite sure just how much of each element
1002120	1005920	makes up the overall mass of our planet. We do know, however,
1006160	1010080	that as the planet cooled more than 4 billion years ago, much of
1010080	1012920	the denser elements like iron and nickel found their way to the
1012920	1016800	core of the planet. Intermediate sized elements like silicon and
1016800	1020600	aluminum were sorted into the crust, leaving behind even
1020600	1024000	lighter elements like carbon and higher concentrations at and
1024000	1029760	near the surface. So carbon is ever present near the surface of
1029760	1032760	the earth in environments which might support life as we know
1032760	1036960	it. But our best estimates of the amount of carbon in those
1036960	1040560	environments, the world's atmosphere, oceans and crust is
1040560	1045360	never more than about 1% of the total mass. This means that
1045360	1048240	there's enough carbon there to work with. But if abundance were
1048240	1051800	the only concern, then there would clearly be better choices.
1054800	1058320	And yet, when we turn our attention to our own bodies, we
1058320	1062120	see that we are actually made up of about 20% carbon by mass.
1062960	1065680	This is far more than the relative abundance of carbon in our
1065680	1069200	environment, far more than the oceans, the atmosphere or dry
1069200	1073400	land. So carbon is available, but so are many other candidates.
1073760	1078080	So what's going on here? What makes the difference? Why use
1078080	1078560	carbon?
1081040	1083400	Well, clearly, there's something about carbon that makes it a
1083400	1085680	better choice for the structural basis of organic
1085680	1089080	molecules. With such an enormous amount of carbon in
1089080	1092160	biological systems relative to the environment around us, it's
1092160	1095000	easy to see how the concept of vitalism was originally
1095000	1095720	conceived.
1096720	1100920	But if vitalism has been shown to be an invalid theory, why is it
1100920	1104240	that carbon has been selected by nature to be the backbone for
1104240	1105800	the molecules essential to life?
1106960	1110440	Why would life go to the trouble of increasing carbon content
1110440	1113840	20 fold over what was available in the environment, especially
1113840	1116560	when there are much more abundant elements available, like
1116560	1121160	nitrogen, which makes up 78% of our atmosphere, or oxygen and
1121160	1125440	hydrogen, which combined to make up a staggering 96% of our
1126360	1131360	oceans, or silicon, which comes in at a very respectable 27% of
1131360	1132280	the Earth's crust?
1134200	1137040	In order to answer this question, we'll have to take a look at
1137040	1140080	the bonding behavior of carbon compared to other even more
1140080	1143480	abundant elements and try to explain a bit better why carbon
1143480	1145360	is so special when compared to them.
1146440	1149320	But before we can have this discussion, we first need to
1149320	1151120	consider the structure of atoms.
1152120	1156120	All atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded
1156120	1158600	by a cloud of negatively charged electrons.
1160120	1163120	The electron clouds of two or more atoms can interact with one
1163120	1166120	another in ways which can find those atoms to a fixed distance
1166120	1167120	in space.
1168120	1172120	We call this interaction between atoms a covalent chemical bond.
1174120	1176120	Now, one of the remarkable things about Mendeleev's brain
1176120	1179120	child, the periodic table of the elements, is that it actually
1179120	1182120	predicts the maximum number of these covalent bonding
1182120	1186120	interactions that a particular atom can form with others.
1188120	1191120	If we start from the leftmost column of the table, elements
1191120	1194120	of the first group can form one bond at most.
1195120	1199120	Those of the second can form two, and the trend continues
1199120	1201120	until we reach the fourth group.
1202120	1205120	After this, the maximum number of possible bonds begins to
1205120	1210120	decrease again to three, two, one, and finally, zero.
1212120	1215120	This makes hydrogen a relatively uninteresting nucleus
1215120	1218120	from the bonding perspective, since it can only form a single
1218120	1220120	bond with another atom.
1221120	1225120	So hydrogen atoms are the end-linked chains of bonded atoms.
1225120	1228120	They can't bond any more or two anymore atoms to continue
1228120	1231120	creating a complex structure, because doing so would require
1231120	1233120	that they make a second bond.
1233120	1236120	That makes hydrogen the placeholder of organic chemistry,
1236120	1239120	occupying locations on a molecule in which differing groups
1239120	1242120	of atoms might be placed to alter that molecule's
1242120	1244120	identity and reactivity.
1247120	1250120	Helium, nature's second most abundant element overall,
1250120	1253120	though vanishingly rare on Earth, appears in group
1253120	1256120	eight of the periodic table, making it unlikely to form
1256120	1258120	any bonds at all.
1259120	1262120	Helium actually exists only naturally as isolated atoms
1262120	1265120	that don't commonly react with other elements.
1265120	1267120	It's not essential to life at all.
1267120	1271120	In fact, Helium's lack of reactivity kept its existence
1271120	1274120	concealed from chemists for nearly a century after the
1274120	1276120	discovery of elements like hydrogen.
1277120	1280120	French astronomer Pierre Janssen first observed Helium
1280120	1284120	when studying a solar eclipse in 1868, a century after
1284120	1286120	Lavoisier's work.
1286120	1289120	And it was only after several more decades of searching
1289120	1292120	that Helium was finally found to be present on Earth.
1293120	1296120	An English physicist, Sir William Ramsey, found it,
1296120	1299120	trapped inside of radioactively decomposing minerals,
1299120	1302120	not exactly a biologically relevant environment.
1305120	1308120	And our final contender with carbon for the role of backbone
1308120	1310120	molecule is oxygen.
1310120	1313120	Oxygen typically makes two bonds to other atoms.
1313120	1316120	In doing so, oxygen can act either as a bridge,
1316120	1320120	bonding two different atoms together perpetuating a chain,
1320120	1324120	or as a terminal atom, making what is known as a double bond.
1325120	1328120	But once oxygen's two bonds are established,
1328120	1331120	it is satisfied, and there are no additional locations
1331120	1334120	available to decorate or modify an oxygen chain.
1334120	1337120	Using an oxygen chain as a backbone would then lead to
1337120	1340120	a rather dull set of molecules, just a set of ever-lengthening
1340120	1343120	chains of oxygen atoms with no additional complexity at all.
1343120	1347120	But carbon interests organic chemists because it's found
1347120	1349120	in group four of the periodic table.
1350120	1354120	This means that it can, and often does, form four bonds
1354120	1357120	to complete its electron-shell octet.
1357120	1360120	This is more bonds than any other element in the second row
1360120	1362120	of the periodic table.
1362120	1366120	And this allows carbon to bond to itself to form not only chains,
1366120	1370120	but branched structures, loops, and many, many more.
1371120	1374120	Furthermore, these complex carbon scaffolds often have
1374120	1377120	remaining unsatisfied bonds, which can be terminated
1377120	1380120	by hydrogen atoms, or decorated by hydrogen atoms,
1380120	1383120	or decorated by hydrogen atoms.
1383120	1386120	So it should be clear now that those extra bonds
1386120	1389120	that carbon can form are going to make all the difference.
1389120	1391120	But we aren't quite done yet.
1391120	1394120	If you're keeping score, we still have nitrogen
1394120	1397120	and silicon on the list of possible backbone elements
1397120	1399120	for larger complex scaffolds.
1400120	1403120	Nitrogen and silicon have withstood the test
1403120	1406120	of both abundance and of bonding conditions
1406120	1409120	in the second row of the periodic table.
1409120	1412120	And silicon and silicon have withstood the test
1412120	1415120	of both abundance and of bonding complexity.
1416120	1418120	With nitrogen abundant in the atmosphere,
1418120	1421120	able to form three bonds, while silicon makes up
1421120	1424120	a large part of the Earth's crust and is able to make four bonds.
1425120	1427120	So we're close.
1427120	1430120	But what separates carbon from nitrogen and silicon
1430120	1433120	is the last factor that we have to consider, strength.
1434120	1437120	You wouldn't build a skyscraper with a frame
1437120	1440120	because the structural support has to be stronger
1440120	1443120	than the doors, windows, and walls which it holds in place.
1446120	1449120	Organic molecules are no different.
1449120	1452120	Just like a building, they need a support structure
1452120	1455120	tough enough to hold the functional parts
1455120	1457120	of the compound in place.
1457120	1460120	Any candidate for this role will have to be tough enough
1460120	1463120	to withstand the conditions which cause other parts
1463120	1466120	of the compound to break their bonds and react.
1467120	1470120	So the final factor leading to nature's choice of carbon
1470120	1473120	for small molecule scaffolds is the stability
1473120	1475120	of the carbon-carbon bond.
1477120	1481120	You see, bonding is an energetically beneficial arrangement.
1481120	1484120	And a bond's strength is usually measured
1484120	1488120	by the amount of energy required to separate the bonded atoms.
1489120	1492120	Scientists call this the bond enthalpy.
1492120	1495120	So the larger the bond enthalpy, the harder it is
1495120	1498120	to pull two bonded atoms apart,
1498120	1501120	and the stronger the chemical bond is.
1502120	1505120	If we compare the experimentally determined bond enthalpies
1505120	1508120	of all first, second, and third row elements
1508120	1512120	in the periodic table to other atoms of the same kind of element,
1512120	1516120	we can see that only hydrogen and boron form single bonds
1516120	1520120	to other atoms of the same kind with similar strengths to carbon.
1521120	1524120	So hydrogen does bond to itself strongly
1524120	1529120	and is very abundant, but its one bond limit rules it out.
1530120	1532120	Boron can form stable bonds with itself
1532120	1535120	in networks with up to three bonds.
1535120	1537120	But it's so vanishingly rare in the environment
1537120	1539120	that it simply can't play an important role
1539120	1541120	in the chemistry of life.
1543120	1546120	Our last two viable candidates, nitrogen and silicon,
1546120	1549120	are finally ruled out when we consider bond strength.
1550120	1552120	With bonds only about half as strong as carbon,
1552120	1554120	nitrogen can't compete.
1554120	1558120	And even silicon, a favorite candidate of sci-fi aficionados everywhere,
1558120	1561120	as carbons alternate because of its abundance
1561120	1564120	and ability to form four bonds, fails to meet the final standard.
1564120	1567120	Because a covalent network of silicon atoms
1567120	1571120	would simply not be stable enough to survive chemical reactions
1571120	1574120	meant to modify other bonds within the molecules it would comprise.
1576120	1580120	So if we consider the first three rows of the periodic table,
1580120	1584120	removing elements of prohibitively low abundance,
1584120	1588120	elements incapable of forming more than two bonds,
1588120	1592120	and those which do not form strong single bonds to themselves,
1592120	1595120	it now becomes obvious how these three factors
1595120	1600120	make carbon uniquely suited to the formation of molecular scaffolds.
1603120	1605120	So I hope that by now I've convinced you
1605120	1608120	that carbon is nature's best available choice
1608120	1610120	for the construction of molecular scaffolds
1610120	1613120	because of its abundance, complex bonding
1613120	1616120	and the stable bonds it forms with other carbon atoms.
1617120	1620120	Now I would like to show you specifically how carbon atoms
1620120	1623120	can combine to form distinct structures
1623120	1625120	and how decorating these structures with other atoms
1625120	1629120	can lead to a rich and diverse library of compounds.
1631120	1635120	Part of what makes carbon scaffolds so prolific and diverse
1635120	1638120	is the multiple ways in which the four bonds to carbon atoms
1638120	1640120	can arrange themselves in space.
1641120	1646120	Remember that chemical bonds are formed when electron clouds overlap
1646120	1649120	and this produces a region of dense negative charge
1649120	1651120	between the atom's nuclei.
1652120	1655120	So these bonds made up of negatively charged electrons
1655120	1658120	can be thought of as being negatively charged themselves
1658120	1660120	and just as you might expect
1660120	1663120	because they're made up of like charged particles they repel one another.
1663120	1666120	Positioning themselves as far apart as possible
1666120	1668120	around the central atom.
1671120	1674120	So when a carbon atom is connected to two other atoms
1674120	1679120	either by two double bonds or by a single bond and a triple bond
1679120	1683120	the connected atoms are 180 degrees apart from one another
1683120	1686120	forming a linear geometry among those three atoms.
1688120	1691120	When a carbon atom is connected to three other atoms
1691120	1695120	two atoms by a single bond and one other atom by a double bond
1695120	1700120	the atoms form a planar geometry in the shape of an equilateral triangle
1700120	1704120	with bond angles of 120 degrees among all of the atoms.
1704120	1708120	We call this type of geometry trigonal planar.
1710120	1713120	But the real magic happens when we use all four bonds
1713120	1716120	to connect to four distinct bonding partners.
1717120	1722120	In this case a planar geometry would require 90 degree bond angles
1722120	1725120	but giving these bonds access to the third dimension
1725120	1728120	allows them to separate even more from one another
1728120	1731120	forming bond angles of 109.5 degrees.
1732120	1735120	And we call this arrangement tetrahedral
1735120	1740120	because tracing lines among all bonded atoms produces the shape of a tetrahedron.
1741120	1746120	So by bonding carbon atoms together using some or all of these geometries
1746120	1750120	linear trigonal planar and particularly tetrahedral
1750120	1755120	we can form almost any three-dimensional arrangement imaginable.
1755120	1759120	But notice that in all of the examples of carbon scaffolds shown here
1759120	1763120	there are remaining bonds terminated by hydrogen atoms
1763120	1766120	which could easily be replaced by other sets of atoms.
1767120	1771120	This means that each carbon scaffold can act as a backbone
1771120	1776120	supporting hundreds, thousands or even millions of distinct atom combinations.
1777120	1779120	By designing molecules in this way
1779120	1784120	chemists are able to create compounds with very specific and rationally designed shapes
1784120	1787120	physical properties and reactivities.
1788120	1793120	As you can probably imagine this quickly leads to a virtually limitless library of possible compounds
1793120	1799120	all of which rely on the stability and geometry of their carbon scaffold to function.
1801120	1803120	As we progress through the course
1803120	1807120	we will take a detailed look at how building upon these scaffolds
1807120	1810120	leads to libraries of compounds with extremely diverse properties.
1810120	1814120	And I'd like to close our conversation today with a few examples.
1815120	1818120	Consider compounds with only six carbons in their scaffold.
1818120	1822120	Using these six atoms we can construct a variety of scaffolds
1822120	1830120	such as straight chains, branched scaffolds, cyclic scaffolds, fused bicyclics and even more.
1831120	1834120	Now let's see what we can do with just six carbon atoms in a scaffold
1834120	1836120	and a little bit of imagination.
1839120	1843120	Let's bring up those six carbon atoms and place them in a linear chain.
1844120	1847120	If I saturate this structure with hydrogens
1847120	1851120	meaning I put hydrogens at all the remaining bonding locations on the carbons
1851120	1854120	I create a molecule known as hexane.
1854120	1857120	Hexane is a component of motor fuels.
1857120	1862120	But if I make just a few alterations inserting some oxygen atoms
1862120	1865120	I create a molecule known as glucose
1865120	1869120	a simple sugar found in foods and used by your body to store energy.
1870120	1873120	If we make a few more changes and throw in a nitrogen atom here
1873120	1879120	we create lysine, an essential amino acid which your body uses to make enzymes and tissues.
1881120	1883120	But let's go back to our carbons and rearrange them.
1883120	1885120	Let's create a branched chain now.
1886120	1889120	This branched chain when saturated with hydrogens
1889120	1893120	is isohexane, yet another component that's blended into motor fuels.
1894120	1896120	If I add a little bit to it
1896120	1900120	I can create leucine, yet another amino acid essential to life.
1901120	1903120	But I can make another change
1903120	1909120	and create isohexyl acetate, a flavor and fragrance additive that smells a bit like fruit.
1911120	1914120	Let's continue. Let's take those carbons and put them into a ring.
1915120	1920120	When I saturate my six-membered ring I create cyclohexane, yet another motor fuel.
1921120	1923120	But that's not all cyclohexane can do.
1923120	1928120	If I make a little change I can create the heart medication, cyclohexyl nitrite.
1929120	1932120	Or I can make the artificial sweetener, cyclomate.
1934120	1937120	One last example. Let's take those atoms again and put them into a ring.
1937120	1942120	But this time let's put them into a ring where they have a different bonding structure to one another.
1942120	1944120	This is called a benzene ring.
1944120	1947120	And when it's saturated with hydrogens we call that molecule benzene,
1947120	1951120	an industrial solvent and also one that we use in the laboratory quite frequently.
1951120	1956120	But just a small change to that structure gives me aspirin, popular analgesic.
1957120	1962120	Yet another change gives me TNT, a high explosive.
1963120	1967120	Impressive versatility and variability, isn't it? All done with just six atoms.
1969120	1974120	So all of these possibilities and countless more are accessible with just six carbon atoms.
1975120	1978120	Not only can the number of carbon atoms in scaffolds be changed,
1978120	1982120	but there is a long library of reactive groups made from other elements
1982120	1985120	that can be bonded to these carbon scaffolds that we've discussed today.
1986120	1993120	In tandem, these two factors combine to form a practically inexhaustible library of possibilities.
1995120	1997120	So let's review what we've discussed today.
1998120	2002120	We've explored what organic chemistry is, how it got started,
2002120	2005120	and how our understanding of it has changed over the years.
2006120	2010120	We've also scratched the surface of explaining how carbon's abundance,
2010120	2014120	bonding complexity and bonding strength all combine to make it such a unique
2014120	2018120	and versatile element for building complex small molecules.
2019120	2023120	Finally, we've looked at how the decoration of these scaffolds with groups of other atoms
2023120	2026120	can lead to a diverse library of useful compounds.
2028120	2033120	Next time, we'll take a much more detailed look at atomic structure and chemical bonding,
2033120	2038120	examining exactly why some of the trends predicted by the periodic table exist.
2039120	2043120	And in doing so, we will continue to deepen our understanding of the complex geometries
2043120	2048120	of the carbon frameworks on which every living thing relies.
2049120	2051120	I look forward to seeing you then.
