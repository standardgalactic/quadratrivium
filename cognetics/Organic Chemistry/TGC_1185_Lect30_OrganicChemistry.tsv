0	17860	We've spent some time now learning about the discovery of how electromagnetic waves in
17860	22920	and near the visible spectrum can interact with organic molecules and how we can observe
22920	28240	that interaction in a way which gives us information about the structure of the molecules involved.
30600	35000	We learned how Newton's use of a prism to separate light into its constituent wavelengths
35000	39840	introduced the western world to the idea that visible light was made up of multiple color
39840	42120	components.
42120	46600	We saw how the discoveries of Herschel and Ritter demonstrated that there were other
46600	50560	types of light just outside of that visible spectrum as well.
50560	55360	We've talked about how all three of these portions of the spectrum, ultraviolet, visible,
55360	60560	and infrared, interact with small molecules in the tremendous utility that these phenomena
60560	66720	have as tools for the identification of organic compounds.
66720	71360	So far we've investigated how to determine the extent of conjugation in a compound with
71360	77800	UV visible spectroscopy, the presence of functional groups using IR spectroscopy, and the handedness
77800	81920	of compounds using polarimetry.
81920	87120	But short of comparing the fingerprint region of IR spectra to those of known standards,
87120	93160	we don't really have a way to probe the connectivity of functional groups within a molecule.
93160	97280	So if we're making an entirely new molecule, for which there is no reference spectrum yet
97280	103400	in the literature, how are we going to confirm its identity?
103400	108760	In this lecture, we will move on to yet another region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
108760	113440	To get our answer, we're going all the way to the long wavelength end of the spectrum,
113440	121620	beyond infrared, past microwaves, all the way to the radio portion of the spectrum.
121620	125920	But before we get to our radio waves today, we'll need to try to better understand a property
125920	130800	of atoms that we haven't really discussed and which we usually think of as more within
130800	134280	the realm of physics than organic chemistry.
134280	137480	That property is magnetism.
137560	142720	The magnetic properties of nuclei were not well understood by Newton, Ritter, and Herschel,
142720	147080	and they went largely unaddressed during the development of optical spectroscopy techniques
147080	150560	in the 1800s.
150560	153520	But in the early 1900s, that all changed.
153520	158600	In large part due to the efforts of Isidore Rebe, an American physicist who is credited
158600	163600	with having the revelation that atoms have certain magnetic properties which can be used
163600	167800	to discern them from one another in a given molecule.
167800	174920	So to get started today, let's take one more step back and consider magnetism in general.
174920	180120	But before we get to our radio frequency radiation, I'd like to show you this.
180120	181120	It's a compass.
181120	187200	It's a device with which most of us, especially navigators, pilots, hikers, are familiar.
187200	192200	A small magnetized needle is mounted on an axis which allows it to turn so that it can
192200	197120	align itself with whatever sort of magnetic field it's in.
197120	201480	Of course, in the case of my compass needle, this field is generated by the Earth's rotating
201480	202720	inner core.
202720	206840	Now, physicists have several different units used to measure the intensity of a magnetic
206840	212560	field, one of which is Tesla, named for the famous and somewhat eccentric physicist Nikola
212560	214920	Tesla.
214920	220000	At its surface, the Earth's magnetic field measures about 50 milli-Tesla.
220120	225200	Here, close to Washington, D.C., this weak but ever-present field points about 11 degrees
225200	227800	to the west of true north.
227800	232880	When I place this compass within the field, the needle aligns itself with that field,
232880	235160	giving me an indication of its direction.
235160	239680	So, let's assume for a moment that I could somehow remove the influence of the Earth's
239680	240800	magnetic field.
240800	245720	Now, I can't remove the Earth's magnetic field because I can't stop the core from spinning.
245720	250560	But what I can do is use these rare Earth magnets to pull this needle out of alignment.
250560	255240	Now, if there were no magnetic field, I would expect that any arrangement whatsoever of
255240	258160	this needle in space would be of equal energy.
258160	261240	So any alignment is possible.
261240	264840	But as soon as I remove my rare Earth's magnetic field and allow the Earth's magnetic field
264840	270720	to take over once again, this guy back out of alignment, snaps right back.
271280	276000	So as soon as I place my compass back in the field, the energy of the aligned state becomes
276000	281520	lower in energy than any of the other misaligned states, causing the needle to reliably and
281520	285720	predictably take on that lower energy orientation.
285720	292720	Now, the reason I'm showing you this, this rather mundane little magnetic tool, is that
292720	298400	it's a very good analogy for the behavior of certain atomic nuclei.
298400	303840	At atomic nuclei have a property that physicists call magnetic spin.
303840	307440	I specifically mentioned physicists here because I refuse to lay the blame for this one on
307440	309840	chemists.
309840	314920	Spin, you see, is a very unfortunate choice of terminology, as it doesn't actually refer
314920	319760	to a rate of rotation as one might assume from classical mechanics.
319760	323280	It's a common point of confusion in the study of NMR, so let's be sure we clear that up
323280	325280	right away.
325280	328560	Now for our discussion, it'll suffice to say this.
328560	333840	Certain atomic nuclei have a spin quantum number of one-half, which is just a fancy
333840	338240	way of saying that there are two possible magnetic states.
338240	343480	Such nuclei contain what is known as a magnetic dipole, or a magnetization which can behave
343480	348520	much like an atom-sized bar magnet or compass needle.
348520	353880	Finally, those neutrons that I encouraged you to overlook way back at the beginning of the
353880	356720	course are about to become relevant.
356720	362200	This is because isotopes, or atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons,
362200	367600	have different magnetic properties, and nearly every element has at least one isotope, which
367600	370080	is spin one-half.
370080	376840	This includes protons, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, and fluorine-19.
376840	381680	But for this lecture, we're going to confine ourselves to protons, with the caveat that
381680	385600	the same magnetic tricks I'm about to show you can be pulled with at least one isotope
385600	393720	of practically every commonly encountered element.
393720	397800	So let's take a look at a hydrogen nucleus.
397800	402160	So the magnetic dipole of certain atomic nuclei behaves in much the same way as our compass
402160	407520	needle did, randomly orienting itself in the absence of an external magnetic field.
407520	412080	But as soon as a magnetic field is applied, which we represent as these lines, specific
412080	417080	orientations of the nuclear dipole become more stable.
417080	422800	Now where the analogy deviates from our macroscopic example of our compass and needle is that
422800	430760	spin one-half atomic nuclei can align their dipoles either parallel to or anti-parallel
430760	436600	to a magnetic field in which they reside, leading to a distribution of those two states
436600	440920	in the population.
440920	446160	But the energies of the parallel state, often called the alpha spin state and the anti-parallel
446160	451840	alignment, sometimes called the beta spin state, differ by an amount which can be calculated
451840	456480	and is referred to as the Zaman splitting energy.
456480	461320	The Zaman splitting energy is a function of the intensity of the external magnetic field
461680	467200	and an intrinsic property of the nucleus called its gyromagnetic ratio.
467200	471960	Now by intrinsic, I mean that, for example, all protons in the universe have the exact
471960	475080	same gyromagnetic ratio.
475080	480960	So for a nucleus of a given type, the stronger the external magnetic field, the greater the
480960	487880	energy difference between the alpha and beta spin states will be.
487880	493000	Now on our way to understanding how NMR works in laboratories of the 21st century, we first
493000	497880	have to make a pit stop in the 1940s and 50s when the science was still being developed
497880	501000	by Rebi and his contemporaries.
501000	505560	This historical context is going to help us to better understand the more complex instruments
505560	507320	of today.
507320	511560	So let's say that we have a collection of protons in a fairly strong external magnetic
511560	513480	field.
513480	517920	We expect that these protons will arrange themselves in a collection of alpha and beta
517920	524840	spin states, with just a very slight excess in the lower energy alpha state.
524840	529080	Let's say that we place our protons in a 1.4 Tesla magnetic field.
529080	535720	That's a field about 28,000 times as strong as the Earth's, powerful but attainable with
535720	539120	a suitable electromagnet.
539120	546320	First on the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton, 42.577 MHz per Tesla, I can calculate the
546320	551440	Zaman splitting energy difference between those two states.
551440	556120	Since the proton is the most frequently used nucleus in NMR experiments, we report field
556120	560820	strengths in Tesla or rarely in Tesla, more often we actually use the resonance frequency
560820	564240	of a proton in that field.
564240	569800	For example, our 1.4 Tesla magnet should bring a proton into resonance with a radiation
569800	572920	of 60 MHz in frequency.
572920	578320	So you'll notice that most modern spectrometers have a frequency splashed across the side in
578320	580040	large fonts.
580040	583080	This is the frequency that's indicated there.
583080	588120	It's a photon of that specific frequency, one with a wavelength of about 5 meters, which
588120	592920	carries just the right amount of energy to cause a proton in the alpha spin state to
592920	600360	flip into the beta spin state, absorbing the photon in the process.
600360	604360	So early spectrometers attempting to take advantage of this phenomenon consisted of
604360	613320	a powerful electromagnet, a radio frequency transmitter, and a radio frequency receiver.
613320	618200	A sample of organic material is placed into the magnetic field and irradiated with a constant
618200	622080	wave of a specific radio frequency.
622080	625480	In keeping with our example, that would be 60 MHz.
625480	630600	And this is how continuous wave NMR gets its name.
630600	636240	The current to the electromagnet is slowly increased as the exiting radio wave is monitored
636240	638320	at the receiver.
638320	644440	In our very simple example, at one very specific field strength, the radio wave will be absorbed
644440	649800	in the spin state transition from alpha to beta, manifesting itself as a reduced radio
649800	652560	wave intensity at the receiver.
652560	661520	So this is the basic design of a continuous wave NMR spectrometer.
661520	666800	So if you've been following so far, you probably have at least one very important question.
666800	672280	If all protons have exactly the same gyromagnetic ratio, and the field in the NMR experiment
672280	677320	is perfectly uniform, how is it that this technology is good for anything other than
677320	680400	simply detecting the presence of protons?
680400	686960	How can it possibly distinguish one proton on a molecule from another?
686960	690800	The answer to this very important question lies in a different term in the Zeeman splitting
690800	691800	equation.
691800	697680	It's not the gyromagnetic ratio which differs from one proton to the next, but rather the
697680	704560	exact strength of the external field at a given nucleus.
704560	709880	You see, we started with the very unrealistic example of a collection of isolated protons
709880	714700	with no other atoms or even electrons present in the system.
714700	718320	The obvious difference between this model system and the ones which a chemist might
718320	723760	want to study is that there are electron clouds and atoms of other kinds bonded to the protons
723760	726880	that we want to analyze.
726880	733280	And the real key to understanding how NMR gives us information lies in another phenomenon,
733280	735920	like shielding by electrons.
735920	740560	You see, I told a little white lie back there, at least a lie of omission.
740560	744840	I already told you the Zeeman splitting is a function of gyromagnetic ratio and the external
744840	750360	field strength, but what I left out was the fact that electron clouds have this interesting
750360	757200	ability to attenuate or weaken the external field ever so slightly.
757200	761800	Now we can think of this as a new term in the Zeeman equation in which I account for
761800	767440	a small reduction in field strength due to the shielding of the electron cloud at that
767440	771520	particular nucleus.
771520	774680	Let's take a look at some examples to see if we can drive this point home.
774680	780400	We're going to look at some hypothetical NMR spectra for four different compounds,
780400	785240	methane, chloromethane, dichloromethane, and chloroform.
785240	790000	So essentially what I've done here is started from methane and then slowly added one chlorine
790000	793840	atom at a time to pick it here in green until I reach the point where I have three chlorines
793840	795960	attached.
795960	800600	So let's start by thinking about methane and its electron cloud.
800600	805160	Now the electron cloud in a methane molecule is very symmetrical, isn't it?
805160	807880	There are no particularly electronegative elements.
807880	811160	The carbon-hydrogen bonds are essentially nonpolar.
811160	815320	And so there really is no distortion in this electron cloud.
815320	819800	That means that if I plot its absorption versus the applied field strength in a continuous
819800	826800	wave NMR spectrometer, I expect that it will take a fairly high field to overcome the shielding
826800	831520	that these protons are experiencing.
831520	835280	But if I move along to say chloromethane, where I've replaced one of those hydrogens
835280	840560	with a more electronegative chlorine atom, there's now a dipole within this molecule
840560	847400	and it's pulling electrons toward the chlorine and therefore away from the remaining hydrogens.
847400	852240	So its electron cloud may look more like this with a bit of a distortion because that chlorine
852240	855320	is pulling some of it more towards itself.
855320	861120	So with reduced shielding, I expect that I need a lower applied field strength to create
861120	865160	resonance and indeed that's what I see.
865160	870440	And this trend continues through dichloromethane which has two dipoles and therefore an electron
870440	875800	cloud which is even more deshielded at those protons.
875800	880640	And of course its NMR spectrum would reflect that in an even weaker applied field necessary
880640	882280	for resonance.
882280	887080	And finally chloroform where I have three of these dipoles has got a very, very deshielded
887080	892440	proton which will resonate at an even lower applied field.
892440	898320	Because of this, lower applied fields causing resonances at the, down here at the left-hand
898320	903440	side of the spectrum, we refer to this side of the spectrum as downfield, whereas we refer
903480	908120	to the higher field portion of the spectrum sometimes as upfield.
908120	913960	So a more shielded hydrogen like those in methane resonates upfield, a more deshielded
913960	918720	hydrogen like those in chloroform will resonate downfield.
918720	923800	So the density of the electron cloud at a particular nucleus can cause its peak to shift
923800	926160	within the NMR spectrum.
926160	931080	So we call this phenomenon chemical shift.
931080	935240	So we've established that protons in different chemical environments will resonate at distinct
935240	939880	applied fields because of the effects like shielding.
939880	944080	But what happens when a researcher in a lab across the country or across the globe tries
944080	946800	to reproduce my experiment?
946800	951400	What happens if his or her spectrometer produces a field strength or radio wave frequency different
951400	954320	than mine?
954320	959080	Well of course all shifts of all the protons will be different making comparisons somewhat
959080	960680	difficult.
960680	964880	So we need a method of reporting data which can be easily translated from one spectrometer
964880	966620	to the next.
966620	974120	We need to normalize the resonance frequencies to account for different applied field strengths.
974120	978040	We start this process by agreeing to a reference standard.
978040	984080	In the case of proton NMR, we use a compound called tetramethylsilane.
984080	989160	We use this compound because the very low electronegativity of silicon pushes electrons
989160	993680	toward the methyl groups producing a strong consistent resonance frequency which is so
993680	999680	far up field that it rarely interferes with the signals of interest.
999680	1004120	So the differences in field needed to produce resonance in the protons of most organic molecules
1004120	1008980	is just a small fraction of 1% of the total field strength.
1008980	1013720	So to make the numbers more manageable, we report chemical shift in parts per million
1013720	1022120	from the absolute resonance frequency of that reference compound, TMS or tetramethylsilane.
1022120	1028960	So a proton resonating in a field which is 99.9999% of the strength needed to bring TMS
1028960	1034760	into resonance is said to be resonating at 1.0 ppm chemical shift.
1034760	1041960	A proton at 99.9998% of the field strength of TMS would be at 2.0 ppm chemical shift
1041960	1046480	and so on.
1046480	1050720	Treating the x-axis of my spectrum in this way not only gives me easier numbers to work
1050720	1055480	with but allows me to compare data collected on one instrument with data collected on another
1055480	1059680	instrument even if it uses a different magnetic field strength.
1059680	1066700	So parts per million has become the standard unit for NMR spectroscopy.
1066700	1072500	So we've considered the behavior of a hypothetical collection of protons in a magnetic field.
1072500	1077560	We then graduated to real, albeit very simple, organic compounds like methane and its halogenated
1077560	1083200	derivatives, all of which have only one type of proton in them.
1083200	1087580	But what happens when a compound has more than one kind of proton?
1087580	1093180	How would we expect a continuous wave NMR spectrum to look for a compound like that?
1093180	1095920	Let's answer that question with an example.
1095920	1101380	Let's take a look at ethyl chloride or chloroethane.
1101380	1106780	Now chloroethane has two chemically distinct protons.
1106780	1110700	These I've highlighted in red are adjacent to the chlorine atom and of course there are
1110700	1113940	three others that are farther away.
1113940	1118540	Now if I locate the resonance frequency for these two protons, I notice something very
1118540	1120620	interesting has taken place.
1120620	1122940	It's not a single peak.
1122940	1127960	Even though these are identical and should produce a single absorption, I actually see
1127960	1132480	a peak which has four distinct lobes.
1132480	1139120	Now the origin of these lobes is the interaction of these two protons with their neighbors.
1139120	1144120	See every proton, remember, is a small bar magnet and that means that whether they're
1144120	1150480	aligned parallel to or anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field will cause them to interact
1150480	1153740	differently with the adjacent protons.
1153740	1158620	So if I consider the effect of these protons, which I've highlighted in blue, they can interact
1158620	1165140	with the hydrogens of interest by being all spin up, there are actually three different
1165140	1174140	ways that I can combine them with two spins up and one spin down and of course there will
1174140	1182920	also be three potential ways to combine them with two spins down and one spin up.
1182920	1188640	And the final permutation that's possible with three is to have all spin down.
1188640	1192800	So in the case where all of the neighbors are spin up, they add just a little bit of
1192800	1198000	magnetic field to what's experienced by those causing the signal and that means it requires
1198000	1203720	just a little bit less of an applied magnetic field to cause resonance.
1203720	1209300	That's why what should be, in theory, a single signal is actually split into four.
1209300	1212500	So these are the source of that multiplicity.
1212500	1217980	Similarly, I can look at the resonance frequency of these three hydrogens and say they must
1217980	1222740	be coupled to or interacting with my red hydrogens.
1222740	1228420	Now with two hydrogens interacting, I have the possibility of having them both spin up,
1228420	1234760	two possibilities in which I have one up, one down, and my final possibility in which
1234760	1238240	they're both spin down.
1238240	1244000	So in this case, my blue hydrogens should create a resonance with three lobes.
1244000	1249520	So we refer to this phenomenon as magnetic coupling and the resulting shape of the peaks
1249520	1253020	as multiplets.
1253020	1259080	They follow a rule known as the n plus one rule which simply states that we have n plus
1259080	1264040	one lobes per multiplet where n is the number of coupled hydrogens.
1264040	1269800	So my red hydrogens are coupled to three neighbors creating a peak with four lobes.
1269800	1275140	My blue hydrogens are coupled to two neighbors creating a peak with three lobes.
1275140	1280080	In most simple situations where we're dealing with saturated compounds with free rotation,
1280100	1285540	this rule holds pretty well.
1285540	1289180	So let's take a look at some multiplet features that we may see in an MR specter as we go
1289180	1290180	forward.
1290180	1294660	Of course the simplest where n equals one we call a doublet.
1294660	1298980	When there are two coupled partners, we get what we call a triplet.
1298980	1303900	Three produces a quartet and so on with four making a quintet and five making a sextet
1303900	1304900	and so on.
1304900	1309580	Now in many cases they become so complex around this point that we stop referring to them
1309580	1315240	by their individual names and simply refer to them collectively as multiplets.
1315240	1319040	Now the intensity of the lobes within the multiplet is also useful information.
1319040	1322440	So we'd like to be able to predict that as well and we can.
1322440	1327440	For example a doublet is always one to one whereas a triplet is one to two to one and
1327440	1331680	a quartet one to three to three to one and the pattern continues, remember this is because
1331680	1338080	of all the different permutations of alpha and beta spin states for the coupling partners.
1338080	1342100	Now what's really great is if you forget this pattern you can easily recreate it using a
1342100	1345060	geometric mnemonic.
1345060	1348300	That geometric mnemonic is known as Pascal's Triangle.
1348300	1353620	So we can simply create a series in which we add adjacent numbers as we go down so one
1353620	1358540	plus two equals three, for example here three plus three equals six, etc.
1358540	1362600	And Pascal's Triangle allows us to predict the multiplicity in any instance where we have
1362600	1367720	multiple coupling partners in simple situations like these.
1367720	1373740	So we're now ready to get just a small taste of the power NMR has to reveal structural
1373740	1374740	information.
1374740	1380620	We're going to begin with a very simple example but one which clearly shows how we can gather
1380620	1387620	structural information which would not be available to us from the UV-Vis, IR or polarimetry
1387620	1389780	experiments that we have covered so far.
1389780	1394740	We're going to do it using a relatively simple molecule or set of molecules and that is the
1394760	1398080	structural isomers of chloropropane.
1398080	1406280	So let's construct some hypothetical NMR spectra for the two different isomers of chloropropane.
1406280	1408200	We'll start with two chloropropane.
1408200	1414080	So here I have my chlorine attached at the central atom and because of this I'm going
1414080	1417880	to have a spectrum which has two different resonances.
1417880	1422120	Now it's worth mentioning here I've exaggerated the multiplicities a little bit, I've spaced
1422120	1425340	them out a little bit wider than you might see them in an actual spectrum so that they're
1425340	1431140	easy for us to see but their position within the spectrum is accurate.
1431140	1436260	So we see that there are two different kinds of protons in this two chloropropane.
1436260	1441740	First there are the six methyl protons which are all exactly the same as one another.
1441740	1446060	Now because they're chemically identical to one another they don't couple to each other
1446060	1452060	but they do have one coupling partner in this proton right here in the center of the molecule.
1453000	1459400	And it has its own resonance which is split by its six non-equivalent neighbors.
1459400	1464640	So just as we would expect from our previous discussions on multiplicity we have a very
1464640	1470600	large doublet which corresponds to these six hydrogens highlighted in blue and a relatively
1470600	1477320	small multiplet produced by this single hydrogen which is split by many coupling partners.
1477320	1481960	Now if we take a closer look we can see the multiplicity is exactly as we would predict
1481980	1490100	using Pascal's Triangle and that this is actually a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and plus 1 right this is
1490100	1491660	a septet.
1491660	1498340	So our septet at 3.7 parts per million tells us we have a proton with many coupling partners
1498340	1504740	very close to an electron withdrawing group and our doublet at 1.1 parts per million tells
1504740	1509940	us that we have some protons which have a single coupling partner and that those protons
1509940	1516520	are farther away from the electron withdrawing group because they resonate upfield.
1516520	1521780	So how can we use this spectrum in comparison to say one chloropropane and distinguish between
1521780	1524540	these two compounds?
1524540	1527980	Let's take a look at one chloropropane right now.
1527980	1532300	So when I put my chlorine at the end of the molecule rather than in the center it has
1532300	1538260	very important and profound effect on the number of resonances that I see.
1538260	1541380	My spectrum is a little bit more complicated now isn't it?
1541380	1545600	That's because by placing the chlorine at the end I've created three distinct chemical
1545600	1548480	environments for the protons in the molecule.
1548480	1552900	Those that are directly on the carbon bearing the chlorine, those one bond away and those
1552900	1555100	that are two bonds away.
1555100	1560760	So I expect to see three distinct resonances which I do but not only that their multiplicities
1560760	1564240	are different than those in my previous example.
1564240	1571000	So in this case I have a triplet that is way upfield which tells me I've got some hydrogens
1571000	1577340	that are very far away from any electron withdrawing groups and have two non-equivalent neighbors
1577340	1580960	to which they are magnetically coupled.
1580960	1585560	I also have a little bit more complicated multiplet here.
1585560	1591920	This one would be called a sexted and that tells me that I've got some protons which
1591920	1598800	are a little bit closer to the electron withdrawing group and are coupled to five distinct partners.
1598800	1603160	One, two, three, four, five.
1603160	1608760	Finally I have another triplet which is farther downfield telling me that I must have some
1608760	1612640	protons that are very close to the electron withdrawing chlorine and are coupled to two
1612640	1617880	partners which is a perfect description of these two protons highlighted in red coupled
1617880	1622120	to their neighbors in blue.
1622120	1628880	So this spectrum having a triplet at .8, a sexted at 1.6 and another triplet at 3.3 allows
1628880	1635640	me to very clearly and unambiguously assign that it's one chloropropane.
1635640	1639600	So let's review the material from this lecture.
1639600	1646080	We started by considering a property of atomic nuclei known as spin and how certain isotopes
1646080	1651280	of certain atoms have a spin of one half, giving them two possible spin states when
1651280	1654160	an external magnetic field is applied.
1654160	1659280	There's the low energy parallel state called alpha and the high energy anti-parallel state
1659280	1663040	called beta.
1663040	1668000	We discussed how the energy difference between these states known as the Zeeman splitting
1668000	1673360	corresponds to the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum and is proportional
1673360	1679920	to the strength of the magnetic field with which the nuclei are aligning themselves.
1679920	1684680	We took a look at the design of early spectrometers in which a continuous radio frequency wave
1684680	1689620	is shined on a sample as the strength of an applied field is varied until resonance is
1689620	1695240	achieved resulting in an absorption of the radio wave.
1695240	1699800	We then looked at how the shielding and induced fields provided by electrons can cause the
1699800	1704800	magnetic field at protons within a molecule to be slightly different, leading us to the
1704800	1707960	calculations of chemical shift.
1707960	1714460	Finally, we discussed the phenomenon of magnetic spin-spin coupling in which non-equivalent
1714460	1719600	nuclei which are three bonds away from one another can share magnetization splitting
1719600	1726000	resonances into a set of lobes called a multiplet.
1726000	1730220	Next time, we'll take our discussion into the new millennium and look at what is known
1730220	1733160	as pulsed or Fourier transform NMR.
1733160	1738240	We'll also take a brief look at a few other techniques used to characterize molecules,
1738240	1742320	specifically x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry.
1742320	1743960	I'll see you for that discussion next time.
