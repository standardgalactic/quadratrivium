0	18440	So, we've seen how Friedrich Voller's synthesis of urea, from non-biological starting materials
18440	25600	in 1828, toppled the long-standing dogma known as vitalism, which stated that only organisms
25600	28400	could produce the molecules of life.
29360	35240	Now, as the 1800s pressed on, other notable chemists advanced this idea by putting it
35240	36920	into practice.
36920	42560	Justice von Liebig demonstrated the role of abiological nitrogen in plant fertilization,
42560	47920	and he also extracted and manipulated carbohydrates under controlled laboratory conditions.
47920	53480	Miescher had isolated DNA from the nuclei of cells, and as a century drew to a close,
53480	59080	Alexander Butlerov and Hermann Emile Fischer both managed to synthesize carbohydrates and
59080	63520	other biologically relevant compounds in their laboratories, also without the help of living
63520	65020	organisms.
66360	71800	So, by the end of the 1800s, organic chemists were beginning to get a hold on exactly how
71800	79200	to produce, characterize, and even manipulate the chemicals of life abiologically.
79200	84200	One could argue that today we have successfully, if not yet completely, dissected life all
84200	87520	the way down to the molecular level.
87520	92560	We can take molecules out of living systems and use them in vitro.
92560	98680	We can synthesize compounds like carbohydrates, RNA, and DNA in labs, and insert them back
98680	104120	into living systems to show that they function exactly as one would predict for their biologically
104120	108120	synthesized equivalents.
108120	113960	But there remains one great burning question, which is unanswered to this day.
113960	119160	If all of these molecules of life are truly devoid of any vital essence, shouldn't we
119160	125720	be able to use those synthetic compounds not just to sustain or manipulate existing life,
125720	128360	but to create life itself?
128360	134760	Now, life on Earth must have originated by some accidental, abiological synthesis of
134760	138480	some of the compounds necessary to achieve life.
138480	142920	But what were those compounds, and how did they come to be with no living organism or
142920	147520	human scientist around to create them?
147520	151680	It's an intriguing question, and one which is difficult to answer considering that it
151680	158320	took place at least 2.7 billion years ago, and nobody was around to see it happen.
158320	164280	Was it DNA, RNA, maybe carbohydrates, or amino acids?
164280	169360	And whatever these seminal biomolecules were, how did they come together in a way which
169360	175840	allowed them to cross that critical barrier of simply existing to self-replication, allowing
175840	183440	them to reproduce, grow, and eventually evolve?
183440	188480	So scientists started on a new quest, not one to learn how biomolecules function, per
188480	193560	say, but rather how they came to be in the first place.
193560	199320	And two of these researchers were Harold Urie and Stanley Miller.
199320	202080	Miller was a student of Urie in the 1950s.
202080	207440	Now, already a Nobel laureate at the time, Urie had developed an interest in the origin
207440	212760	of life and had asked if it were possible for simple, vital organic compounds to form
212760	220160	under the reducing, stormy conditions of the Earth's early atmosphere.
220160	225440	Miller had just arrived at the University of Chicago as a graduate student and was slated
225440	229440	to work on a project aimed at understanding the synthesis of elements in the furnaces
229440	231800	of stars.
231800	236400	But Miller found himself inspired by Urie's interest in the origin of life and asked for
236400	239240	permission to try a different experiment.
239240	245160	Come to imitate the conditions of the primordial Earth and probe the resulting material for
245160	250160	signs of biologically relevant molecules.
250160	254880	Urie agreed, and Miller went straight to work, designing a system which simulated the early
254880	259480	Earth's atmosphere and closed conditions on a lab bench.
259480	264520	The conditions on the Earth some three billion years ago were very different from those today.
264520	270840	Balkanism was rampant, oxygen was scarce, and electrical storms were commonplace.
270840	277320	So to model this, Miller devised an apparatus which enclosed water, methane, ammonia and
277320	281040	hydrogen in a sealed vessel.
281040	285720	Now he allowed an electrical current to arc through that mixture for an extended period
285720	291280	of time as the water was boiled.
291280	296120	After running his apparatus for a week, Miller tapped the circulating solution and analyzed
296120	297120	it.
297120	303360	And sure enough, when he did, he found evidence of several amino acids.
303360	308960	Now Miller published the results in the prestigious journal Science in 1953 under the title, A
308960	314200	Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions.
314200	320160	And remarkably, the paper is published citing Miller as the lone author.
320160	325000	This was done at Urie's insistence lest he received the credit for Miller's ingenious
325000	329000	experiment.
329000	334160	So perhaps it was amino acids which were the very first biological molecules to participate
334160	336520	in life on Earth.
336520	341200	But if they were, these are some pretty small molecules, and life would need something larger,
341200	346240	more complex, to really generate diversity and get a foothold.
346240	351060	But amino acids are able to create these kinds of molecules by joining together into long
351060	358600	strands through a special linkage known as an amide bond.
358600	361560	During this lecture, we're going to talk about a class of materials which not only
361560	368000	make up 20% of the mass of your body, but which find use in medicine, materials, detergents
368000	370600	and many other functions.
370600	375480	Today we're going to talk about proteins, usually associated with skin, hair and muscle
375480	376880	fibers.
376880	379480	Proteins are really much more than that.
379480	383760	They also make up a class of catalysts which mediate every chemical reaction that your
383760	386220	body carries out.
386220	392080	But before we can develop an appreciation for these large, complex kings of catalysis,
392080	398140	we have to review their building blocks, amino acids.
398140	402800	Amino acids are so named because this class of compound always has two distinct functional
402800	403800	groups.
403800	410200	Amine and an organic acid, joined together by one or more carbons.
410200	415360	The simplest possible example is an amino acid in which the amine and acid groups are
415360	420400	joined by a single CH2 group, also called a methylene group.
420400	427920	When only one carbon separates the functional groups, we call these alpha amino acids.
427920	432360	You can imagine that extending the chain by one more methylene creates a beta amino acid
432360	436520	and yet another insertion creates a gamma amino acid and so on.
436520	441600	Of course, I've drawn these compounds as completely neutral species, but each contains
441600	447840	a carboxylic acid with a pKa of about 5 and an amine whose conjugate base has a pKa of
447840	450920	about 11.
450920	455800	So a more proper way to draw these compounds might be like this, with an intramolecular
455800	460680	proton transfer reaction creating two regions of charge.
460680	465200	We call these species zwitterions.
465200	469320	The charged regions of these species don't interact favorably with most low polarity
469320	474620	organic solvents, so they can make dissolution in organic solvents a painful process for
474620	475620	amino acids.
475620	480160	It's a good thing that you're made mostly of the very polar solvent water, so they
480160	484320	dissolve in you quite readily.
484320	490000	Although there are many other ways to connect an amine group and a carboxylic acid, in today's
490000	495560	lecture we will keep our attention squarely focused on alpha amino acids, because this
495560	501480	class of amino acids was chosen by nature as the basis for proteins, a very special
501480	507040	set of compounds which carry out the chemistry of life.
507040	511120	So getting back to our simple alpha amino acid.
511120	516680	We commonly call this little guy glycine, it's one of the first amino acids detected
516680	519360	by Stanley Miller.
519360	523560	Now notice that glycine has two hydrogens on the alpha carbon.
523560	530520	It's this position which is modified to create a short library of 20 alpha amino acid compounds
530520	535000	which are used to produce nearly all of the proteins and enzymes that drive the chemistry
535000	537480	of life.
537480	541880	When something other than a hydrogen is present in one of those two positions, we refer to
541880	548240	the group replacing that hydrogen as a side chain.
548240	554320	Now there is really no side, front, back, top or bottom to a molecule of course, but
554320	558720	when we align various amino acids for the purpose of comparison, we usually line the
558720	564400	amino acid portions of the molecules up and treat the side chain as a motif branching off
564400	567920	in the same direction, hence the name.
567920	573120	Even so, we know that these bonds can twist and rotate and do not necessarily exist locked
573120	577160	in the configurations that I'm going to show you.
577160	579560	Side chains can be broken down into several classes.
579560	583400	Okay, let's take a look at a few of these amino acids now.
583400	587040	We've already discussed a little bit about the simplest of all amino acids, which would
587040	589040	be glycine.
589040	594240	Glycine is unusual among the amino acids because it has two of the same groups attached to
594240	597240	its central carbon or its alpha carbon.
597240	604040	So in this case, glycine is unusual because it's really unmodified, but as we begin modifying
604040	607240	one of those groups, we start to create our library.
607240	611840	Adding a methyl group creates alanine, another one of the amino acids, which was detected
611840	614080	by Stanley Miller.
614080	621080	If I continue to increase the complexity of that side chain, I can create valine, leucine
621080	623040	and isoleucine.
623040	630240	As you can see here, I've highlighted all of their side chains by sort of a grayish glow.
630240	634680	The reason I've grouped these five together is that their side chains are hydrophobic.
634680	639360	In other words, they're all made strictly of carbon and hydrogen, and so they behave as
639360	643720	though they were very low polarity arms on the molecule.
643720	645760	But that's only true for these five.
645760	650200	Let's take a look at some others.
650200	656640	Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are acidic side chains, meaning that in most physiological
656640	661920	environments, you actually see them as their conjugate bases, so they have a tendency to
661920	664600	carry negative charges.
664600	671200	Asparagine and glutamine are two amino acids which have amide functional groups at the
671200	677000	ends of their chains, so these are specialists at hydrogen bonding to other side chains and
677000	680880	other molecules.
680880	688800	The amino acids lysine, histidine and arginine all contain slightly basic amine groups, or
688800	691840	in this case, histidine has a cyclic side chain.
691840	697200	Nonetheless, it has a nitrogen which is basic, and so all three of these can become fairly
697200	701520	easily protonated and therefore carry a positive charge.
701520	707840	So these are the basic side chains of the amino acid library.
707840	716360	Moving on, we have serine, threonine, cysteine and methionine, all of which contain either
716360	723700	an OH, an SH group known as a thiol, or a group known as a thioether, where the sulfur is
723700	727160	contained in between two carbons.
727160	731960	The reason I placed all of these together is that they all contain fairly good nucleophiles.
731960	738120	So these four are particularly good at creating covalent bonds between other molecules and
738120	742760	their own side chains.
742760	749720	Moving on, we have aromatic side chains as well, in the form of phenylalanine, tyrosine
749720	752400	and tryptophen.
752400	759000	All of these amino acids contain large conjugated or more accurately aromatic pi systems, which
759000	763200	can be used to create all sorts of different interactions that you wouldn't get otherwise
763200	770060	using, say, hydrophobics or any other amino acid for that matter.
770060	775320	And finally, we have proline, which stands alone among amino acids because of a very
775320	777440	special feature.
777440	784200	Proline's side chain actually wraps around and bonds back to the nitrogen of the amino
784200	785640	acid.
785640	790640	So proline is unusual in the sense that its side chain is locked in a cyclic conformation
790640	796260	rather than being free to move attached to an sp3 carbon.
796260	801200	So proline is going to have some very special roles in biochemistry.
801200	804400	But we're still not done characterizing these amino acids.
804400	811360	Now you probably noticed that all but glycine contained a chiral center at the alpha carbon,
811360	816520	meaning that there are two possible enantiomers of each compound.
816520	822400	Now what's remarkable is that all 19 amino acids with a chiral alpha carbon take on the
822400	826480	same stereochemistry in living systems.
826480	833080	So only one enantiomer of each amino acid is useful biologically.
833080	835280	The reason for this is twofold.
835280	841320	First, chiral RNA is responsible for sequestering and using these amino acids to build proteins.
841320	848360	So, only one handed form interacts properly with the ribosomal RNA.
848360	852880	The other reason is that many amino acids are manufactured from one another in the body.
852880	859560	In fact, only 8 of the 20 that I just showed you are absolutely essential in your diet.
859560	864320	All the others can be made in your body from other starting materials, sometimes by chemically
864320	870880	modifying some of the eight essential amino acids.
870880	874560	So why was Miller's discovery so sensational?
874560	881240	What is it about amino acids which make their presence in his primordial concoction so newsworthy?
881240	887120	Well, now that we have a firm grasp on the structure of amino acids, let's consider
887120	892760	what happens when we start putting them together via a series of condensation reactions which
892760	896040	form chains of amide bonds.
896040	902480	We call these polyamides peptides or proteins, and the distinction between the two is one
902480	907960	of size, with the former generally referring to polymers of less than a hundred condensed
907960	913720	amino acids and the latter encompassing larger molecules.
913720	917160	So let's begin with just glycine.
917160	923320	If I could condense two glycine amino acids together in an end-to-end relationship, I
923320	928400	would find that I have created a very short chain, consisting of two glycines, minus a
928400	931520	water molecule of course.
931520	936600	Now I can continue the process condensing another to make a triglycine, then another,
936600	939920	and so on for as long as I like.
939920	945480	The result will be a chain of glycine residues, and we call them residues instead of amino
945480	952400	acids since they've lost one equivalent of water when they are placed into the chain.
952400	956640	Polymers like to arrange their polyamides so that the nitrogen-containing terminus is
956640	961160	at the left, and the sequence can be read like a sentence from left to right, from end
961160	964000	terminus to C terminus.
964000	969680	Now our polyglycine peptide is pretty boring as peptides go, but remember that nature has
969680	977440	provided us with 19 more options for each position in that peptide.
977440	982280	It's this variety which leads to the stunning complexity in the possible number of sequences
982280	984880	for peptides.
984880	991680	Let's consider a protein of 100 residues, fairly short by biological standards.
991680	999980	This sequence has 100 positions, with 20 possibilities in each position, for 20 to the 100th power
999980	1002600	number of possibilities.
1002600	1008840	That's roughly 10 to the 130th power, far more possibilities than there are atoms in
1008840	1011280	the known universe.
1011280	1017320	So clearly, variety is not a problem when it comes to proteins and peptides.
1017320	1026400	Now we call each unique sequence of condensed amino acids a primary structure, but the rabbit
1026400	1030080	hole goes much, much deeper than that.
1030080	1035440	You see, when amino acids condense to form an amide bond, the amine nitrogen from one
1035440	1041240	residue and the carbonyl from the preceding residue participate in a resonance which locks
1041240	1047400	a plane defined by the N, H, C, and O of the amide bond.
1047400	1053360	We call this small collection of atoms the amide plane.
1053360	1058760	But that leaves the alpha-carbon bonds free to rotate, and this gives proteins a tendency
1058760	1065080	to twist and collapse on themselves in very specific arrangements which maximize intramolecular
1065080	1071640	attractions created by backbone atoms and those side chains as well.
1071640	1075480	We call this process protein folding.
1075480	1080320	Now not only do alpha-carbon backbone bonds and side chain bonds rotate, but they tend
1080320	1087800	to do so in ways which form just a few specific geometries called secondary structures.
1087800	1094560	These structures include many different versions of essentially three basic motifs, helices,
1094560	1097680	strands, and turns.
1097680	1107800	So let's take a look at the most common versions of each of these now.
1107800	1111680	Let's start with a short polyalanine molecule.
1111680	1117840	Now polyalanine tends to form a secondary structure known as an alpha helix.
1117840	1124360	Now in this example I've created an idealized helix which is perfect in all angles and interactions.
1125360	1133000	The alpha helix is characterized by a helical pitch of 3.6 residues, meaning that one full
1133000	1138640	turn is completed for every 3.6 residues I move along the chain.
1138640	1144120	What this pitch accomplishes is to bring the amide NH of one residue into proper alignment
1144120	1149360	to hydrogen bond with the carbonyl four residues down the chain.
1149360	1154000	We can see the alpha helices in the structure of myoglobin for example.
1154000	1160000	If we include all of the atoms in a molecule of myoglobin, it's very difficult to see.
1160000	1164520	But if instead we remove the side chains while leaving their effects on the structure in
1164520	1170960	place, we can begin to see repeating turns of quite a few helices in the protein.
1170960	1175320	But biochemists like to make things even prettier than organic chemists, so they like to show
1175320	1180320	colorful 3D ribbons to map out the backbone of a peptide or protein, making it look more
1180320	1182000	like this.
1182000	1189280	Now the secondary structural elements of this protein are unmistakable and they're beautiful.
1189280	1195880	Another common structure is the beta strand in which a peptide chain is fully extended.
1195880	1199960	Now causing a chain to take on an extended geometry like this might seem a bit implausible
1199960	1205480	at first because the driving force for the substructure only becomes clear when we align
1205480	1209600	two or more of them anti-parallel to one another.
1209720	1216360	This creates a network of NH to carbonyl hydrogen bonds in between two strands and the resulting
1216360	1220000	network is referred to as a beta sheet.
1220000	1224760	And this appears in many well characterized proteins as well.
1224760	1230080	A third type of motif, and incidentally one which is all but essential to make a beta sheet,
1230080	1232080	is the turn.
1232080	1237400	There are many potential angles which can accomplish turns in proteins and certain amino acid residues
1237400	1240520	seem better suited to inducing them.
1240520	1245920	Among others, glycine and proline are very common turn residues, but for very different
1245920	1247680	reasons.
1247680	1252120	Glycine because the lack of a side chain allows it a greater range of angles.
1252120	1258760	And proline because the cyclic nature of its chain restricts it to just a few angles which
1258760	1260560	are consistent with turns.
1260560	1267360	So it has the tendency to disrupt other patterns in chains and sheets allowing turns to begin.
1268320	1272360	But the structural complexity doesn't even end there.
1272360	1278000	Notice that each element of secondary structure in our protein packs against other secondary
1278000	1280080	structures in that protein.
1280080	1284720	And the interactions between the faces of these two structural elements is a stabilizing
1284720	1290360	factor as well and brings different portions of the sequence into proper proximity and
1290360	1294320	orientation for proper function.
1294320	1298600	We call the arrangement of secondary structural elements in space relative to one another
1298600	1301600	a protein's tertiary structure.
1301600	1307960	Now additionally, entire proteins can act as subunits of a single large complex such
1307960	1314720	as this, a voltage gated potassium ion channel characterized by Rod McKinnon in 1998.
1314720	1319200	This conduit is designed to span the cell membrane and create a channel through which
1319200	1324640	ions can flow, but it only functions when all four of its subunits are mated together
1324640	1331520	creating a superstructure which forms a tunnel traversing the membrane of the cell.
1331520	1337200	And this tunnel is lined with oxygen atoms of MI bonds from the protein's backbone.
1337200	1342120	This creates a negatively charged conduit which is exactly the width of a potassium
1342120	1343120	ion.
1343120	1349920	And these very specific primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures combine
1349920	1359000	to form a molecular device with powerful selectivity for potassium ion transport.
1359000	1364880	So all of these higher order elements of structure, quaternary, tertiary and secondary, are in
1364880	1371600	theory dictated simply by the sequence or the primary structure of a protein.
1371600	1376880	If we simply construct an unfolded protein for nearly any naturally occurring enzyme,
1376880	1382920	we often find that protein will most likely fold right back into its functional form,
1382920	1388000	usually with startling speed.
1388000	1392640	In rare instances however, the functional form of the protein is actually not the most
1392640	1395200	stable fold.
1395200	1399040	Proteins can become misfolded and trapped in an arrangement which will not allow them
1399040	1402120	to fold properly.
1402120	1407320	Now ordinarily it wouldn't be too alarming if a single protein in your body were to misfold.
1407320	1413320	After all, you have millions and millions more to help get the job done.
1413320	1418800	But it does get disconcerting when one misfolded protein encourages the misfolding of others,
1418800	1424640	producing plaques of proteins which potentially can have devastating health effects.
1424640	1430160	And this situation most notably happens when amyloid plaque builds in the brain of an Alzheimer's
1430160	1433320	disease victim.
1433320	1441560	Ok, so we clearly can benefit from understanding how protein sequence affects protein folding.
1441560	1446880	The next order of business is to figure out how to make samples for study.
1446880	1452080	Of course, biologically synthesized proteins can be produced using complex RNA machinery
1452080	1457840	within cells, but what do chemists do when they want to make highly purified peptides
1457840	1463120	and proteins in the laboratory for study?
1463120	1468040	Several techniques are available, including the use of special strains of E. coli bacteria
1468040	1473920	as manufacturing plants for proteins, as we saw in the manufacture of human insulin.
1473920	1478680	We saw in our DNA lecture how that genome of that very special, already genetically
1478680	1483800	modified E. coli was altered to encourage the bacteria to produce massive quantities
1483800	1488880	of that one desired protein.
1488880	1493400	Now this technique is startlingly effective when large proteins containing naturally
1493400	1496440	occurring amino acids are the target.
1496440	1501080	But this isn't a microbiology course, it's a chemistry course.
1501080	1506200	So there's a method for synthesizing even peptides and proteins with exotic side chains
1506200	1511320	and very interesting organic chemistry, absolutely.
1511320	1516680	And its developer, Bruce Merrifield, won the 1984 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his development
1516680	1525600	called Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, sometimes also called the Merrifield Synthesis.
1525600	1530800	Merrifield's technique starts with an insoluble polymer resin, to which is attached a single
1530800	1533000	amino acid.
1533000	1537360	The connection to the resin is made through the C-terminus and the N-terminus is available
1537360	1539880	for reaction.
1539880	1545000	Now Merrifield then turned to a classic technique for making amide bonds, called an active ester
1545000	1547080	coupling.
1547080	1553040	By mixing amino acids with a special reagent, which turns them into very electrophilic esters,
1553040	1558320	the exposed amine of the growing chain can be enticed to attack the carbonyl of an amino
1558320	1562440	acid in solution.
1562440	1566560	Of course, this is a problem when the amino acids in solution have amine groups of their
1566560	1568160	own.
1568160	1573320	If unchecked, the growing peptides will extend in an uncontrolled fashion.
1573320	1578320	So Merrifield applied a special protecting group to the N-terminus of the amino acids
1578320	1581920	prior to reacting them with the growing peptide on the resin.
1581920	1589880	Now Merrifield used a group called a T-butoxy carbonyl motif.
1589880	1595360	When attached to an amide, this N-terminal protecting group prevents more than one amino
1595360	1602200	acid from attaching to any given growing peptide in a single reaction step.
1602200	1606760	The excess reagent could then be washed away from the resin, and the N-terminal protecting
1606760	1613440	groups removed from the on-resin peptide before introducing the next coupling reagent.
1613440	1618520	In this way, Merrifield was able to produce peptides in sufficient yield and purity to
1618520	1623680	be used in lab experimentation.
1623680	1626080	So let's review what we've covered.
1626080	1631600	We've discussed amino acids, most extensively alpha amino acids.
1631600	1636040	We looked at the structural features which define them, and we identified the side chains
1636040	1642000	of the 20 amino acids which are necessary to maintain life.
1642000	1647080	We talked about the Miller experiment, and how it can be used to create amino acids,
1647080	1654480	a biologically, though at best it can produce racemic mixtures or achiral amino acids.
1654480	1659200	We also covered how amino acids can be condensed together into chains of varying length joined
1659200	1661360	by amide bonds.
1661360	1666840	We defined the amide plane and the backbone dihedral angles, phi and psi, associated with
1666840	1672440	rotation of the carbon-carbon bond at the alpha carbon.
1672440	1677000	We looked at how different phi and psi angles produce backbones leading to different secondary
1677000	1678000	structures.
1678000	1684000	Specifically, we looked at alpha helices and beta sheets and the network of hydrogen bonds
1684000	1686200	which hold them together.
1686200	1690480	We also talked about turns and how proline and glycine tend to concentrate themselves
1690480	1693280	in those areas.
1693280	1697600	We talked about tertiary and quaternary structures in proteins as well, and we looked at very
1697600	1703320	large complexes consisting of multiple protein subunits, like the one characterized by Rod
1703320	1705320	McKinnon.
1706320	1711640	Finally, we addressed the issue of creating proteins in the lab, so that we can continue
1711640	1716000	to study the structure and interaction of these compounds on a lab bench, with the hope
1716000	1723120	that we can someday relate what we have learned to how they behave in organisms.
1723120	1729240	So we finished our quick three lecture survey of large biological molecules, most of which
1729240	1735160	can simply be thought of as very large organic compounds, consisting mostly of the same elements
1735160	1742120	as the smaller molecules making up those classic small molecules of our science.
1742120	1747800	The time has come for us to consider some new additions to organic chemistry, metals.
1747800	1751720	In our next lecture, we'll move slightly away from organic chemistry's interface with
1751720	1757600	molecular biology, and focus more on its connections with the chemistry of metals.
1757600	1762920	We'll tackle this special class of compounds called organometallics next time, and I'll
1762920	1763440	see you then.
