0	18280	In 1815, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history took place at Mount Tambora
18280	20480	in Indonesia.
20480	25480	This colossal volcanic eruption ejected an unfathomable amount of volcanic ash and debris
25480	30560	into the atmosphere, blocking out a significant fraction of the sunlight reaching the Earth's
30560	31560	surface.
31560	35800	This sent parts of the world into a chill from which they did not awaken until the following
35800	36800	year.
36800	44400	In the middle of the year of 1816, this cloud drifted over Western Europe, leading to what
44400	51160	is sometimes referred to as the year without a summer, which brought a devastating famine.
51160	55920	The result of this was a sustenance crisis, the likes of which the Western world has not
55920	60520	seen in the 200 years since.
60520	65720	Particularly hard hit in this crisis was the nation of Germany, where food riots, demonstrations,
65720	68640	and looting were commonplace that year.
68640	74080	One can only imagine how suddenly an incomprehensibly difficult life must have become for the people
74080	79200	of Europe as this crisis played itself out.
79200	84880	One of those people was a 13-year-old boy by the name of Justice Liebig.
84880	90080	Many historians believe that his traumatic event taking place at such a formative age
90080	95320	so shook this young man's faith in Mother Nature to provide that he dedicated his life
95320	99520	later to researching agricultural chemistry.
99520	104440	His motivations aside, it's undeniable that Liebig's contributions to the field of chemistry
104440	109320	in the decades following the year without a summer opened up a whole new world of chemicals
109320	110720	to study.
110720	117360	Specifically, those chemicals involved in the biology of plants.
117360	123240	Liebig earned his doctorate in 1822 at the University of Erlangen in Bavaria.
123240	128560	After that, in his laboratory in Gie√üen, Germany, and later Munich, Liebig spent much of his
128560	133800	career characterizing and synthesizing a broad range of biologically relevant compounds
133800	135960	from plants.
135960	140960	So prolific was his work that he's often cited as the father of agricultural chemistry,
140960	143360	a well-deserved acknowledgement.
143360	148520	Today, we will swing a pretty wide turn in our study of organic chemistry.
148520	152840	We're going to move from the realm of the harsh reaction conditions and unfamiliar materials
152840	158800	of our synthesis lectures into a more biologically oriented look at organic chemistry, and we're
158800	164520	going to start with one of the classes of compounds that Liebig himself studied.
164520	171500	Now, from the sweet ingredient of sodas like this sugar to the fibrous particles making
171500	178040	up this wood to the tough shell of crabs and lobsters, all the members of this extraordinarily
178040	182720	diverse family of materials have one thing in common.
182720	190200	They're all made up of the same general class of organic compounds, carbohydrates.
190200	193760	In modern culture, we're trained to think of carbohydrates as not much more than a
193760	199280	dietary source of calories, but we're about to see that carbohydrates make up not only
199280	205720	small molecules of caloric value, but also other familiar materials like clothing, building
205720	209640	materials, joint supplements, and even body armor.
209640	214120	In short, we will take a look at these and other biologically important materials crafted
214120	220840	from carbohydrates from the perspective of an organic chemist.
220840	226160	Before we break into the exciting and complex world of materials fashioned from carbohydrates,
226160	229800	let's begin by defining a carbohydrate.
229800	235240	This term is sometimes confused by students with the similar sounding hydrocarbons that
235240	237720	we encountered earlier in our course.
237720	243360	The distinction here is that the hydro of hydrocarbons refers to just hydrogen, while
243360	250880	the hydrate of carbohydrates refers not just to hydrogen, but to water, which includes
250880	254400	one half molar equivalent of oxygen.
254400	260000	So as I mentioned before, carbohydrate refers to a compound composed of carbon and water
260000	261400	in equal parts.
261400	267240	So they'll have a generic formula of CnH2oN.
267240	271320	Now we've come pretty close to carbohydrates before with some of the compounds that we've
271320	273640	looked at previously.
273640	275960	Take the example of glycerol.
275960	280920	Now glycerol's formula is C3H8O3.
280920	285120	So it's got a little bit too much hydrogen in the formula to meet our requirements to
285120	288640	be classified as a carbohydrate.
288640	293440	But I can modify my glycerol structure slightly to make a carbohydrate.
293440	299520	So let's bring up two copies of glycerol here and modify them to create a carbohydrate.
299520	301760	I've got to get rid of two hydrogens.
301760	308120	So let's start by removing two hydrogens from the end of my glycerol molecule.
308120	317240	When I do this, I can insert a carbon-oxygen double bond, creating C3H6O3, a carbohydrate.
317240	321920	But I can also remove two hydrogens from the center.
321920	330360	If I remove two hydrogens from an interior motif here, I get C3H6O3, also a carbohydrate.
330360	336160	But I've changed the names to glyceraldehyde and glycerone in my two structures.
336160	341920	Glyceraldehyde because the carbonyl is a terminal position like it would be in an aldehyde.
341920	347120	Glycerone because the carbonyl is in an interior carbon just as it would be if these groups
347120	350240	were aliphatic and I were dealing with a ketone.
350240	354560	So what I've done here is created three different classes of compounds.
354560	360840	Glycerol would be considered a sugar alcohol, whereas my glyceraldehyde and glycerone are
360840	367600	sugars which we call individually aldoses and ketoses, referring to whether the carbonyl
367600	373520	is internal or external.
373520	378760	Now I've mentioned Alexander Butlerov before, most notably as the mentor of two of the most
378760	385840	revered and mutually repulsed chemists of the 19th century, Markovnikov and Zetsev.
385840	390040	And just as he's contributed to many other fields, the history of carbohydrate chemistry
390040	392720	would not be the same without him.
392720	398840	In 1861 Butlerov published a paper entitled, Formation of a Sugar-like Substance, in which
398840	403400	he detailed a synthesis using formaldehyde and a base to form what he believed to be
403400	405840	simple sugars.
405840	411120	He named his new substance Formos, for the formaldehyde starting material he used and
411120	415760	the class of compounds which he believed he created, sugars.
415760	420760	In a sense Butlerov was right, but he created not just one sugar, but a mixture of sugars
420760	427560	which interconverted through a series of aldol reactions, forming a concoction of carbohydrates.
427560	434000	Now in Butlerov's day, a quick taste would be all it took to make his observations publication-worthy.
434000	438440	Today of course we cringe at the idea of tasting anything prepared in the lab, and we require
438440	444960	a bit more detailed analysis to identify the structures of the compounds that we make.
444960	449040	Butlerov was unable to surmise that there are many, many carbohydrates which can be
449040	453760	produced and isolated from one another, using techniques more modern to the science of organic
453760	456080	chemistry.
456080	460400	These carbohydrates are broadly classified by the number of sugar molecules which we
460400	463080	combine to make them up.
463080	468120	Actually an individual simple sugar molecule can be connected to another one, in several
468120	472040	ways which produce chains of varying lengths and geometries.
472040	477600	And these larger structures, built of simple sugars, are still referred to as carbohydrates
477600	482120	but we call them complex carbohydrates, and these are classified based on their lengths
482120	483120	and geometries.
483120	488000	But we're getting ahead of ourselves, let's step back and consider the most fundamental
488000	490600	of carbohydrates first.
490600	494600	There are those which cannot be hydrolyzed into simpler carbohydrates, and those are
494600	497040	the ones we want to deal with now.
497040	500880	We call these kinds of sugars monosaccharides.
500880	506760	When two such units are joined together in a condensation reaction, we get a disaccharide.
506760	511600	And finally we have polysaccharides, which can have anywhere from just a few to literally
511600	516520	thousands of condensed monosaccharide units.
516520	521600	So let's start at the beginning, the simplest class of carbohydrates, monosaccharides.
521600	527120	As I mentioned before, we break down these simple sugars into two major classes, aldoses
527120	529160	and ketoses.
529160	533160	I've prepared the structures of four different aldoses for you here, so we can see their
533160	536480	structural similarities and differences.
536480	543240	Now the striking structural similarity here, of course, is that we have an aldehyde carbonyl.
543240	548040	So we call this molecule an aldotryose.
548040	553120	Aldo indicating that we have a carbonyl at the end of the chain, triose indicating that
553120	556880	there are three carbons in the chain.
556880	564920	So similarly we would call this one aldotetrose, aldo for a terminal carbonyl, tetrose for
564920	567160	four carbons in the chain.
567160	574680	And the trend continues through aldopentose and aldohexoses and beyond.
574680	579200	Now we use a very similar naming system for ketoses, that is when the carbonyl bond is
579200	580200	interior.
580200	587160	For example, this molecule would be a keto because the carbonyl bond is internal and
587160	592840	a triose because there are three carbons, so I have a keto triose.
592840	601240	My next example would be a keto, tetrose, and so on through the remainder, a ketopentose
601240	604080	and a ketohexose.
604080	608200	But defining the number of carbons in the chain and the location of the carbonyl bond
608200	613880	in a simple sugar isn't enough to let us unambiguously identify carbohydrates.
613880	620960	You see, all along a chain of hexoses, pentoses, tetroses, and even trios, there are one or
620960	622480	more chiral centers.
622480	628640	Now, particularly in the case of longer monosaccharides like hexoses, chirality can generate a large
628640	630520	number of potential stereoisomers.
630520	637440	Now that's why I drew my sample molecules in the previous slides in a Fischer projection.
637440	642100	Remember a Fischer projection is created by drawing a compound so that all of the horizontally
642100	646640	depicted bonds are coming out of the plane and all the vertical ones are falling back
646640	650040	behind the plane.
650040	655080	Now Fischer won his Nobel Prize in part for his characterization of the structure of glucose,
655080	659720	and a large part of his technique for this was to use his systematic form of projection
659720	665320	which made all of the stereochemical relationships in these complex molecules evident.
665320	671160	So let's begin with the simplest of all carbohydrates, the triose glyceraldehyde.
671160	675720	You can see clearly that glyceraldehyde has only one chiral center, so this will be a
675720	678600	relatively easy puzzle to solve.
678600	682200	As a general rule, we draw monosaccharides in a Fischer projection with the terminal
682200	686840	carbonyl at the top and then going downward.
686840	692720	So we can then number the carbons of the chain from top to bottom to facilitate the discussion.
692720	699000	Now notice that only C2 of glyceraldehyde is chiral, so I can draw two enantiomers, one
699000	704960	of which was named plus glyceraldehyde and the other minus glyceraldehyde.
704960	709720	Now remember, this was a long time before the Kahn Engel pre-log rules had been proposed,
709720	714360	and Fischer had only physical properties of saccharides to go on for identifying their
714360	716200	stereochemistry.
716200	721640	So he designated glyceraldehydes as plus and minus based on their ability to rotate a special
721640	725560	kind of light called plane polarized light.
725560	729880	We're going to discuss this phenomenon in detail during our spectroscopy lectures.
729880	733720	But for now, let's just say that the plus and minus glyceraldehyde designations stand
733720	740240	for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of that light.
740240	744960	Now if I start with glyceraldehyde and build larger monosaccharides by adding new interior
744960	750080	carbons to the chain, I'll call my construct a D-sugar.
750080	757040	If instead I start with a minus glyceraldehyde, I'll have to call that construct an L-sugar.
757040	762080	The D and L designations are again based on the molecules interaction with light, D for
762080	768560	clockwise from dextra and L for counterclockwise from livra.
768560	775920	For example, I can create D-erythros by inserting one new carbon into the chain of D-glyceraldehyde.
775920	780600	I can also make a molecule of D-threous in the same way by changing the chirality of my
780600	784760	newly inserted chiral center.
784760	789500	So not surprisingly, the introduction of a second chiral center has led to the possibility
789500	793300	of diastereomers for my aldotetroses.
793300	797960	Of course, I could instead have an L configuration for the bottom chiral carbon of my fissure
797960	804700	projection leading to the other two possible stereochemistries, L-aldotetroses, each a mere
804700	809900	image of one of the D-aldoterroses.
809900	813900	Now this interesting set of stereoisomers in the fissure projection combined to produce
813900	821300	a new relationship in stereochemistry known as erythro and threoenantiomers.
821300	826260	When aligned in a fissure projection orientation, if similar groups are on the same side as
826260	831900	they are in erythros, then we use a prefix erythro to name that enantiomer.
831900	840300	Conversely, if groups of interest are at opposition, we use the threo designation.
840300	845580	As the size of the monosaccharide grows, so do the number of possible stereoisomers.
845580	850940	And by the time we reach hexoses, there are eight stereoisomers possible for D-aldohexoses
850940	853100	and four for D-ketohexoses.
853100	854980	Things get out of hand pretty quickly here.
854980	858900	Now fortunately, there are just a handful of these which tend to make appearances in
858900	860620	natural systems.
860620	867740	And two of the most frequent are the aldohexose known as glucose and the ketohexose known
867740	870120	as fructose.
870120	874200	For simplicity's sake, we'll be using just these two monosaccharides as examples as we
874200	876100	go forward in this lecture.
876100	880480	But keep in mind that the chemistry we're about to see can easily be applied to any
880480	884720	of the dozens of small saccharides that can be created with just a few carbons in the
884720	888720	chain.
888720	894420	So far, I've drawn all the carbohydrates under investigation today as linear compounds.
894420	899600	But you may recall from our lecture on carbonyl compounds that a carbonyl activated by acid
899600	904360	in the presence of an alcohol forms a motif called a hemiacetal.
904360	911160	Well, in the case of monosaccharides, we have both a carbonyl and an alcohol available to
911160	916280	participate in this kind of chemistry intramolecularly.
916280	919980	When this reaction takes place between the carbonyl of a carbohydrate and one of its
919980	927040	own hydroxyl groups, a relatively stable ring of five or six atoms can sometimes form.
927040	934120	We call these cyclic sugars furanose, in the case of a five-membered ring, and pyranose,
934120	937000	in the case of a six-membered ring.
937000	942820	Each of these is named for the cyclic ether which makes up their backbone.
942820	948120	The result of this is an equilibrium interconversion between the acyclic, aldose, or ketose form
948120	954040	and the cyclic, furanose, or pyranose form.
954040	958440	So let's take a look again at glucose, an aldohexose with a fissure projection which
958440	960840	looks like this.
960840	965240	Now we see yet another reason why fissure projections are so useful.
965240	970800	Since all of the carbon-carbon bonds are already aligned so that they curve in on each other,
970800	975960	the cis-trans relationships of groups within the cyclic form are very easy to determine
975960	978160	from this projection.
978160	984440	I simply turn my fissure projection on its side to get a better look at the forming ring.
984440	990240	For example, hydroxyls which are erythro to one another in the aldohexose will be cis
990240	995320	to one another in the resulting pyranose.
995320	999960	If I complete the cyclization in this fictitious orientation, I get what's commonly known as
999960	1005880	a Hayworth projection, with a planar six-membered ring, which we all know can't exist, yet
1006080	1010600	we do this anyway sometimes because it so clearly shows the cis-trans relationships in
1010600	1013680	the cyclic form of the sugar.
1013680	1018040	Now once the ring is placed into a proper chair conformation, we see that there's still
1018040	1021960	one stereochemical consideration left.
1021960	1027880	Since the carbonyl is planar, the attack on that motif during cyclization can take place
1027880	1033600	from either face, meaning that there are really two different enantiomers of any pyranose
1033800	1039800	or pyranose sugar, which we sometimes call animers, and we designate these as alpha and
1039800	1043200	beta animers.
1043200	1047760	In the case of D-leucopyranose, all of the existing hydroxyl groups can be placed in
1047760	1051880	the equatorial position simultaneously, so it's not much of a wonder why this sugar
1051880	1055720	likes to exist as a pyranose ring, right?
1055720	1062320	If the newly formed hydroxyl is in the axial position, we call this an alpha-anomer.
1062320	1069320	If the new group is instead in the equatorial conformation, we have the beta-anomer.
1069840	1074240	By convention, we assign the designation of C1 for the terminal carbon at the closest
1074240	1080440	to the carbonyl end of the uncyclized carbohydrate and number each carbon from there sequentially.
1080440	1086720	So the anomeric C1 group of glucopyranose is a crucial site for modification in both
1086720	1089840	the lab and in nature.
1089840	1094600	This inspection of glucopyranose reveals that the C1 is the only carbon bonded to a
1094600	1097960	pair of electron withdrawing oxygen atoms.
1097960	1104320	So it's the most electrophilic and most likely to participate in substitution reactions,
1104320	1111320	like this very simple reaction between alpha, D, glucopyranose, and acidified methanol.
1112560	1117600	This reaction generates an equilibrium mixture of both the alpha and beta-functionalized
1117600	1119920	monosaccharide.
1119920	1125440	When the C1 is modified this way, we call the product a glycoside, and the newly added
1125440	1130160	group an eglycone.
1130160	1135760	So let's take a look at a glycoside that has some historical relevance.
1135760	1142760	This is a molecule called salicin, and salicin is a glycoside with anti-inflammatory properties,
1142800	1146320	and it's also present in the bark of willow trees.
1146320	1151040	Recent Greeks knew that chewing on the bark of a willow tree gave pain relief and alleviated
1151040	1154080	headaches and joint problems.
1154080	1158040	What they didn't know was that what they were doing while chewing the bark was extracting
1158040	1161560	this particular compound, salicin.
1161560	1168560	Now salicin consists of a glucopyranose, which is bonded to a hydroxybenzyl alcohol, a glycon.
1168560	1173560	And once this compound has been ingested, the water in your bloodstream and the enzymes
1173560	1178560	in your blood go at breaking this down through a hydrolysis reaction.
1178560	1185060	It takes a water molecule to break that link, separating the glucopyranose from the hydroxybenzyl
1185060	1186560	alcohol.
1186560	1192560	Now at this point, the hydroxybenzyl alcohol is oxidized by other enzymes in your body
1192560	1194560	in preparation for removing it.
1194560	1201560	And in doing so, it creates salicylic acid, the same compound into which aspirin degrades
1201560	1207560	to give joint pain relief, headache relief, and other beneficial properties as well.
1207560	1212560	Now, all of this amazing and rich chemistry is done with a few monosaccharides and an
1212560	1215560	endless library of glycones.
1215560	1218060	But I believe that you were promised more.
1218060	1221560	I still owe you an explanation of disaccharides and polysaccharides.
1221560	1225560	So let's get started on those.
1225560	1228560	Our last topic was a perfect lead into disaccharides.
1228560	1233560	We looked at how glycosidic linkages conform to almost anything with an amine or alcohol
1233560	1236560	group on it, really anything that's nucleophilic.
1236560	1239560	And if you were really on top of your game, you might have wondered if all those other
1239560	1244560	alcohol groups on the sugar might make it possible for one sugar molecule to bond to
1244560	1247560	another using the same motif.
1247560	1250560	Now, if you had that thought, give yourself a gold star.
1250560	1253560	You are spot on.
1253560	1258560	Although theoretically it's possible for any hydroxyl of one monosaccharide to form
1258560	1262560	a glycosidic linkage with another, there are three arrangements which we principally
1262560	1264560	see in nature.
1264560	1268560	And we distinguish these linkages by numbering the monosaccharide acting as the
1268560	1271560	glycone with prime numbers.
1271560	1272560	So check this out.
1272560	1276560	Take the system 1, 1 prime, 1, 4 prime, and 1, 6 prime.
1276560	1280560	These are the linkages that we most often see in nature, meaning that the C1 will
1280560	1286560	link to a different oxygen from one of the carbons in the other saccharide.
1286560	1292560	Now, a familiar disaccharide with this 1, 4 prime linkage is maltose.
1292560	1297560	Maltose is formed by the glycosidic linkage of two glucose units through an alpha
1297560	1298560	anomer.
1298560	1304560	Now, here one glucose acts as the glycoside, bonding through its C1, and the other acts
1304560	1308560	as the aglycone, bonding through its C4 prime.
1308560	1313560	And notice that this leaves the C1 prime to interconvert between enantiomers through
1313560	1317560	an equilibrium process so this disaccharide can still open and close in at least one
1317560	1319560	of its rings.
1319560	1324560	Maltose is most familiar as the starting material for beer, made by the hydrolysis
1324560	1328560	of starches from grains in the first part of the brewing process.
1328560	1332560	Much of the maltose is consumed by the yeast, which are used to brew the beer,
1332560	1335560	but a small amount is retained in the beverage.
1335560	1339560	So the next time you have a beer with your friends, take a sip and pronounce.
1339560	1345560	That has some lovely 4-0-alpha-D-glucoparanosyl-D-glucopyranos notes.
1345560	1350560	You may wind up drinking alone after that, but at least you are telling the truth.
1350560	1356560	Now, the 1-6 prime linkages are less common, but they do exist in a few disaccharides.
1356560	1360560	They're actually more relevant to polysaccharides, as we'll soon see.
1360560	1365560	One example of this type of linkage in a disaccharide is Gentio bios,
1365560	1369560	a 1-6 prime disaccharide between two glucose units.
1369560	1374560	Now, by connecting to the aglycone at its 6 prime carbon, which is not part of the
1374560	1378560	Pyranos ring, additional conformational flexibility is introduced,
1378560	1383560	making a nice building block for branched polysaccharides.
1383560	1390560	Now, a prime example of a 1-1 prime linkage is the familiar sweetening agent, sucrose.
1390560	1395560	Sucrose consists of a glucose and a fructose unit linked by a bridging oxygen
1395560	1398560	through one another's anomeric carbons.
1398560	1403560	So, in this unusual case, both sugars are acting as glycosides for themselves
1403560	1406560	and as aglycones for their bonding partner.
1406560	1411560	Since both anomeric carbons are occupied by the glycosidic linkage,
1411560	1417560	sucrose has no free anomeric carbon to open back up in equilibrium with the cyclic form.
1417560	1422560	Now, this is important because sugars are much more prone to oxidative degradation
1422560	1424560	when in their acyclic forms.
1424560	1429560	So, this makes sucrose much slower to oxidize than other disaccharides
1429560	1433560	and therefore a popular choice for use in preserves.
1440560	1445560	Polysaccharides, as you might expect from the name, are simply longer chains of sugars
1445560	1450560	in which most of them are acting as both glycosides and as aglycones.
1450560	1455560	Perpetuating a polymer built from monosaccharide units.
1455560	1460560	Many materials with which we're familiar are made from polysaccharides.
1460560	1464560	For example, cellulose in the cotton fibers in these cotton balls.
1464560	1468560	It's made up almost exclusively of D-glucose units
1468560	1474560	attached by beta-1-4-prime glycosidic bonds.
1474560	1478560	That same material makes up about one half of the matter.
1478560	1483560	That same material makes up about one half of the mass of dry wood.
1483560	1486560	Cellulose combines into closely packed fibrils
1486560	1489560	which interact with one another by a hydrogen bonding,
1489560	1494560	forming a strong, tough, insoluble material.
1494560	1499560	Now, cotton balls and lumber don't seem terribly appetizing to me as a human,
1499560	1503560	but certain animal species, most notably cows and termites,
1503560	1506560	have symbiotic bacteria living in their digestive tract
1506560	1510560	which help them to break down the cellulose in those materials
1510560	1514560	and use them as a food source.
1514560	1520560	Now, by contrast, switching the beta linkage to an alpha linkage gives us amylose,
1520560	1525560	a starch which curves on itself into a helix.
1525560	1529560	It can be digested and used as a source of nutrition for higher order animals,
1529560	1535560	even those without bacterial help or four stomachs to help break it down.
1535560	1539560	Now, if we take amylose and branch it out every 30 subunits or so
1539560	1543560	by cross-linking another chain at a six prime position,
1543560	1550560	we get amylopectin, a water-soluble thickening agent used in cooking applications.
1550560	1554560	More extensive branching of the same kind leads to glycogen,
1554560	1558560	one of the human body's primary energy stores.
1558560	1560560	If you have enough glycogen stored up in your muscles,
1560560	1564560	you're just a hydrolysis reaction away from additional glucose molecules
1564560	1570560	for use as energy to help you run that marathon or finish that workday.
1570560	1573560	As a final example of polysaccharides,
1573560	1577560	let's take a look at the remarkable armor which protects insects and arthropods
1577560	1580560	from cicadas to crabs.
1580560	1583560	You might find it hard to believe that the same class of materials
1583560	1586560	that's used to sweeten soft drinks can also make up armor
1586560	1589560	which protects sea creatures and insects from predators.
1589560	1592560	But it does.
1592560	1596560	Chitin, the material from which this tough exoskeleton is made,
1596560	1601560	is a polymer of a glucose derivative called n-acetylglucosamine.
1601560	1604560	N-acetylglucosamine is a pyranose form of glucose
1604560	1610560	with an amide-functional group substituted here at the C2 position of the ring.
1610560	1616560	Now, polymerize this molecule through beta-1,4-prime glycosidic bonds
1616560	1621560	and you have chitin, a material so tough that once formed it can't grow with the animal.
1622560	1625560	This is why crabs and some insects periodically molt,
1625560	1630560	shedding their chitin armor and producing a whole new, slightly larger suit of armor
1630560	1633560	once the old one's been shuffled off.
1633560	1637560	But the secret to chitin's strength is not only in the glycosidic linkages,
1637560	1641560	but also in the amide-functionality added to that sugar ring.
1641560	1647560	Now, you can see here that when multiple strands of chitin are aligned,
1647560	1654560	the aminitrogen and carbonyl from one chitin can hydrogen bond to others on a separate strand.
1654560	1659560	This H bond network contributes to the remarkable strength of chitin,
1659560	1661560	which protects against predation.
1661560	1664560	It's also the reason that crustaceans and insects have to molt,
1664560	1668560	shedding their old exoskeletons during periods of concerted growth
1668560	1671560	during which a new exoskeleton is formed.
1671560	1675560	Now, the toughening provided by this hydrogen bonding network
1675560	1680560	can simply be turned off again by modifying the amine group of glucosamine yet again.
1681560	1686560	In the body, our joint cartilage is made up partially of glucosaminoglycans,
1686560	1691560	which are long polysaccharides, consisting of alternating acetyl glucosamine
1691560	1695560	and another modified sugar called uronic acid.
1696560	1699560	As opposed to tough and flexible chitin,
1699560	1704560	glucosaminoglycans like this one are springy and lubricating
1704560	1708560	because the hydrogen bonding network is disrupted by the acetyl motif,
1708560	1712560	which allows one chain to slide along the other more easily.
1712560	1716560	This is the reason that many believers religiously take doses of glucosamine
1716560	1721560	in the hopes of limiting cartilage loss associated with arthritis.
1723560	1725560	So let's sum up for the day.
1725560	1730560	Today we discussed carbohydrates, a broad and diverse class of compounds
1730560	1735560	with the chemical formula CNH2ON.
1735560	1740560	We took a look at Fischer projections of the two main classes of simple carbohydrates,
1740560	1746560	those being aldoses and ketoses, which differ by the location of their carbonyl motif.
1746560	1750560	We then discussed the stereochemistry of simple carbohydrates
1750560	1754560	and the concept of erythro and threoenantiomers.
1754560	1758560	After that, we discussed the cyclization of simple sugars
1758560	1762560	by reacting a hydroxyl with the carbonyl in an intramolecular reaction
1762560	1765560	to form a hemiacetal,
1765560	1771560	and how the most common of these are 5-membered furanose and 6-membered purinose rings.
1771560	1776560	We also recognized that the hemiacetal carbon can have two distinct stereochemistries,
1776560	1780560	leaving us to label it an anomeric carbon.
1781560	1785560	We looked at how these cyclic sugars can react through their anomeric carbon
1785560	1791560	to form alpha and beta glycosidic linkages to new groups called aglycones.
1791560	1795560	When the aglycone is another sugar itself, we form a disaccharide,
1795560	1799560	like maltose from beer or sucrose in fruit preserves.
1799560	1805560	We discussed the 1,4' 1,6' and 1,1' glycosidic linkages,
1805560	1810560	and how the 1,4' linkage is well suited to formation of long polymer strands.
1810560	1814560	The 1,6' linkage imparts branching to such polymers,
1814560	1819560	and the 1,1' linkage in sucrose prohibits its two sugar units from opening and oxidizing,
1819560	1825560	making it a perfect choice for food applications because of its resistance to oxidation.
1826560	1831560	Finally, we considered polysaccharides of glucopyrinose, including cellulose,
1831560	1835560	which has beta glycosidic linkages, giving it tensile strength,
1835560	1838560	in contrast to amylose and amylopectin,
1838560	1840560	which have alpha glycosidic linkages,
1840560	1845560	endowing them with a higher solubility and making them more digestible for humans.
1846560	1849560	We also saw how some animals like arthropods and insects
1849560	1852560	chemically modify the glucoside subunits of cellulose
1852560	1856560	to form even more powerful sets of interstrand hydrogen bonds,
1856560	1860560	which endow their exoskeletons with formidable physical properties.
1861560	1866560	Next time, we're going to take a look at a very special Aldo pentose,
1866560	1873560	ribose, and how it acts as the central piece of one of nature's most awesome molecular creations,
1873560	1874560	DNA.
1874560	1876560	I'll see you then.
