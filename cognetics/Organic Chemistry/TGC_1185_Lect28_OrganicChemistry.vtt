WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.840
Last time we started considering how spectroscopists use light as a means of probing the structure

00:17.840 --> 00:20.440
and behavior of molecular systems.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.120
Specifically, we took a look at the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic

00:25.120 --> 00:31.040
spectrum and how radiation of this energy is perfectly suited to excite electrons from

00:31.040 --> 00:36.120
one molecular orbital to another, giving us a way to probe the energetics of these kinds

00:36.120 --> 00:37.520
of systems.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.200
Today, we're going to take a look at the red end of the visible spectrum and what lies

00:42.200 --> 00:44.720
beyond that.

00:44.720 --> 00:50.880
Just like UV light, infrared light from the sun is constantly bombarding us.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.760
Like UV light, though, infrared light isn't associated with any particularly dangerous

00:55.760 --> 00:58.240
health effects.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.480
Infrared is still a very interesting part of the electromagnetic spectrum, though.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.580
Objects at or near room temperature naturally emit this wavelength of light, and that includes

01:08.580 --> 01:10.080
you.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.800
Believe it or not, you glow in the dark.

01:12.800 --> 01:16.760
The catch is that you glow in the dark at too long of a wavelength to be detected by

01:16.760 --> 01:18.720
the human eye.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.480
Now, scientists like those at NASA have developed cameras and telescopes capable of detecting

01:24.480 --> 01:30.920
the infrared emissions of both small objects here on Earth and of celestial bodies on the

01:30.920 --> 01:36.080
other side of the known universe, creating false color images like these in which the

01:36.080 --> 01:43.080
detected infrared light has been shown as different colors.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.240
But infrared light isn't just radiated.

01:46.240 --> 01:51.680
Like all other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, it can also be absorbed.

01:51.680 --> 01:57.240
And just as a warm object cools by radiating energy as I are light, so can an object be

01:57.240 --> 02:00.000
warmed by absorbing it.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.080
Now, last time I made it sound like Ritter was stricken with a divine inspiration to

02:05.080 --> 02:08.680
look outside the blue end of the visible spectrum.

02:08.680 --> 02:14.000
But in fact, his experiment was almost certainly inspired by one conducted earlier that year

02:14.000 --> 02:20.400
by another English scientist, Sir William Herschel.

02:20.400 --> 02:26.800
Herschel was a prolific astronomer, a composer and a mathematician, a true Renaissance man.

02:26.800 --> 02:32.800
And he was the one who made a truly inspired discovery when he asked a simple question,

02:32.800 --> 02:39.160
which color of light is most effective at heating a surface when shined on it?

02:39.160 --> 02:44.360
To answer this question, he used a prism to diffract sunlight into a spectrum and placed

02:44.360 --> 02:52.760
thermometers with blackened bulbs at regular intervals within that spectrum.

02:52.760 --> 02:58.720
So let's bring up this IR spectrum, or visible spectrum, with infrared just outside of it.

02:58.720 --> 03:04.840
So Herschel saw that the temperature indicated by his thermometers increased across the spectrum,

03:04.840 --> 03:07.680
from blue to red.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.440
And knowing what we do about the amount of energy contained in photons of different wavelengths,

03:12.440 --> 03:15.520
it might seem a little bit counterintuitive at first.

03:15.520 --> 03:20.880
But Herschel essentially proved that red light is absorbed more efficiently by objects that

03:20.880 --> 03:23.420
are near room temperature.

03:23.420 --> 03:28.840
But the pertinent result of Herschel's experiment wasn't the trend he saw in the visible spectrum.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.360
His real breakthrough came when he wondered if the trend continued beyond the spectrum

03:33.360 --> 03:35.400
that he could see.

03:35.400 --> 03:41.320
And sure enough, when he placed another thermometer just beyond the red portion of the spectrum,

03:41.320 --> 03:46.920
it read an even higher temperature than the one in the red light.

03:46.920 --> 03:53.680
Clearly, there was some form of light beyond the red portion of the spectrum, prompting

03:53.680 --> 03:59.120
him to call his new discovery, infrared light.

03:59.120 --> 04:04.280
Today we're going to take a look at how modern scientists use Herschel's discovery to probe

04:04.280 --> 04:09.840
the structures of organic compounds and make new discoveries today more than 200 years

04:09.840 --> 04:13.360
after its initial discovery.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.640
Modern spectroscopy in the infrared region is conducted using instruments very similar

04:17.640 --> 04:20.760
to those used for the UV visible.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.920
The simplest of these will follow the same format, starting with a light source, but

04:24.920 --> 04:29.640
in this case a light source which emits powerful infrared light.

04:29.640 --> 04:34.320
That light will again go through a monochromator which will selectively direct one wavelength

04:34.320 --> 04:37.080
at a time through a beam splitter.

04:37.080 --> 04:42.920
The beam splitter will split the beam into two, giving us two different beams of infrared

04:42.920 --> 04:48.120
light, one traversing a reference cell, one traversing a sample cell which is exactly

04:48.120 --> 04:54.160
the same but contains one additive and that's the molecules that we want to analyze.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.880
As the beams exit, their intensities are measured by two detectors and compared.

04:58.880 --> 05:03.960
Now there are much more sophisticated apparatus, but this is the simplest way to conduct and

05:03.960 --> 05:07.480
therefore to understand infrared.

05:07.480 --> 05:14.240
Okay, so now that we know how scientists shine infrared light on samples and measure which

05:14.240 --> 05:19.880
wavelengths of light are absorbed, but we still need to try to understand exactly why

05:19.880 --> 05:21.840
anyone would want to do such a thing.

05:25.160 --> 05:30.400
Now to explain this, I want to show you a molecule called fluorinone on the big screen

05:30.400 --> 05:34.880
here using my ChemDraw Chem3D software.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.800
Now we're used to seeing molecules in this kind of configuration when we see them in

05:38.800 --> 05:41.760
textbooks and papers.

05:41.760 --> 05:46.080
Notice that all of the bond lengths and angles are identical and ideal.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.400
The molecule appears perfectly planar.

05:49.400 --> 05:54.120
Every bond in my benzene rings is exactly 120 degrees.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.160
Everything looks exactly as it should, right?

05:57.160 --> 05:59.240
But do molecules really look like this?

05:59.240 --> 06:00.760
Do they really act like this?

06:00.760 --> 06:03.120
Are they rigid, unmoving, and symmetrical?

06:03.120 --> 06:05.720
No, of course not.

06:05.720 --> 06:11.440
This representation is done using average bond angles and average bond lengths of a dynamic

06:11.440 --> 06:13.240
set of bonds.

06:13.240 --> 06:18.320
They really look more like this.

06:18.320 --> 06:23.280
What's running right now is a dynamic simulation which approximates the random motions of each

06:23.280 --> 06:25.680
atom within a molecule.

06:25.680 --> 06:30.320
The bonds between and among those atoms are stretching, bending and twisting in many different

06:30.320 --> 06:31.320
ways.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.400
Just put more simply, bonds vibrate.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.320
They don't all vibrate in the same way either.

06:38.320 --> 06:44.440
Notice that the carbon-oxygen bond is oscillating very slowly compared to some of those carbon-hydrogen

06:44.440 --> 06:45.880
bonds.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.960
If you watch for a while, you can see not only individual bonds stretching and compressing,

06:50.960 --> 06:55.840
but other sets of bonds are opening and closing like scissors and even twisting.

06:55.840 --> 07:02.200
This is really evident when I turn the molecule to look at it edge-on.

07:02.200 --> 07:06.320
Instead of being perfectly flat and planar, you'll notice that some of the vibrations

07:06.320 --> 07:12.320
cause the molecule to flex and twist in and out of the plane that we usually use to represent

07:12.320 --> 07:14.820
it.

07:14.840 --> 07:22.540
Let me stop my simulation now and bring my molecule back to its idealized state.

07:22.540 --> 07:27.220
So we're used to seeing the molecules drawn in this way, but to the eyes of a seasoned

07:27.220 --> 07:30.900
chemist, it's apparent that they really aren't like this.

07:30.900 --> 07:35.900
When it comes to actually modeling how molecules behave, we have to learn how to think of a

07:35.900 --> 07:43.340
picture like this in terms of that animation that we saw previously.

07:43.340 --> 07:47.760
In order to understand infrared spectroscopy, we need to begin to think of molecules in

07:47.760 --> 07:53.220
terms of that dynamic model that I just showed you, rather than the rigid, idealized structures

07:53.220 --> 07:55.580
that are so often depicted.

07:55.580 --> 07:59.800
So let's begin breaking this down by looking at a set of much simpler molecules and how

07:59.800 --> 08:01.300
they behave.

08:01.300 --> 08:07.660
First, let's consider carbon monoxide, two atoms joined by a triple bond.

08:07.660 --> 08:13.100
Now with only two atoms, there's only one possible bond vibration which can take place,

08:13.100 --> 08:16.220
a stretching between the atoms.

08:16.220 --> 08:20.700
But what if we move on to carbon dioxide, a molecule with three atoms?

08:20.700 --> 08:28.980
Well, now we can conceive of vibrations involving a symmetrical stretch, an asymmetrical stretch,

08:28.980 --> 08:33.900
a symmetrical bend, and an asymmetrical bend.

08:33.900 --> 08:42.540
So there are actually four different ways in which a CO2 molecule can vibrate.

08:42.540 --> 08:47.100
If we continue adding atoms, we find that the total number of these vibrations, which

08:47.100 --> 08:53.820
we call vibrational modes, is equal to 3n minus 5, where n is the number of atoms in

08:53.820 --> 09:00.040
a linear molecule, or 3n minus 6 for nonlinear molecules.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.660
So this means that for a compound as simple as methane, we expect to find nine different

09:04.660 --> 09:09.020
types of vibrations going on within that molecule.

09:09.020 --> 09:14.060
Carbon has 24, and even more complex molecules like fluorinone have dozens or even hundreds

09:14.060 --> 09:21.980
of vibrational modes, each with their own distinct frequency.

09:21.980 --> 09:27.260
So we've now covered how IR spectroscopy is conducted, and the vibration of bonds and

09:27.260 --> 09:30.100
sets of bonds in organic molecules.

09:30.100 --> 09:34.660
And I'm sure by now you're wondering, what is it that brings these two apparently disparate

09:34.660 --> 09:37.940
concepts together?

09:37.940 --> 09:39.620
The answer is this.

09:39.620 --> 09:44.900
Many bond vibrational frequencies are the same as those of infrared light.

09:44.900 --> 09:49.420
And just as electronic transitions could be promoted by just the right photon in a UV

09:49.420 --> 09:54.620
visible experiment, so can transitions in the vibrations of a molecule be introduced

09:54.620 --> 10:00.260
by just the right infrared photon.

10:00.260 --> 10:05.260
When a bond vibrating in a particular frequency encounters a photon of identical frequency,

10:05.260 --> 10:10.100
that photon can be absorbed, increasing the amplitude of the associated vibration in

10:10.100 --> 10:12.300
the process.

10:12.300 --> 10:16.700
This is the absorption which is measured by the spectrophotometer.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.860
Now the frequencies which correspond to the vibrations of bonds in organic molecules

10:20.860 --> 10:25.500
are on the order of billions of cycles per second, or billions of hertz, much faster

10:25.500 --> 10:28.820
than the model I showed you.

10:28.820 --> 10:32.500
This produces some pretty unwieldy numbers for frequency, of course.

10:32.500 --> 10:38.100
So in IR spectroscopy, we instead use a unit called wave numbers.

10:38.100 --> 10:43.940
A wave number is simply the reciprocal of a photon's wavelength in centimeters.

10:43.940 --> 10:50.020
For example, light with a wavelength of 5 microns, or .0005 centimeters, which is a

10:50.020 --> 10:59.580
typical IR wavelength, will have a wave number of 2000, 2000 reciprocal centimeters.

10:59.580 --> 11:04.100
Of course, as you might imagine, we have a pretty good idea of the vibrational frequencies

11:04.100 --> 11:07.660
of different types of bonds near room temperatures.

11:07.660 --> 11:10.620
It's actually easier to predict than you might think.

11:10.620 --> 11:16.860
You simply have to think of atoms and bonds as though they were weights and springs.

11:16.860 --> 11:19.060
Let me demonstrate this for you.

11:19.060 --> 11:24.980
If I connect a set of light weights by a fairly stiff spring and give it some energy, the

11:24.980 --> 11:29.380
vibrational frequency is expected to be fairly high.

11:29.380 --> 11:33.620
And this is because the light weights have only a small amount of momentum which is easily

11:33.620 --> 11:40.460
overcome by the strong spring in order to reverse the masses direction.

11:40.460 --> 11:45.580
Of course, right now we have nothing to compare this to, so let's make a change and connect

11:45.580 --> 11:49.280
a heavier weight to the same kind of spring.

11:49.280 --> 11:53.620
You see that the spring needs more time to overcome the greater momentum of the larger

11:53.620 --> 12:00.020
weight, causing the frequency of the oscillation to be lower.

12:00.020 --> 12:05.100
I can also alter the frequency by adjusting the stiffness of the spring.

12:05.100 --> 12:09.580
For example, connecting similar weights to a stronger spring means that the spring can

12:09.580 --> 12:14.020
overcome the momentum of those weights more easily and reverse the motion of the mass

12:14.020 --> 12:16.260
more quickly.

12:16.260 --> 12:21.900
So we've increased the vibrational frequency in this case.

12:21.900 --> 12:27.500
So larger masses and weaker springs lead to slower vibrations.

12:27.500 --> 12:32.660
If we translate this phenomenon from the macroscopic example of weights and springs to the molecular

12:32.660 --> 12:39.720
level, atoms would be our weights and the chemical bonds between them would be our springs.

12:39.720 --> 12:45.020
We would say that larger atoms and weaker bonds lead to slower vibrations.

12:45.020 --> 12:50.180
In other words, a C-H bond should vibrate faster than a carbonyl bond, which should

12:50.180 --> 12:54.220
vibrate faster than a carbon-oxygen ether bond.

12:54.220 --> 13:01.300
In fact, this is exactly what we see in IR spectroscopy.

13:01.300 --> 13:05.220
Now there's one more catch to the science of IR spectroscopy.

13:05.220 --> 13:08.220
It's known as the IR Selection Rule.

13:08.220 --> 13:14.100
Now the IR Selection Rule states simply this, that a vibrating bond or set of bonds can only

13:14.100 --> 13:19.820
absorb a photon of the same frequency if that vibration causes a change in the dipole of

13:19.820 --> 13:21.680
the molecule.

13:21.680 --> 13:25.420
No dipole change means no absorption.

13:25.420 --> 13:31.420
Strong dipole change means a strong absorption.

13:31.420 --> 13:36.380
So it should come as no surprise that functional groups which usually have strong dipoles in

13:36.380 --> 13:43.300
their bonds are often powerful IR absorbers, while less reactive bonds like alkyl C-H bonds

13:43.300 --> 13:48.660
tend to absorb very weakly or sometimes not even at all.

13:48.660 --> 13:53.380
Now you've probably noticed that most functional groups contain good strong polar bonds to

13:53.380 --> 13:59.700
at least one hydrogen or double and triple bonds among larger atoms, sometimes both.

13:59.700 --> 14:05.020
So the signatures associated with the most common functional groups in infrared are typically

14:05.020 --> 14:11.660
found at higher frequency regions of the spectrum, whereas the vibrations within the skeleton

14:11.660 --> 14:21.380
tend to have absorptions in the lower frequency region of the spectrum on the other side.

14:21.380 --> 14:26.620
The few but distinct absorptions caused by functional groups leads us to define the higher

14:26.620 --> 14:31.860
frequency region of the IR spectrum as the functional group region, because it's often

14:31.860 --> 14:35.460
where we find the information we need to catalog which functional groups are present in the

14:35.460 --> 14:38.780
sample and which are not.

14:38.780 --> 14:42.540
What this region tells us very little about the carbon-carbon bonds within the scaffold

14:42.540 --> 14:48.540
of the molecule, which is usually fairly large with many complex vibrational modes.

14:48.540 --> 14:53.340
Too many to consider individually, but these types of molecular vibrations tend to have

14:53.340 --> 14:58.460
lower frequency IR absorptions, so we've labeled that region of the spectrum, the fingerprint

14:58.460 --> 15:04.700
region, for the fact that its complexity makes it difficult to interpret but unique to each

15:04.700 --> 15:06.260
molecule which generates it.

15:09.620 --> 15:15.340
So, let's take a look at a few IR spectra and see if we can make sense of the information

15:15.340 --> 15:20.980
that they contain, starting with the functional group region of some common hydrocarbons.

15:20.980 --> 15:25.300
Let's take a look at three different hydrocarbons with which we're very familiar.

15:25.300 --> 15:33.500
The saturated hydrocarbon pentane, one pentene, a terminal alkyne, and one pentine, a terminal

15:33.500 --> 15:34.800
alkyne.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.420
So these molecules are all very similar to one another structurally with one distinct

15:38.420 --> 15:45.420
difference, that difference being that the degree of saturation or unsaturation is changing.

15:45.420 --> 15:50.540
So let's begin by taking a look at the infrared spectrum of pentane.

15:50.540 --> 15:55.020
Now we've taken these spectra from a database called the AIST database.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.980
They're available online free of charge, so if you'd like to check them out for yourself,

15:58.980 --> 16:01.140
be sure that you find the URL and have a look.

16:01.140 --> 16:06.060
It's a very, very broad database with lots of really good data to see, certainly more

16:06.060 --> 16:07.820
than I'm going to show you today.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.620
So let's start with pentane again.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.860
Here's my structure.

16:10.860 --> 16:14.940
It's a simple hydrocarbon consisting only of carbon-carbon single bonds and carbon-hydrogen

16:14.940 --> 16:20.740
single bonds, so I expect to see primarily evidence of those kinds of bonds in the molecule.

16:20.740 --> 16:25.140
Now looking at the functional group region, which is over here on the left-hand side at

16:25.140 --> 16:30.220
my higher frequencies and therefore higher wave numbers, I see that there's a very strong

16:30.220 --> 16:38.380
absorbance at about 2900 wave numbers, and this is a classic signature for an SP3 hybridized

16:38.380 --> 16:41.780
carbon-hydrogen bond.

16:41.780 --> 16:45.780
The rest of this is the fingerprint of the molecule, which corresponds to the backbone

16:45.780 --> 16:48.540
atoms and their particular vibrations.

16:48.540 --> 16:53.780
So this is a very simple infrared spectrum of a very simple hydrocarbon and a great place

16:53.780 --> 16:55.820
to start.

16:55.940 --> 17:01.980
When I move to one pentane, I'm going to introduce a few changes to the molecule, most notably

17:01.980 --> 17:07.740
the hybridization of two of the carbon atoms which bear CH bonds.

17:07.740 --> 17:13.100
By changing their hybridization state from an SP3 to an SP2, I'm going to increase the

17:13.100 --> 17:17.780
S character of those bonds, and that means that I'm going to make them a little bit tighter,

17:17.780 --> 17:23.460
a little bit tougher, and that means their frequency should increase ever so slightly.

17:23.460 --> 17:27.340
So let's keep our eyes on the functional group region as I switch my spectrum over from

17:27.340 --> 17:30.340
pentane to one pentane.

17:33.340 --> 17:38.980
Here it is, a classic signature of an SP2 CH bond.

17:38.980 --> 17:45.500
I now have an absorption not only at 2900 wave numbers corresponding to my SP3 hybridized

17:45.500 --> 17:51.420
carbon-hydrogen bonds, but I also have a new absorption, which is taking place at about

17:51.460 --> 17:54.140
3100 wave numbers.

17:54.140 --> 17:58.420
Now remember, my axis here is transmittance, so my peaks are actually valleys.

17:58.420 --> 18:02.020
So the lower the spectrum goes, the stronger the absorption is.

18:02.020 --> 18:07.260
Okay, so let's move on to one pentane after we think for just a moment about what kind

18:07.260 --> 18:11.140
of change we expect to see in the functional group region.

18:11.140 --> 18:15.580
I'm going to be changing the hybridization state of at least two of my atoms here.

18:15.580 --> 18:19.380
These two are going to go from SP2 to SP3.

18:20.380 --> 18:24.860
Excuse me, they're going to go from SP2 to SP, and that means they'll have even more

18:24.860 --> 18:26.260
S-character.

18:26.260 --> 18:31.100
And having even more S-character means I expect to see, that's right, an infrared absorption

18:31.100 --> 18:33.140
at an even higher frequency.

18:33.140 --> 18:37.340
So let's make that change now.

18:37.340 --> 18:43.540
Sure enough, here is my absorption at about 3300 wave numbers, a perfect signature for

18:43.580 --> 18:49.580
an SP-hybridized carbon-hydrogen bond, just like the one I have in one pentane.

18:52.780 --> 18:57.420
But remember, we talked about the importance of polarity and how IR is a great tool for

18:57.420 --> 19:01.260
probing the structures and presence of functional groups.

19:01.260 --> 19:05.380
So let's put some more functional groups in and see what happens to our IR spectra.

19:05.380 --> 19:09.380
Let's compare one pentanol to pentanoic acid.

19:09.380 --> 19:14.380
Both compounds, which we know, have very polar CO and OH bonds.

19:16.380 --> 19:22.380
Well, the IR spectrum of one pentanol has a very clear signature for an OH.

19:22.380 --> 19:25.380
It's this large, broad peak here.

19:25.380 --> 19:30.220
Now the peak is fairly broad because OHs have a tendency to hydrogen bond to one another

19:30.220 --> 19:33.420
and exchange back and forth between and among molecules.

19:33.420 --> 19:36.980
And so this broadens their peaks out a little bit because their chemical environments can

19:36.980 --> 19:38.980
change as the experiment progresses.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.980
Nonetheless, I can see it very clearly here.

19:41.980 --> 19:46.980
And on top of that peak, I can also see my SP3 carbon hydrogens.

19:46.980 --> 19:52.980
So what I have here is a very obvious functional group region for an aliphatic alcohol.

19:52.980 --> 19:59.980
Now if I make a slight change here and oxidize my one pentanol down to pentanoic acid, let's see what happens.

20:02.980 --> 20:05.980
Okay, two changes that we can point to directly.

20:05.980 --> 20:09.980
The first of which is that the OH peak has gotten broader,

20:09.980 --> 20:17.980
and also that this very large absorbance has come into my spectrum at around 1700 wave numbers.

20:17.980 --> 20:26.980
So we can easily explain this broadness here by, again, the exchange of my OH bond from the pentanoic acid,

20:26.980 --> 20:30.980
not the bond itself, mind you, but the hydrogen being exchanged.

20:30.980 --> 20:36.980
But what's causing the really, really powerful absorbance here at 1700 at a lower frequency?

20:36.980 --> 20:39.980
That's the presence of a carbonyl.

20:39.980 --> 20:45.980
Heavier carbon and oxygen atoms lead to lower frequency vibrations in that particular bond.

20:45.980 --> 20:50.980
So once again, my functional group region has given me a very clear signal here.

20:50.980 --> 20:54.980
I have an aliphatic organic acid.

20:55.980 --> 21:00.980
Let's continue and do a few more functional groups.

21:00.980 --> 21:05.980
How about the IR of ketones and esters, some more carbonyl-containing compounds?

21:05.980 --> 21:10.980
Now we should be able to use what we know so far to get a rough idea of what these will look like.

21:13.980 --> 21:17.980
Two pentanone is a very clean IR spectrum here.

21:17.980 --> 21:22.980
Obviously aliphatic because we have strong absorptions here at about 2900.

21:22.980 --> 21:27.980
Now the strong absorption isn't because the carbon-hydrogen bond is very polar actually.

21:27.980 --> 21:31.980
The strong absorption is because there are so many of those bonds in the molecule.

21:31.980 --> 21:37.980
But in addition to that, I have my carbonyl absorbing at about 1700 wave numbers.

21:37.980 --> 21:43.980
So this is a very obvious functional group region for an aliphatic ketone.

21:43.980 --> 21:48.980
It shares some of its features in common with my organic acids,

21:48.980 --> 21:52.980
but it's missing the critical OH signal which would tell me it's an acid.

21:52.980 --> 21:57.980
So you need to think in terms of not only what's present in your spectrum when you're doing an analysis,

21:57.980 --> 21:59.980
but also what's not there.

21:59.980 --> 22:04.980
The absence of peaks can be just as informative as the presence.

22:04.980 --> 22:10.980
Now let's move on to butyl acetate, an ester compound.

22:10.980 --> 22:16.980
Very similar, isn't it, to two pentanone, sp3CHs, and my carbonyl.

22:16.980 --> 22:20.980
But there's another very strong absorbance which is working its way down into the fingerprint region.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.980
But it's so strong that I can easily pick it out.

22:23.980 --> 22:24.980
It's right here.

22:24.980 --> 22:32.980
And this is one of the absorbances which is commonly caused by the presence of a carbon-oxygen single bond.

22:32.980 --> 22:37.980
Remember double bonds are stronger so they create a higher frequency vibration.

22:37.980 --> 22:42.980
Carbon-oxygen single bonds would be weaker but have the same sized atoms.

22:42.980 --> 22:45.980
Therefore we see a lower frequency vibration.

22:47.980 --> 22:50.980
One last look at the fingerprint region.

22:50.980 --> 22:54.980
Let's take a look at the IR of amines, amines.

22:54.980 --> 23:00.980
I'm going to compare a primary, secondary, and tertiary amine here.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.980
First let's look at the primary amine, pentalamine.

23:04.980 --> 23:07.980
Again, easily seen as an aliphatic.

23:07.980 --> 23:15.980
And we also have two absorptions that are slightly higher in frequency than my aliphatic sp3CHs.

23:15.980 --> 23:18.980
And those aren't from an alkyne proton.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.980
Those are from the NH protons here.

23:21.980 --> 23:25.980
This is from an asymmetric stretch and symmetric stretch mode.

23:25.980 --> 23:29.980
In other words, it's the interpretive dance portion of the course now.

23:29.980 --> 23:35.980
In other words, if you think of my head as a nitrogen atom and my hands as being the hydrogens,

23:35.980 --> 23:40.980
there are two vibrational modes there because two hydrogen atoms means they can vibrate symmetrically

23:41.980 --> 23:45.980
or asymmetrically relative to the nitrogen.

23:45.980 --> 23:49.980
Hence two peaks in the NH region of my spectrum.

23:49.980 --> 23:55.980
But what if instead I have a secondary amine like N-methylbutylamine?

23:55.980 --> 23:58.980
Well let's watch the spectrum change.

24:01.980 --> 24:05.980
A lot of similarity there in the functional group region but one very crucial change.

24:05.980 --> 24:09.980
There is only one absorbance now in the NH region of the spectrum.

24:09.980 --> 24:15.980
So this tells me that there's only a single NH and therefore only a single vibrational mode,

24:15.980 --> 24:18.980
only a single stretching mode, which can appear.

24:18.980 --> 24:20.980
And the trend continues.

24:20.980 --> 24:28.980
If I move on to a tertiary amine like ethyl diisopropylamine, let's take a look at the spectrum.

24:28.980 --> 24:32.980
Again, the functional group region looks very similar to the others,

24:32.980 --> 24:37.980
except that there are now no NH stretches to be found whatsoever.

24:37.980 --> 24:44.980
So we can not only detect the presence of amines, but we can detect whether they're primary, secondary, or tertiary,

24:44.980 --> 24:47.980
simply using the functional group region of the spectrum.

24:47.980 --> 24:54.980
So the high frequency region of the IR spectrum tells us about the presence or absence of functional groups.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.980
But what about that lower frequency region?

24:56.980 --> 25:03.980
If it's so complex that it defies dissection, why do we bother to collect that information?

25:03.980 --> 25:07.980
Well, we call the low frequency region of the spectrum the fingerprint region,

25:07.980 --> 25:12.980
because just like fingerprints, the complex set of vibrations within the skeleton of a molecule

25:12.980 --> 25:18.980
give it a complex pattern in this region, which is unique to that particular molecule.

25:18.980 --> 25:22.980
So just as a fingerprint can be compared to a reference to identify its owner,

25:22.980 --> 25:29.980
so can the fingerprint region of an IR spectrum be compared to a standard to identify a molecule.

25:29.980 --> 25:34.980
Let's work through a quick example here to see if I can illustrate my point.

25:34.980 --> 25:40.980
I'm going to show you the IR spectra of four different aliphatic esters.

25:40.980 --> 25:47.980
Butylacetate, isobutylacetate, secbutylacetate, and tbutylacetate.

25:47.980 --> 25:51.980
All of these have the same molecular formula, and they all have the same kinds of bonds,

25:51.980 --> 25:57.980
carbon-carbon singles, carbon-hydrogen singles, carbonyls, and carbon-oxygen singles.

25:57.980 --> 26:03.980
So when we look at the functional group region of these molecules and try to tell them apart,

26:03.980 --> 26:06.980
we're going to be a little disappointed.

26:06.980 --> 26:08.980
Let's start with butylacetate.

26:08.980 --> 26:12.980
We can break down the spectrum very easily.

26:12.980 --> 26:18.980
2,900 wave numbers means it's aliphatic, lots of carbon-hydrogen bonds with sp3 carbons,

26:18.980 --> 26:24.980
clear presence of a carbonyl, and also the clear presence of a CO single bond.

26:24.980 --> 26:27.980
But what about all these other little absorptions in here?

26:27.980 --> 26:29.980
Are they really useless?

26:29.980 --> 26:30.980
No, they're not.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.980
Because when I switch my spectrum from butylacetate to isobutylacetate,

26:34.980 --> 26:41.980
I want you to keep your eye on the functional group region the first time.

26:41.980 --> 26:43.980
Hardly anything has changed.

26:43.980 --> 26:49.980
So looking at this from a functional group region perspective, the two spectra appear almost identical.

26:49.980 --> 26:53.980
Let me go back again to butylacetate.

26:53.980 --> 26:58.980
All the same maxima, all the same peaks, and essentially the same frequencies.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.980
So could we tell them apart from one another?

27:00.980 --> 27:04.980
And the answer, of course, is yes, as long as I have a reference spectrum.

27:04.980 --> 27:08.980
If I know the specific pattern that occurs in the functional group region,

27:08.980 --> 27:12.980
take a look at this now as I change the fingerprint region, excuse me.

27:12.980 --> 27:19.980
Take a look at the fingerprint region as I switch the spectrum back to isobutylacetate once more.

27:19.980 --> 27:21.980
We see some specific changes now.

27:21.980 --> 27:31.980
If I switch to secbutylacetate, even greater difference, moving over to tbutylacetate, even more variability.

27:31.980 --> 27:37.980
So even though I can't dissect every peak there and break them all down into their individual vibrational modes,

27:37.980 --> 27:41.980
in the case of the fingerprint region of the spectrum, I don't have to,

27:41.980 --> 27:50.980
because I can always go to a data library just like the AIST and compare it to the data that I see when I run my experiment.

27:50.980 --> 27:55.980
So let's summarize what we've learned about FTIR spectroscopy today.

27:55.980 --> 27:59.980
We talked about what lies beyond the red portion of the visible spectrum,

27:59.980 --> 28:06.980
a form of radiation with lower energy than red light, earning it the name InfraRed.

28:06.980 --> 28:11.980
We took a brief look at the layout of a very basic IR spectrophotometer,

28:11.980 --> 28:16.980
and how, just like UV visible spectrophotometers, they split and compare light beams

28:16.980 --> 28:22.980
which pass through reference cells and sample cells to determine the transmittance of a sample.

28:22.980 --> 28:25.980
We looked at molecular structures in a new light as well,

28:25.980 --> 28:29.980
not as a rigid construct of ideal bond lengths and angles,

28:29.980 --> 28:34.980
but as a dynamic, vibrating framework with many degrees of freedom for its atoms to move,

28:34.980 --> 28:39.980
and therefore its bonds to stretch and bend.

28:39.980 --> 28:44.980
We covered how these vibrations tend to have frequencies corresponding to those of InfraRed photons,

28:44.980 --> 28:49.980
and these photons can be absorbed when they encounter a bond vibrating at that frequency,

28:49.980 --> 28:54.980
as long as the vibration causes a change in the overall dipole of the molecule.

28:54.980 --> 29:00.980
We discussed factors affecting the rates of vibrations in both macroscopic systems and in bonds.

29:00.980 --> 29:06.980
How lighter atoms joined by tighter bonds lead to higher vibrational frequencies.

29:06.980 --> 29:12.980
Of course, this means that hydrogen-containing bonds, as well as double and triple bonds to larger atoms,

29:12.980 --> 29:18.980
tend to appear at the higher frequency end of the IR spectrum, called the functional group region,

29:18.980 --> 29:22.980
while vibrations in the carbon scaffold contribute more to the complex,

29:22.980 --> 29:29.980
but equally useful, fingerprint region in the lower frequencies.

29:29.980 --> 29:34.980
Next time, we'll turn our attention to a phenomenon different from absorbance,

29:34.980 --> 29:39.980
a new form of interaction between light and matter, called optical rotation.

29:39.980 --> 29:42.980
I'll see you then.
