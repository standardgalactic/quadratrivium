0	17360	In the latter part of the 1830s, a desperate businessman by the name of Charles Goodyear
17360	19720	was near the end of his rope.
19720	23840	Having already failed in the hardware business in Philadelphia, he had turned his attention
23840	29000	to a newly available material from Brazil called rubber.
29000	33960	Like many other entrepreneurs at his time, Goodyear believed that this pliable, moldable
33960	39240	substance had enormous potential to be put to work in a number of potentially profitable
39240	40240	applications.
40240	44200	But there were some problems.
44200	50880	Despite its usefulness in waterproofing applications, rubber itself was very soft, pliable, and
50880	56760	tended to deform plastically, meaning that once pulled or otherwise misshapen, it retained
56760	58000	the new shape.
58880	63000	Now Goodyear had worked with natural rubber for about a half a decade, seeking out ways
63000	66880	to strengthen it so that it could be used to produce objects which could be molded into
66880	74240	a desired shape, but would then retain that shape across a great range of conditions.
74240	79320	As seems to usually be the case with great discoveries, Goodyear's breakthrough was reached
79320	81520	quite by accident.
81520	86680	There are several variations of the story, but the most inspirational is this.
86680	91560	Being nearly bankrupt, Goodyear had attempted to remove paint from one of his rubber samples
91560	93520	for reuse.
93520	98200	To do this, he tried using nitric acid.
98200	102880	He noticed that after removing the paint with nitric acid, the properties of his rubber
102880	106080	sample had changed.
106080	111160	He realized then that treatment with various other materials might alter the structure
111160	118400	of rubber, or even become incorporated into it, changing its properties for the better.
118400	122720	Now Goodyear wasn't much of a chemist, so he had to rely on blind trial and error to
122720	126040	concoct his modified rubber materials.
126040	134240	Being readily available and inexpensive, one of the modifiers he tried was elemental sulfur.
134240	139120	Now as the story goes, Goodyear walked into the general store in the town of Woburn, Massachusetts,
139120	140760	where he was then living.
140760	144800	It was then that he accidentally dropped a sample of his latest sulfur-treated rubber
144800	148320	concoction onto a pot-bellied stove.
148320	156040	In the ensuing charred mess, he noticed that some of that material's properties had changed.
156040	160040	Goodyear later worked out a more controlled process for producing the material he had
160040	163400	first observed in the aftermath of his accident.
163400	168560	And he finally settled on a method for production by steam-heating a mixture of natural rubber
168640	170840	with sulfur.
170840	175840	His new material was first used by his brother-in-law to induce the then sought-after ruffles in
175840	180400	the fabrics of men's shirts.
180400	184880	Now it turns out that Goodyear wasn't only limited in his chemistry skills.
184880	188320	He didn't fare too well in the world of business either.
188320	192960	Goodyear managed to obtain an American patent for his new material, but he failed to seize
192960	195960	the same opportunity in the British market.
195960	201480	It was an English entrepreneur and a competitor of Goodyear's by the name of Thomas Hancock,
201480	206120	who reverse engineered his invention from one of Goodyear's own samples and obtained
206120	208120	the British patent.
208120	213400	Shortly thereafter, one of Hancock's associates coined the term vulcanized rubber, naming
213400	216680	the material for the Roman god of fire.
216680	222120	Perhaps some would say that Hermes, Roman god of thieves, would have been a better namesake.
222120	227600	So vulcanized rubber became not just a world-changing material from which many durable rubber products
227600	233600	could be made, but also one of the first artificially modified polymers in human history.
236880	241440	Polymers are defined as a very large set of molecules consisting of repeating units
241440	243960	known as monomers.
243960	249640	We've already looked at some biologically relevant polymers, including DNA, RNA, proteins
249640	251720	and starches.
251720	256080	But Goodyear's invention is noteworthy because it may have represented the first semi-synthetic
256080	258960	polymer created by man.
258960	264000	But it wasn't long after that that German apothecary by the name of Edward Simon managed
264000	270000	to create a substance with similar properties, not by modifying an existing natural polymer,
270000	276520	but from individual molecules of styrene, he treated to induce polymerization.
277360	282720	Now, by no fault of his own, Simon lacked the insight to fully understand what he had
282720	284480	just done.
284480	288560	He only knew that heating styrene led to a material with properties very similar to
288560	290400	rubber.
290400	293560	This observation went largely unnoticed.
293560	297640	To those who did notice, the simplest explanation was that he had created a conglomerate of
297640	303640	small molecules held together in aggregates by intermolecular forces.
303640	308600	After all, the creation of a covalent molecule with thousands upon thousands of atoms was
308600	310280	not a reasonable explanation.
310280	314120	That could never happen, right?
314120	320160	It was nearly a century later that Simon's countryman, Hermann Staudinger, finally elucidated
320160	322760	the structure of Simon's creation.
322760	327960	It took some outside-of-the-box thinking to finally understand Simon's material.
327960	333200	Staudinger finally postulated publicly that the heated styrene molecules had reacted with
333200	337320	themselves to create immense molecules of great size.
337320	343320	Staudinger's initial efforts to reach this idea, or to research this idea, were met with
343320	345720	remarkable skepticism.
345720	350040	He found it difficult to secure the support of his colleagues, who all believed rubbers
350040	356640	were aggregates of small molecules stuck together by some messy non-covalent force.
356640	361560	Even the eminent Hermann M. L. Fisher went on record against Staudinger's theories.
362240	365280	But Staudinger stood fast, and it's a good thing that he did.
365280	367800	His theory proved true.
367800	374280	And having fought the good fight to prove it, he received his Nobel Prize in 1953.
374280	381240	Ultimately, it was realized that styrene molecules had been joined together through their vinyl
381240	386560	groups, creating carbon chains with hundreds or even thousands of atoms.
387560	392320	With the benefit of 100 years of additional insight, and his willingness to continue supporting
392320	397880	his theory in the face of substantial opposition, Staudinger's theory of polymers, which he
397880	402840	referred to as macromolecules, ultimately had proven true.
405200	410800	Since the days of Staudinger's work, a tremendous amount of attention has been poured into understanding,
410800	414560	designing, and creating useful polymers.
414560	419680	From the tires on your car, to the man-made fibers in some clothing, to medical equipment,
419680	424880	body armor, food packaging, and even more, the importance of synthetic polymers to our
424880	429920	modern lifestyles simply cannot be overstated.
429920	435280	So in this lecture, we're going to take a short survey of polymer chemistry, how polymers
435280	440080	are designed, how they're made, and a few ways in which they've changed the world.
440080	447880	Synthetic polymers are classified in more than one way, but a typical method is to
447880	451480	distinguish them based upon how they're prepared.
451480	455960	From this perspective, most polymers fall into one of two general classes.
455960	462240	Addition polymers, also called chain growth polymers, or condensation polymers, sometimes
462240	464920	called step growth polymers.
464920	468560	So let's take a look at each of those classes one at a time.
468560	474600	The first class of polymers based upon their synthesis are addition polymers, also called
474600	476440	chain growth.
476440	481120	Now any polymer will be constructed from a set of small molecules known as monomers.
481120	487520	Now I've represented my monomers here as simply these red objects that are going to do the
487520	494040	chemistry that we would expect of a molecule, which is very small, but is a monomer.
494040	498040	To this, we're going to add another type of molecule called an initiator.
498040	502840	That's because in the case of addition polymers, my individual monomers are not reactive in
502840	505160	and of themselves.
505160	509240	But in the presence of an initiator, my monomer can react.
509240	514480	And only when attached to the chain will that new monomer become reactive again, sequestering
514480	518240	more and more of the monomer to the chain.
518240	523620	In short, addition polymers grow from one end to the other in a fashion much like this.
523620	528300	So their sizes are very predictable and very easy to manipulate.
528300	534220	A classic example of an addition polymer are those formed from alkene subunits, trading
534220	539660	less stable pi bonds for the new sigma bonds which link them together.
539660	546340	The first entirely synthetic polymer, polystyrene, falls into this class of compounds.
546340	553380	The process of creating addition polymers consists of three phases, the initiation, the propagation,
553380	554380	and the termination.
554380	561340	In the case of polystyrene, polymerization reaction can be initiated when a sample of
561340	568900	styrene is heated in the presence of just a small amount of benzoil peroxide.
568900	574860	Now the heat causes the benzoil peroxide to dissociate into two phenyl radicals, a process
574860	579720	encouraged by the loss of carbon dioxide gas.
579720	582380	In the second step, propagation.
582380	587460	As each monomer encounters the reactive radical at the end of a chain, a new sigma bond is
587460	592380	formed homogenically, meaning one electron from each side.
592380	596140	This regenerates the radical at the end of the lengthening chain and perpetuates the
596140	598140	reaction.
598140	605020	In the case of polystyrene, this process repeats itself several thousand times before the third
605020	608900	phase, termination takes place.
608900	614400	In termination, either two growing radicals react with one another or something of that
614400	620200	like forming one last sigma bond which will ultimately consume the radicals without generating
620200	624160	a new one.
624160	628280	Addition polymers are very attractive targets for commercial materials because their properties
628280	633520	can be turned or tuned by controlling the overall size of the macromolecules produced
633520	635840	in the chain growth reaction.
635840	640540	For example, the size of the polystyrene polymer molecules can be controlled simply
640540	646980	by altering the relative amount of benzoil peroxide initiator which is added.
646980	652460	Relatively fewer benzoil peroxide molecules means fewer growing chains.
652460	656740	And because growth can only take place at the end of an initiated chain, one expects
656740	660940	to obtain longer polymers in this kind of scenario.
661840	666760	Additionally, fewer growing chains means less likelihood that two growing chains will encounter
666760	669160	one another in a termination step.
669160	673960	Some other examples of addition polymers include polyethylene used in plastic bottles formed
673960	678040	by the addition of ethene monomers to one another.
678040	683520	Polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, most well known as a substitute for metal plumbing pipes,
683520	688960	is assembled in a similar reaction using vinyl chloride monomers.
688960	696900	Even the once popular cookware coating Teflon is formed by polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene.
696900	701580	Now let's take a look at the second class of polymers, condensation polymers, also
701580	705620	sometimes called step growth polymers.
705620	712260	This has become a very popular class of polymers because they're relatively easy to make.
712260	717980	Condensation polymers form, again, through conjoining, more than one, obviously, monomers,
717980	721000	we want long chains, so we need lots and lots of monomers.
721000	726080	But in the case of condensation polymers, each monomer itself is reactive without any
726080	728520	initiator necessary.
728520	733400	So in the case of condensation polymers, rather than having an initiator dictate when and
733400	741320	where monomers can join together, my monomers can really join together anywhere at any time.
741320	747860	So in this case, I have a growing set of ever larger and larger polymers forming as my
747860	752160	monomers become dimers, which can condense with other monomers or dimers, and so on and
752160	753680	so on.
753680	758980	But you'll notice that in this process, I get a wide variety of lengths in my polymers
758980	760480	as they grow.
760480	765880	So although condensation polymers are very easy to make, they are very difficult to control
765880	768800	from a polymer length standpoint.
768800	773600	Now generally, condensation polymers differ from addition polymers in that their growth
773600	779580	is not driven by trading of pi bonds for sigma bonds, but by the formation of small molecule
779580	783740	byproducts like water or hydrochloric acid.
783740	790260	A perfect example of this is the formation of nylon-6, in which molecules of 6-aminohexanoic
790260	796980	acid are joined together in a reaction which produces not only an amide union between monomers,
796980	802420	but also a molecule of water as a byproduct.
802700	807400	So far in this lecture, I've shown examples of polymerization reactions in which only
807400	813960	one type of monomer is used, leading to very simple, repeating structures of that monomer.
813960	820440	Make no mistake, polymers like polystyrene, PVC, and nylon-6 are extremely valuable and
820440	822440	useful materials.
822440	828040	But we can significantly increase the complexity and therefore the tuneability of polymers
828040	832280	if we use more than one monomer in the process.
832300	836900	When we use more than one monomer to create a polymer, we call the class of compounds
836900	839180	created copolymers.
839180	843620	So the examples I'm going to show here are using only two different monomers, but we
843620	849420	could just as easily have three or four or any number of different monomers.
849420	853980	Now copolymers can be constructed using either one of our two major mechanisms for building
853980	859260	a polymer, so they're not necessarily chain growth or step growth polymers.
859260	862920	But what is true is that when I have a collection of monomers like this one where I have indicated
862920	868360	one monomer in red and one monomer in blue, they can combine in several different geometric
868360	874080	relationships, each of which can lead to a polymer with different properties.
874080	878360	Possibly the simplest example of this is what we would call an alternating copolymer, in
878360	884160	which each monomer is spaced with two of the other monomers around it, so red, blue, red,
884160	888240	blue, red, blue, all the way across.
888240	893340	The second arrangement would be what we would call a random copolymer, in which the order
893340	900700	of each monomer within the overall chain is completely statistically random.
900700	905980	A third potential arrangement is what we call a block copolymer.
905980	911740	In a block copolymer, long stretches of a certain type of monomer exist, which are then
911740	919240	punctuated by long stretches of the other monomer or monomers within the copolymer.
919240	924800	And as one last example of a type of structure that copolymers can form, we have something
924800	931160	called a graft copolymer, in which one of the monomers serves to form the backbone while
931160	936120	the other decorates that backbone by branching away from it.
936120	941660	So an alternating polymer that we're familiar with is produced when vinyl chloride and
941660	947860	vinylidine chloride react in a radical chain growth polymerization.
947860	954040	In this reaction, monomers add in an alternating order, with vinyl chloride monomers reacting
954040	959880	at initiated vinylidine termini and vinylidine chloride monomers reacting at initiated vinyl
959880	963420	chloride termini.
963420	967340	The result is an alternating polymer called saran.
967340	971620	This is the polymer used to make the very popular food wrap which bears its name.
971620	973500	Isn't that remarkable?
973500	978620	Just one additional chlorine atom on every other monomer unit, and we go from PVC, which
978620	986220	is used in plumbing, to saran wrap, which is very flexible and is used as a food wrap.
986220	992140	But alternating polymers can just as easily be produced using condensation polymerizations.
992140	1000660	One example of this is the polymer nylon 6-6, not to be confused with nylon 6.
1000660	1010700	Nylon 6-6 is prepared using equal parts of adipic acid and 1-6 hexane diamine.
1010700	1016180	By producing nylon in this way, the orientation of alternating amide bonds is reversed from
1016180	1018780	those in nylon 6.
1018780	1024060	In fact, it would be more accurate to say that the amide bonds in nylon 6 are reversed
1024060	1030340	since nylon 6-6 was actually the first of these to be prepared and patented by DuPont
1030340	1033100	in 1935.
1033100	1038740	The development of the homopolymer nylon 6 by BASF was an attempt to produce a material
1038740	1044900	with similar properties, which didn't infringe on DuPont's intellectual property.
1044900	1050460	In fact, both of these polymers were a huge success and are still used today as the backbone
1050460	1058020	for some of the most modern materials produced by both companies.
1058020	1064100	Random copolymers are produced by mixing monomers, but unlike alternating copolymers, growing
1064100	1069580	random copolymers can incorporate any of the monomers in any order, leading to a statistically
1069580	1073740	random distribution of monomers in the molecule.
1073740	1080300	An example of a random copolymer is polybutyrate, which is a polyester compound, built from
1080300	1083180	two distinct subunits.
1083180	1087020	The distinction here is that these subunits are randomly oriented throughout each polymer
1087020	1089620	strand.
1089620	1093860	But what's really special about polybutyrate isn't how it's made, but the fact that its
1093860	1097420	ester bonds make it fully biodegradable.
1097420	1102860	Plastic bags and wraps produced from this flexible, random copolymer are completely deconstructed
1102860	1107820	by moisture and microbes in the ground, making it a popular choice for disposable items of
1107820	1112260	this kind.
1112260	1115820	One of the more exciting advances in more recent decades has been the development of
1115820	1121700	block copolymers, which aim to exploit the best properties of more than one polymer by
1121700	1126940	linking together large regions of each, which we call domains.
1126940	1133180	For example, the block copolymer SBS is used in many modern applications, including tires
1133180	1135820	and running shoe soles.
1135820	1142460	SBS stands for polystyrene butadiene styrene.
1142460	1149060	So in a single molecule of this block copolymer, a domain of polybutadiene is sandwiched in
1149060	1154780	between two polystyrene domains.
1154780	1160580	The polystyrene blocks give this polymer great toughness, while the polybutadiene domain
1160580	1166180	becomes softer under high temperature conditions, allowing the material to be more easily moldable
1166180	1168660	like softer rubbers.
1168660	1172900	The result is a material which behaves more like a plastic at high temperature, but more
1172900	1178820	like vulcanized rubber when cooler, a perfect recipe for manufacturing tires.
1178820	1184420	I think Mr. Goodyear would be proud.
1184420	1190540	Our fourth class, graft copolymers, are characterized by a uniform backbone polymer which is decorated
1190540	1196420	by strands of a different polymer attached covalently along its length.
1196420	1201260	In many cases, graft copolymers can be designed to have certain properties of both polymers
1201260	1203420	which make it up.
1203420	1209660	For example, long polysaccharides like cellulose onto which other polymers are grafted.
1209660	1213700	This has the effect of producing a very large molecule with the properties of those smaller
1213700	1222140	grafted polymers, but retaining the biodegradability of the cellulose backbone.
1222140	1227220	And while we're back on the subject of Mr. Goodyear, let's take a look back at his creation,
1227220	1229780	knowing what we do now about polymers.
1229780	1234460	Natural rubber is a somewhat complex mixture created by trees to defend themselves from
1234460	1236540	wood-eating insects.
1236540	1241820	It has quite a few minor components, but the big player in its chemical properties is this.
1241820	1249020	A polyisoprene macromolecule made on long, unsaturated hydrocarbons, making it very thick
1249020	1253220	and insoluble in water.
1253220	1257820	Now the problem in Goodyear's days is that these polyisoprene macromolecules are only
1257820	1263580	held together by intermolecular dispersion forces stemming from their electron clouds.
1263580	1266300	So let's look at this.
1266300	1271060	These forces are enough to make the molecule viscous, but they can be overcome.
1271060	1278540	So when I pull on my natural rubber molecules, they can slide back and forth on one another.
1278540	1284620	Now what Goodyear had accomplished by the addition of sulfur was to cross-link the polymer molecules
1284620	1287180	with covalent bonds to sulfur.
1287180	1290500	So let me pull that polymer back together here.
1290500	1296980	So some of these pi bonds within the rubber were replaced by a sulfur bridge.
1296980	1301820	So we'll put in a few sulfur bridges, and now let's pull on that polymer again and see
1301820	1303340	if it deforms.
1303340	1308940	I can deform the polymer, but as soon as I release it, it snaps back into place.
1308940	1313700	This is because of the bridging solfers.
1313700	1318260	So the presence of these cross-links is what gives vulcanized rubber its toughness and
1318260	1323140	ability to retain its shape, exactly what you would hope for in a product like an automobile
1323140	1324700	tire.
1324700	1330060	It also, unfortunately, makes the material very difficult to deconstruct, meaning that
1330060	1335700	vulcanized rubbers are very difficult to recycle.
1335700	1338260	Now this is the reason that tire yards exist.
1338260	1343980	For many decades, non-biodegradable, non-recyclable vulcanized rubber tires were simply piled
1343980	1348260	up in huge tire yards with no obvious fate.
1348260	1352640	Today we do our best to reuse vulcanized rubber by cutting or chipping it into smaller pieces
1352640	1355980	for use in paving projects and other applications.
1355980	1360580	But melting and reforming vulcanized rubber is simply not possible.
1360580	1370120	So truly recycling a tire by making it into another tire is not a viable strategy.
1370120	1374480	Yet another common polymer motif is polycarbonates.
1374480	1379360	These polymers are found in materials as tough and rigid as bulletproof glass, and as soft
1379360	1382820	and supple as commercial water bottles.
1382820	1388420	Both of these products are made from the condensation of carbonic acid with bisphenol A to form
1388420	1390700	an alternating copolymer.
1390700	1396060	Recently, concern has arisen over the possibility that these polymers can hydrolyze back into
1396060	1401060	their starting materials over time, leaching bisphenol A into the water or beverage that
1401060	1404420	they contain.
1404420	1409180	The reason for so much concern is mounting evidence that bisphenol A imitates estradiol
1409180	1413800	in the body, potentially causing developmental or reproductive problems in those who are
1413800	1417240	exposed to it.
1417240	1423120	Some studies suggest that BPA is less than one-tenthousandth as powerful of a hormone
1423120	1428320	as estradiol is, suggesting that this whole controversy may be overblown.
1428320	1434480	Still, we simply don't know what the long-term effects of exposure to low levels of BPA might
1434480	1437040	do.
1437040	1440940	No one is sure exactly what the risks are, but one thing is undeniable.
1440940	1445260	Many people are sufficiently wary of BPA that they are willing to purchase products
1445260	1453700	labeled BPA-free without giving much thought to what's actually in the product.
1453700	1458580	The polymers industry has responded to these concerns by offering BPA-free plastics with
1458580	1460820	a great deal of fanfare.
1460820	1462700	Sounds great, doesn't it?
1462700	1467720	So what they don't tell you is that most of these products are still polycarbonates,
1467720	1475760	which are simply made using molecules like bisphenol S or bisphenol F in place of bisphenol
1475760	1479160	A in an analogous reaction.
1479160	1484560	Now if there is concern over a molecule like bisphenol A imitating estradiol, something
1484560	1490560	tells me it's only a matter of time until bisphenol S, F, and others come under similar
1490580	1497340	scrutiny, putting us right back where we were before.
1497340	1501980	One last hot button plastics issue that you may have heard of is the use of compounds
1501980	1505100	called phthalates.
1505100	1510100	Phthalic acid is a small organic diacid which looks like this.
1510100	1514900	It's easily esterified with a number of aliphatic alcohols to produce small molecules called
1514900	1517780	phthalates.
1517780	1523000	Phthalates like this dibutal phthalate are sometimes added to polyvinyl chloride to soften
1523000	1528800	the plastic enough to make it useful over a wider range of applications.
1528800	1535080	Now plasticizers work by disrupting the packing of polymer chains, in this case in the PVC,
1535080	1538000	thereby softening it.
1538000	1543160	That new car smell that so much of us enjoy is caused by these plasticizers escaping the
1543160	1548780	newly prepared plastics into the air.
1548780	1555280	Now it's worth mentioning that polyethylene tetrothalate, commonly called P-E-T-E, is
1555280	1560700	used in food packaging and does not contain isolated phthalate molecules at all.
1560700	1566580	The phthalate portion of P-E-T-E's name refers to the monomer which is condensed in the prepared
1566580	1568220	polymer.
1568220	1573220	So in this case the phthalate is locked securely in the matrix of this non-biodegradable plastic
1573220	1576240	where it can't easily be released.
1576240	1580680	So P-E-T-E doesn't release phthalates into the environment even though phthalate is in
1580680	1586760	its name and PVC very often does release phthalates even though the term phthalate is nowhere to
1586760	1591360	be found in its name.
1591360	1597240	So in this lecture we grazed the surface of nearly 200 years of synthetic polymer chemistry.
1597240	1601260	Starting with the accidental vulcanization of rubber by Charles Goodyear during a clumsy
1601260	1605100	moment in 1830s Massachusetts.
1605100	1610740	We talked about the two major classes of polymerization reactions, addition and condensation, also
1610740	1618940	called chain growth polymerization and step growth polymerization respectively.
1618940	1624380	We saw how chain growth usually involves the reaction of alkene subunits with an activated
1624400	1629120	growing polymer chain until termination takes place.
1629120	1634640	Specifically we took a look at radical polymerization which is initiated by the dissociation of
1634640	1640200	a small bit of benzoyl peroxide to initiate chain growth.
1640200	1645160	By contrast condensation polymers tend to proceed with the formation of small molecules
1645160	1650960	as monomers, dimers, trimmers, tetramers and more and condense with one another forming
1650980	1656980	ever larger chains until the reagents are exhausted.
1656980	1662060	We then took a different view on polymers, classifying them not based upon the reaction
1662060	1668180	which makes them, but the morphology of the polymer chains themselves, including homopolymers
1668180	1673300	and the many layers of complexity added when copolymers come into play.
1673300	1679060	We saw the alternating copolymer saran and the random copolymer polybutyrate, both of
1679080	1685080	which blend monomers closely together, usually forming a polymer with totally new properties.
1685080	1692080	Then we considered how graft copolymers and block copolymers can preserve certain properties
1692080	1697480	of each homopolymer from which they are derived, helping chemists to design polymers perfectly
1697480	1700480	suited to an intended application.
1700480	1705960	Finally, we looked at a few recent concerns regarding popular polymers, including the
1705960	1711860	estrogen emulating bisphenol compounds used in polycarbonates and the use of plasticizers
1711860	1715260	like phthalates.
1715260	1720780	Of course what we saw in this lecture is just a small slice of polymer chemistry, a field
1720780	1726660	made incredibly diverse by not only the vast library of monomers and linking motifs, but
1726660	1731380	by the sheer titanic size of the molecules involved.
1731380	1736380	So macromolecules bring us to a fitting end to our survey of organic compounds in their
1736380	1739120	reactions.
1739120	1744360	In our next few lessons, we're going to focus not on how new compounds are made and put to
1744360	1748960	use, but on how they are identified.
1748960	1753000	Organic chemists use a very special set of techniques to be their eyes as they navigate
1753000	1758400	the long and sometimes complex road to an effective synthesis, and no organic chemistry
1758400	1761780	course is complete without it.
1761780	1765220	We'll begin to develop an understanding of the techniques that have been used to verify
1765220	1768500	so much of the information that I've already given you.
1768500	1773300	From identifying specific functional groups, to discerning regioisomers and enantiomers
1773300	1779740	of small molecules, to determining full protein structures, spectroscopy is the tool that lets
1779740	1782660	us observe the fruits of our labor in the lab.
1782660	1786660	It's an exciting science in its own right, and it will be the topic of our next few lectures.
1786660	1788160	And I'll see you for those soon.
