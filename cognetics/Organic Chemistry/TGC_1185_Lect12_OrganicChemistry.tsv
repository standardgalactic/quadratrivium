0	14920	Let's get back to one of my favorite stories.
14920	21000	The years 1870, and in the laboratories of Alexander Butlarov at the University of Kazan,
21000	25920	are working two men who will become arguably the two most prolific chemical researchers
25920	27720	of the coming decade.
27720	31320	Vladimir Markovnikov and Alexander Zetsev.
31320	34200	Now Markovnikov and Zetsev have little love for one another.
34200	38360	Their mutual contempt is driving these two men to forge ahead in their research in the
38360	43520	hopes of not only making a name for themselves, but of one upping the other.
43520	47880	We've already seen how one of their most prominent battlegrounds was the chemistry
47880	53640	of alkyl halides and alkenes, both how they're made and how they react.
53640	57200	During our lecture on alkenes, I told you about Zetsev's great victory in the debate
57200	59280	over alkene stability.
59280	63280	But I chose to show you how modern chemists go about proving his rule.
63280	67280	By the end of the day today, we'll have all the necessary understanding to survey the
67280	73000	reactions Zetsev himself used, one of the principle methods of producing alkenes, elimination
73000	79720	reactions.
79720	84080	Alkyl halides and other compounds containing good leaving groups need not necessarily undergo
84080	86560	substitution reactions.
86560	91960	There's another class of reactions in which these types of compounds often participate.
91960	97200	Now instead of substituting a new group in place of the leaving group, a pi bond is formed
97200	103760	by the loss of an adjacent proton, which we call the beta proton.
103760	107440	Elimination reactions always proceed with the production of a byproduct formed by the
107440	112400	leaving group, but they don't consume a nucleophile in the process.
112400	117360	So in contrast to substitution reactions, which are entropically neutral, elimination
117360	123140	reactions actually proceed with a pretty significant increase in entropy, because they're making
123140	126000	two or more molecules from one.
126000	130360	Now this is a good thing, because the exchange of sigma bonds for a pi bond means that the
130360	134320	enthalpy of this reaction is not usually favorable.
134320	139160	So elimination reactions are driven by factors like increased heat and time, as well as the
139160	144160	formation of stable leaving groups and alkene products.
144160	148580	Eliminations are always a possibility and are usually competing pathways in substitution
148580	150080	reactions.
150080	159000	It's when this competing pathway becomes dominant that we call the reaction an elimination.
159000	163120	So just as we did with substitution, let's start from the very beginning.
163120	167600	Let's limit ourselves to only the knowledge available to Markovnikov and Zetsev in the
167960	174360	1870s and consider exactly how elimination reactions might take place.
174360	177960	Completing an elimination reaction requires that two things be removed from the starting
177960	184080	material, a stable leaving group and a beta proton from an adjacent carbon.
184080	189760	Zetsev's theory that more substituted alkenes would form in these reactions proved true.
189760	195200	Markovnikov instead hung his hat on a theory called microscopic reversibility.
195200	200040	Having observed that alkyl halides of low substitution could be used to prepare alkenes,
200040	205200	he theorized that reversing the reaction should produce the original starting material.
205200	210880	But Markovnikov and Zetsev lacked the tools to probe these mechanisms much, if at all.
210880	214960	Decades later it was our friend Christopher Engeld who once again left his mark on organic
214960	220400	chemistry by recognizing that there were three potential mechanisms which he had to consider.
220520	225520	The first of these three possibilities would involve having the base abstract the proton
225520	230480	from our alkyl halide's beta carbon to initiate the reaction, so first the base will take
230480	235080	the proton, then the remainder of the reaction will complete.
235080	239680	If I do this, I have to go through an intermediate called the carbanion which then undergoes
239680	245240	the remainder of the reaction, losing the leaving group to form the new alkene.
245240	249880	The problem with this particular mechanism is that our base is trying to abstract a
249880	253720	proton from something with a pKa of about 50.
253720	259680	And you'll recall from our lecture on alkenes and alkynes that pKa's of 44, like those
259680	262520	in an alkene, are considered to be prohibitive.
262520	266640	So in this case with a pKa of 50, it's simply not possible.
266640	271840	The substrate is just not acidic enough.
271840	274680	But we still have two more possibilities.
274680	276840	So let's take a look at another one.
276840	281640	How about a reaction in which the base abstracts that beta proton at the same time as departure
281640	285600	of the leaving group and the formation of the pi bond?
285600	291000	If this all takes place in a single concerted step, we avoid that very unstable conjugate
291000	292240	base.
292240	295600	So this is a very viable reaction mechanism.
295600	299160	And if this were a reaction mechanism that we're taking place, since it happens in a
299160	305040	single step, we expect its rate law to involve both the concentration of the base and the
305040	307600	concentration of the substrate.
307600	313160	In other words, this is a second order elimination engulfed called these E2 mechanisms.
313160	318760	The third possibility would involve the departure of the leaving group before the base abstracts
318760	319760	the proton.
319760	324480	In other words, we're going to go through a carbocation intermediate.
324480	329440	This carbocation intermediate can then act as an acid protonating our base and leading
329440	331360	to products.
331360	335600	This is also a perfectly viable mechanism, as we're well aware carbocation is frequently
335600	338000	formed from alkyl halides.
338000	342880	So in this case, because the rate limiting step occurs before the base reacts with the
342880	348720	acidic proton, the rate law should only contain the substrate concentration.
348720	354800	In other words, this is a first order elimination or an E1 reaction.
354800	359520	So just as in the case of substitution, we're left pondering two believable mechanisms for
359520	365240	the elimination of an alkyl halide to form an alkene, one with a rate dependent only
365240	372880	on substrate concentration and another dependent on both substrate and base concentration.
372880	374240	So which is correct?
374240	380400	Well, just as with substitution, the conditional answer here is both.
380400	385120	Engle realized that in each potential reaction mechanism was a base accepting a beta proton
385120	386880	from the substrate.
386880	390600	But in one mechanism, the base participates in the rate limiting step while in the other,
390600	391840	it did not.
391840	403080	And again, kinetic studies were the key to unlocking the rules governing these two mechanisms.
403080	408080	Let's begin with the E2 reaction pathway, which involves simultaneous deprotonation
408080	410840	and leaving group departure.
410840	415800	In our previous lecture, we defined nucleophiles as electron rich species, which have high
415840	423040	negative charge density and lone pair electrons to donate in heterogenic bond formation.
423040	426560	You may recall that in an earlier lecture, we mentioned another type of reagent which
426560	429920	has a very similar set of properties, right?
429920	431560	Lewis bases.
431560	437160	So if nucleophiles and bases have similar properties, is it possible for a nucleophile
437160	439000	to act as a base?
439000	441800	And the answer is yes.
441800	445640	You may also recall from our last lecture that SN2 reactions take place when strong
445640	450200	nucleophiles attack a substrate of low substitution from the backside.
450200	456280	A natural question to follow that observation is, what happens if the nucleophile is strong,
456280	464400	like hydroxide, but the substrate is of high substitution, like t-butyl chloride?
464400	466560	The answer to this question should be clear.
466560	473160	The nucleophile unable to attack the obstructed electrophile is not going to wait to react.
473160	478720	When nucleophilic attack isn't possible, it will instead react as a base.
478720	482840	The protonation of the beta carbon seems like the next best alternative to satiate these
482840	485040	very reactive species.
485040	489720	But we already know simple deprotonation would be a highly disfavored reaction because of
489720	494560	the high pKa of the alkyl halide beta protons.
494560	498440	But there's a second process which can be coupled to the proton removal, that's the
498440	500320	departure of the leaving group.
500320	504800	And it's the simultaneous removal of the beta proton, departure of the leaving group, and
504800	510720	formation of a new double bond, which all come together to form a single step process
510720	515360	resulting in the formation of an alkene.
515360	519520	Now a beta proton, which is at opposition to the leaving group, is the one which will
519520	520520	be removed.
521040	526240	Remember leaving groups and second order reactions depart when electrons move in from the backside
526240	529000	of the electrophilic carbon.
529000	534760	In order to accomplish this in an E2 substrate, the bond holding the acidic proton has to
534760	541040	be on the backside of the molecule relative to the leaving group.
541040	546960	This orientation is only achieved when the beta proton has a 180 degree dihedral angle
546960	549160	relative to the leaving group.
549160	553080	We call this orientation of substituents anti-coplanar.
553080	558600	Fortunately, in this saturated alkyl halide, the bond joining the electrophilic carbon
558600	563560	and the beta carbon has free rotation, so it can easily achieve this arrangement, allowing
563560	566080	the E2 reaction to take place.
566080	570080	So in this case, we form 2-methylpropene.
570080	579480	Now let's consider a different situation, which might lead to a first order reaction.
579480	585120	One in which an alkyl halide of high substitution is placed in the presence of a very weak base.
585120	590320	In a situation like this, any elimination which might occur would likely fall into the
590320	593200	E1 class of reactions.
593200	598920	Now by very weak base, I mean a species which can accept a proton only under extreme conditions.
598920	603760	Usually this means a neutral compound such as a molecule of solvent, or one which is
603760	609120	negatively charged but has lots of resonance to help stabilize that charge, like this dihydrogen
609120	612600	phosphate ion.
612600	618280	So let's consider the same substrate as before, but with a weak nucleophile like water.
618280	623640	In this situation, carbocation should form quite easily from something like t-butyl chloride,
623640	627520	but even so, there's no strong nucleophile to be found.
627520	631240	So what's a carbocation to do?
631240	637320	Under the circumstances, the only way to produce a product is to lose an adjacent proton and
637320	639560	form an alkene.
639560	644560	In the case of t-butyl chloride, the elimination product is exactly the same as that obtained
644560	647920	in our E2 example, but don't be fooled.
647920	652200	We'll soon see some examples in which this is not true.
652200	657100	So you can see the distinguishing property of E1 reactions is that they tend to run best
657100	661540	under acidic conditions where there's no good nucleophile, and at higher temperatures
661540	672180	which favor systems of greater entropy.
672180	677380	One consideration which sets second order elimination, or E2 reactions, apart from second
677380	682960	order substitution, SN2 reactions, is the wide variety of possible products which can
682960	686540	form from the same combination of reagents.
686540	691380	For example, unlike the SN2 pathway, which involves the attack of a nucleophile on the
691380	697300	carbon-bearing the leaving group, giving it only one potential reactive site, the E2 reaction
697300	704120	requires the abstraction of an adjacent proton, of which there may be many.
704120	708700	When I first introduced this mechanism, I was careful to select a t-butyl halide, since
708700	713700	all of its beta protons are equivalent, so eliminates that consideration.
713700	718100	But most substrates for elimination reactions aren't so convenient.
718100	723460	Issues of regiospecificity and stereospecificity will arise quickly.
723460	732060	So let's take a look at this reaction between hydroxide ions and S2 bromo-3-methylbutane.
732060	736100	Now in this case I'm going to have an elimination mechanism take place so that we can observe
736100	739140	the potential products that form.
739140	744380	Now in this case I actually have a substrate which has two different kinds of beta protons.
744380	749060	I have the outside ones here labeled in green on a primary carbon, and I have this more
749060	753420	interior beta proton which is on a tertiary carbon.
753420	758140	So if hydroxide ion is going to act as a base rather than a nucleophile in this situation,
758140	763540	there are two different protons which it can abstract from my alkyl halide.
763540	767860	And depending upon which one it takes, I will get a different structural isomer of the resulting
767860	770300	alkene.
770300	775220	So if the green proton participates in the reaction, I'll get this product.
775220	780700	This particular alkene has three hydrogens and one R-group attached to its functional
780700	782140	group.
782140	787260	But if instead the purple interior proton is abstracted, I'll get the lower product
787260	793260	in which there is one hydrogen and three attached alkyl groups.
793260	797460	So in this case I'm also going to get a little bit of water and bromide ion, but my primary
797460	800540	product is going to be the Zetsev product.
800540	804060	That is the one that's more substituted because we know it to be more stable.
804060	808500	Now in situations like this one, the more substituted alkene product tends to be the
808500	810500	major product of the reaction.
810500	814980	And you'll recall from the alkene lecture that Zetsev's rule states the major product
814980	820660	of an elimination reaction will be the most substituted alkene possible.
820660	826460	So applying Zetsev's rule to our problem of 2-bromo-3-methylbutane with hydroxide gave
826460	832780	us the tri-substituted product in greater abundance than the monosubstituted product.
832780	837340	By extension, Zetsev's rule accurately predicts the major products of these elimination reactions
837340	838740	as well.
838740	842100	But there's one more wrinkle to this story that we have to consider.
842100	847780	You see, we can safely apply Zetsev's rule for E2 reactions when the base is particularly
847780	851660	small like that hydroxide ion was.
851660	856940	The picture, however, can become a bit more complicated when we use bulkier bases like
856940	859580	tbutoxide.
859580	865540	When we attempt to react tbutoxide with 2-bromo-3-methylbutane to obtain an elimination product,
865540	868700	we run into a little snag in predicting what's going to happen.
868700	873780	So here's an example of a reaction between tbutoxide ion and the same substrate as in
873780	877860	our previous example where we used hydroxide as the base.
877860	882980	So just like hydroxide, the tbutoxide ion has a choice of two different protons, which
882980	889340	it can abstract, to form two different structural isomers of the alkene product.
889340	893860	The difference in this situation is that the ratio of these products is flipped over.
893860	895220	It's on its head.
895220	899580	When we do this analysis, we find that we get tbutanol and bromide ion byproducts.
899580	904740	And as the major product, we have our alkene, which has only one R group.
904740	911220	So in this case, we've made more of the antiseptsep product or the Hoffman product.
911220	913220	So the question here is, why did this happen?
913220	919900	Well, the reason that it happened is because this large, bulky tbutoxide base has difficulty
919900	924820	accessing this sterically crowded interior hydrogen.
924820	929420	So more often than not, it simply reacts with its third choice.
929420	933020	Can't get to the electrophilic carbon, can't get to the interior hydrogen.
933020	938140	The only thing left to react with are these protons that are out on the edge of the molecule.
938140	942740	And removing one of those protons results in the formation of the antiseptsep or Hoffman
942740	945940	product.
945940	950540	Now let's consider regiospecificity in the E1 mechanism.
950540	955340	Just as with E2 reactions, we need to be careful to consider how an E1 might produce multiple
955340	958140	products of varying stability.
958140	962540	And we've already established that E1 reactions are expected to proceed through a carbocation
962540	963740	intermediate.
963740	968100	And this has two important influences on the products formed by such a reaction.
968100	974260	First, the carbocation is planar, which means that they form a planar intermediate, making
974260	979980	the even more sterically obstructed beta protons accessible to the weak base.
979980	986500	This means E1 reactions are much less prone to form Hoffman or antiseptsep products.
986500	993420	So the reaction of water with 2-bromo-2-methylbutane forms 2-methyl-2-butene, just as the analogous
993420	995740	E2 reaction.
995740	1000020	But the reaction with t-butanol, a bulky weak base, has little effect.
1000020	1005140	We still get the zets of product as the major species.
1005140	1010300	But there's another consideration which always comes with first-order reactants, carbocation
1010300	1012340	rearrangements.
1012340	1019980	So the reaction of water with 2-bromo-3-4-dimethylpentane will produce a carbocation, which can not
1019980	1025300	only undergo a secondary rearrangement, but will then form the tetra-substituted zetsip
1025300	1026780	product.
1026780	1028540	So take a look at this product.
1028540	1033900	The double bond is not even on the original electrophilic carbon.
1033900	1044660	Now, our explanation of these mechanisms, though, isn't quite complete.
1044660	1049580	See, when we work with elimination reactions, just like with substitution reactions, we
1049580	1054660	must not only consider regiospecificity, but also consider the possible effects on the
1054660	1059300	stereochemistry of products.
1059300	1063300	Since the product of this reaction is an alkene, of course there's no potential for a chiral
1063300	1070460	center to form, but a stereocenter may yet be produced in the form of cis and trans isomers.
1070460	1073360	Take the example of 2-bromo-butane.
1073360	1077780	Because this is a secondary alkyl halide, it can undergo an E2 elimination in the presence
1077780	1084580	of a strong base or an E1 elimination in the presence of a weak one.
1084580	1088580	Let's begin by considering an E2 product, which we might generate with a strong base
1088580	1092460	like t-butoxide or hydroxide.
1092460	1096700	We already know that Zetsev's rule predicts the reaction to take place through deprotonation
1096700	1103680	of the secondary beta proton, leading to a disubstituted alkene, 2-butene, rather than
1103680	1109180	a primary hydrogen, which would lead to a monosubstituted alkene.
1109180	1113740	But the 2-butene products can form two different isomers, cis or trans.
1113740	1118340	Now, each of these products results when we have a different dihedral angle among the
1118340	1121660	methyl and bromine substituents.
1121660	1126460	You might recall that I alluded to this issue when we first introduced Newman projections.
1126460	1132140	Well, here's my Newman projection of S2-bromobutane.
1132140	1138780	I can place this molecule in a reactive position for an E2 by aligning either of the two beta
1138780	1142020	protons anti-coplanar to the bromine.
1142020	1144940	But look at what happens to the methyl substituents.
1144940	1151340	Depending on which rotational state, or rotamer, is adopted, a different beta proton is removed
1151460	1156940	and I get a different arrangement of substituents in the resulting alkene.
1156940	1163100	With methyl groups anti-to-one another, I get the transisomer, or E2-butene.
1163100	1168300	Whereas when the alternative hydrogen is aligned for the E2 reaction, methyl groups are gauche
1168300	1173740	to one another, creating a less stable starting state for the reaction.
1173740	1177900	So as you might guess, the major elimination product is the one formed by the most often
1177900	1185940	sampled reactive rotamer in the starting material, or the E-isomer.
1185940	1190100	But there are instances in which only one isomer is possible for an E2.
1190100	1195460	For example, take S2-bromo R3-methylpentane.
1195460	1199980	If I were to begin with this starting material, a large base like t-butoxide might give me
1199980	1205460	the Hoffman or anti-Zetzep product of which only one isomer exists.
1205500	1210540	But if we use a compact, strong base like hydroxide, there's only one rotameric state
1210540	1214740	which will allow an E2 reaction to take place.
1214740	1219940	As you can see from the Newman projection, the predicted product is actually the Z-isomer
1219940	1222060	of the alkene.
1222060	1229660	E1 reactions are also prone to stereospecificity, but almost always preferentially form E-isomers
1229660	1235180	because carbocation have free rotation, which allows them to adopt the most stable confirmation
1235180	1239740	with large groups at opposition before the elimination completes.
1239740	1251780	So in most cases, this means the E-isomer.
1251780	1255820	So far, we've considered elimination reactions using branched and linear alkyl halides as
1255820	1257940	starting materials.
1257940	1262500	All of these examples have enjoyed free rotation about the bonds between alpha and beta carbons,
1262500	1267180	allowing them to adopt reactive confirmations for E2 reactions.
1267180	1271340	But there's a class of alkyl halide which doesn't have this free rotation.
1271340	1274500	Think about a cyclic alkyl halide.
1274500	1280820	Just as with cyclic alkanes, there is an associated ring strain in smaller cyclic alkyl halides,
1280820	1285300	which means that the carbon-carbon bonds making up the ring can't freely rotate, and this
1285300	1288340	can cause a serious problem.
1289340	1298380	Let's consider the first-order reaction between trans, 1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane, and water.
1298380	1302180	Water is a very weak nucleophile, and our substrate is secondary.
1302180	1306220	So when I react these two with one another, what potential products might I make?
1306220	1312700	Well, the secondary carbocation produced in this E1 reaction can form one of two products,
1312700	1317940	three-methylhexene, or one-methylhexene.
1317940	1324300	But this carbocation can also rearrange by a hydride shift to form a tertiary carbocation,
1324300	1326940	which can also produce one-methylhexene.
1326940	1332260	But also a small amount of methylene-cyclohexane can occur as well.
1332260	1337340	So by switching to an E2 mechanism, using hydroxide, you might be tempted to say that
1337340	1343660	the major product would be one-methylcyclohexane in accordance with Zetzsev's rule.
1343660	1346660	But in this case, there's a problem.
1346660	1351660	The ring restricts rotation of the bond between the alpha and beta carbons, and simply will
1351660	1357740	not allow the tertiary beta proton to achieve the necessary anti-coplanar alignment for
1357740	1360940	the reaction.
1360940	1369620	So this reaction will produce only one elimination product in the form of three-methylcyclohexane.
1369620	1374540	The ability of cyclic alkyl halides to undergo E2 reactions is also severely limited by the
1374540	1381100	need for the halide to be in an axial position for the proper orbital alignments.
1381100	1386940	Consider the two isomers of one T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane.
1386940	1392340	The trans-isomer is essentially incapable of undergoing E2 reactions, because a set of
1392340	1397300	one-three-diaxial interactions is so strong that the molecule simply can't achieve that
1397300	1400660	reactive confirmation.
1400660	1403460	But now take a look at the cis-confirmation.
1403460	1409220	Now that T-butyl group wanting to be equatorial forces the chloride-leaving group into a reactive
1409220	1418780	confirmation, so the order of reactivity with respect to E2 is trans-1-T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane,
1418780	1426020	then chlorocyclohexane, and finally the most reactive is cis-1-T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane.
1434260	1437900	So far I've done my best to keep the world of substitution and elimination reactions
1437900	1442020	separate from one another, showing my best attempts at examples which strongly favor
1442020	1444900	one process or the other.
1444900	1448620	Even so, you might have already noticed that I used the exact same set of reagents to show
1448620	1455620	you SN1 and E1 reactions, so clearly there's a potential here for competition.
1455620	1460500	And the truth is that substitution and elimination reactions go together like coffee and donuts.
1460500	1465980	They are seldom found occurring exclusively, and they often compete with one another.
1465980	1470940	And the key to defining which mechanism will prevail is in the reaction conditions.
1470940	1475860	Now you'll recall that the Gibbs free energy equation is a function of temperature, so
1475860	1481140	the extent to which entropy contributes to a process's spontaneity is a function of
1481140	1482940	temperature.
1482940	1488380	Higher temperature means entropy has a greater role, and as you might expect, increasing
1488380	1494300	temperature makes the increased entropy of the elimination products more favored.
1494300	1499100	So if I have a reaction with competing substitution and elimination pathways, one way to tip the
1499100	1504380	scales in the direction I want is to use a little bit of heat.
1504380	1510220	For example, the reaction of methoxide with tube-romo-3-ethyl pentane forms the substitution
1510220	1513300	product predominantly at room temperature.
1513300	1517740	But there will be more of the 3-ethyl-2-pentene product forming when the reaction is run at
1517740	1520260	elevated temperatures.
1520260	1526540	So if we instead want to maximize the yield of the antiseptic product, 3-ethyl-1-pentene,
1526540	1532140	we can substitute a bulkier base like t-butoxide in place of the methoxide, still running
1532140	1535140	at higher temperatures to encourage elimination.
1535140	1539380	We can actually direct the double bond to the primary carbon by careful selection of
1539380	1542740	the base.
1542740	1548060	The strong bases favor second-order reactions, lower temperatures favor substitution, higher
1548060	1553460	temperatures with small strong bases favor elimination to form the Zetzev product, while
1553460	1566020	higher temperatures with bulky bases tend to favor the antisetzev or Hoffman product.
1566020	1571340	So today we've covered our second major class of organic reaction, eliminations.
1571340	1576020	We got to know Zetzev again, a Russian chemist whose epic power struggle with Markovnikov
1576020	1580620	at the University of Kazan in the 1870s led to much of our understanding about this class
1580620	1583140	of reaction.
1583140	1587860	We saw how elimination takes place when Lewis bases abstract beta protons instead of acting
1587860	1591500	as nucleophiles.
1591500	1597280	We looked at second-order E2 elimination reactions, in which direction takes place with a highly
1597280	1600860	substituted substrate or strong base.
1600860	1606460	We saw how a beta proton in an anticoplanar relationship to the leaving group can be abstracted,
1606460	1611860	causing simultaneous leaving group departure to form an alkene.
1611860	1616660	We also looked at E1 reactions, which take place when there is only a weak non-nucleophilic
1616660	1618700	base present.
1618700	1627060	These reactions progress through a carbocation intermediate, which makes them subject to rearrangements.
1627060	1631220	We took a look at how the strength of the base dictates the order of the reaction.
1631220	1635180	Strong bases for second-order, weaker bases for first-order.
1635180	1639740	We saw how bulky bases combined with more substituted beta carbons can lead to a situation
1639740	1645340	in which Zetzev's rule fails to accurately predict the major product.
1645340	1649880	We also briefly discussed the idea that substitution and elimination frequently compete with one
1649880	1655520	another in the same flask, and how certain reaction conditions, most notably the temperature,
1655520	1659020	can be altered to promote the desired mechanism.
1659020	1664580	We'll see all of these topics applied again as we begin to discuss more specific and complex
1664580	1666620	elimination reactions.
1666620	1672060	But before we can do that, we need to complete the trifecta of major organic reaction types.
1672060	1677420	We still have to consider addition reactions, in which alkenes and alkynes can give up,
1677420	1682300	some are all of their pi bonds, to be converted into a host of useful compounds, from vinyl
1682300	1687040	chlorides used to make plastics to the margarine that you put on your toast this morning.
1687040	1687600	I'll see you then.
