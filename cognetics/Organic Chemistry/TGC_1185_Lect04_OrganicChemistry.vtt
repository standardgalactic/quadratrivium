00:00.000 --> 00:17.520
Welcome back. I hope that our first few lectures on bonding and molecular structure have piqued

00:17.520 --> 00:21.880
your interest in the relationship between those structures and the physical and chemical

00:21.880 --> 00:27.840
properties that they lead to in organic compounds. Of course, observation of these properties

00:27.840 --> 00:33.800
takes time, so we can't just rely on a static snapshot of a structure to tell the whole

00:33.800 --> 00:43.480
story. Let me show you an example. Here I have a molecule called acrolein. Acrolein is a

00:43.480 --> 00:49.040
potent toxin found in cigarette smoke. It's also used in commercial biocides, and its

00:49.040 --> 00:53.400
reactivity is similar to that of formaldehyde, so it finds use as a fixative agent, preserving

00:53.400 --> 01:00.360
biological samples. Now, in textbooks and in papers, acrolein is commonly drawn in this

01:00.360 --> 01:06.600
configuration. And yet, something about this configuration doesn't make sense to us. There's

01:06.600 --> 01:11.800
a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbon-carbon single bond, and a carbon-oxygen double bond

01:11.800 --> 01:17.400
in this molecule, which means the central bond should rotate freely. Yet, when we use

01:17.400 --> 01:21.480
the static structure like this one and try to model its behavior, we see that this kind

01:21.480 --> 01:26.520
of rotation doesn't happen. And so the chemical properties of acrolein, like its boiling point,

01:26.520 --> 01:32.920
its acid-base properties, are all different than the prediction based upon this model.

01:32.920 --> 01:38.400
So we find the carbon-oxygen bond dipole here is actually larger than the structure predicts,

01:38.400 --> 01:44.040
and that electron density around these carbons is not the same. So clearly there's something

01:44.040 --> 01:50.380
going on here that this static model just can't explain. Now, so far we've concerned

01:50.380 --> 01:57.340
ourselves primarily with the drawing of molecular structures, these stationary, unchanging representations

01:57.340 --> 02:03.820
of molecules in their most ideal states. They'll have median bond lengths and angles and dihedrals

02:03.820 --> 02:10.300
just the way that we want them. Now, as useful as it is to have these representations, showing

02:10.300 --> 02:16.220
compounds in their most stable, ideal states, as chemists we're ultimately concerned with

02:16.220 --> 02:21.020
materials physical and chemical properties in the real world, where bonds vibrate, electrons

02:21.020 --> 02:27.340
move through clouds, and those bonds change. So the physical and chemical changes would

02:27.340 --> 02:33.740
be best communicated not by a single ideal representation, but by how the molecule truly

02:33.740 --> 02:41.740
behaves as time passes. So we need to develop a method for communicating how substances behave

02:41.740 --> 02:49.460
and change through time, instead of just a single instantaneous ideal snapshot. We naturally

02:49.460 --> 02:54.540
benefit from a method which is generally accepted by all chemists so that we can give one another

02:54.540 --> 02:59.380
all the information we need to reach a common understanding of chemical processes as well

02:59.380 --> 03:06.180
as physical processes. In this lecture I'll show you how to create drawings which depict

03:06.180 --> 03:10.660
the transfer of electrons from one location to another in order to form and break chemical

03:10.660 --> 03:18.020
bonds. Some of these motions will be intramolecular, meaning they take place within a single molecule,

03:18.020 --> 03:24.580
and others will be intermolecular, meaning that they take place between two or more molecules.

03:24.580 --> 03:31.100
In all cases, the relocation of electrons will result in the formation, alteration, or breaking

03:31.100 --> 03:40.020
of connections between atoms. Get ready, chemistry is about to come alive.

03:40.020 --> 03:45.940
So let's begin with an intramolecular process called resonance. Electrons within an electron

03:45.940 --> 03:50.980
cloud are always in motion, and we've already seen in one of our previous lectures that

03:50.980 --> 03:55.060
pi bonds have a unique ability to form and break without altering the connectivity of

03:55.060 --> 04:00.420
atoms, and since the stronger sigma bonds can remain intact while the weaker pi bonds are

04:00.420 --> 04:06.660
broken. So electron pairs which are not involved in bonding at all, sometimes called lone

04:06.660 --> 04:11.580
pair electrons and pi bonding electrons, can be made more mobile within a molecule's

04:11.580 --> 04:18.180
overall electron cloud. Now these electrons can sometimes occupy a region much larger

04:18.180 --> 04:22.540
than just that defined by a hybrid orbital or an isolated pi bond. They can traverse

04:22.540 --> 04:27.140
great distances across molecules using p orbitals without disrupting the connectivity of the

04:27.140 --> 04:34.140
atoms. These long interconnected systems of p orbitals, sometimes called pi systems.

04:34.140 --> 04:39.180
So as electrons move through the pi systems, no reaction is really taking place, but our

04:39.180 --> 04:44.940
method of drawing an individual structure begins to fail. We're already familiar with

04:44.940 --> 04:50.540
today's acrolein molecule, and I drew it like this just the way that I had represented it

04:50.540 --> 04:55.700
in the model that I showed you previously. But the problem is that the pi electrons in

04:55.700 --> 04:59.940
acrolein want more space. They want to run throughout the molecule, and if given a chance

04:59.940 --> 05:07.260
to do so, that's exactly what they'll do. Now if you look at the acrolein structure,

05:07.260 --> 05:16.020
you'll see many, many sp2 carbons and even an sp2 oxygen all arranged in a row. Now if

05:16.020 --> 05:19.180
I show you the molecule on its side, it'll probably make a little bit more sense what's

05:19.180 --> 05:22.620
happening here. I'm going to take the hydrogens away so it's easier to see, and I'm going

05:22.620 --> 05:30.220
to turn my acrolein molecule. Now these are the p orbitals participating in pi bonding.

05:30.220 --> 05:34.780
So even though I've drawn it here with an isolated pi bond on alternating carbons, the

05:34.780 --> 05:40.820
truth of the matter is that pi system is completely interconnected. So when the bonds are arranged

05:40.820 --> 05:47.900
appropriately so that all p orbitals are aligned, the electrons can run throughout the molecule.

05:47.900 --> 05:52.980
So I need a way to represent acrolein, which is a little bit more realistic. And we do

05:52.980 --> 06:00.100
this by breaking the structure down and drawing every conceivable extreme. For example, here

06:00.100 --> 06:04.700
I have three duplicates of my acrolein structure, but I'm going to alter them, remembering my

06:04.700 --> 06:10.420
rule. Sigma bonds can't break, only pi bonds can move. So let's take a look at what happens

06:10.420 --> 06:14.260
when I do this to my first structure on the left. I'm going to move one pi bond up to

06:14.260 --> 06:19.860
the oxygen, creating a charge separation. In my other one here, I'm going to relocate

06:19.860 --> 06:25.500
both of those pi bonds, one to the oxygen and one to the central carbon-carbon bond,

06:25.500 --> 06:30.340
creating a different kind of charge separation. And my third I'm going to leave exactly as

06:30.340 --> 06:37.260
it was. So these extremes of electron motion that we draw in this type of way are called

06:37.260 --> 06:42.020
resonance contributors. And you'll see this drawn in the chemical literature and in your

06:42.060 --> 06:46.820
textbooks. But what happens when you see that, or at least when a trained chemist does, is

06:46.820 --> 06:53.460
this. They mentally combine all of those resonance contributors into a single resonance hybrid,

06:53.460 --> 06:59.020
which is essentially the weighted average of these three structures. In my resonance

06:59.020 --> 07:04.660
hybrid, I can understand why there is no rotation or limited rotation about that central bond,

07:04.660 --> 07:09.220
because it has a little bit of pi character, which my static structure that I drew originally

07:09.260 --> 07:15.540
would not predict. So this is the utility of thinking more about the motion of electrons

07:15.540 --> 07:22.940
through time than about a single instantaneous snapshot of my molecule. So in that drawing,

07:22.940 --> 07:27.260
I had brackets and straight double-headed arrows, giving me my cue to create the best

07:27.260 --> 07:31.980
possible approximation of acrylene structure. And I did this by mentally combining them

07:31.980 --> 07:36.940
all into that new weighted average called the resonance hybrid. And it will help me

07:36.980 --> 07:42.100
to predict the reactivity and properties of acrylene much better. But it's important to

07:42.100 --> 07:46.580
remember that hybrid is a weighted average, meaning that the contributors with less charge

07:46.580 --> 07:52.180
separation and more ideal electron positions tend to be a closer representation of the hybrid

07:52.180 --> 08:00.500
than their charge-containing counterparts. Now, creating a static depiction of a system

08:00.500 --> 08:05.460
changing through time can be a challenging undertaking, but one which humanity has deemed

08:05.500 --> 08:10.900
worthy since prehistory. Just ask cave painters of Paleolithic Europe and Africa. They tried to

08:10.900 --> 08:15.900
document their hunts with just a few simple markings on a cave wall. Or if you don't have a

08:15.900 --> 08:23.140
time machine, ask any modern-day comic strip author. The comic strip artists try to tell

08:23.140 --> 08:28.860
a story using a storyboard of static images, depicting different moments within the narrative.

08:28.860 --> 08:34.740
And it's up to us as readers to combine these images in our minds to create a seamless running

08:34.780 --> 08:41.780
story. For example, here's Garfield holding a piece of pie, and then suddenly in the next

08:41.780 --> 08:48.660
frame, pie's gone. But where did it go? Well, as the readers, we have to rely on our experience

08:48.660 --> 08:53.180
and our intuition to tell us how that transition occurred. I'm pretty sure I know where the

08:53.180 --> 08:58.340
pie went. Now, organic chemistry is no different than that comic strip. I might show you the

08:58.340 --> 09:03.340
chemical structures, for example, of ammonium cyanate and urea. But unless I give it greater

09:03.380 --> 09:08.900
detail, it's up to you to decide how you think the transition took place, using your understanding

09:08.900 --> 09:14.340
of how organic chemistry works. Of course, technologies progress to the point at which

09:14.340 --> 09:18.740
we don't often have to perform this exercise anymore. Computer animation fills in all the

09:18.740 --> 09:25.500
gaps and gives us maximum detail about how a process takes place. But even with the advantages

09:25.500 --> 09:31.540
of modern technology, fully animating a story is not always the best choice. It certainly

09:31.540 --> 09:36.460
leaves out most ambiguities, but it requires a great deal of effort to create, and also

09:36.460 --> 09:42.660
special devices to view. So for the purposes of day-to-day communication, chemists prefer

09:42.660 --> 09:47.660
to use a faster, shorthand style of depicting reactions that's developed over the centuries.

09:47.660 --> 09:53.780
Now, last time, we took a detailed look at methods chemists use to unambiguously convey

09:53.780 --> 09:58.420
molecular structures to one another. And in this lecture, we'll be taking a detailed

09:58.420 --> 10:04.020
look at how organic chemists convey changes in those structures through time. Specifically,

10:04.020 --> 10:08.160
how the chemical energy of a system changes, and how the bonding between and among atoms

10:08.160 --> 10:15.160
changes when that chemistry takes place. So let's begin with the simplest possible illustration

10:15.180 --> 10:21.140
of a chemical change, a reaction scheme. Now chemists often don't know or feel the need

10:21.140 --> 10:27.440
to convey minute mechanistic details of a chemical reaction as it takes place. And sometimes

10:27.440 --> 10:31.580
their arguments simply depends on what was present at the beginning of the reaction and

10:31.580 --> 10:37.700
what was present at the end. For example, if we just want to give the basic details

10:37.700 --> 10:43.580
of a reaction, we rely on something called a reaction scheme. The reaction scheme consists

10:43.580 --> 10:50.060
of reagents on the left side, products on the right side, an arrow which indicates whether

10:50.060 --> 10:55.340
the reaction is reversible or not, we'll get to that in a moment, and also any special

10:55.360 --> 11:00.400
conditions which are required for the reaction to take place. A great example of this is

11:00.400 --> 11:05.480
the reaction scheme used by Friedrich Wohler to synthesize urea. Remember, his reagent

11:05.480 --> 11:12.480
was ammonium cyanane. His products ultimately were urea. The reaction runs irreversibly,

11:13.520 --> 11:19.640
meaning that it completely and quantitatively converts all of the reagents into products.

11:19.640 --> 11:24.160
And the conditions that he used were simply heating. We represent heat sometimes with

11:24.180 --> 11:29.180
the capital Greek letter delta. So this is how Wohler's synthesis would appear if I

11:29.180 --> 11:36.180
were to write it as a reaction scheme. I have the synthesis of urea formed from ammonium

11:36.300 --> 11:41.740
cyanate in an irreversible process driven by heat. Now it's that last element of the

11:41.740 --> 11:46.780
scheme that requires a little bit more explanation. See, chemists distinguish between reactions

11:46.780 --> 11:51.420
which can be reversed from those and those which cannot. So in a reaction like Wohler's

11:51.420 --> 11:56.400
synthesis, the product formed is so stable that once it forms, it can never go back to

11:56.400 --> 12:01.600
the original starting materials through the reverse pathway. Of course, this means that

12:01.600 --> 12:05.520
if we wait long enough, the reaction will eventually result in the complete conversion

12:05.520 --> 12:10.200
of reactants to products. And as the course progresses, we'll eventually see why this

12:10.200 --> 12:16.240
is so important to make a distinction like this when plotting out a synthesis. So now

12:16.240 --> 12:21.360
that we have our completed scheme for Wohler's irreversible synthesis of urea, let's take

12:21.380 --> 12:28.380
a look at a scheme for another famous reaction, which this time is reversible. Another classic

12:28.900 --> 12:34.060
example of a reaction scheme is a Haber-Bosch process, which one might argue is not truly

12:34.060 --> 12:38.860
organic since carbon is not involved, but it's probably the single most influential

12:38.860 --> 12:43.820
chemical reaction of all time. And it's a critical entry point for nitrogen into the

12:43.820 --> 12:48.900
biosphere. So I'm going to exercise the professor's privilege here and step outside the bounds

12:48.920 --> 12:54.960
of my own discipline for just a moment. During World War I, with Germany facing dwindling

12:54.960 --> 13:00.760
natural resources to fuel their war efforts, famous German chemists Fritz Haber and Karl

13:00.760 --> 13:06.120
Bosch were engaged in a project to provide Germany with all the fixed nitrogen it could

13:06.120 --> 13:13.120
ever need for explosives and crop fertilization. The scheme that Haber used looks like this.

13:13.980 --> 13:20.980
As reagents, he used nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. For products, he was hoping to get ammonia.

13:22.660 --> 13:27.400
And what Haber realized was that in order to accomplish this, he was going to have some

13:27.400 --> 13:32.660
trouble because he had a reversible process. But he could get it to go if he ran it at

13:32.660 --> 13:39.660
400 degrees centigrade and 200 atmospheres of pressure in the presence of an iron catalyst,

13:40.200 --> 13:44.520
which speeds the reaction but doesn't really participate in it overall. That's why we place

13:44.520 --> 13:51.600
the iron here in the conditions rather than as a reagent. So Haber's scheme was, again,

13:51.600 --> 13:57.520
to try to get nitrogen and hydrogen to combine in a reversible process at 400 degrees and

13:57.520 --> 14:04.200
200 atmospheres of pressure with an iron catalyst, all to make ammonia. So you'll notice in

14:04.200 --> 14:08.000
this case that I've placed some numbers in front of my reagents here. And those numbers

14:08.020 --> 14:13.220
indicate a quantity. So you'll hear me from time to time refer to three moles of hydrogen

14:13.220 --> 14:18.820
or two moles of ammonia. This is because chemists usually count molecules using a very large

14:18.820 --> 14:24.780
quantity. It's no different than a dozen or a gross. So if I need a dozen eggs to make

14:24.780 --> 14:29.820
two dozen cookies, you now know the ratio needed. So if I need three moles of hydrogen

14:29.820 --> 14:36.100
to make two moles of ammonia, again, you know the ratio that's needed. So the only difference

14:36.120 --> 14:41.000
here is that in chemistry, we're counting atoms and molecules. So a mole is tremendous

14:41.000 --> 14:48.520
in quantity by comparison. 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd to be exact. So my reaction here

14:48.520 --> 14:53.480
involves one mole of nitrogen gas reacting with three molar equivalents of hydrogen

14:53.480 --> 14:58.440
to produce two moles of ammonia. And it would be a great way to make ammonia from the air

14:58.440 --> 15:03.680
if we could convert it into this much needed ammonia. The only problem here is the reaction

15:03.680 --> 15:09.100
is reversible. So once it's formed, the ammonia can convert back to hydrogen and nitrogen

15:09.100 --> 15:15.820
gases, thereby completely undoing the reaction. So as the concentration of ammonia builds,

15:15.820 --> 15:20.140
the reverse reaction accelerates until it matches out of the forward reaction, establishing

15:20.140 --> 15:25.700
what chemists call an equilibrium. The problem that Haber and Bosch faced is that ammonia

15:25.700 --> 15:31.060
decomposes to nitrogen and hydrogen very rapidly under common laboratory conditions, so only

15:31.080 --> 15:38.080
a small fraction of material in the reactor will be ammonia at any given time. So equilibrium

15:38.640 --> 15:44.400
is defined as a dynamic process in which the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.520
And it's a common misconception actually that equilibrium means equal amounts of both

15:48.520 --> 15:53.200
products and reactants, but this is really not the case at all, much to the chagrin

15:53.200 --> 16:00.200
of Haber and Bosch. So let me show you what I mean by that. We model equilibria as chemists

16:00.580 --> 16:06.860
using something called an equilibrium constant, which is written as the capital letter K. Now

16:06.860 --> 16:12.020
in the equilibrium constant we place a function of the products in the numerator, a function

16:12.020 --> 16:16.620
of the reagents in the denominator, and we raise those functions to a power equal to

16:16.620 --> 16:21.720
their coefficients in the reaction. So here I've created a sort of generic reaction,

16:21.720 --> 16:28.720
one mole of reagent A plus three moles of reagent B forms two moles of product C. So to construct

16:29.340 --> 16:35.200
the equilibrium constant K, I simply place my product's concentration, which we indicate

16:35.200 --> 16:41.560
by brackets, raised to the power of two for its coefficient. I place my first reagent

16:41.560 --> 16:48.240
in the denominator, raised to a power of one, and my second reagent also in the denominator,

16:48.240 --> 16:54.740
raised to a power of three. So this is my general equilibrium constant for this type

16:54.760 --> 17:01.440
of reaction. So Haber and Bosch were attempting to use nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia in

17:01.440 --> 17:08.040
an equilibrium process, meaning that its equilibrium constant expression will look like this, concentration

17:08.040 --> 17:15.040
of ammonia squared over concentration of nitrogen over concentration of hydrogen cubed equals

17:15.040 --> 17:21.540
ten to the minus sixth. This is a highly disfavored equilibrium. So this reaction is capable of

17:21.560 --> 17:26.880
producing only a small amount of ammonia once equilibrium is reached. So the scheme

17:26.880 --> 17:32.840
that Haber and Bosch were hoping to use to create ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen,

17:32.840 --> 17:36.560
unfortunately at equilibrium didn't look much like this, instead it looked a little

17:36.560 --> 17:43.560
bit like this. So the genius of what Haber and Bosch did was not in this reaction that

17:43.720 --> 17:49.920
they used. In fact, it's a pretty simple reaction. The genius of what Haber and Bosch accomplished

17:49.980 --> 17:55.100
was in their reactor design, which altered the conditions of pressure and temperature,

17:55.100 --> 17:59.700
increasing both of these factors to speed the rate of ammonia formation relative to

17:59.700 --> 18:04.460
the rate of its decomposition. So they influenced the equilibrium in a manner which suited their

18:04.460 --> 18:11.460
needs. But even that strategy didn't produce large quantities of ammonia at equilibrium.

18:11.780 --> 18:16.100
So in a final manipulation, they devised a way to remove ammonia from the reactor as

18:16.120 --> 18:22.120
it formed, thereby causing the equilibrium to shift continuously in favor of their desired

18:22.120 --> 18:28.720
products. This tendency of reversible systems to shift in ways which relieve stresses like

18:28.720 --> 18:35.720
removal of product is known as Le Chatelier's principle. Now at this early stage, reversible

18:37.040 --> 18:41.200
reactions may seem like a nuisance. After all, wouldn't it be great if we could just

18:41.200 --> 18:45.960
mix some ingredients, wait for a little while, and ultimately have the maximum possible amount

18:45.980 --> 18:51.220
of product? Sure, many times it would. But later in the course, we're going to see some

18:51.220 --> 18:58.220
examples of reactions whose reversibility makes them even more useful in synthetic design.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.540
So far our drawing examples have been limited in the sense that they convey a great deal

19:03.540 --> 19:08.860
about what we start and end with, but relatively little about what goes on in the interim.

19:08.860 --> 19:13.700
And since reaction schemes only show a list of starting materials and products, we're

19:13.760 --> 19:19.960
often left to wonder exactly how those materials go about changing. One might make the analogy

19:19.960 --> 19:23.960
that it's like having a pile of boards, screws, and other pieces, and then a picture of a

19:23.960 --> 19:30.960
finished table when assembled, but our step-by-step manual is missing. So when organic chemists

19:30.960 --> 19:35.640
want to convey a process in a little more detail, they turn to a style of drawing known

19:35.640 --> 19:41.240
as a mechanism. And a mechanism, just like that manual for assembling their table, it's

19:41.260 --> 19:46.660
a series of elementary steps showing not only the starting material, reversibility, conditions

19:46.660 --> 19:52.420
and products, but also explicitly showing how electrons from each species are exchanged

19:52.420 --> 19:58.260
to make and break bonds. So let's take a look at Wohler's Synthesis one more time

19:58.260 --> 20:03.940
as an example, knowing that chemists now understand what happened during that happy accident.

20:03.940 --> 20:07.900
So our scheme only showed the starting material and products, but let's see if we can fill

20:07.920 --> 20:14.920
in some of the gaps now. So once again, here is Wohler's Synthesis. Ammonium cyanate

20:15.480 --> 20:21.040
and forming urea. But if I break this reaction down to elementary steps, I see that there

20:21.040 --> 20:27.800
are different compounds which form as intermediates, specifically ammonia and cyanic acid, and ultimately

20:27.800 --> 20:34.240
a charge-separated intermediate, before it finally becomes urea. So Wohler's Synthesis,

20:34.260 --> 20:37.900
as I showed you before, left out a lot of information. There's actually quite a few

20:37.900 --> 20:44.900
additional species involved in the transition. But that's still not enough information.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.260
If you look at this now, it's sort of like reading that comic strip. We might have multiple

20:48.260 --> 20:53.780
pains in the comic, but we still haven't really clearly defined how one transition

20:53.780 --> 21:00.380
occurs and forms the next. Now to do this, we use a mechanism. And a mechanism consists

21:00.400 --> 21:05.360
of not only the structures of all of these species, but arrows indicating how and when

21:05.360 --> 21:12.360
electrons move. For example, here's a representation of ammonium and of cyanate. And I've colored

21:12.920 --> 21:16.080
the nitrogens just a little bit different shades of blue so they're easier to follow

21:16.080 --> 21:20.780
through the process. So I could skip ahead and draw the new structures for ammonia and

21:20.780 --> 21:26.200
cyanic acid, but that would leave you wondering how the transition happened. So to fill in

21:26.220 --> 21:31.820
that gap, I'm going to use some arrows. When I use an arrow like this, I'm trying to show

21:31.820 --> 21:37.500
you that a pair of electrons is moving from this nitrogen to this hydrogen, abstracting

21:37.500 --> 21:44.380
it, forming a new chemical bond to it. As that happens, the original chemical bond breaks,

21:44.380 --> 21:51.380
and that pair of electrons moves back to the nitrogen of the ammonium ion. Now I can draw

21:51.380 --> 21:58.380
this intermediate in my process, and it's absolutely clear how it got that way. In a

21:58.480 --> 22:04.980
second fundamental step, I have my ammonia reacting with the cyanic acid, which was produced,

22:04.980 --> 22:09.980
forming a new bond between the nitrogen and carbon, and breaking a pi bond between the

22:09.980 --> 22:16.980
carbon and the original nitrogen of the cyanic acid. This produces a charged intermediate

22:17.080 --> 22:22.200
in which there's a rearrangement where one of the hydrogens moves from my nitrogen here

22:22.200 --> 22:28.440
to my nitrogen down below, breaking that bond. Now I can complete my mechanism, and it becomes

22:28.440 --> 22:34.640
clear exactly how we got from this point to this point, including each individual bond

22:34.640 --> 22:40.520
forming and breaking. And this is the value of a mechanism. It gives us the maximum level

22:40.520 --> 22:47.520
of detail. So we're now acquainted with the techniques used not only to draw molecular

22:48.060 --> 22:53.500
structures, but the elements of drawings used to convey elementary steps, and the electron

22:53.500 --> 22:58.780
transitions which take place in each one. But there's one more piece of information

22:58.780 --> 23:04.060
which is crucial to understanding how these transitions occur, and that is the chemical

23:04.060 --> 23:11.060
energetics of the process. You see, just like in classical physics, chemists think in terms

23:11.680 --> 23:17.320
of potential energy. And just like a physical object, like a ball, is expected to roll down

23:17.320 --> 23:23.920
a hill, thereby decreasing its potential physical energy and reaching a more stable state, so

23:23.920 --> 23:29.880
will a molecular system react in a way which decreases its overall potential chemical energy,

23:30.020 --> 23:35.540
also making it more stable. The difference is that chemical energy is a bit less intuitive

23:35.540 --> 23:42.940
to determine. Still, to fully understand the process of a chemical reaction, we need a

23:42.940 --> 23:47.980
quick and convenient method for demonstrating whether a particular transition increases

23:47.980 --> 23:54.340
or decreases the overall chemical free energy of the system, and by how much. And to better

23:54.340 --> 23:58.480
understand this concept, we should consider a simple example like that ball perched on

23:58.500 --> 24:04.260
a hilltop. Classical physics tells us that the potential energy of that ball in its current

24:04.260 --> 24:11.260
position is higher than that of the same ball at the bottom of the hill. So we can see from

24:11.340 --> 24:17.300
the diagram that when we give it a small push to overcome the barrier, which would be friction

24:17.300 --> 24:21.900
or a small hill preventing it from rolling in the first place, the ball will spontaneously

24:21.900 --> 24:26.420
roll downward, presumably coming to rest at the bottom of the hill in the lowest energy

24:26.440 --> 24:32.600
state available. Chemical systems are a perfect analogy for this physical system that I just

24:32.600 --> 24:38.080
described. Just as that ball has an associated physical potential energy, which it would

24:38.080 --> 24:44.080
like to release, so does a collection of molecules have an associated chemical free energy that

24:44.080 --> 24:50.080
it would like to release. When a small energetic barrier is overcome by the addition of heat,

24:50.080 --> 24:55.400
catalyst or some other perturbation, the system can then convert spontaneously to its lower

24:55.420 --> 25:02.420
energy state. Now chemists often convey this energetic landscape for a chemical reaction

25:02.780 --> 25:08.900
using this hill analogy, and we call it a reaction coordinate diagram. The only difference

25:08.900 --> 25:14.420
here is that the hill is one of chemical potential energy rather than one of physical potential

25:14.420 --> 25:19.740
energy. So the diagrams are essentially a plot of system free energy as a function of

25:19.740 --> 25:25.020
reaction progress. So let's finish our discussion today by applying this diagram to Wohler's

25:25.040 --> 25:31.040
Urea Synthesis, and recall that the mechanism for this process involves starting materials,

25:31.040 --> 25:36.200
products, and two different intermediate states, which are meta-stable, and they can exist

25:36.200 --> 25:42.700
for a little while. So we begin by defining the original energy of the system as the y

25:42.700 --> 25:48.760
intercept of our plot, and the first step of our reaction begins with a new bond forming

25:48.760 --> 25:54.520
to hydrogen while its original bond breaks. So this process actually increases the energy

25:54.520 --> 26:00.140
of the system until we reach a maximum energy for the step. The structure at that local

26:00.140 --> 26:07.140
energy maximum is called the transition state. Now at first it might seem strange to suggest

26:07.780 --> 26:12.540
that the system is going to move energetically uphill. After all, balls aren't known to roll

26:12.540 --> 26:18.020
suddenly uphill without a little outside help. And the same is actually true of chemical

26:18.020 --> 26:23.660
systems, but often the help is already there. It's all around us permeating every object

26:23.680 --> 26:30.680
in this room. Of course I'm talking about heat. At all temperatures but absolute zero,

26:31.520 --> 26:36.520
there will be some molecular motion, bond vibration, molecular collisions, and other

26:36.520 --> 26:41.800
kinds of motions. And so long as there's sufficient thermal energy in a system to get it over

26:41.800 --> 26:46.560
that initial barrier from starting materials to the transition state, the reaction will

26:46.580 --> 26:53.580
take place. Now we call that activation, that barrier activation energy as you already know.

26:53.940 --> 26:58.460
And just as you might expect, often the addition of heat to a reaction mixture is all it needs

26:58.460 --> 27:04.660
to traverse that barrier, thereby speeding the reaction up. Now as that first step winds

27:04.660 --> 27:10.700
down, we see that the energy of the system begins to decrease to a local minimum. But

27:10.700 --> 27:16.260
in this case it has a second energetic hill to climb on its way to the final product.

27:16.280 --> 27:21.680
So we call this local minimum an intermediate. And it's distinct from transition states because

27:21.680 --> 27:27.240
it has a small energy well there which makes it metastable so it can exist in measurable

27:27.240 --> 27:34.240
amounts while the reaction is running. In the next step ammonia forms its bond to the

27:34.240 --> 27:39.960
newly formed cyanic acid. Again this increases the energy of the system initially to a point

27:39.960 --> 27:45.640
representing the transition state for that process. After that new bond formation completes

27:45.660 --> 27:52.180
and the system reaches another metastable state. We finally conclude the reaction with

27:52.180 --> 27:59.180
the reorganization of the product by an intramolecular exchange of a hydrogen. So we've created an

27:59.180 --> 28:04.380
energy diagram here for the entire process of converting ammonium cyanate into urea

28:04.380 --> 28:09.380
in three steps. Now let's review the relevance of all the features of this diagram.

28:10.120 --> 28:16.120
Our starting materials must pass through a transition state to become the first intermediates

28:16.120 --> 28:22.400
ammonia and cyanic acid. The diagram tells me two important things. First that the reaction

28:22.400 --> 28:27.640
will happen quickly because the energetic barrier is relatively low. And second that

28:27.640 --> 28:31.520
a large amount of this intermediate will exist in equilibrium with the starting material

28:31.520 --> 28:37.200
because the intermediate is lower in energy. The second step of the mechanism reaches a

28:37.220 --> 28:41.740
considerably higher transition state energy which tells me that this is a rate limiting

28:41.740 --> 28:47.460
step of the reaction. Since this step is expected to proceed much more slowly than the others

28:47.460 --> 28:53.960
by virtue of the energy change taking place. Finally the intramolecular proton relocation

28:53.960 --> 28:58.580
or hydrogen relocation takes place quickly and irreversibly once that last intermediate

28:58.580 --> 29:03.980
has formed. This creates a product of greater stability than the original starting materials

29:04.120 --> 29:11.120
and my reaction is complete. So today we've taken a look at how chemists communicate chemical

29:12.120 --> 29:16.520
transitions to one another. We do this in much the same way that a cartoonist tells

29:16.520 --> 29:23.520
a story with pains showing punctuated depictions of a system as it undergoes changes. We started

29:24.080 --> 29:29.540
with the phenomenon of resonance or delocalization of electrons. And we talked about how multiple

29:29.560 --> 29:34.640
resonance contributors contained in brackets and separated by straight two headed arrows

29:34.640 --> 29:41.640
can be mentally combined in a mathematical average to produce the resonance hybrid.

29:41.720 --> 29:46.520
We looked at how to write a reaction scheme which communicates the four crucial details

29:46.520 --> 29:53.520
of a reaction, the starting materials, the products, the conditions and the reversibility.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.480
And we discussed how the choice of arrows separating the starting materials and products

29:57.620 --> 30:03.700
give us a little bit of information about that reversibility. Then we explored the art

30:03.700 --> 30:08.540
of depicting mechanisms in which schemes are expanded into their elementary steps and the

30:08.540 --> 30:13.660
motion of electrons is indicated by curved arrows pointing from the original location

30:13.660 --> 30:20.220
to their final destination in a given step. And finally we took a look at a reaction coordinate

30:20.220 --> 30:25.260
diagram and how it shows us the energetic landscape of a chemical change making such

30:25.280 --> 30:30.600
details as the transition state and intermediate energies and rate limiting steps all evident

30:30.600 --> 30:37.040
to us. As we progress through the remainder of this course, we're going to rely heavily

30:37.040 --> 30:41.800
on what we've learned regarding chemical drawing. And next time we'll put some of these drawing

30:41.800 --> 30:47.840
skills into practice as we investigate the acid based properties of organic compounds.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.360
I'll see you then.
