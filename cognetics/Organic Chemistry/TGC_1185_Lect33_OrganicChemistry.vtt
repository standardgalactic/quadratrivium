00:00.000 --> 00:17.640
Potent alcoholic beverages from the waste product of yeast, drinkable water from the

00:17.640 --> 00:21.960
sea, gasoline from crude oil.

00:21.960 --> 00:27.280
Humanity has always had a deep interest in the purification of liquids to obtain commodities

00:27.280 --> 00:29.600
of great value.

00:29.600 --> 00:35.040
One of the earliest and most effective techniques to purify liquids relies on two simple physical

00:35.040 --> 00:45.520
changes, boiling and condensation, which combine to create a familiar technique called distillation.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.080
Most of us are predominantly familiar with this technique as a method of producing beverage

00:49.080 --> 00:50.680
alcohol.

00:50.680 --> 00:55.020
This application has been employed for so long that its true origins in human history

00:55.020 --> 00:57.560
are lost to the ages.

00:57.560 --> 01:02.500
What is certain is that many early civilizations independently discovered this trick, which

01:02.500 --> 01:08.320
can be used to produce a beverage from such varied sources as fermented rice, bananas,

01:08.320 --> 01:12.080
or even milk.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.800
But ethanol is just one of many liquids which we find particularly useful in its purified

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
state.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.800
In the 4th century BC, Aristotle observed this phenomenon related to water and wrote

01:22.800 --> 01:25.780
on it in his work Meteorologica.

01:25.780 --> 01:31.520
He wrote, salt water, when it turns to vapor, becomes sweet, and the vapor does not form

01:31.520 --> 01:34.640
salt water again when it condenses.

01:34.640 --> 01:40.280
Wine and all fluids that evaporate and condense into a liquid state become water.

01:40.280 --> 01:45.640
Now, by sweet, what Aristotle meant was drinkable.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.800
He had observed that seawater, wine, and all other common solutions of his day could be

01:50.800 --> 01:57.820
made into fresh, potable water simply by boiling it, then recondensing the vapor in a new container.

01:57.820 --> 02:03.220
Now, clearly seawater and freshwater were made from the same basic substance and modified

02:03.220 --> 02:10.020
only by some admixture, which could be removed by this process.

02:10.020 --> 02:14.980
Of course, in his day, Aristotle only had access to aqueous solutions, so his observation

02:14.980 --> 02:20.700
that all fluids become water in this process would be a bit erroneous from a modern perspective.

02:20.700 --> 02:26.240
But he did demonstrate an understanding that liquids can be vaporized, collected and recondensed

02:26.240 --> 02:31.360
to form a liquid of a different composition than the original, a primary tenet of the

02:31.360 --> 02:34.040
technique of distillation.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.960
Now, Aristotle's observations weren't merely academic, either.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.720
His ideas were applied in the centuries following his death.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.400
For example, Greek sailors, according to the accounts from Alexander of Aphrodisius, boiled

02:47.400 --> 02:52.060
seawater and suspended large sponges from the mouth of bronze vessels above them to

02:52.060 --> 02:53.660
obtain drinking water.

02:53.660 --> 02:58.500
Now, here Alexander is describing the desalination of seawater.

02:58.500 --> 03:04.940
In the middle of the 1600s, an Englishman and physician named John French played a critical

03:04.940 --> 03:11.500
role in thrusting distillation from the realm of an alchemical art to a chemical science.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.500
He very eloquently writes in his now famous work, The Art of Distillation,

03:16.200 --> 03:21.600
I shall not stand here to show where the art of distillation had its origin as being a thing,

03:21.600 --> 03:27.600
little conducing to our ensuing discourse, but let us understand what distillation is.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.100
In yet another of my favorite quotes of all time, French writes,

03:34.100 --> 03:39.800
Before you take yourself to the work, propound to yourself what you seek and enter not upon

03:39.800 --> 03:44.800
the practice until you are first well versed in the theory.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.500
A more telling quotation of those times could not possibly exist.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.500
French has always been on my list of top ten scientists I'd like to sit down for a beer

03:53.500 --> 03:58.500
with, though perhaps in his case a whiskey would be a more appropriate drink.

03:58.500 --> 04:05.500
In his time, French's work was the most influential universal compendium of distillation theory

04:05.500 --> 04:11.100
and techniques that was ever published, a true asset to the growing science of chemistry.

04:11.100 --> 04:16.900
Today, it offers us a fascinating insight into the change in thinking which was going on during his day,

04:16.900 --> 04:21.600
a shift from the artistic and romantic descriptions of the alchemical world

04:21.600 --> 04:26.600
to the factual and detailed observations of the chemical world.

04:28.200 --> 04:33.000
But distillation is not simply an ancient technique relegated to the pages of history.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.800
Modern fuels are particularly pertinent example of a more recent societal change made possible by this purification method.

04:40.900 --> 04:45.700
A fantastic example of this is the refining of crude oil into useful materials.

04:45.700 --> 04:51.700
And we owe a great deal of that practice to J.D. Rockefeller's standard oil company and his competitors.

04:53.700 --> 04:58.900
You see, there's a good reason why we refer to fossil fuels as petroleum distillates.

04:58.900 --> 05:05.600
It's because the refining process primarily relies on distillation to separate components of crude petroleum

05:05.600 --> 05:09.100
based on little more than their boiling points.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.900
Rockefeller's true genius was not to employ the technique. Now, that had been done long ago.

05:15.200 --> 05:20.600
But what really helped to make Rockefeller successful was his realization that in addition to lamp oil,

05:20.600 --> 05:25.300
he could use distillation to collect and sell many of the other products of various volatilities

05:25.300 --> 05:28.300
which other companies simply treated as waste.

05:28.300 --> 05:31.300
And this included octane for gasoline.

05:31.300 --> 05:35.800
So just imagine that gasoline was once considered a waste product.

05:36.500 --> 05:41.500
So distillation has found many uses through the ages, from producing potable water and alcoholic beverages

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
to refining oil and gasoline.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.000
It also finds use frequently in the organic chemistry laboratory

05:47.000 --> 05:51.500
as a method for isolating liquids of varying volatility from one another.

05:51.500 --> 05:57.500
The applications of distillation go on and on, but in this lecture we'll take French's advice

05:57.500 --> 06:02.500
and first take a look at the fundamental laws governing this influential chemical technique.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.200
First, a bit of background on the process of vaporization.

06:07.200 --> 06:12.200
All liquids exist naturally in equilibrium with just a little bit of their vapor,

06:12.200 --> 06:15.200
even at temperatures well below their boiling points.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.200
Now, the exact amount of vapor varies from one substance to the next

06:19.200 --> 06:26.200
and depends on how well molecules of the same kind stick together through intermolecular attractions.

06:26.900 --> 06:33.900
For example, under a given set of conditions, water will exert a lower vapor pressure than will acetone

06:33.900 --> 06:36.900
because the water molecules can hydrogen bond to themselves,

06:36.900 --> 06:40.900
causing them to prefer the liquid phase more than the gas.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.900
This is easily observed.

06:42.900 --> 06:47.900
Just place a drop of water next to a drop of nail polish remover on a countertop

06:47.900 --> 06:50.900
and see which one evaporates first.

06:51.600 --> 06:57.600
We measure the amount of vapor above a liquid in terms of the pressure that that vapor exerts.

06:57.600 --> 07:02.600
So this property of liquids has come to be known as vapor pressure.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.600
The higher the vapor pressure of a given liquid,

07:05.600 --> 07:10.600
the faster and more easily it will be converted to the gas phase.

07:10.600 --> 07:15.600
Now, we often report vapor pressures in units of torr.

07:16.300 --> 07:20.300
One torr is equal to one millimeter of mercury in a barometer.

07:20.300 --> 07:25.300
So, 760 torr is equal to one atmosphere of pressure,

07:25.300 --> 07:30.300
the likes of which we would experience on a lab bench.

07:30.300 --> 07:36.300
Now, increasing the temperature of a sample means increasing the kinetic energy in the molecules which make it up.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.300
So, increasing the temperature of a liquid,

07:39.300 --> 07:45.300
gives more of its molecules enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid and become a gas.

07:45.300 --> 07:49.300
This increases the vapor pressure of the sample.

07:49.300 --> 07:56.300
When a liquid is heated to a temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the externally applied pressure,

07:56.300 --> 08:02.300
like the 760 torr of pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere, for example, the liquid boils.

08:03.300 --> 08:06.300
When the pressure we are working against is one atmosphere,

08:06.300 --> 08:11.300
we refer to this temperature as the liquid's normal boiling point.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.300
This is most easily observed by heating a sample of pure water.

08:17.300 --> 08:23.300
At room temperature, water's vapor pressure is only about 3% out of atmospheric pressure.

08:23.300 --> 08:28.300
But as the temperature increases, more and more water increases.

08:29.300 --> 08:35.300
But as the temperature increases, more and more water vapor can be seen forming at the liquid's surface,

08:35.300 --> 08:38.300
until the water reaches 100 degrees centigrade,

08:38.300 --> 08:45.300
at which point its vapor pressure is now one atmosphere, or 760 torr, and boiling takes place.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.300
But that's pure water.

08:49.300 --> 08:54.300
And our goal today is to show how we can separate mixtures of liquids from one another using this process.

08:54.300 --> 08:59.300
So let's call on a few more great minds from the 1800s to help us with that.

09:01.300 --> 09:06.300
Raoul's law, named for French chemist François-Marie Raoul, states that

09:06.300 --> 09:11.300
the vapor pressure exerted by a component in a mixture of miscible liquids

09:11.300 --> 09:17.300
is equal to its normal vapor pressure when pure, times its mole fraction in the mixture.

09:18.300 --> 09:25.300
In other words, the vapor pressure of each component is proportional to the fraction of sample molecules it makes up.

09:25.300 --> 09:33.300
So a solution which is 50% water at room temperature will only exert a vapor pressure of 1.5 torr instead of 3 torr.

09:36.300 --> 09:44.300
Dalton's law, named for John Dalton, tells us that the sum of the partial vapor pressures exerted by all of the components of such a system

09:44.300 --> 09:48.300
is equal to the total vapor pressure exerted by that system.

09:48.300 --> 09:52.300
In other words, vapor pressures are additive.

09:54.300 --> 10:01.300
For example, if our water was diluted to 50% using ethanol, we would have to include the vapor pressure of the ethanol

10:01.300 --> 10:04.300
and the total vapor pressure of our mixture as well.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.300
Now, ethanol's vapor pressure is about 50 torr at room temperature.

10:09.300 --> 10:15.300
So it contributes 25 torr to the vapor pressure of the mixture according to Raoul's law,

10:15.300 --> 10:21.300
giving the mixture about 26.5 torr total vapor pressure in accordance with Dalton's law.

10:22.300 --> 10:28.300
So varying the amount of each liquid making up the mixture can alter that mixture's vapor pressure.

10:29.300 --> 10:36.300
Finally, we're going to use ideal gas law, which is actually a combination of several other laws relating pressure,

10:36.300 --> 10:44.300
volume, abundance, and temperature, all through a constant called the ideal gas constant, which we represent by the letter R.

10:45.300 --> 10:49.300
So let's start our discussion about the process of vaporization and how it applies to distillation

10:49.300 --> 10:54.300
in an object lesson using benzene and toluene to fairly simple hydrocarbons.

10:55.300 --> 11:00.300
Now, I'll be using numbers for toluene and benzene, but I'll be representing the molecules as blue spheres and red spheres

11:00.300 --> 11:05.300
throughout this demonstration so that we keep our attention on the physical behavior of the molecules

11:05.300 --> 11:07.300
and not the structures of them themselves.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.300
So here I have a beaker that's filled with benzene and toluene.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.300
And this mixture of benzene and toluene is 50 mole percent of each.

11:17.300 --> 11:22.300
Now that means that if I model my blue spheres as toluene and my red spheres as benzene,

11:22.300 --> 11:25.300
I can begin to follow them as they change from the liquid to the vapor state.

11:26.300 --> 11:32.300
Now, at a given temperature, the vapor pressure of toluene is normally 300 Tor.

11:33.300 --> 11:39.300
And at the same temperature, the vapor pressure of pure benzene is normally 1200 Tor.

11:41.300 --> 11:47.300
So I can use Raoult's law to calculate the vapor pressure exerted by each in my mixture.

11:47.300 --> 11:55.300
For example, the vapor pressure exerted by toluene is equal to chi, the Greek letter chi, which is its mole fraction,

11:56.300 --> 11:59.300
times the vapor pressure it would exert if it were pure.

12:00.300 --> 12:04.300
In other words, the toluene should exert a vapor pressure of 150 Tor.

12:06.300 --> 12:13.300
Now, a similar calculation for benzene allows me to predict that its vapor pressure above the liquid should be equal to 600 Tor.

12:14.300 --> 12:20.300
And a quick check using Dalton's law tells me that this liquid will be boiling maybe on a cloudy day here in Washington D.C.

12:20.300 --> 12:25.300
when the vapor pressure or when the atmospheric pressure is 750 Tor, which equals the vapor pressure.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.300
Now, here's the interesting part.

12:29.300 --> 12:36.300
If I take the vapor pressures of my liquids and use the ideal gas law, which allows me to predict that the pressures they exert

12:36.300 --> 12:40.300
is proportional to the number of moles in the gas phase,

12:40.300 --> 12:49.300
I calculate that the mole fraction of benzene in the vapor phase is 80 mole percent, not 50 mole percent.

12:50.300 --> 12:55.300
So this means that in the headspace above my liquid, whatever vapor does form at this temperature,

12:55.300 --> 13:01.300
is actually going to be enriched in benzene, which is the more volatile of the two components.

13:02.300 --> 13:07.300
Now, this is very important to distillation and how it allows us to separate liquids.

13:08.300 --> 13:15.300
So let's say that I could take a sample of benzene and toluene and place it in an apparatus in which it can vaporize

13:15.300 --> 13:22.300
and in which that vapor is then channeled into a new region in space where it is then condensed back into a liquid.

13:22.300 --> 13:30.300
Well, if I can do that, then the liquid I collect should be of the same composition as the vapor in that original sample.

13:31.300 --> 13:37.300
So we use a device like this called the simple still, which consists of what we call a boiling flask, which is heated.

13:37.300 --> 13:45.300
A still head whose job is to direct the vapor into another downward-facing region, which we call a west condenser.

13:45.300 --> 13:51.300
Now, the west condenser has a water jacket to keep it cold, which induces condensation,

13:51.300 --> 13:56.300
but that condensed vapor rolls downhill into a new receiving flask,

13:56.300 --> 14:01.300
and it's directed that way through a flow controller or a vacuum adapter in this case.

14:01.300 --> 14:06.300
So knowing what we know about how a mixture of benzene and toluene will vaporize,

14:06.300 --> 14:10.300
if I run my still by adding heat to the boiling flask,

14:10.300 --> 14:15.300
I expect that the vapor which is moving through the system will be enriched in the benzene,

14:15.300 --> 14:20.300
and therefore at the end of my distillation run, when I remove my receiving flask,

14:20.300 --> 14:23.300
it should contain 80 mole percent benzene.

14:23.300 --> 14:28.300
So I've enriched my sample in the more volatile component through distillation.

14:29.300 --> 14:34.300
So now that we've talked a little bit about the theory behind simple distillation, let's take a look at one in progress.

14:36.300 --> 14:42.300
So I've constructed here a simple distillation apparatus, the type of which you might find running in an organic chemistry lab.

14:42.300 --> 14:47.300
Currently, I'm distilling a mixture of 50-50 ethanol and water.

14:47.300 --> 14:52.300
Now the apparatus consists of not only the elements we looked at previously in our slides,

14:52.300 --> 14:55.300
but a few other practical pieces that help it work.

14:55.300 --> 14:59.300
The first is this device called a lab jack, and the lab jack gives me a little bit of clearance

14:59.300 --> 15:03.300
so that I can raise and lower my heat source when I need to.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.300
On top of the lab jack is a stir plate.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.300
Now this is also a heating plate, but I'm not using the heat,

15:09.300 --> 15:12.300
because remember we talked about this in our previous lecture,

15:12.300 --> 15:16.300
that it's not a good idea to put anything with organic solvents directly on top of a hot plate.

15:16.300 --> 15:22.300
And since I'm working with ethanol, which in certain concentrations is flammable, I can't do that.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.300
Instead, I've used a device which is called a thermowell.

15:26.300 --> 15:32.300
A thermowell is a ceramic heater, and I'm controlling it with a little controller in the back here,

15:32.300 --> 15:36.300
which is hidden from view, which regulates how much current is reaching the thermowell.

15:36.300 --> 15:40.300
So that's how I set the temperature of the still just the way I like it.

15:40.300 --> 15:45.300
Now right now, I have a round bottom boiling flask, which is clamped in place.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.300
So this is the lowest piece of glassware in my apparatus,

15:48.300 --> 15:51.300
and so I've clamped it on a ring stand so that when I lower the lab jack,

15:51.300 --> 15:54.300
my heat source is removed from my organic sample.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.300
So this is all about safety up to this point.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.300
Now about the distillation.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.300
The boiling flask contains a mixture of boiling water and ethanol.

16:03.300 --> 16:08.300
And if you look very closely, you can actually see the vapor condensing within the still head here,

16:08.300 --> 16:12.300
and a great deal of it is falling back into the boiling flask, and that's okay.

16:12.300 --> 16:17.300
But some of that vapor traverses the still head into this arm,

16:17.300 --> 16:22.300
which is in a downward sloping direction and is in line with a water-cooled condenser.

16:22.300 --> 16:27.300
So this condenser here, actually, if I get wiped away some of the condensation that's on it,

16:27.300 --> 16:30.300
you might be able to see this, has two concentric tubes.

16:30.300 --> 16:34.300
The outside tube is actually plumbed to cold water,

16:34.300 --> 16:38.300
which is circulating because of a pump that I have underneath the table.

16:38.300 --> 16:43.300
So it's constantly keeping the inner portion of this column cold.

16:43.300 --> 16:48.300
That's why the vapor is condensing in this cold region and rolling downward,

16:48.300 --> 16:53.300
where my vacuum adapter is directing the flow into a receiving flask.

16:53.300 --> 17:00.300
You may notice that it's dripping downward, and that's actually the origin of the term distill.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.300
It's from the Latin meaning to drop downward.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.300
So if I'm really enriching my sample here in ethanol,

17:06.300 --> 17:11.300
I should be able to detect that in the temperature of the vapor as it moves through the still head.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.300
So I have an infrared thermometer here,

17:14.300 --> 17:17.300
and I've placed a few white stickers on my apparatus

17:17.300 --> 17:23.300
so that I can get the proper reflection of the IR light to measure the temperatures going on in this still.

17:23.300 --> 17:28.300
Now if I point my thermometer directly at the boiling flask,

17:28.300 --> 17:33.300
I see that at least the surface of the boiling flask is somewhere around 80 degrees centigrade,

17:33.300 --> 17:37.300
77 according to my thermometer.

17:37.300 --> 17:42.300
But if the vapor which is moving into the condenser is of a different composition,

17:42.300 --> 17:45.300
then it should be a different temperature.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.300
If I've increased the concentration of the more volatile component,

17:48.300 --> 17:52.300
I should see a decrease in temperature as it moves up into the still head.

17:52.300 --> 17:56.300
So let's take a look at the still head temperature, at least on the outside of the still head.

17:56.300 --> 18:00.300
See, it's moving around quite a bit as the vapor sort of moves and swirls inside,

18:00.300 --> 18:04.300
but my reading never exceeds about 70 degrees.

18:08.300 --> 18:12.300
So even though I've been measuring the temperatures of the outside of the still,

18:12.300 --> 18:15.300
or the glass surface, rather than the actual liquid and vapor,

18:15.300 --> 18:17.300
we can see the trend occurring here,

18:17.300 --> 18:20.300
that it's much warmer down here where the boiling liquid is

18:20.300 --> 18:23.300
compared to the temperature of the vapor which is moving through the still head.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.300
Now if this were a pure liquid, that should not be the case,

18:26.300 --> 18:31.300
because boiling means that the liquid and the vapor are in thermal equilibrium with one another,

18:31.300 --> 18:33.300
which clearly they aren't,

18:33.300 --> 18:38.300
and that is the source of the purification that we get during a distillation.

18:38.300 --> 18:42.300
So we've seen how we can separate or at least enrich a sample

18:42.300 --> 18:45.300
in a more volatile component using simple distillation.

18:45.300 --> 18:50.300
But what if we want a really highly purified sample of a particular liquid?

18:50.300 --> 18:53.300
Remember, in our calculations before, with benzene and toluene,

18:53.300 --> 18:57.300
we determined that we would only get a distillate of about 80 mole percent benzene,

18:57.300 --> 19:04.300
but what if we need one that's 90 or 95 or even practically 100 percent benzene?

19:04.300 --> 19:10.300
We have a tool that we can use to predict exactly how liquids and vapors will behave

19:10.300 --> 19:15.300
to determine the outcome of a distillation and whether or not we need to take extra measures.

19:15.300 --> 19:19.300
Now for that we use something called a liquid vapor composition plot.

19:19.300 --> 19:26.300
And a liquid vapor composition plot, simply put, is a phase diagram for a binary liquid system at boiling,

19:26.300 --> 19:32.300
as opposed to a binary solid system which is melting like we looked at last time.

19:32.300 --> 19:36.300
So remember, we were operating in a specific temperature,

19:36.300 --> 19:41.300
boiling a mixture of benzene and toluene, which was 50 mole percent benzene,

19:41.300 --> 19:45.300
but created a vapor that was 80 mole percent benzene.

19:45.300 --> 19:52.300
So at that given temperature on my plot, I can place those two percentages of benzene.

19:52.300 --> 20:00.300
Here 50 for the liquid and here 80 for my vapor composition.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.300
But these calculations in this experiment have been done many, many times over

20:04.300 --> 20:08.300
at many, many different compositions of benzene and toluene.

20:08.300 --> 20:13.300
So if we plot similar results for different compositions at their boiling points,

20:13.300 --> 20:18.300
we start to see a pattern emerge within the plot and connecting the dots gives us

20:18.300 --> 20:24.300
what looks a lot like our phase diagrams for a binary system that we've seen before.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.300
So this is the origin of the liquid vapor composition plot.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.300
It's a tool which allows me to predict the outcome of a distillation

20:30.300 --> 20:37.300
without ever having to go into the lab and run one.

20:37.300 --> 20:41.300
So let's say that I really do want a very, very pure sample of benzene.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.300
Can I use distillation to achieve that?

20:44.300 --> 20:49.300
Well, our calculations would suggest otherwise for a 50 mole percent mixture with toluene.

20:49.300 --> 20:54.300
But what if I were to collect that distillate and then redestill it?

20:54.300 --> 20:58.300
Well, I could build an apparatus like the one I've shown you here in which I have a boiling flask

20:58.300 --> 21:03.300
and then an intermediate flask which is a collection flask for a first round of distillation

21:03.300 --> 21:07.300
but is a boiling flask for a second round of distillation.

21:07.300 --> 21:12.300
Now, if I were to run a system like this, I would expect my 50 mole percent benzene

21:12.300 --> 21:17.300
to collect in the first flask as an 80 mole percent benzene solution.

21:17.300 --> 21:21.300
But that 80 mole percent benzene solution, when heated,

21:21.300 --> 21:27.300
I would expect to distill yet again and form a new condensate which is even more enriched.

21:27.300 --> 21:33.300
Now, just how enriched it is, I can determine using my liquid vapor composition plot.

21:33.300 --> 21:38.300
Now, it turns out it's 97 mole percent, so let's see how I figured that out.

21:38.300 --> 21:43.300
Using the liquid vapor composition plot, I started with a liquid of 50 mole percent,

21:43.300 --> 21:49.300
which gives me a vapor of 80 mole percent, which gives me a condensate of 80 mole percent in the receiving flask.

21:49.300 --> 21:53.300
Now, I'm going to heat that 80 percent liquid that I've recondensed.

21:53.300 --> 22:01.300
That creates a vapor which recondenses to form a liquid with a composition of 97 mole percent benzene.

22:01.300 --> 22:04.300
Now, I've set it up here as two sequential distillations,

22:04.300 --> 22:08.300
but we'd really like to be able to do this in a system in which we can run a single run

22:08.300 --> 22:13.300
without having to build all of this, or take it apart and clean all of this at the end,

22:13.300 --> 22:15.300
or use two different sources of heat.

22:15.300 --> 22:19.300
So, in short, is there a simpler way that we can do this?

22:21.300 --> 22:25.300
The answer is yes, and we call it a fractional distillation.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.300
This is a fractional distillation scheme,

22:28.300 --> 22:33.300
and I've really only changed my simple distill by one very important thing.

22:33.300 --> 22:37.300
I've added what's called a fractionating column to it,

22:37.300 --> 22:41.300
and the insertion of this fractionating column gives lots and lots of surface area

22:41.300 --> 22:46.300
onto which my vapor as it ascends the column can condense and then revaporize,

22:46.300 --> 22:50.300
and then condense and revaporize as it climbs up the column.

22:51.300 --> 22:56.300
So, if I charge this flask with 50 mole percent benzene and then run my fractional distill,

22:56.300 --> 23:01.300
let's take a look at what goes on inside this region, this fractionating column that I've added.

23:08.300 --> 23:12.300
As I heat the sample, I'll see vapor beginning to ascend,

23:12.300 --> 23:16.300
but every time it condenses along the walls, falls into a slightly warmer region

23:16.300 --> 23:20.300
and revaporizes, it becomes more and more enriched in the more volatile component,

23:20.300 --> 23:23.300
in our case, benzene.

23:24.300 --> 23:29.300
At the, or near the base of that column, it's as though I were doing a simple distillation.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.300
I get about 80 mole percent.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.300
But if you look carefully about midway up that column,

23:34.300 --> 23:40.300
you'll notice that far fewer of my toluene molecules are making it to this location on the column.

23:40.300 --> 23:44.300
And if you go even higher, near the very, very top, really none of them are.

23:44.300 --> 23:48.300
So, if I run this particular column as I've depicted it here,

23:48.300 --> 23:51.300
collecting the vapor that exits through the top of the column,

23:51.300 --> 23:56.300
I expect to get what is essentially 100% pure benzene in a single distillation,

23:56.300 --> 24:00.300
starting with 50 mole percent benzene.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.300
So, here's how I was able to do that.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.300
I started with 50 mole percent,

24:04.300 --> 24:09.300
but my column here is running not as though a single round of distillation had taken place,

24:09.300 --> 24:12.300
creating an 80% benzene distillate,

24:12.300 --> 24:15.300
but rather as though a second one had taken place,

24:15.300 --> 24:19.300
giving 97% and then yet again a third one had taken place,

24:19.300 --> 24:26.300
finally getting me right around the limit of my diagram here to about 100% benzene.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.300
Now, when I do a single run in a fractional still,

24:29.300 --> 24:32.300
which gives me a distillate of a purity that resembles that

24:32.300 --> 24:35.300
of something that's been distilled twice or three times,

24:35.300 --> 24:41.300
I report on the efficiency of my still using a term called theoretical plates.

24:41.300 --> 24:47.300
Simply put, a 97% pure distillate would mean that my fractional still operates at two theoretical plates,

24:47.300 --> 24:52.300
because it's as though I had distilled and redestilled a second time.

24:52.300 --> 24:57.300
If instead my fractional still gives me 100% pure benzene in the first run,

24:57.300 --> 24:59.300
then it's three theoretical plates,

24:59.300 --> 25:06.300
because it's as though I've gone over and down three times on my liquid vapor composition plot.

25:06.300 --> 25:09.300
So, I've made a small change to my simple still setup from last time,

25:09.300 --> 25:13.300
inserting not only the fractionating column itself, which is here,

25:13.300 --> 25:17.300
but I've also, you'll notice, packed a little bit of steel wool inside.

25:17.300 --> 25:22.300
And the purpose of that packing is to give extra surface area on to which multiple rounds

25:22.300 --> 25:28.300
of condensation and vaporization can take place as my sample ascends the column.

25:28.300 --> 25:33.300
In fact, if you look very closely, you'll see plenty of condensation falling back down,

25:33.300 --> 25:36.300
because it's formed before the vapor actually reaches the sidearm.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.300
So, only the most volatile of components can get to the top.

25:40.300 --> 25:46.300
Now, again, in this case, I have 50-50 ethanol and water in my boiling flask.

25:46.300 --> 25:50.300
So, if I take a look at the temperature of the boiling liquid,

25:50.300 --> 25:55.300
it's no surprise that the temperature is somewhere around the mid-80 degrees centigrade.

25:55.300 --> 25:59.300
But as my sample ascends the column, let's say about halfway up,

25:59.300 --> 26:02.300
I've got another sticker here so I can measure my temperature.

26:02.300 --> 26:07.300
Now, in this case, the temperature of the ascending vapor is no longer in the high-80s.

26:07.300 --> 26:15.300
Now, it's about 80 degrees.

26:15.300 --> 26:22.300
And finally, at the top, if I measure the actual temperature of the vapor which is reaching my west condenser,

26:22.300 --> 26:30.300
I see that that vapor has a temperature of about 75 degrees.

26:30.300 --> 26:34.300
So, what I've shown you here is proof that as the vapor ascends,

26:34.300 --> 26:39.300
the boiling point of the associated combination of ethanol and water continually decreases.

26:39.300 --> 26:43.300
Now, knowing that the boiling point of ethanol is lower than that of water,

26:43.300 --> 26:49.300
it should come as no surprise that my distillate, that is, that liquid which is dripping down from the far side,

26:49.300 --> 26:52.300
is dramatically enriched in ethanol.

26:52.300 --> 26:56.300
In fact, it's just about 95% ethanol by volume.

26:56.300 --> 27:02.300
Now, powerful though distillation is as a technique, it does suffer from limitations.

27:02.300 --> 27:05.300
You may have seen this product for sale before.

27:05.300 --> 27:09.300
It's a grain alcohol beverage which is labeled 190 proof.

27:09.300 --> 27:17.300
Now, that means the mixture is 95% ethanol by volume and 5% water.

27:17.300 --> 27:21.300
If you ever saw this product on the store shelf, you might have wondered to yourself,

27:21.300 --> 27:26.300
if you're going to make alcohol that strong, why not just go for broke and make it 200 proof

27:26.300 --> 27:30.300
or 100% absolutely pure alcohol?

27:30.300 --> 27:35.300
Now, there's in fact a very good reason that the manufacturer decided to stop at 95%.

27:35.300 --> 27:42.300
It's because ethanol and water simply cannot be distilled beyond that proportion.

27:42.300 --> 27:49.300
You see, Raoult, Dalton's and ideal gas laws are just that, predictions based on ideal behavior

27:49.300 --> 27:53.300
in which gas molecules don't interact with one another significantly.

27:53.300 --> 27:59.300
And as you can imagine, the truth is often quite different from that.

27:59.300 --> 28:02.300
So because these laws are not rigorously accurate models,

28:02.300 --> 28:07.300
we often see distortions in the behavior of systems which we're trying to distill.

28:07.300 --> 28:11.300
Ethanol and water is actually a rather mild example of this.

28:11.300 --> 28:16.300
The liquid vapor phase diagram for this system looks like this.

28:16.300 --> 28:21.300
With a small local minimum at about 95% ethanol.

28:21.300 --> 28:24.300
It looks an awful lot like something we saw earlier, doesn't it?

28:24.300 --> 28:28.300
Right, it looks just like the eutectic point in melting of solids,

28:28.300 --> 28:35.300
which was very interesting because it was the only composition at which the liquid and solid were of the same composition.

28:35.300 --> 28:42.300
When the analogous feature is seen in a liquid vapor system, we call that mixture an azeotrope.

28:42.300 --> 28:47.300
This is derived from Greek terms, meaning no change on boiling.

28:47.300 --> 28:54.300
It's a very appropriate name because the vapor above the liquid is of exactly the same composition as that liquid,

28:54.300 --> 28:58.300
making distillation of such a mixture futile.

28:58.300 --> 29:05.300
A fractionating column, which reaches the moon, would not be sufficient to obtain pure ethanol by distillation.

29:05.300 --> 29:11.300
We'd have to resort to other means to chemically dry the azeotrope to make it 100% ethanol.

29:11.300 --> 29:18.300
From the perspective of an alcoholic beverage, it simply isn't worth all of the extra effort to remove that last little bit of water

29:18.300 --> 29:26.300
from a product which is most likely going to be mixed right back in with another aqueous solution to prepare a drink.

29:26.300 --> 29:29.300
So let's sum up what we've covered today.

29:29.300 --> 29:38.300
We started with a mathematical explanation for why vapors above boiling mixtures tend to be enriched in the more volatile component.

29:38.300 --> 29:47.300
We relied on the concept of vapor pressure and Raoult's, Dalton's, and ideal gas laws to support our prediction.

29:47.300 --> 29:55.300
We used the results of these calculations to construct a phase diagram, which is commonly called a liquid vapor composition plot.

29:55.300 --> 30:02.300
And we explored how these plots can be used to graphically predict the outcome of a distillation.

30:02.300 --> 30:10.300
Next, we investigated a commonly used simple distillation apparatus, which diverts vapor from boiling mixtures into a condenser,

30:10.300 --> 30:16.300
which then directs the recondensed liquid into a separate collecting flask.

30:16.300 --> 30:25.300
We also looked at a fractional distillation apparatus, which differs by the insertion of a special column between the boiling flask

30:25.300 --> 30:32.300
and still had, allowing multiple rounds of vaporization and condensation to take place in a single run.

30:32.300 --> 30:43.300
This increased efficiency can be compared to the liquid vapor composition plot to give it a numerical value in the form of theoretical plates.

30:43.300 --> 30:53.300
Next, we covered the phenomenon of azeotropes, which are undistillable mixtures of liquids which form because of non-ideal behaviors.

30:53.300 --> 30:58.300
We saw how they manifest themselves as a local minimum within the liquid vapor composition plot,

30:58.300 --> 31:07.300
making the vapor and boiling liquid identical in composition, thereby rendering distillation ineffective.

31:07.300 --> 31:14.300
So over our last two lectures, we've covered all of the phrases which we commonly encounter in the lab, solid, liquid, and vapor,

31:14.300 --> 31:24.300
and how transitioning from one state to the other can be used to purify and sometimes even identify substances in the lab.

31:24.300 --> 31:29.300
In our next lecture, we will return our attention to a different physical property, solubility.

31:29.300 --> 31:36.300
We'll see how this property can also be used as a very effective tool for isolation of non-volatile organic compounds

31:36.300 --> 31:39.300
in a process known as liquid-liquid extraction.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.300
I'll see you then.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.300
Thank you.
