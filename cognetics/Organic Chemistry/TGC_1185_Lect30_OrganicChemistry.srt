1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,860
We've spent some time now learning about the discovery of how electromagnetic waves in

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,920
and near the visible spectrum can interact with organic molecules and how we can observe

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,240
that interaction in a way which gives us information about the structure of the molecules involved.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,000
We learned how Newton's use of a prism to separate light into its constituent wavelengths

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,840
introduced the western world to the idea that visible light was made up of multiple color

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,120
components.

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,600
We saw how the discoveries of Herschel and Ritter demonstrated that there were other

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,560
types of light just outside of that visible spectrum as well.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,360
We've talked about how all three of these portions of the spectrum, ultraviolet, visible,

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,560
and infrared, interact with small molecules in the tremendous utility that these phenomena

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,720
have as tools for the identification of organic compounds.

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,360
So far we've investigated how to determine the extent of conjugation in a compound with

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,800
UV visible spectroscopy, the presence of functional groups using IR spectroscopy, and the handedness

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,920
of compounds using polarimetry.

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,120
But short of comparing the fingerprint region of IR spectra to those of known standards,

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,160
we don't really have a way to probe the connectivity of functional groups within a molecule.

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,280
So if we're making an entirely new molecule, for which there is no reference spectrum yet

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,400
in the literature, how are we going to confirm its identity?

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,760
In this lecture, we will move on to yet another region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,440
To get our answer, we're going all the way to the long wavelength end of the spectrum,

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:01,620
beyond infrared, past microwaves, all the way to the radio portion of the spectrum.

22
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,920
But before we get to our radio waves today, we'll need to try to better understand a property

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
of atoms that we haven't really discussed and which we usually think of as more within

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,280
the realm of physics than organic chemistry.

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,480
That property is magnetism.

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,720
The magnetic properties of nuclei were not well understood by Newton, Ritter, and Herschel,

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,080
and they went largely unaddressed during the development of optical spectroscopy techniques

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,560
in the 1800s.

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,520
But in the early 1900s, that all changed.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,600
In large part due to the efforts of Isidore Rebe, an American physicist who is credited

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,600
with having the revelation that atoms have certain magnetic properties which can be used

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,800
to discern them from one another in a given molecule.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,920
So to get started today, let's take one more step back and consider magnetism in general.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,120
But before we get to our radio frequency radiation, I'd like to show you this.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
It's a compass.

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,200
It's a device with which most of us, especially navigators, pilots, hikers, are familiar.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,200
A small magnetized needle is mounted on an axis which allows it to turn so that it can

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,120
align itself with whatever sort of magnetic field it's in.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,480
Of course, in the case of my compass needle, this field is generated by the Earth's rotating

40
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,720
inner core.

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,840
Now, physicists have several different units used to measure the intensity of a magnetic

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,560
field, one of which is Tesla, named for the famous and somewhat eccentric physicist Nikola

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,920
Tesla.

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,000
At its surface, the Earth's magnetic field measures about 50 milli-Tesla.

45
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,200
Here, close to Washington, D.C., this weak but ever-present field points about 11 degrees

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,800
to the west of true north.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,880
When I place this compass within the field, the needle aligns itself with that field,

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,160
giving me an indication of its direction.

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,680
So, let's assume for a moment that I could somehow remove the influence of the Earth's

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,800
magnetic field.

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,720
Now, I can't remove the Earth's magnetic field because I can't stop the core from spinning.

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,560
But what I can do is use these rare Earth magnets to pull this needle out of alignment.

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,240
Now, if there were no magnetic field, I would expect that any arrangement whatsoever of

54
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,160
this needle in space would be of equal energy.

55
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,240
So any alignment is possible.

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,840
But as soon as I remove my rare Earth's magnetic field and allow the Earth's magnetic field

57
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,720
to take over once again, this guy back out of alignment, snaps right back.

58
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,000
So as soon as I place my compass back in the field, the energy of the aligned state becomes

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,520
lower in energy than any of the other misaligned states, causing the needle to reliably and

60
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,720
predictably take on that lower energy orientation.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Now, the reason I'm showing you this, this rather mundane little magnetic tool, is that

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,400
it's a very good analogy for the behavior of certain atomic nuclei.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,840
At atomic nuclei have a property that physicists call magnetic spin.

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
I specifically mentioned physicists here because I refuse to lay the blame for this one on

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
chemists.

66
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,920
Spin, you see, is a very unfortunate choice of terminology, as it doesn't actually refer

67
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,760
to a rate of rotation as one might assume from classical mechanics.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,280
It's a common point of confusion in the study of NMR, so let's be sure we clear that up

69
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
right away.

70
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
Now for our discussion, it'll suffice to say this.

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,840
Certain atomic nuclei have a spin quantum number of one-half, which is just a fancy

72
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,240
way of saying that there are two possible magnetic states.

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,480
Such nuclei contain what is known as a magnetic dipole, or a magnetization which can behave

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,520
much like an atom-sized bar magnet or compass needle.

75
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,880
Finally, those neutrons that I encouraged you to overlook way back at the beginning of the

76
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,720
course are about to become relevant.

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,200
This is because isotopes, or atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons,

78
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,600
have different magnetic properties, and nearly every element has at least one isotope, which

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
is spin one-half.

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,840
This includes protons, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, and fluorine-19.

81
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,680
But for this lecture, we're going to confine ourselves to protons, with the caveat that

82
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,600
the same magnetic tricks I'm about to show you can be pulled with at least one isotope

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,720
of practically every commonly encountered element.

84
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,800
So let's take a look at a hydrogen nucleus.

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,160
So the magnetic dipole of certain atomic nuclei behaves in much the same way as our compass

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,520
needle did, randomly orienting itself in the absence of an external magnetic field.

87
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,080
But as soon as a magnetic field is applied, which we represent as these lines, specific

88
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,080
orientations of the nuclear dipole become more stable.

89
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,800
Now where the analogy deviates from our macroscopic example of our compass and needle is that

90
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,760
spin one-half atomic nuclei can align their dipoles either parallel to or anti-parallel

91
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,600
to a magnetic field in which they reside, leading to a distribution of those two states

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,920
in the population.

93
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,160
But the energies of the parallel state, often called the alpha spin state and the anti-parallel

94
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,840
alignment, sometimes called the beta spin state, differ by an amount which can be calculated

95
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,480
and is referred to as the Zaman splitting energy.

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,320
The Zaman splitting energy is a function of the intensity of the external magnetic field

97
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,200
and an intrinsic property of the nucleus called its gyromagnetic ratio.

98
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,960
Now by intrinsic, I mean that, for example, all protons in the universe have the exact

99
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,080
same gyromagnetic ratio.

100
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,960
So for a nucleus of a given type, the stronger the external magnetic field, the greater the

101
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,880
energy difference between the alpha and beta spin states will be.

102
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,000
Now on our way to understanding how NMR works in laboratories of the 21st century, we first

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,880
have to make a pit stop in the 1940s and 50s when the science was still being developed

104
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,000
by Rebi and his contemporaries.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,560
This historical context is going to help us to better understand the more complex instruments

106
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,320
of today.

107
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,560
So let's say that we have a collection of protons in a fairly strong external magnetic

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,480
field.

109
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,920
We expect that these protons will arrange themselves in a collection of alpha and beta

110
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,840
spin states, with just a very slight excess in the lower energy alpha state.

111
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,080
Let's say that we place our protons in a 1.4 Tesla magnetic field.

112
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,720
That's a field about 28,000 times as strong as the Earth's, powerful but attainable with

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,120
a suitable electromagnet.

114
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,320
First on the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton, 42.577 MHz per Tesla, I can calculate the

115
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,440
Zaman splitting energy difference between those two states.

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,120
Since the proton is the most frequently used nucleus in NMR experiments, we report field

117
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,820
strengths in Tesla or rarely in Tesla, more often we actually use the resonance frequency

118
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,240
of a proton in that field.

119
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,800
For example, our 1.4 Tesla magnet should bring a proton into resonance with a radiation

120
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,920
of 60 MHz in frequency.

121
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,320
So you'll notice that most modern spectrometers have a frequency splashed across the side in

122
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,040
large fonts.

123
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,080
This is the frequency that's indicated there.

124
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,120
It's a photon of that specific frequency, one with a wavelength of about 5 meters, which

125
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,920
carries just the right amount of energy to cause a proton in the alpha spin state to

126
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,360
flip into the beta spin state, absorbing the photon in the process.

127
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,360
So early spectrometers attempting to take advantage of this phenomenon consisted of

128
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:13,320
a powerful electromagnet, a radio frequency transmitter, and a radio frequency receiver.

129
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,200
A sample of organic material is placed into the magnetic field and irradiated with a constant

130
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,080
wave of a specific radio frequency.

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,480
In keeping with our example, that would be 60 MHz.

132
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,600
And this is how continuous wave NMR gets its name.

133
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,240
The current to the electromagnet is slowly increased as the exiting radio wave is monitored

134
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
at the receiver.

135
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,440
In our very simple example, at one very specific field strength, the radio wave will be absorbed

136
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,800
in the spin state transition from alpha to beta, manifesting itself as a reduced radio

137
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,560
wave intensity at the receiver.

138
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,520
So this is the basic design of a continuous wave NMR spectrometer.

139
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,800
So if you've been following so far, you probably have at least one very important question.

140
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,280
If all protons have exactly the same gyromagnetic ratio, and the field in the NMR experiment

141
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,320
is perfectly uniform, how is it that this technology is good for anything other than

142
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,400
simply detecting the presence of protons?

143
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,960
How can it possibly distinguish one proton on a molecule from another?

144
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,800
The answer to this very important question lies in a different term in the Zeeman splitting

145
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
equation.

146
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,680
It's not the gyromagnetic ratio which differs from one proton to the next, but rather the

147
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,560
exact strength of the external field at a given nucleus.

148
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,880
You see, we started with the very unrealistic example of a collection of isolated protons

149
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,700
with no other atoms or even electrons present in the system.

150
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,320
The obvious difference between this model system and the ones which a chemist might

151
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,760
want to study is that there are electron clouds and atoms of other kinds bonded to the protons

152
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,880
that we want to analyze.

153
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,280
And the real key to understanding how NMR gives us information lies in another phenomenon,

154
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,920
like shielding by electrons.

155
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,560
You see, I told a little white lie back there, at least a lie of omission.

156
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,840
I already told you the Zeeman splitting is a function of gyromagnetic ratio and the external

157
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,360
field strength, but what I left out was the fact that electron clouds have this interesting

158
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,200
ability to attenuate or weaken the external field ever so slightly.

159
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,800
Now we can think of this as a new term in the Zeeman equation in which I account for

160
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,440
a small reduction in field strength due to the shielding of the electron cloud at that

161
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,520
particular nucleus.

162
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,680
Let's take a look at some examples to see if we can drive this point home.

163
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,400
We're going to look at some hypothetical NMR spectra for four different compounds,

164
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,240
methane, chloromethane, dichloromethane, and chloroform.

165
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,000
So essentially what I've done here is started from methane and then slowly added one chlorine

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,840
atom at a time to pick it here in green until I reach the point where I have three chlorines

167
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,960
attached.

168
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,600
So let's start by thinking about methane and its electron cloud.

169
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,160
Now the electron cloud in a methane molecule is very symmetrical, isn't it?

170
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,880
There are no particularly electronegative elements.

171
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,160
The carbon-hydrogen bonds are essentially nonpolar.

172
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,320
And so there really is no distortion in this electron cloud.

173
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,800
That means that if I plot its absorption versus the applied field strength in a continuous

174
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,800
wave NMR spectrometer, I expect that it will take a fairly high field to overcome the shielding

175
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,520
that these protons are experiencing.

176
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,280
But if I move along to say chloromethane, where I've replaced one of those hydrogens

177
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,560
with a more electronegative chlorine atom, there's now a dipole within this molecule

178
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,400
and it's pulling electrons toward the chlorine and therefore away from the remaining hydrogens.

179
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,240
So its electron cloud may look more like this with a bit of a distortion because that chlorine

180
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,320
is pulling some of it more towards itself.

181
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,120
So with reduced shielding, I expect that I need a lower applied field strength to create

182
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,160
resonance and indeed that's what I see.

183
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,440
And this trend continues through dichloromethane which has two dipoles and therefore an electron

184
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,800
cloud which is even more deshielded at those protons.

185
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,640
And of course its NMR spectrum would reflect that in an even weaker applied field necessary

186
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,280
for resonance.

187
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,080
And finally chloroform where I have three of these dipoles has got a very, very deshielded

188
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,440
proton which will resonate at an even lower applied field.

189
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,320
Because of this, lower applied fields causing resonances at the, down here at the left-hand

190
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,440
side of the spectrum, we refer to this side of the spectrum as downfield, whereas we refer

191
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,120
to the higher field portion of the spectrum sometimes as upfield.

192
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,960
So a more shielded hydrogen like those in methane resonates upfield, a more deshielded

193
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,720
hydrogen like those in chloroform will resonate downfield.

194
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,800
So the density of the electron cloud at a particular nucleus can cause its peak to shift

195
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,160
within the NMR spectrum.

196
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,080
So we call this phenomenon chemical shift.

197
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,240
So we've established that protons in different chemical environments will resonate at distinct

198
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,880
applied fields because of the effects like shielding.

199
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,080
But what happens when a researcher in a lab across the country or across the globe tries

200
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,800
to reproduce my experiment?

201
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,400
What happens if his or her spectrometer produces a field strength or radio wave frequency different

202
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,320
than mine?

203
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,080
Well of course all shifts of all the protons will be different making comparisons somewhat

204
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,680
difficult.

205
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,880
So we need a method of reporting data which can be easily translated from one spectrometer

206
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,620
to the next.

207
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:14,120
We need to normalize the resonance frequencies to account for different applied field strengths.

208
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,040
We start this process by agreeing to a reference standard.

209
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,080
In the case of proton NMR, we use a compound called tetramethylsilane.

210
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,160
We use this compound because the very low electronegativity of silicon pushes electrons

211
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,680
toward the methyl groups producing a strong consistent resonance frequency which is so

212
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,680
far up field that it rarely interferes with the signals of interest.

213
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,120
So the differences in field needed to produce resonance in the protons of most organic molecules

214
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,980
is just a small fraction of 1% of the total field strength.

215
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,720
So to make the numbers more manageable, we report chemical shift in parts per million

216
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:02,120
from the absolute resonance frequency of that reference compound, TMS or tetramethylsilane.

217
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,960
So a proton resonating in a field which is 99.9999% of the strength needed to bring TMS

218
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,760
into resonance is said to be resonating at 1.0 ppm chemical shift.

219
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,960
A proton at 99.9998% of the field strength of TMS would be at 2.0 ppm chemical shift

220
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,480
and so on.

221
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,720
Treating the x-axis of my spectrum in this way not only gives me easier numbers to work

222
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,480
with but allows me to compare data collected on one instrument with data collected on another

223
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,680
instrument even if it uses a different magnetic field strength.

224
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:46,700
So parts per million has become the standard unit for NMR spectroscopy.

225
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,500
So we've considered the behavior of a hypothetical collection of protons in a magnetic field.

226
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,560
We then graduated to real, albeit very simple, organic compounds like methane and its halogenated

227
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:03,200
derivatives, all of which have only one type of proton in them.

228
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,580
But what happens when a compound has more than one kind of proton?

229
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:13,180
How would we expect a continuous wave NMR spectrum to look for a compound like that?

230
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,920
Let's answer that question with an example.

231
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,380
Let's take a look at ethyl chloride or chloroethane.

232
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,780
Now chloroethane has two chemically distinct protons.

233
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,700
These I've highlighted in red are adjacent to the chlorine atom and of course there are

234
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,940
three others that are farther away.

235
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,540
Now if I locate the resonance frequency for these two protons, I notice something very

236
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,620
interesting has taken place.

237
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,940
It's not a single peak.

238
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,960
Even though these are identical and should produce a single absorption, I actually see

239
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,480
a peak which has four distinct lobes.

240
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,120
Now the origin of these lobes is the interaction of these two protons with their neighbors.

241
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,120
See every proton, remember, is a small bar magnet and that means that whether they're

242
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,480
aligned parallel to or anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field will cause them to interact

243
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,740
differently with the adjacent protons.

244
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,620
So if I consider the effect of these protons, which I've highlighted in blue, they can interact

245
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:25,140
with the hydrogens of interest by being all spin up, there are actually three different

246
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:34,140
ways that I can combine them with two spins up and one spin down and of course there will

247
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:42,920
also be three potential ways to combine them with two spins down and one spin up.

248
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,640
And the final permutation that's possible with three is to have all spin down.

249
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,800
So in the case where all of the neighbors are spin up, they add just a little bit of

250
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,000
magnetic field to what's experienced by those causing the signal and that means it requires

251
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,720
just a little bit less of an applied magnetic field to cause resonance.

252
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,300
That's why what should be, in theory, a single signal is actually split into four.

253
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,500
So these are the source of that multiplicity.

254
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,980
Similarly, I can look at the resonance frequency of these three hydrogens and say they must

255
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,740
be coupled to or interacting with my red hydrogens.

256
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,420
Now with two hydrogens interacting, I have the possibility of having them both spin up,

257
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,760
two possibilities in which I have one up, one down, and my final possibility in which

258
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,240
they're both spin down.

259
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,000
So in this case, my blue hydrogens should create a resonance with three lobes.

260
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,520
So we refer to this phenomenon as magnetic coupling and the resulting shape of the peaks

261
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,020
as multiplets.

262
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:59,080
They follow a rule known as the n plus one rule which simply states that we have n plus

263
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,040
one lobes per multiplet where n is the number of coupled hydrogens.

264
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,800
So my red hydrogens are coupled to three neighbors creating a peak with four lobes.

265
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:15,140
My blue hydrogens are coupled to two neighbors creating a peak with three lobes.

266
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,080
In most simple situations where we're dealing with saturated compounds with free rotation,

267
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,540
this rule holds pretty well.

268
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,180
So let's take a look at some multiplet features that we may see in an MR specter as we go

269
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
forward.

270
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,660
Of course the simplest where n equals one we call a doublet.

271
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,980
When there are two coupled partners, we get what we call a triplet.

272
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,900
Three produces a quartet and so on with four making a quintet and five making a sextet

273
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
and so on.

274
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,580
Now in many cases they become so complex around this point that we stop referring to them

275
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,240
by their individual names and simply refer to them collectively as multiplets.

276
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,040
Now the intensity of the lobes within the multiplet is also useful information.

277
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,440
So we'd like to be able to predict that as well and we can.

278
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,440
For example a doublet is always one to one whereas a triplet is one to two to one and

279
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,680
a quartet one to three to three to one and the pattern continues, remember this is because

280
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:18,080
of all the different permutations of alpha and beta spin states for the coupling partners.

281
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,100
Now what's really great is if you forget this pattern you can easily recreate it using a

282
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,060
geometric mnemonic.

283
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,300
That geometric mnemonic is known as Pascal's Triangle.

284
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,620
So we can simply create a series in which we add adjacent numbers as we go down so one

285
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,540
plus two equals three, for example here three plus three equals six, etc.

286
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,600
And Pascal's Triangle allows us to predict the multiplicity in any instance where we have

287
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,720
multiple coupling partners in simple situations like these.

288
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,740
So we're now ready to get just a small taste of the power NMR has to reveal structural

289
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,740
information.

290
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,620
We're going to begin with a very simple example but one which clearly shows how we can gather

291
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:07,620
structural information which would not be available to us from the UV-Vis, IR or polarimetry

292
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,780
experiments that we have covered so far.

293
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,740
We're going to do it using a relatively simple molecule or set of molecules and that is the

294
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,080
structural isomers of chloropropane.

295
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:26,280
So let's construct some hypothetical NMR spectra for the two different isomers of chloropropane.

296
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,200
We'll start with two chloropropane.

297
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,080
So here I have my chlorine attached at the central atom and because of this I'm going

298
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,880
to have a spectrum which has two different resonances.

299
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,120
Now it's worth mentioning here I've exaggerated the multiplicities a little bit, I've spaced

300
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,340
them out a little bit wider than you might see them in an actual spectrum so that they're

301
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:51,140
easy for us to see but their position within the spectrum is accurate.

302
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,260
So we see that there are two different kinds of protons in this two chloropropane.

303
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,740
First there are the six methyl protons which are all exactly the same as one another.

304
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,060
Now because they're chemically identical to one another they don't couple to each other

305
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:12,060
but they do have one coupling partner in this proton right here in the center of the molecule.

306
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,400
And it has its own resonance which is split by its six non-equivalent neighbors.

307
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,640
So just as we would expect from our previous discussions on multiplicity we have a very

308
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,600
large doublet which corresponds to these six hydrogens highlighted in blue and a relatively

309
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,320
small multiplet produced by this single hydrogen which is split by many coupling partners.

310
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,960
Now if we take a closer look we can see the multiplicity is exactly as we would predict

311
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:50,100
using Pascal's Triangle and that this is actually a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and plus 1 right this is

312
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,660
a septet.

313
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:58,340
So our septet at 3.7 parts per million tells us we have a proton with many coupling partners

314
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,740
very close to an electron withdrawing group and our doublet at 1.1 parts per million tells

315
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,940
us that we have some protons which have a single coupling partner and that those protons

316
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:16,520
are farther away from the electron withdrawing group because they resonate upfield.

317
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,780
So how can we use this spectrum in comparison to say one chloropropane and distinguish between

318
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,540
these two compounds?

319
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,980
Let's take a look at one chloropropane right now.

320
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,300
So when I put my chlorine at the end of the molecule rather than in the center it has

321
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:38,260
very important and profound effect on the number of resonances that I see.

322
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,380
My spectrum is a little bit more complicated now isn't it?

323
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,600
That's because by placing the chlorine at the end I've created three distinct chemical

324
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,480
environments for the protons in the molecule.

325
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,900
Those that are directly on the carbon bearing the chlorine, those one bond away and those

326
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,100
that are two bonds away.

327
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,760
So I expect to see three distinct resonances which I do but not only that their multiplicities

328
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,240
are different than those in my previous example.

329
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,000
So in this case I have a triplet that is way upfield which tells me I've got some hydrogens

330
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,340
that are very far away from any electron withdrawing groups and have two non-equivalent neighbors

331
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,960
to which they are magnetically coupled.

332
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,560
I also have a little bit more complicated multiplet here.

333
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,920
This one would be called a sexted and that tells me that I've got some protons which

334
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,800
are a little bit closer to the electron withdrawing group and are coupled to five distinct partners.

335
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,160
One, two, three, four, five.

336
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,760
Finally I have another triplet which is farther downfield telling me that I must have some

337
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,640
protons that are very close to the electron withdrawing chlorine and are coupled to two

338
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,880
partners which is a perfect description of these two protons highlighted in red coupled

339
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,120
to their neighbors in blue.

340
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,880
So this spectrum having a triplet at .8, a sexted at 1.6 and another triplet at 3.3 allows

341
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,640
me to very clearly and unambiguously assign that it's one chloropropane.

342
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,600
So let's review the material from this lecture.

343
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,080
We started by considering a property of atomic nuclei known as spin and how certain isotopes

344
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,280
of certain atoms have a spin of one half, giving them two possible spin states when

345
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,160
an external magnetic field is applied.

346
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,280
There's the low energy parallel state called alpha and the high energy anti-parallel state

347
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,040
called beta.

348
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,000
We discussed how the energy difference between these states known as the Zeeman splitting

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,360
corresponds to the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum and is proportional

350
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,920
to the strength of the magnetic field with which the nuclei are aligning themselves.

351
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,680
We took a look at the design of early spectrometers in which a continuous radio frequency wave

352
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,620
is shined on a sample as the strength of an applied field is varied until resonance is

353
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,240
achieved resulting in an absorption of the radio wave.

354
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,800
We then looked at how the shielding and induced fields provided by electrons can cause the

355
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,800
magnetic field at protons within a molecule to be slightly different, leading us to the

356
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,960
calculations of chemical shift.

357
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,460
Finally, we discussed the phenomenon of magnetic spin-spin coupling in which non-equivalent

358
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:39,600
nuclei which are three bonds away from one another can share magnetization splitting

359
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,000
resonances into a set of lobes called a multiplet.

360
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,220
Next time, we'll take our discussion into the new millennium and look at what is known

361
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,160
as pulsed or Fourier transform NMR.

362
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,240
We'll also take a brief look at a few other techniques used to characterize molecules,

363
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,320
specifically x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry.

364
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,960
I'll see you for that discussion next time.
