1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,600
It's happened to us all at one time or another.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,320
You sneak down to the kitchen in the dark in the middle of the night for a late night

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,840
snack and just as you're about to reach for that last cupcake on the counter, the lights

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,520
flip on.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,560
Through your dilated pupils flooded with light, struggle to make out the image of your wife.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,060
Arms folded, foot tapping.

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,720
Of course, your pupils quickly constrict in an attempt to limit the amount of light reaching

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,960
the receptors in the back of your eye, but it's already too late.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,440
The torrent of photons has done its damage, and you seem to suffer the ill effects of

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,880
the overexposure for the next 10 or 20 minutes.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,360
Have you ever wondered what's going on inside your eyes in situations like this?

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,360
And aside from the conundrum of why your wife doesn't want you to enjoy that last delicious

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,120
morsel before bed, there's also the mystery of why it takes so long to recover your normal

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,960
vision after she springs her trap.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,640
The answer to this riddle lies in the structure and behavior of pie bonds and the molecules

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,440
responsible for vision, and its alkenes and alkynes, hydrocarbons sharing the same structural

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,960
feature as the receptors in your eyes that are the topic of today's lecture.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,040
Now you should recall from our lecture on bonding that the first bond between any two atoms

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,120
in organic chemistry is almost always a sigma bond.

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,880
The electrons in these bonds occupy an area along the internuclear axis, so they can rotate

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,160
like the axle of a car without any meaningful energetic input.

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,000
But pie bonds are very different.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,480
During the formation of double and triple bonds, the second and third bonds have to find a

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,560
different region of space to inhabit, one which still screens the two nuclei from one

25
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,400
another but doesn't occupy the space directly between them since the original sigma bond

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,720
electrons already have claimed to that space.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:22,480
So pie bonds form as a consequence of side-on overlap of unhybridized atomic P orbitals.

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,820
The shape of the P orbitals allows them to overlap in a region above and below the internuclear

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,520
axis.

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
This leads to two distinct differences between pie bonds and sigma bonds, and we've discussed

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
both of these consequences in earlier lectures, but they bear repeating here.

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,200
The first is that double and triple bonds can't rotate freely the way single bonds can.

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,700
Rotation of the bond would require that the pie bond be broken completely, leaving only

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,360
the remaining sigma bond intact, restoring the rotation.

35
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,840
I can then stop the rotation and restore my pie bond.

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,440
Now the second is that pie bonds are weaker than sigma bonds.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,200
Being located in a less centralized molecular orbital means that pie electrons tend to be

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,940
held less tightly in the resulting bonding orbital.

39
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,000
This means that less energy is required to break a pie bond.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,280
And when we test the overall bonding energy, we see that a carbon-carbon single bond requires

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,080
about 348 kilojoules of energy to break one mole of those bonds.

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,120
When we look for a carbon-carbon double bond energy, we see that it requires about 614

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,160
kilojoules to break a mole of these bonds.

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,320
Assuming of course that the sigma bonds in both of these motifs are of similar energy,

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,400
we can easily calculate that it requires about 266 kilojoules to break a mole of pie bonds,

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,780
compared to 348 kilojoules for a similar number of sigma bonds.

47
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,920
This means that it's possible to break just a pie bond of a double bond while leaving

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,560
the sigma bond intact, if the proper energy is provided.

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:11,840
So the atoms can be kept connected even while free rotation is temporarily restored.

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,200
Pie bonds make up the second and third pair of electrons in double and triple bonds respectively.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,400
Yet there's no such thing as a quadruple bond in introductory organic chemistry.

52
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
So why is this?

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,560
Well, the reason is rooted in the geometry of P orbitals.

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,320
Now that pie bonds are formed by the side-on overlap of P atomic orbitals, and this naturally

55
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,880
requires that the orbitals be aligned parallel and adjacent to one another.

56
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,800
So let's take another look at that double bond.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,680
In this case, double bonds are made from one sigma bond and one pie bond, having that pie

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
bond above and below the inter-nuclear axis.

59
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,320
So the bond angles around these atoms that are involved in the pie bond is about 120

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,120
degrees.

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,920
If I add a triple bond, I need a region of space to put a new P orbital overlap, so I

62
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,640
can put my two P orbitals which overlap, moving into and out of the plane of the screen here.

63
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,400
So I have yet another pie bond, and now bond angles of 180 degrees among all the atoms.

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,400
But a quadruple bond in this case is impossible, because that last P orbital is not aligned

65
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,440
in such a way that the end-on overlap can be achieved.

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,360
So it's physically, geometrically impossible to obtain the orbital alignments required

67
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,440
to form a carbon-carbon quadruple bond.

68
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,240
So as far as we're concerned in this course, a quadruple bond to a carbon is just as great

69
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:50,680
an offense as an expanded octet would be for a carbon atom with five bonds.

70
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,120
Now hydrocarbons, like alkanes, consisting of only sigma bonded hydrogen and carbon atoms

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,920
are called saturated hydrocarbons.

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,880
Conversely, those hydrocarbons which contain pie bonds are sometimes collectively referred

73
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,560
to as unsaturated hydrocarbons.

74
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,160
This reference is born from the fact that each time I introduce a pie bond to a hydrocarbon,

75
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,760
I have to remove two substituents from the molecule to accommodate it.

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,880
Introduction of a double bond here requires that I remove two hydrogens, and a triple

77
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,720
bond requires that I remove four.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:33,960
So alkanes are saturated with hydrogens, but there are hydrocarbons which are not.

79
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,680
So at the most basic level of organization, I have saturated hydrocarbons, which are also

80
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,880
called alkanes, and two classes of unsaturated hydrocarbons, those with a double bond, which

81
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,200
we call alkenes, and those with a triple bond, which we call alkynes.

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,560
So now we understand the geometries of multiple bonds and the classes of hydrocarbons they

83
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,360
create a little bit better.

84
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,960
Let's continue our discussion by considering the simplest possible hydrocarbon containing

85
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,320
a double bond, ethene, also known by its more common name, ethylene.

86
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,160
Ethylene is a naturally occurring alkene and a plant hormone which is critical to the

87
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,040
ripening process and a number of fruits and vegetables.

88
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,920
It's also the single most produced organic molecule in the world, valued for its use

89
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,640
as a synthetic starting material, as well as for its amazing power to ripen foodstuffs.

90
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,360
We take a look at the structure of ethylene, we see that it has a single pi bond.

91
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,200
Propylene contains an extra carbon, but still a single pi bond.

92
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,080
And butylene would be one containing four carbons with one pi bond.

93
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,840
But when we reach butylene, we have to consider the fact that there are different isomers

94
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,600
which can form.

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,200
So here I have what I call alpha butylene in which the double bond is at the end of

96
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,280
the molecule, but with four carbons introduced, it's now possible to make beta butylene.

97
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:11,080
In fact, beta butylene can exist in one of two stereoisomers, cis beta butylene or trans

98
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,600
beta butylene.

99
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,400
They all have the same empirical molecular formula.

100
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:26,520
So ethylene is C2H4, propylene is C3H6, and my butylenes are C4H8, or a generic formula

101
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,000
of CNH2N, where N is an integer number.

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,920
Now moving on to alkynes, the simplest of all alkynes is acetylene.

103
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,440
Now this is a standalone alkyne, there's only one kind like it itself, and that's because

104
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,920
acetylene has hydrogens attached, remember chain terminating hydrogens, attached to both

105
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,640
of the carbons involved in the triple bond.

106
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,560
Whereas the next most complex would be methyl acetylene, and this particular molecule would

107
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,240
be called a terminal alkyne, because one side of the triple bond is continued by another

108
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,720
R group or another bond to carbon, whereas one end of it is terminated and capped off

109
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,800
by that hydrogen.

110
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,000
The final example I'm going to show you here is dimethyl acetylene, in which we have what

111
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,320
we call an internal alkyne, because both of the carbons involved in the triple bond are

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,880
bonded to other carbons themselves.

113
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,640
Now the formula for these compounds are C2H2, C3H4, and C4H6.

114
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,360
So though they don't have identical empirical formula, they do follow a mathematical formula

115
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:48,920
of CnH2n-2.

116
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,920
So far in this lecture we've discussed a few simple hydrocarbons which have pi bonds.

117
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,400
I've used common names to refer to a few simple alkenes and alkynes, but just like any other

118
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,840
class of compounds, there's an IUPAC system which can be used to name them as well.

119
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,760
The presence of weaker and therefore more reactive pi bonds gives alkenes and alkynes

120
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,240
a special place among motifs in nomenclature.

121
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,760
We call them functional groups rather than substituents, and as functional groups they

122
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,600
receive special attention in IUPAC nomenclature.

123
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
So these and all other functional groups are indicated not at the beginning of a molecule's

124
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,480
name like substituents are, but rather at the end.

125
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,800
Alright, so let's begin by giving some simple IUPAC names to some of the simplest possible

126
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,120
alkenes and alkynes.

127
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,600
Let's start with ethene.

128
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,880
So named because it has two carbons, hence the eth prefix, and a double bond giving it

129
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,280
the ene suffix.

130
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,760
If I instead have a triple bond between two carbons, I call my molecule eth-ine.

131
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,000
Again, eth for two carbons, i-ine indicating that they're separated by a triple bond.

132
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,840
Now, adding another carbon to this gives me propene and propine.

133
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,720
I can continue adding carbons to my unsaturated hydrocarbons to get butene, but when I get

134
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,200
to this point, again I have four atoms so I have to consider isomerism.

135
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,360
So in this case I use an IUPAC convention to designate the location of the double bond

136
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,280
by giving the number of the first carbon in the chain containing that double bond.

137
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,800
So since in this case my double bond is at the end of the chain, I'll call this one butene

138
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,640
or bute-one-ine as the IUPAC conventions have changed in the 1990s and you'll hear them

139
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,280
used both ways, both the old and the new.

140
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,760
Similarly, we can look at an alkyne the same way.

141
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,160
With four carbons we need to designate the location of the triple bond in this example

142
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,280
it's at the end so this is one butene or bute-one-ine.

143
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:07,520
And then moving on, I have two butene which actually has multiplisomers and I can also

144
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,760
place my triple bond in the center giving myself two butene or bute-two-ine.

145
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,800
But as the size of alkenes and alkynes grows and the number and complexity of their substituents

146
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,640
increases, using a common nomenclature system just isn't going to take care of the job

147
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
anymore.

148
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,280
So we have to switch over to IUPAC.

149
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:35,840
So let's try a few IUPAC rules out on alkenes and alkynes keeping in mind that the pi-bonds

150
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,840
are not substituents but functional groups so we're going to have to change our rules

151
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,360
a little bit to treat them specially.

152
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,880
Now here's an alkyne, let's try to name this using our IUPAC rules considering the following

153
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
changes.

154
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,560
The functional group must have the lowest possible number regardless of other substituents and

155
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,940
also we're going to end our parent compound with ene or ein depending on whether it's

156
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,680
a double or triple bond.

157
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,080
So in our first example, we have a carbon chain with one, two, three, four, five, six

158
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
atoms total.

159
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,280
It may not be readily apparent because remember the bond angles in alkynes are 180 degrees.

160
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,360
So our parent compound is highlighted in orange.

161
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,040
The alkyne is here between these two carbons.

162
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,720
So this is going to be a hexine molecule.

163
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,840
Now my hexine molecule has a methyl substituent because there's one carbon here, methyl is

164
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,640
the name of that substituent.

165
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,600
And I can number my chain one of two ways either from left to right which puts the methyl

166
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,120
at two and my alkyne at four since we use the lowest numbered carbon that contains that

167
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:59,320
pi bond or we can number from right to left which would give a two and a five.

168
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,840
Now even though it gives overall higher numbers, I'm going to choose the numbering system that

169
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,760
gives the lowest number to the functional group because it gets priority.

170
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,080
So I'm going to name this compound five methyl to hexine.

171
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Let's try one more.

172
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,240
How about this alkyne?

173
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Well step one is to find the longest chain.

174
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,200
Well the longest chain in the whole molecule is here but there's a problem with that.

175
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,640
It doesn't contain the functional group.

176
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,320
So I can't use this six carbon chain instead I'll have to use this six carbon chain or

177
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,040
excuse me this five carbon chain, one, two, three, four, five.

178
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,240
Even though it's smaller it contains the pi bond.

179
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
So this is going to be a pentene molecule.

180
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,760
My pentene molecule has an ethyl substituent with two carbons and again numbering my parent

181
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,920
hydrocarbon giving the pi bond the lowest possible number will give me this numbering

182
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,040
scheme where my lowest numbered carbon in the pi bond is one and the number of the carbon

183
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,680
bearing the ethyl group is two.

184
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:17,360
So this will be a two ethyl one pentene.

185
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,200
Now we've already looked at how both structural isomerism and stereoisomerism is possible in

186
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,240
alkenes meaning that a wide variety of alkyne structures is possible with just a few carbon

187
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,440
and hydrogen atoms.

188
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,040
These resulting isomers can and often do have differing chemical properties which are of

189
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,920
interest to us.

190
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,200
No discussion on the topic of alkenes is complete without a mention of two of the most influential

191
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,440
chemists in the development of their understanding.

192
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,200
Vladimir Markovnikov and Alexander Zetsev.

193
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,160
Markovnikov and Zetsev were contemporaries studying under another great chemist, Alexander

194
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,280
Butlerov in the Russian system in the 1870s.

195
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,640
These two shared a striking number of commonalities.

196
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,040
Both had entered the Russian university system as students of economics.

197
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,120
Both were wooed to a career study in chemistry by the revered chemist Butlerov and both made

198
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,960
some of their greatest contributions to the field of chemistry by uncovering rules dictating

199
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,280
reactivity and stability involving alkenes.

200
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,200
Now final similarity, one which may have had the greatest influence on their careers was

201
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:36,600
their unabashed mutual disdain and burning desire to one up one another.

202
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,320
The origins of their personal conflicts are lost to history, but however strained their

203
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,760
personal relationship might have been, the field of organic chemistry undoubtedly benefited

204
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,560
from it.

205
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,120
The resulting rivalry drove them to make discoveries about some of the most basic tenets governing

206
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,520
the chemistry of alkenes.

207
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,160
As our course progresses, we will learn rules bearing the names of both of these great inventories.

208
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:08,680
With respect to stability of alkenes, Markovnikov believed that less substituted alkenes like

209
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,360
this one butene were more stable.

210
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,000
While Zetzev held the opposing view that the more substituted alkenes isomer, like two

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,040
butene, would be more stable.

212
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,520
It may seem like a minor point to quibble over, but at the time the science of organic chemistry

213
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,800
was just beginning to blossom.

214
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,800
So both men knew that the answer to such a question would have a monumental bearing on

215
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,600
our understanding of the most fundamental tenets of organic chemistry.

216
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,640
Greatness was at stake, and both men knew it.

217
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,200
In this crucial debate, it was Zetzev who proved victorious when he published a paper

218
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
in 1875.

219
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,200
We already have the tools needed to make his prediction for ourselves.

220
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,640
You may remember that we discussed hyperconjugation previously, how adjacent alkyl groups can

221
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,920
interact favorably with p orbitals.

222
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,840
Well, just like radicals, alkenes have p orbitals.

223
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,000
And because of that, if there are adjacent r-groups which have their bonding orbitals

224
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,600
aligned with that pi system, the electrons from the adjacent bond can participate with

225
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,400
the pi electrons, giving a larger system through which they can move.

226
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,160
And we all know that when you extend the region through which electrons can move, you increase

227
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,760
the stability of the species.

228
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,240
Now Zetzev used an alcohol dehydration reaction, which we're going to look at in a future lecture,

229
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,240
to demonstrate that alkenes of higher substitution are indeed more stable.

230
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,960
Zetzev needed to use this system because, frankly, it was one of the very few understood

231
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,040
reactions in his day.

232
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,920
But this part of the story is going to have to wait for another lecture.

233
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,760
Modern chemists can much more easily verify Zetzev's conclusions.

234
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,880
Today we often compare the stability of unsaturated hydrocarbons using the technique of calorimetry.

235
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,920
Remember that in a calorimetry experiment, a reaction is allowed to run to completion

236
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,440
in a closed, well-insulated vessel.

237
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,560
And the temperature of the contents is then monitored.

238
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,640
On completion of the reaction, the amount of chemical potential energy gained or lost

239
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,320
by the reacting molecules is proportional to the temperature change of the surroundings

240
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
within the calorimeter.

241
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,040
Take our example of the two structural isomers of butene, the simplest alkene to have both

242
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,720
structural isomers and stereoisomers.

243
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,480
It's obvious that one butene is unique from two butene, and that one butene has only a

244
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,520
single stereoisomer because one of its alkene carbons has two hydrogen substituents.

245
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,920
Two butene, however, can exist in two different stereoisomeric states.

246
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,480
But which of these three isomers is most stable, and how can we tell?

247
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,280
If we want to compare the relative stability of several related alkenes, we can simply

248
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,560
convert samples of each molecule into their saturated counterparts in a calorimeter using

249
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,680
a reaction known as hydrogenation.

250
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,920
Hydrogenation is a process which saturates alkenes and alkynes using hydrogen gas.

251
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,760
Essentially we're trading two hydrogen atoms for each pi bond in the starting material.

252
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,180
We investigate the details of how and why this reaction happens during our lecture on

253
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,440
addition reactions, but for now let's just focus on the starting materials in the products.

254
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,060
Take a look at all three hydrogenation reactions.

255
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:52,500
They all start with one mole of alkene, one mole of hydrogen, and end with the exact same

256
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,300
product, butane.

257
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,500
Because the only difference among the reactions is the identity of the alkene, any difference

258
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,500
in the amount of heat released in the reaction must be a reflection of the differences in

259
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,440
the free energies of those alkenes.

260
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,100
In other words, hydrogenation of less stable alkenes releases more heat, causing a greater

261
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,980
temperature change in the calorimeter.

262
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,960
Conducting our simple calorimetry experiment gives us great insight into the factors affecting

263
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,980
alkene stability.

264
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,740
An equal quantity of one butene releases more heat when hydrogenated, which validates Zetzev's

265
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,480
rule.

266
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,480
We also see that not only is Zetzev's rule validated, but the geometric arrangement

267
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,320
of larger substituents also appears to affect stability somewhat, with E2 butene being more

268
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,360
stable than Z2 butene.

269
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,280
The difference in stability between the E and Z isomers is usually attributed to sterics,

270
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,200
that is, the physical proximity of substituent electron clouds in the molecule, placing two

271
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,760
larger alkyl substituents closer to one another as in the Z isomer, causes a natural repulsion

272
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,120
which is not present when those substituents are at opposition in the E isomer.

273
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Not surprisingly, internal alkenes also prove more stable than their external counterparts.

274
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,040
So we see the same trend that Zetzev would predict for internal and terminal alkenes,

275
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:33,840
though the linear geometry of these compounds precludes any geometric isomerism.

276
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,160
So let's return now to our introductory story.

277
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,640
What goes on chemically when your eyes are overexposed to light?

278
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,160
Or for that matter, when your eyes are exposed to normal levels of light?

279
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,000
The rods and cones in your eyes contain specific molecules which interact with light.

280
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,920
We call molecules like this chromophores.

281
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,320
The chromophore responsible for your vision is called retinol, and it looks like this.

282
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,840
Now retinol has a number of alkene groups, all of which we know from our earlier calorimetry

283
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:16,280
data should be most stable when in the trans or E configuration.

284
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:22,560
But the retinol in your eyes has one double bond in the cis or Z-confirmation.

285
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,400
It's locked in this way because of the pi bond on the 11th carbon of the chain.

286
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:34,320
So this 11-cis retinol wants to be all trans retinol, but it can't get there without some

287
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,500
help.

288
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,440
The help comes in the form of photons, light.

289
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,440
When a photon of appropriate energy strikes the retinol molecule, breaking just the pi

290
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:54,400
bond on the 11th carbon, sterics calls the C11-C12 bond to rotate before re-establishing

291
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,320
the pi bond in the more stable trans configuration.

292
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,320
This change in the shape of retinol, promoted by absorption of light, induces a conformational

293
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,800
change in a protein to which it's bound.

294
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,920
And this starts a cascade of electrochemical signaling which your brain ultimately interprets

295
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,260
as vision.

296
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:24,000
An enzyme known as retinol isomerase then resets the alkene bond in retinol to the higher

297
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,340
energy, 11-cis-confirmation, making it ready to detect light again.

298
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,680
This process takes a little bit of time, which explains why it becomes difficult to see for

299
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,400
several minutes after exposure to a very bright light.

300
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,440
So the light sensors in your eyes are really just an elegant application of the concepts

301
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,800
we've been discussing in this lecture.

302
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,280
So I hope we can all agree now that structural and stereoisomerism make alkenes very interesting

303
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,960
to us.

304
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,540
Now it's time for alkynes to take the spotlight.

305
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,160
We know from the geometry of a carbon-carbon triple bond that alkynes are not capable of

306
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,200
that kind of stereoisomerism that makes alkenes so fascinating.

307
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
But it doesn't make them uninteresting.

308
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,080
Alkines have properties all their own which make them interesting to organic chemists.

309
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,480
One very interesting property of alkynes is their acidity.

310
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,240
Now it should be evident that internal alkynes don't have a very acidic proton since all

311
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,280
of their hydrogens are on sp3 carbons, just like an alkane.

312
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,360
The pKa of a terminal alkyne however is about 26, which may seem like a very weak acid and

313
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,280
in fact it is.

314
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,320
But compared to the acidity of alkenes with the pKa of 44 and of alkenes whose pKa is

315
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,440
about 60, alkynes start to look like a pretty acidic compound.

316
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,560
So at a pKa of 26, terminal alkynes are weak acids in the overall scheme of things but

317
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,840
they are rock stars of acidity among hydrocarbons.

318
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,680
In fact there are just a few bases available to us in the laboratory, albeit very strong

319
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,240
ones which are capable of deprotonating terminal alkynes.

320
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,320
Most notable of these is the amide ion, the conjugate acid of ammonia, which has a pKa

321
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,480
of about 35.

322
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,800
Easy to work with, no.

323
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,400
But available, yes.

324
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,640
So what's the source of the acidity in compounds like acetylene or propyne?

325
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,440
The answer is that alkyne carbons are sp hybridized.

326
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,360
Now heterolytically breaking the CH bond means that both bonding electrons will go to the

327
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,540
carbon.

328
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:54,240
This means that the hybrid orbital into which the bonding electrons go has about 50% s-character

329
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,360
as opposed to about 33% s-character for an alkene and 25% s-character for an alkane.

330
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,000
S orbitals hold their electrons tighter and closer to the nucleus than dupi orbitals of

331
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,360
the same principal energy level.

332
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,760
So a more s-character in a hybrid orbital means a more stable lone pair in that orbital.

333
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,560
And a more stable conjugate base means a more acidic conjugate acid.

334
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,800
These deprotonated alkynes are remarkably reactive compared to neutral hydrocarbons.

335
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,240
And we'll see in a few lectures how these deprotonated alkynes can prove very useful

336
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,480
reagents in the synthesis of other organic compounds.

337
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,000
So far we've concerned ourselves with relatively simple, straight and branched alkenes and

338
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
alkynes.

339
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,440
But just as alkenes can be cyclic, so can alkenes and alkynes.

340
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,960
In fact, we already saw an example of this during our discussion of chirality when we

341
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,800
analyzed the stereochemistry of limony.

342
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,640
Cyclic alkenes and cyclic alkynes follow many of the same rules as cyclic alkenes, but with

343
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
two important considerations.

344
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,960
First, just like with linear and branched hydrocarbons, the presence of the pi system

345
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,640
usually makes them much more reactive than similar alkane counterparts.

346
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,720
Second, the inclusion of a double bond with sp2 carbons and angles of about 120 degrees

347
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,080
or a triple bond with sp carbons in a bond angle of about 180 degrees can significantly

348
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,240
affect the ring strain of a cyclic hydrocarbon.

349
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,920
Just take the example of cyclohexane.

350
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,160
If we add a pi bond making cyclohexane, we create a molecule with bond angle strains

351
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,240
forced upon it by the presence of four coplanar atoms from the alkene motif.

352
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,480
Nonetheless, there are many examples of this motif in nature, including our familiar limony

353
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,960
from the rinds of citrus fruits.

354
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,560
Cyclicization of small alkenes also has the important effect of stabilizing the cis isomer.

355
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,840
Recall that when we looked at linear alkenes, we saw how heats of combustion demonstrate

356
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,680
that the trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer.

357
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:20,160
But in the case of cyclohexane, the trans isomer is impossible to make.

358
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,080
So I've built a model here, including six atoms.

359
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,720
And within these six atoms, I placed a single double bond here, one double bond.

360
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:37,120
Now if I cyclize this with a cis double bond, I have a pretty good, pretty stable looking

361
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,400
model here.

362
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,960
Maybe not quite as good as cyclohexane, but pretty close.

363
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,800
But what happens if I try to convert this double bond from a cis into a trans?

364
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,320
Well in the case of a six-membered ring, I'm going to break my model kit.

365
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,920
Notice how badly distorted this double bond is just to accommodate what I've attempted.

366
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,440
It's essentially impossible to create this structure.

367
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,920
In fact, in order to be able to create such a structure, a cyclic alkene that is in the

368
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,360
trans confirmation requires at least seven atoms.

369
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,200
Now here I have eight so that I don't break two model kits on one day.

370
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,600
Again, very, very easy to create a cis alkene that looks fairly stable.

371
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:31,520
But if I try to make the trans alkene, although I can, definitely doesn't look like a very

372
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,840
happy molecule.

373
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Clearly there's additional ring strain.

374
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,720
Many of my bonds are in poor bond angles and I've had to develop some new clashes from

375
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,880
eclipsing interactions as well.

376
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,680
So in the case of seven, eight, nine, or ten atoms, we can make the trans but not very

377
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
stable.

378
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:59,320
In fact, we have to get all the way to eleven atoms before we reach the point where a trans

379
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,000
isomer is actually more stable once again.

380
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,480
When we reach eleven atoms, we have enough conformational flexibility that my double

381
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,760
bond in the trans configuration is tolerated very well.

382
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,520
I can find lots of good stable conformations, which give it lots of room, and I don't break

383
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,520
the double bond and I can reuse it later.

384
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,640
Now take your model kit.

385
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,040
Try to make cyclohexine.

386
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,080
The 180 degree bond angle in the alkyne part of that system makes it almost geometrically

387
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,440
impossible for this molecule to exist.

388
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,920
I say almost because the carbon-carbon triple bond of an alkyne is about 20 percent shorter

389
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,240
than a typical carbon-carbon single bond.

390
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,600
Now this means that cyclohexine can theoretically exist and it probably does form as a high

391
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,000
energy intermediate in certain reactions, but it can't be isolated and bottled like

392
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,560
it's cyclohexene and cyclohexane cousins.

393
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,760
Of course larger cyclic alkynes do exist.

394
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,640
Cyclo-octyne for example is the smallest cyclic alkyne which is stable enough to be prepared

395
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
and collected.

396
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,080
So in this lecture we investigated how pi bonds change the chemistry of hydrocarbons.

397
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,640
We took a look at how the geometry of the orbitals involved results in a weaker bond

398
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,440
than their sigma-conner parts, but which restricts rotation about carbon-carbon bonds and also

399
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,240
carbon-carbon triple bonds.

400
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,320
We discussed alkenes, hydrocarbons containing double bonds, as well as alkynes, hydrocarbons

401
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,540
containing triple bonds.

402
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,200
We saw how these double and triple bonds are reactive and therefore are treated with higher

403
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,720
priority in nomenclature than the simple alkyl substituents.

404
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,960
We call these higher priority reactive motifs functional groups.

405
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,560
We took a look at one of the great chemistry rivalries of all time, that between Markovnikov

406
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,660
and Zetzev over trends in the stability of alkenes.

407
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,840
We investigated how their work led to our understanding of trends in stability among

408
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,640
various regio and stereoisomers of the same molecular formula.

409
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,160
We took a look at how the function of a biologically relevant molecule, retinol, is tied to these

410
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:25,520
trends in stability, that the spontaneous conversion of retinol from 11 cis to all trans

411
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,120
conformations takes place when a photon temporarily breaks the associated pi bond.

412
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,560
Next, we covered the unusual acidity of terminal alkynes and how the presence of a hydrogen

413
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,520
on an SP-hybridized carbon is a rare structural feature which makes alkynes much more acidic

414
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,120
than ordinary hydrocarbons.

415
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,440
Finally, we investigated the effect of pi bonds on cyclic structures and how their presence

416
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,400
can not only introduce cis transisomerization, but also chirality.

417
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,000
We also saw how a clash of personalities in 1870s Russia led to a race to understanding

418
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,560
alkene chemistry, which in turn helps us to arrive at a better understanding of the molecular

419
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,520
mechanism of vision employed in modern medicine.

420
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,320
We've had quite a journey this lecture.

421
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,680
Next time, we will introduce a new class of atoms to the structural mix when we expand

422
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,200
our inventory of compounds to include the halogens, fluorine, fluorine, bromine and

423
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,800
iodine in a class of compounds called alkyl halides.

424
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I'll see you then.
