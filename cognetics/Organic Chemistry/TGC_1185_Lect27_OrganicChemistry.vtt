00:00.000 --> 00:20.340
In 1666, a young Isaac Newton first documented the separation of white light into its constituent

00:20.340 --> 00:23.400
visible colors using a prism.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.320
And in his notes on this now famous experiment, he described the rainbow of colors he saw

00:28.320 --> 00:32.920
as a spectrum from the Latin word meaning apparition.

00:32.920 --> 00:40.040
But what we didn't know at that time was that what he saw was only part of the story.

00:40.040 --> 00:46.000
It was another hundred years, more than that, in 1801 when a young self-taught scientist

00:46.000 --> 00:51.840
by the name of Wilhelm Ritter acted on a hunch that maybe there was more to the spectrum

00:51.840 --> 00:57.040
than what Newton had seen with his own eyes more than a hundred years earlier.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.560
The problem is that Wilhelm is a human and his eyes couldn't see any further along the

01:01.560 --> 01:04.400
spectrum than Newton's could.

01:04.400 --> 01:12.360
So Ritter needed a different kind of eye and he had just the tool for the job, silver chloride.

01:12.360 --> 01:17.200
Now silver chloride is an inorganic compound which is most famous for its use in photographic

01:17.200 --> 01:19.360
films.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.480
Solutions of silver chloride undergo a chemical reaction in the presence of visible light

01:23.600 --> 01:29.000
which causes them to dissociate into a suspension of silver metal and chlorine gas.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.640
In other words, the solution turns dark when exposed to light.

01:35.640 --> 01:40.160
It was known even before Ritter that this reaction did not proceed at the same speed

01:40.160 --> 01:42.440
in different colors of light.

01:42.440 --> 01:47.440
He could disperse light with a prism, then place vials of silver chloride solution in

01:47.440 --> 01:52.800
different parts of the resulting spectrum, and clearly see that the reaction was fastest

01:52.800 --> 02:02.040
in blue, slower in green, and slower still in the red portions of the spectrum.

02:02.040 --> 02:07.440
Ritter's real contribution was that he decided to place a vial of silver chloride solution

02:07.440 --> 02:11.360
outside of the blue colored light from the prism.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.020
His hunch paid off.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.820
The solution outside of the blue end of the spectrum reacted even faster than any of the

02:17.820 --> 02:20.720
samples in the visible area.

02:20.720 --> 02:25.880
This experiment is remarkable because it clearly demonstrated the existence of light

02:25.880 --> 02:31.040
with a frequency even higher than the violet light at the edge of the visible spectrum,

02:31.040 --> 02:36.440
one which was not detectable to the human eye but had even more energy than visible light.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.080
Ritter had discovered ultraviolet light.

02:40.080 --> 02:45.360
If you're watching these lectures in order, I'd like to congratulate you on completing

02:45.360 --> 02:49.000
the structures and reactions segment of the course.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.400
You now have the basic knowledge and skills needed to understand and predict the reactivity

02:53.400 --> 02:57.160
of organic compounds on paper.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.800
But you must have asked yourself more than once during these lectures.

03:00.800 --> 03:05.160
How do we know how these molecules are reacting and behaving?

03:05.160 --> 03:10.640
How can these structures and the changes we make to them be confirmed experimentally?

03:10.640 --> 03:16.600
After all, organic chemistry is about science, and science is about what we can prove.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.400
So where's the proof?

03:18.400 --> 03:24.760
Well, today we begin answering these very fair and very crucial questions by discussing

03:24.760 --> 03:29.640
the techniques which organic chemists and many others use to identify the products of

03:29.640 --> 03:31.800
their work.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.760
Today we begin to explore the science of spectroscopy.

03:35.760 --> 03:43.280
Now most simply put, spectroscopy is the observation of the interaction of light with matter.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.840
Now before we can dive into spectroscopic techniques, we need to take a step back and

03:48.840 --> 03:53.520
characterize what we generally refer to as light.

03:53.520 --> 03:59.560
Light is in fact electromagnetic radiation, a form of self-propagating energy composed

03:59.560 --> 04:03.680
of perpendicularly oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

04:03.680 --> 04:10.920
It exhibits both wave and particle-like properties, and it carries energy and momentum.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.560
Now it's the wave properties of light and the energy it carries, which are most interesting

04:15.560 --> 04:22.360
to spectroscopists, and we're going to tend to classify light based on those properties.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.960
Now one of these properties associated with waves is the wavelength, or the distance from

04:27.960 --> 04:32.440
one point on the wave to the next analogous point.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.240
For example, the distance from the top of the peak on this end to the top of the next

04:36.240 --> 04:40.600
peak here on my wave, this is defined as the wavelength.

04:40.600 --> 04:45.000
Now another property of light which interests us is its velocity.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.760
See light has a fixed speed at which it travels in a given medium, regardless of its wavelength.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.920
Light in a vacuum always travels at 3 times 10 to the 8th meters per second.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.600
Now I'm going to start my wave in motion, but I'm not going to start it at the speed

04:58.600 --> 04:59.600
of light.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.360
So let's just move our wave now and pretend that this is the speed of light.

05:04.360 --> 05:09.360
Now the frequency of light is the number of equivalent points along that wave, which pass

05:09.360 --> 05:13.520
by a given location in a specified time.

05:13.520 --> 05:21.240
For example, my wave here has a frequency of about one oscillation per second.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.320
Now since the maxima pass designated points in one second intervals, that's my frequency.

05:26.320 --> 05:31.680
Now it sounds a little bit awkward to say this wave has a frequency of one per second,

05:31.680 --> 05:34.280
so we instead use a unit called Hertz.

05:34.280 --> 05:40.480
This is a unit named in honor of German physicist Heinrich Hertz, who first characterized electromagnetic

05:40.480 --> 05:44.480
radiation in 1887.

05:44.480 --> 05:51.480
So the constant speed of light becomes a proportionality constant for the relationship between wavelength

05:51.480 --> 05:53.640
and the reciprocal of frequency.

05:53.640 --> 05:59.720
For example, if I were to decrease my wavelength by a factor of two, I'd just increase the

05:59.720 --> 06:06.120
frequency by a factor of two.

06:06.120 --> 06:10.120
Now one last property of light, which is going to be of crucial importance to understanding

06:10.120 --> 06:12.720
spectroscopy, is this.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.920
Light does still have some particle character.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.680
We call these particles of light photons.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.400
A single photon of light contains an amount of energy, which is directly related to its

06:25.400 --> 06:30.640
frequency by a factor called Planck's constant, sometimes shown in mathematical equations

06:30.640 --> 06:33.200
as the letter H.

06:33.200 --> 06:40.080
So a single photon of light has an associated wavelength, frequency, and energy, all of

06:40.080 --> 06:45.400
which are related to one another mathematically.

06:45.400 --> 06:50.120
So we classify light according to its frequency or wavelength, which are related to the amount

06:50.120 --> 06:54.400
of energy carried by a single photon of that light.

06:54.400 --> 06:59.200
We call this range of wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum.

06:59.200 --> 07:05.920
The spectrum includes, in order of increasing frequency and therefore energy, radio waves,

07:05.920 --> 07:18.240
microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma rays.

07:18.240 --> 07:23.320
Radio waves can have wavelengths kilometers wide, and as we reduce the wavelength to about

07:23.320 --> 07:28.280
the diameter of a baseball, we cross into the microwave region.

07:28.280 --> 07:35.320
Continuing to reduce the wavelength to about the size of a human cell gets us to the infrared.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.600
The visible has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers or about the size of a typical

07:39.600 --> 07:44.880
virus, and the ultraviolet begins to approach the size of some of the larger molecules that

07:44.880 --> 07:48.000
we've studied in the course, like proteins.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.480
Finally, from about ten nanometers on down, x-rays constitute the smaller extremes of

07:54.480 --> 07:59.440
wavelengths, including the very high energy gamma rays that have wavelengths smaller than

07:59.440 --> 08:02.920
the diameter of a single atom.

08:02.920 --> 08:08.020
So the electromagnetic spectrum spans a dramatic scale of wavelengths, and therefore a dramatic

08:08.020 --> 08:11.800
range of energies per photon.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.400
Because of this, each class of radiation tends to interact with molecules in its own unique

08:16.400 --> 08:23.080
way, and scientists have devised a way to exploit all of them.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.520
So let's try a spectroscopy experiment.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.720
You ready?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.480
Here I have two glasses of water and a flashlight.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.760
I'm going to shine my flashlight through the water.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.680
Now you can see that both glasses of water basically allow all of the visible light to

08:38.680 --> 08:40.200
transmit through them.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.200
Simple enough, right?

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Now I'm going to add just a small bit of red food coloring to one of the two glasses of

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
water.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.360
And I'll use my highly specialized scientific tool to stir that.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.120
Be sure it's well mixed.

08:59.120 --> 09:05.320
Now I'll pass my white light back through the same two glasses, the original and the

09:05.320 --> 09:07.720
one with the added food coloring.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.720
You notice a difference?

09:08.720 --> 09:10.920
You see something different, don't you?

09:10.920 --> 09:15.880
Of course, the light reaching your eyes appeared white when it went through the first glass

09:15.880 --> 09:20.200
because it contained only water, which didn't absorb anything, and you were able to see

09:20.200 --> 09:24.320
all the wavelengths of light which were generated by the flashlight.

09:24.320 --> 09:30.240
But in the second glass, you saw the light that was passing through appeared to be red.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.720
And that's because the contents of the solution were absorbing the complementary color of

09:34.720 --> 09:37.280
red or green.

09:37.280 --> 09:42.560
So you know that something in that dye has to have the ability to absorb light of about

09:42.560 --> 09:45.600
520 nanometer wavelengths.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.040
Congratulations, you are now a spectrophotometer.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.560
You just observed the interaction of light with matter.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.520
And measurement of the interaction of light with matter is the function of all optical

09:56.520 --> 10:00.240
spectroscopy instruments.

10:00.240 --> 10:06.480
Now what distinguishes optical spectrophotometers in a lab from your eyes and mine is their increased

10:06.480 --> 10:12.840
sensitivity and the ability to see the electromagnetic spectrum with far greater precision over a

10:12.840 --> 10:18.080
far wider range of wavelengths than the human eye ever could.

10:18.080 --> 10:23.040
Instead of seeing a combination of all visible wavelengths simultaneously, spectrophotometers

10:23.040 --> 10:28.840
can give us information about each wavelength individually, telling us exactly which photons

10:28.840 --> 10:35.240
are absorbed by our sample and which photons are not absorbed.

10:35.240 --> 10:39.920
For the next few lectures, we will take a look at some of the ways scientists coax structural

10:39.920 --> 10:45.040
information from molecules using spectrophotometers to sense how they interact with different

10:45.040 --> 10:46.840
forms of light.

10:46.840 --> 10:52.440
And we'll begin in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum today.

10:52.440 --> 10:57.680
Of course, since Ritter's Day, the science of spectroscopy has come a long way.

10:57.680 --> 11:02.000
We no longer have to move a sample from one band of light to the next to observe how a

11:02.000 --> 11:04.480
sample is interacting with light.

11:04.600 --> 11:11.560
Instead, we rely on sophisticated instruments called spectrophotometers to get this job done.

11:11.560 --> 11:16.040
Now all spectrophotometers have the same basic functional parts.

11:16.040 --> 11:20.120
How each part functions can be very different depending on the design and the technique

11:20.120 --> 11:22.960
needed to solve a particular problem.

11:22.960 --> 11:28.240
But all spectrometers or spectrophotometers consist of several crucial parts.

11:28.240 --> 11:32.880
First, there's a light source, which generates a broad spectrum of light.

11:32.880 --> 11:38.160
Now this can be as simple as an ordinary incandescent light bulb or a much more advanced lamp

11:38.160 --> 11:41.200
capable of producing ultraviolet.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.160
The light from this source is sent to a device called a monochromator.

11:45.160 --> 11:51.840
The simplest example of this would be one of Newton's prisms in between two slits.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.840
The purpose of the first slit is to ensure that all the light from the source reaches

11:55.840 --> 12:00.280
the monochromator in a parallel pathway.

12:00.280 --> 12:05.120
Once it gets into the center of the monochromator, we will see this beam being fanned out into

12:05.120 --> 12:09.360
its spectrum just as Newton did in the 1600s.

12:09.360 --> 12:14.600
The final slit is there to allow only one very small region of that spectrum to pass

12:14.600 --> 12:17.600
on through.

12:17.600 --> 12:23.000
The next element of our spectrophotometer is a beam splitter, which is really just a fancy

12:23.000 --> 12:29.080
array of mirrors which accomplishes the task of dividing our monochromatic light beam into

12:29.080 --> 12:34.800
two different beams which pass through two different regions of space.

12:34.800 --> 12:39.400
These different regions of space are our sample and reference compartments.

12:39.400 --> 12:44.320
So the beam which passes through my reference compartment will encounter really nothing,

12:44.320 --> 12:45.320
just the reference.

12:45.320 --> 12:50.360
So this would be like our glass of water in the original experiment today.

12:50.360 --> 12:56.720
But the other beam passes through a sample cell and that sample cell contains not just

12:56.720 --> 13:00.440
say water but water with dye in it, as in our example before.

13:00.440 --> 13:04.120
So the difference between these two cells is the presence of the sample that we want

13:04.120 --> 13:06.120
to study.

13:06.120 --> 13:10.360
Finally, the exiting light beams encounter detectors.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.360
And detectors have many different designs as well.

13:13.360 --> 13:18.400
But essentially what a detector does is it turns the impact of photons into some kind

13:18.400 --> 13:24.040
of an electrical signal which can be sent off to a computer which monitors the experiment.

13:24.040 --> 13:29.480
And it's the differences in those signals between the light exiting the reference cell

13:29.480 --> 13:37.040
and the light exiting the sample cell which are interpreted as the result of our experiment.

13:37.040 --> 13:42.600
So the advent of the modern spectrophotometer allows me to not only say that my sample appears

13:42.600 --> 13:48.360
red and therefore is absorbing green light, I can go much farther and determine exactly

13:48.360 --> 13:53.920
how much of every wavelength in the visible spectrum is being absorbed to create the color

13:53.920 --> 13:57.280
that I see.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.400
But there's even more information available from this kind of experiment.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.900
See, one of the very first of these devices was built by a German physicist by the name

14:04.900 --> 14:06.400
of August Bier.

14:06.400 --> 14:12.680
Now Bier is most well known for his law of absorbance which he proposed in 1852.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.840
His law is concerned not with the maximum wavelength of absorption but with just how

14:16.840 --> 14:21.540
strongly a given compound or sample absorbs.

14:21.540 --> 14:25.980
What Bier observed is that incrementally increasing the concentration of a chromophore

14:25.980 --> 14:32.740
or light absorbing molecule cut the transmittance of a sample by one half each time he increased

14:32.740 --> 14:33.740
it.

14:33.740 --> 14:39.660
Now similarly, for a given concentration of a sample the transmittance was cut in half

14:39.660 --> 14:44.780
when the length of the cell was increased incrementally.

14:44.780 --> 14:49.180
This relationship produces an exponential relationship like the one I'm showing you

14:49.180 --> 14:51.060
here.

14:51.060 --> 14:55.800
But scientists prefer to work with linear relationships whenever possible because they're much easier

14:55.800 --> 14:57.620
to predict.

14:57.620 --> 15:04.220
So Bier converted transmittance into a new unit called absorbance.

15:04.220 --> 15:09.980
The absorbance is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of a sample's transmittance.

15:09.980 --> 15:15.460
And when this is done the resulting plot is a very simple and useful relationship in which

15:15.460 --> 15:21.020
incremental concentration or path length increase leads to incremental absorbance values

15:21.020 --> 15:24.620
as well.

15:24.620 --> 15:29.300
So Bier's equation relates absorption to three important factors.

15:29.300 --> 15:34.100
A property of a given molecule called its molar absorptivity, which is essentially a

15:34.100 --> 15:39.900
measure of how well it absorbs at a given wavelength, the concentration of the sample,

15:39.900 --> 15:43.740
and the path length of the cell used in the experiment.

15:43.740 --> 15:49.380
So if you know two of these three parameters for a given sample, measuring the absorbance

15:49.380 --> 15:53.740
would allow you to calculate the third variable using Bier's law.

15:53.740 --> 15:58.940
So this gives us a simple way to determine the concentration of solutions of known compounds

15:58.940 --> 16:06.660
or to help identify compounds in solutions of known concentrations.

16:06.660 --> 16:11.100
Now we saw in our discussion of conjugated alkenes how the frontier molecular orbital

16:11.100 --> 16:18.300
energy of conjugated compounds decreases as additional p-atomic orbitals join the system.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.300
So let's begin by restating a crucial proviso here.

16:22.300 --> 16:27.980
That a single photon of light carries a specific packet of energy with it and that this energy

16:27.980 --> 16:32.620
can be calculated from its wavelength and from Planck's constant using a relationship

16:32.620 --> 16:40.580
of energy is equal to Planck's constant times the speed of light divided by the wavelength

16:40.580 --> 16:44.540
of that particular photon.

16:44.540 --> 16:49.300
So for example, using this equation I can determine that a photon with a 520 nanometer

16:49.300 --> 16:56.860
wavelength carries with it exactly 3.82 times 10 to the minus 19th joules of energy.

16:56.860 --> 16:59.940
No more, no less.

16:59.940 --> 17:04.940
We sometimes convert these energies from joules per photon into kilojoules per molar photons

17:04.940 --> 17:07.860
to make the numbers a little more manageable.

17:07.860 --> 17:15.300
So in our example, 3.82 times 10 to the negative 19th joules per photon becomes 230 kilojoules

17:15.300 --> 17:18.620
per mole of photons.

17:18.620 --> 17:24.140
Second, let's set the rule that this photon will only be absorbed by a molecule when it

17:24.140 --> 17:27.820
can promote an electron to a higher energy state.

17:27.820 --> 17:33.620
In other words, when the orbital energy gap between occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals

17:33.620 --> 17:39.780
are exactly equal to the energy packet of the photon.

17:39.780 --> 17:44.380
Now let's take a look at a few molecules with distinctive UV spectra, compounds with

17:44.380 --> 17:49.660
which we're pretty familiar by now, the conjugated alkenes.

17:49.660 --> 17:54.860
Simple conjugated alkenes have pi systems which overlap very well with one another,

17:54.860 --> 17:59.460
creating a virtual superhighway for electrons to move from one orbital to the next.

18:00.260 --> 18:05.660
And when electrons move from the highest occupied pi molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied

18:05.660 --> 18:12.140
pi molecular orbital, we call the transition a pi to pi star transition.

18:12.140 --> 18:16.900
Now because of the fantastic geometric overlap of the associated orbitals, this absorption

18:16.900 --> 18:21.740
occurs nearly every time an electron of sufficient energy strikes that molecule.

18:21.740 --> 18:30.100
In other words, the extinction coefficient for the absorption can be very, very large.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.820
Now recall from our lecture on conjugated alkenes that I can construct an energy diagram

18:34.820 --> 18:38.100
for the molecular orbitals of a conjugated system.

18:38.100 --> 18:44.620
And that when we did this for 1,3-butadiene and 1,35-hexatriene, we discovered that the

18:44.620 --> 18:51.060
frontier molecular orbitals are closer in energy in the more conjugated compound.

18:51.060 --> 18:55.620
Now if we were to carefully calculate the energies of the frontier molecular orbital

18:55.620 --> 19:01.380
gaps, we would see the following trend for the first three alkenes in the series.

19:01.380 --> 19:09.020
686 kilojoules for ethene, 540 kilojoules for 1,3-butadiene, and 452 kilojoules for

19:09.020 --> 19:13.420
1,35-hexatriene.

19:13.420 --> 19:18.220
Assuming that our earlier rules hold, this means that promoting one electron from the

19:18.220 --> 19:24.820
homo of each compound to the lumo should require a photon with the exact same energy.

19:24.820 --> 19:34.140
So ethene should require a photon of 686 kilojoules per mole or one with a wavelength of 171 nanometers.

19:34.140 --> 19:41.820
1,3-butadiene requires a photon of 217 nanometers and 1,35-hexatriene requires a photon of 258

19:41.820 --> 19:45.580
nanometers.

19:45.580 --> 19:49.940
So there is a distinct correlation between the wavelength of maximum absorption and the

19:49.940 --> 19:53.380
extent of conjugation in organic compounds.

19:53.380 --> 19:57.980
And this trend continues into the visible spectrum as well, where compounds like beta-carotene

19:57.980 --> 20:06.300
with its 11 conjugated double bonds has a maximum absorption at 454 nanometers.

20:06.300 --> 20:10.780
So let's take a look at another example in the form of a compound so well understood

20:10.780 --> 20:14.820
that it's frequently used as a reference standard for experiments like these.

20:14.820 --> 20:18.140
I'm talking about our old friend benzene.

20:18.140 --> 20:24.580
Now benzene has a maximum absorption at 255 nanometers, lower than 1,35-hexatriene because

20:24.580 --> 20:29.460
promoting electrons causes benzene to lose some of its aromaticity.

20:29.460 --> 20:35.620
But let's take a look at the maximum absorption of benzene's cousins, naphthalene and anthracene.

20:35.620 --> 20:41.860
Now see when we do, we notice that the overall trend of increasing lambda max or maximum wavelength

20:41.860 --> 20:50.260
of absorption with increasing pi system size holds for our aromatics as well.

20:50.260 --> 20:54.220
Of course, no discussion of the ultraviolet region of the spectrum is ever complete without

20:54.220 --> 21:00.660
the mention of the single most well-known source of electromagnetic radiation, the sun.

21:00.660 --> 21:05.540
In addition to the intense visible light emitted by the sun, it also constantly bathes the

21:05.540 --> 21:12.980
planet in strong ultraviolet radiation which is capable of causing damage to cellular DNA.

21:12.980 --> 21:17.580
The overall ultraviolet region of the spectrum is defined as the region between 100 and 400

21:17.580 --> 21:20.140
nanometers in wavelength.

21:20.140 --> 21:25.620
But spectroscopists and other scientists break the UV spectrum down into three general regions

21:25.620 --> 21:30.820
which are commonly called UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.

21:30.820 --> 21:33.340
So let's look at those one by one.

21:34.020 --> 21:39.540
UV-C radiation spans 100 nanometers to 280 nanometers in wavelength.

21:39.540 --> 21:44.780
UV-C is that portion of the UV spectrum which isn't normally found at the surface of the

21:44.780 --> 21:50.380
Earth because it's naturally absorbed by the gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

21:50.380 --> 21:55.860
This high energy, potentially damaging radiation, is absorbed by two naturally occurring atmospheric

21:55.860 --> 22:02.980
gases in particular, oxygen which absorbs between 100 and 200 nanometers and ozone which

22:03.020 --> 22:07.860
absorbs between about 200 and 280 nanometers.

22:07.860 --> 22:12.900
So these two gases work in concert to protect us from all of the most dangerous UV light

22:12.900 --> 22:15.180
reaching the planet.

22:15.180 --> 22:22.420
UV-B radiation spans 280 to 315 nanometer wavelengths.

22:22.420 --> 22:27.700
Now, it's that portion of the UV spectrum which reaches the surface and causes reddening

22:27.700 --> 22:32.180
of the skin which we commonly refer to as sunburn.

22:32.180 --> 22:35.900
Because of this, it was long thought that UV-B rays were the only dangerous form of

22:35.900 --> 22:40.500
UV radiation reaching the planet's surface, leading companies to produce sunblock formulations

22:40.500 --> 22:47.900
containing compounds like para-amino-benzoic acid or PHABA, which absorbs very well right

22:47.900 --> 22:50.820
up to the edge of the UV-B.

22:53.820 --> 22:59.820
UV-A radiation spans the 315 to 400 nanometer region of the spectrum.

22:59.860 --> 23:04.580
And for a long time, it was thought that this lower energy UV light wasn't harmful to humans

23:04.580 --> 23:09.140
because it didn't cause sunburn the way that UV-B does.

23:09.140 --> 23:13.540
In the later decades of the 1900s, though, medical researchers began to recognize that

23:13.540 --> 23:18.540
UV-A light can in fact cause cellular damage even though it doesn't cause a reddening

23:18.540 --> 23:21.660
of the skin.

23:21.660 --> 23:27.780
So modern sunblock formulations have abandoned PHABA in favor of compounds like octocrylene

23:27.780 --> 23:32.780
and avalbenzone, shown here as its enol-tautomer.

23:32.780 --> 23:37.220
So when we take a look at the UV spectrum as a whole and all those materials which we

23:37.220 --> 23:42.380
use to protect ourselves from it, both man-made and naturally occurring, we should start to

23:42.380 --> 23:46.060
notice a distinct trend.

23:46.060 --> 23:51.420
Increasing the size of the conjugated pi system in the compound correlates directly with their

23:51.420 --> 23:54.860
wavelength of maximum absorption.

23:54.860 --> 24:02.780
From oxygen to ozone to PHABA, octocrylene and avalbenzone, each larger and more conjugated

24:02.780 --> 24:05.020
than the next.

24:05.020 --> 24:09.660
So using this predictive tool of extended conjugation, these products have been carefully

24:09.660 --> 24:15.780
engineered to have very large extinction coefficients at very specific wavelengths to fill in the

24:15.780 --> 24:19.780
gaps that Mother Nature left behind.

24:19.780 --> 24:24.580
Some aromatic and conjugated compounds are also titratable, meaning that they can accept

24:24.580 --> 24:28.660
and release protons, which can change their absorptive properties.

24:28.660 --> 24:31.000
So let's belly up to the bar here.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.500
Take for example, the anthocyanins in this red wine, well, blush wine.

24:36.500 --> 24:42.100
Now anthocyanins are polyphenols, and that means that not only are they highly conjugated,

24:42.100 --> 24:45.860
which gives them beautiful colors, but they also have hydroxyl groups on them which can

24:45.860 --> 24:48.860
be protonated and deprotonated.

24:48.860 --> 24:52.700
Now if you're an enophile, you might want to look away for this demonstration, because

24:52.700 --> 24:56.700
I'm going to take this wine, which is currently at a pH of about five, and I'm going to bring

24:56.700 --> 25:01.580
it up, and we're going to watch the effect it has on the color.

25:01.580 --> 25:07.500
Now to do this, I'm going to use a solution of sodium hydroxide, which is caustic, so

25:07.500 --> 25:15.820
I'm going to find a glove that isn't destroyed, and I'm going to cover up my hands just for

25:15.820 --> 25:18.060
safety's sake.

25:18.060 --> 25:21.420
Of course what I'm about to do is also going to render the wine undrinkable.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.620
So I'm probably going to make a few enemies, or at least not make any new friends by doing

25:25.620 --> 25:27.780
this today.

25:27.780 --> 25:28.980
So here we have the original wine.

25:28.980 --> 25:31.100
You can see it's clearly red in color.

25:31.100 --> 25:39.380
This is because of a compound called malvadenglucoside, and I have here a small Erlenmeyer flask

25:39.380 --> 25:45.300
with an aqueous solution, that's water-based, of sodium hydroxide.

25:45.300 --> 25:48.220
Now as a control, just to prove to you that there's nothing magical about what I'll be

25:48.220 --> 25:52.260
adding to these wines, I'm going to put a few drops of my solution into a glass full

25:52.260 --> 25:59.260
of water, and of course we see no color change or reaction of any kind taking place.

25:59.260 --> 26:06.020
So clearly if we see any changes in these wines as a result of adding my hydroxide to

26:06.020 --> 26:11.700
it, it has to be coming from something already in the wine.

26:11.700 --> 26:17.940
I'll leave my second glass unaltered as our control, so we have a reference.

26:17.940 --> 26:24.020
Now I'm going to add a little bit of my aqueous sodium hydroxide to my first victim today.

26:48.860 --> 26:54.620
Did you see a change?

26:54.620 --> 26:55.940
I know I certainly do.

26:55.940 --> 27:01.100
Now the change that's taking place here is a result of deprotonating some of those phenolic

27:01.100 --> 27:06.560
compounds, most notably the malvadenglucoside in the red wine.

27:06.560 --> 27:11.220
But I can go even farther than that, and add a very large amount of my sodium hydroxide

27:11.220 --> 27:18.220
to my third glass.

27:34.060 --> 27:41.060
Let's give it a little bit more just for good measure.

27:42.220 --> 27:48.500
I'll cap my sodium hydroxide solution and give my wines one last swirl to be sure that

27:48.500 --> 27:52.420
they're thoroughly mixed.

27:52.420 --> 27:58.420
Now what should be very apparent here is that something has changed.

27:58.420 --> 28:05.420
Clearly changing the pH conditions of the wine has altered the structure of these compounds.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.500
Quite an impressive color change, isn't it?

28:08.500 --> 28:11.340
So let's recap what just happened here.

28:11.340 --> 28:16.900
The compounds which impart the color to the wine like malvadenglucoside have become deprotonated,

28:16.900 --> 28:22.780
and removal of one or more hydroxyl protons allows the newly deprotonated oxygen atoms

28:22.780 --> 28:28.060
to partake in resonance with the rest of the aromatic system, thereby extending the conjugation

28:28.060 --> 28:32.980
and changing the frontier molecular orbital energies of the color-giving organic species

28:32.980 --> 28:34.860
in the wine.

28:34.860 --> 28:38.820
I've actually prepared some more samples here of the same wine that had been altered

28:38.820 --> 28:43.140
with sodium hydroxide as well in varying proportions, and you can see that there's

28:43.140 --> 28:48.540
actually a broad range of colors that can be achieved in this way.

28:48.540 --> 28:53.900
Now as the conjugated pi systems here grew in energy, the pigments absorbed first in

28:53.900 --> 29:00.900
the green, then in the orange, which resulted in a blue color, and finally in the red portion

29:00.900 --> 29:06.700
of the spectrum, which your eyes detect as green.

29:06.700 --> 29:12.260
And that is the chemistry of destroying a perfectly good rosé.

29:12.260 --> 29:17.580
So today we started on our journey through the task of probing molecular structures.

29:17.580 --> 29:22.420
We talked a little bit about light and the electromagnetic spectrum which comprises it.

29:22.420 --> 29:28.100
We explored the relationships among wavelength, frequency, and energy in any given photon.

29:28.100 --> 29:33.200
And we noted that a single photon carries a packet of energy which can only be absorbed

29:33.200 --> 29:37.660
in a transition of equal energy.

29:37.660 --> 29:42.940
We talked about UV light in particular, how Wilhelm Ritter discovered this type of electromagnetic

29:42.940 --> 29:50.180
radiation using decomposition of silver chloride solutions with light separated by a prism.

29:50.180 --> 29:55.100
We examined the general structure of a UV visible spectrophotometer from light source

29:55.100 --> 30:01.260
to monochromator to beam splitter, sample and reference compartments, and finally detectors,

30:01.260 --> 30:07.220
and how these units all work in concert to produce a UV visible spectrum.

30:07.220 --> 30:13.180
Next, we discussed how extending conjugation in a compound leads to lower energy homo-lumo

30:13.180 --> 30:18.300
transitions within the pi system of molecules lengthening the wavelengths of the associated

30:18.300 --> 30:22.900
molecules' maximum absorption.

30:22.900 --> 30:26.780
We saw how this concept can be used to explain how the Earth's atmosphere protects us from

30:26.780 --> 30:32.700
UVC radiation, but we need to devise our own methods to protect ourselves from UVB and

30:32.700 --> 30:35.980
UVA radiation.

30:35.980 --> 30:41.340
And finally, you witnessed me doing the unthinkable and rendering a perfectly good wine undrinkable

30:41.340 --> 30:43.820
by altering its pH.

30:43.820 --> 30:48.620
In doing so, however, I demonstrated that the protonation state of many organic compounds

30:48.740 --> 30:54.780
can profoundly affect their absorption characteristics as well.

30:54.780 --> 30:58.260
Next time, we're going to turn our attention to the other side of the visible spectrum

30:58.260 --> 31:03.460
and explore its other neighbor, infrared light, and how it interacts with molecules by a completely

31:03.460 --> 31:07.660
different mechanism, yielding completely different information about structures.

31:07.660 --> 31:12.700
And I promise, I won't destroy one single beverage during the entire lecture.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.780
I'll see you then.
