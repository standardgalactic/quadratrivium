0	16280	Your physician screens you to determine risk factors for genetic diseases.
16280	21560	A criminal forensics lab links a sample of blood, skin, or hair from a crime scene to
21560	23240	a suspected criminal.
23240	29240	A zoologist or botanist confirms that his or her latest discovery is in fact a new species.
29840	35080	A pharmaceutical company manufactures human insulin used to treat diabetics using a bacterium
35080	38960	as a microscopic production plant.
38960	44960	All of these remarkable accomplishments have one thing in common, DNA.
44960	50680	Elegantly simple in its library of just four letters, but stunningly complex in the size
50680	56960	and organization of those four letters, DNA and its chemical cousin RNA stand alone among
56960	62440	biomolecules in their ability to help us carry out these kinds of tasks.
62440	64920	That's right, just four letters.
64920	70080	That's all it takes to sum up your entire chemical essence.
70080	76280	Using just four simple letters, modern scientists can document, store, and even reproduce a
76280	81840	code which contains all the basic information which makes you who you are, at least in a
81840	85480	physiological sense.
85480	87880	It might sound too simple to be true.
87880	93080	Why such small alphabet of letters to make up a code as complex as the one that makes
93080	96680	you, you in a chemical sense?
96680	100880	Well Nature makes up for the small library of letters with scale.
100880	106240	A single strand of your DNA contains over three billion of these letters.
106240	112080	Now three billion positions with four possibilities for each makes for more possibilities than
112080	115120	one can realistically imagine.
115120	121040	To get the same number of possible permutations with 26 letters like our alphabet would require
121040	130280	a literary work equivalent to about 430 copies of Tolstoy's classic War and Peace.
130280	137760	Most of us are familiar with these four letters A, G, C, and T. There are a shorthand notation
137760	143880	used by geneticists and molecular biologists to represent adenine, guanine, cytosine, and
143880	144880	thymine.
144880	151880	Now these are the four subunits of a compound which is very familiar to us, DNA.
151880	156320	But remember that Voler helped to demonstrate that the chemistry of life is not off limits
156320	158640	to the organic chemists.
158640	165040	So awesomely complex those cellular biochemistry may be, it is still rooted in the same foundations
165040	169240	as the rest of organic chemistry.
169240	174200	The power of understanding and manipulating DNA has been demonstrated time and again since
174200	181440	its structure was solved in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick.
181440	186640	After decades of study, the United States National Institutes of Health and private entrepreneur
186640	192360	Craig Venter jointly announced that the human genome had been completely mapped.
192360	198680	Now mapping genes and sequencing DNA has given us a tool which can be used not only to scan
198680	203440	for particular health risks in a person, but also to use as a forensic identification
203440	209280	tool, a guide for targeted gene therapy, and a way to understand the chemical basis on
209280	216440	which life evolves and changes in response to environmental stimuli.
216440	222000	Our understanding of DNA and the biochemical processes surrounding it has altered our perception
222000	225040	of what it is to be a living thing.
225040	231080	As scientists, we endeavor to study it, understand it, and ultimately manipulate it in ways which
231080	233240	improve our lives.
233240	237840	Of course, none of this understanding is possible without tearing this beautiful complex down
237840	241600	into its most basic constituent parts.
241600	244240	This is what we will do in this lecture.
244240	248400	Starting from the individual molecules and motifs, we will work our way up to a full
248400	254760	model for the structure of nucleic acid-containing compounds.
254760	259120	So let's begin with RNA, or ribonucleic acid.
259120	265440	RNA serves several critical roles in converting your genetic code, or genome, into the proteins
265440	269600	essential to life, also called a proteome.
269600	274640	In addition to other roles, one of RNA's most important jobs is to transport the information
274640	279840	in the DNA of your cells to areas in those cells where proteins are made.
279840	284440	Now this is a gross underestimation of the versatility of RNA, but for this lecture we're
284440	288920	going to focus on this particular role, since it helps to explain some of the chemical differences
288920	295480	between it and its very close chemical relative, DNA.
295480	301400	The ribo part of that name refers to the carbohydrate ribose.
301400	305680	Now the Fischer projection of D-ribose looks like this.
305680	312120	It's an aldopentose, and like any aldopentose, ribose can undergo cyclization to form the
312120	320120	associated ribofurinose, with its anomeric carbon in one of two positions, alpha or beta.
320120	327800	It's the beta form of this ribofurinose, which is the central building block of RNA.
327800	332360	Ribose alone, however, is a fairly uninteresting molecule from a genetic coding perspective.
332360	336640	I mean, after all, there's only one beta ribofurinose molecule possible.
336640	342620	There's no variation among these structures yet.
342620	347920	To produce the building blocks of RNA, the anomeric hydroxyl in beta ribofurinose is
347920	353200	replaced with an organic base to a nitrogen atom.
353200	362320	In the case of RNA, these four bases are cytosine, uracil, adenine, and guanine.
363160	370000	RNA uses uracil as opposed to the thymine of DNA, for reasons that we're going to discuss shortly.
370000	376160	Now these units are further subdivided into the class of pyrimidine bases and purine
376160	381760	bases based on their backbone structures.
381760	388360	So, using one of these four bases as the aglaicone in beta ribofurinose produces one of the four
388400	393760	subunits of RNA, collectively called nucleosides.
393760	397600	And not surprisingly, these nucleosides have names similar to those of the bases which
397600	400120	gave them their identity.
400120	405840	An aglaicone of cytosine forms the nucleoside cytidine.
405840	408880	Uracil leads to uredine.
408880	414520	Adenine produces adenosine, and guanine produces guanosine.
414520	419200	So we're slowly constructing the monomers of our miraculous biopolymer.
419200	425480	We've attached a pyrimidine or pyrimidine base to ribofurinose as an aglaicone to create
425480	431160	four different letters in the coding alphabet of life.
431160	436160	But a simple collection of letters is not a code.
436160	442120	Consider this random collection of letters from our alphabet, randomly distributed about
442120	444200	the screen.
444200	448280	There's a little bit of information here in the quantity and identity of the letters.
448280	453320	But I can communicate even more specific and detailed information if I order the letters
453320	454560	in a certain way.
454560	457520	So let's put the letters together and see if we can figure out what I'm trying to say
457520	460520	here.
460520	463080	Teachers get sour.
463080	466720	Maybe not.
466720	467720	Carugate sheets.
467720	470600	Well, if this were an engineering course, that would probably be it.
470600	471600	But it's not.
471600	472840	So let's keep going.
472840	477600	These same letters can be put together to form saucers together, which maybe would be
477600	478600	a cooking course.
478600	479600	I don't know.
479600	480600	UFOs, possibly.
480600	481720	Who knows?
481720	486840	Or maybe what I'm trying to say is the great courses.
486840	491560	I can communicate very detailed information with the same letters by combining them in
491560	493360	different orders.
493360	495600	DNA does the same thing.
495600	499240	See the building blocks of each of these phrases are the same.
499240	503680	It's the arrangement of the building blocks, which enriches the code and allows me to encode
503680	508360	far more information using far fewer subunits.
508360	510600	So let's go back to RNA.
510600	515960	We must now find a way to link those nucleoside subunits together into a chain so that there's
515960	521480	a sequence to the collection of Cs, Us, As, and Gs, which will make up the information
521480	524080	in our RNA molecule.
524080	529040	We need a way to string them together, just like we string letters to make words and sentences.
530040	536440	The glue which holds our nucleosides together is a phosphate functional group.
536440	543240	Now, by attaching a phosphate group at the five prime position on the sugar of our nucleoside,
543240	547440	we create a motif called a phosphoester.
547440	551920	This phosphoester group will be the linkage through which our nucleosides are connected
551920	556120	to give our collection of building blocks order.
556120	561400	The collection of three crucial elements, information in the base, the backbone of the
561400	568840	ribose, linking the glue of the phosphoester, all together make up what is called a ribonucleotide.
568840	574320	A ribonucleotide is one complete subunit of RNA, ready to be linked to others to create
574320	577840	a useful code.
577840	583440	So let's put our simple code together, consisting of four ribonucleotides condensed into a chain.
583440	589760	We'll use our examples of cytidine monophosphate, uredine monophosphate, adenosine monophosphate,
589760	591880	and guanidine monophosphate.
591880	594600	These will be our ribonucleotides.
594600	598880	Now if we align them so that the five prime phosphoester of one can condense with the three
598880	605760	prime hydroxyl of another, we can form a phosphoester bridge between the two bases, producing
605760	611000	three water molecules in this case as a byproduct.
611000	617320	So here I put C, U, A, and G together in a very specific sequence.
617320	621680	Now as a convention we always read from the five prime end of the chain toward the three
621680	623920	prime end of the chain.
623920	629280	Of course this is a very small chain by biochemistry standards as many RNA strands can be thousands
629280	634440	of units long and they're all performing their functions in your body right now.
634440	639040	Among other functions, RNA is nature's messenger molecule.
639040	643480	This information from the genetic code stored in DNA and assists in the conversion of that
643480	652840	information into the vast library of proteins which our bodies use to regulate the biochemistry.
652840	658600	So now we understand a bit about the structure of RNA, a complex biomolecule whose job is
658600	663360	to act as the middleman, getting information from your permanent genetic code to the site
663360	667560	where that code is used to build other compounds.
667560	671520	Because the role of RNA is transmission of information which is carried out on a fairly
671520	677840	rapid timescale, RNA itself doesn't need to endure for long periods of time to effectively
677840	681000	perform its duties in living systems.
681000	686640	In fact, it's part of RNA's design that it can be broken down easily and its components
686640	692280	recycled for use in creating more RNA as it's needed.
692280	696760	RNA already has a pretty stable backbone, but there's a chink in the armor and it's
696760	702920	right here at the 2-prime hydroxyl group.
702920	707680	This little nucleophile is hanging out right next to the phosphate ester group of the following
707680	713200	nucleoside which has an electrophilic phosphorous atom.
713200	718800	So the connection may last for a while, but before long, a 2-prime hydroxyl of RNA just
718800	724760	can't help but attack the phosphorus, initiating a mechanism which ultimately cuts the chain
724760	729120	that gives RNA its information-carrying ability.
729120	733880	So RNA can carry huge amounts of information back and forth, being broken down and rebuilt
733880	736280	as the organism needs it.
736280	740760	But there would be no information to transport or translate if there were no method of storing
740760	745400	that information indefinitely until it's called upon.
745400	751000	This task of information storage falls to a close chemical cousin of RNA, the famous
751000	755680	DNA.
755680	762400	Dioxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short, is another ribose-based biopolymer which serves
762400	764680	a very different purpose.
764680	770800	DNA is very similar to RNA, consisting of a phosphate, sugar, and base to form what
770800	774880	we call a deoxyribonucleotide.
774880	780160	But there are two key structural differences which make DNA more robust than RNA.
780160	786880	First, it's the lack of the 2-prime hydroxyl group of the beta ribofurinose sugar.
786880	793400	Instead, this group is replaced with a hydrogen, which is non-nucleophilic.
793400	798840	This removal of the one very specific oxygen from the ribose is the source of the deoxyribo
798840	802320	portion of DNA's name.
802320	807080	With that promiscuous little nucleophile out of the picture, DNA hydrolyzes about 100
807080	809800	times slower than RNA.
809800	814080	And this makes DNA a much better choice, not for a short-lived messenger, but for the
814080	819360	permanent storage of a genetic code which needs to last you the rest of your life.
819360	825560	A second feature of DNA, which makes it a more robust system, is the replacement of
825560	829920	uracil with thymine, a methylated version of uracil.
830680	835520	Now the reason for this difference is that cytosine itself can deaminate spontaneously
835520	836960	to become uracil.
836960	843320	Now obviously, when this happens to your DNA, this is bad news, your DNA just mutated.
843320	848320	But your body has a defense mechanism for this, a complex molecule called an enzyme,
848320	854600	which finds that uracil in your DNA and reaminates it to recover the original cytosine.
854600	856000	That's amazing, isn't it?
856000	860400	Your body can actively repair this kind of damage to DNA.
860400	865960	Now, this incredible repair mechanism comes with a cost.
865960	871760	If DNA actually used uracil, how would the enzyme know which uracil is to alter and which
871760	873000	one is to leave alone?
873000	874960	Well, it wouldn't.
874960	880640	So DNA instead uses thymine as the complementary base for cytosine.
880640	884760	The distinguishing methyl group is acting as a signal to the enzyme saying, hey, I'm
884760	894160	supposed to be here, please don't amenate me.
894160	901000	Of course, most of us are familiar with this form of DNA, the double helix.
901000	905720	This structure was first proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, two names which
905720	908080	are often associated with it.
908080	913080	Of course, the truth is that the discovery of the DNA double helix was really the result
913080	919600	of a concerted effort on the part of many talented researchers over many decades.
919600	926120	In 1869, Friedrich Miescher first isolated DNA from the nuclei of cells.
926120	931640	It was this biological source which prompted him to name it nucleon, a name which was later
931640	936800	revised to DNA to better reflect its chemical composition.
936800	942480	Russian researcher Phoebus Levine was able to identify the individual components of DNA,
942480	946520	including the sugars, phosphates, and bases which comprised it.
946520	951760	But he lacked the necessary tools to properly explain exactly how each of these pieces came
951760	956400	together to form a structure for DNA.
956400	962920	In the 1940s, Erwin Chargaff developed a method for isolating the bases from DNA samples,
962920	968080	and he found that the number of cytosine bases in any given sample very closely matched the
968080	970760	number of guanine bases.
970760	977520	He also determined that the number of adenine bases closely tracked that of thymine.
977520	982560	In the 1950s, the X-ray crystallography lab of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at
982560	986440	King's College finally reached a milestone in genetics.
986440	992120	They were able to use a technique called X-ray diffraction to determine the spatial arrangement
992120	997000	of atoms within the DNA molecule.
997000	1001160	In the end, it was Watson and Crick, however, who made it to press first with their model
1001160	1005360	of the double helix, earning them their place in history.
1005360	1010720	What Watson and Crick proposed explained every observation to date.
1010720	1018240	The sugar, the phosphate, and the base molecules found by Levine were all accounted for.
1018240	1022720	And equal amounts of purine and pyrimidine bases from Chargaff's experiments were also
1022720	1025280	easily explained.
1025280	1029560	Even the crystallography data from Wilhelm and Franklin's labs, as well as their own,
1029560	1035440	all clearly showed that this helical structure held them all together.
1035440	1041240	The key to putting it all together was that the two bases, adenine and thymine, when held
1041240	1050960	in place by the proposed helix, form a network of hydrogen bonds, causing them to pair up.
1050960	1056360	And in cytosine, they form a similar set, but this time with three hydrogen bonds, when
1056360	1059720	placed on adjacent strands.
1059720	1064640	So these base pairs, and their noncovalent interactions, which we now call Watson-Crick
1064640	1070320	pairs, are what hold the two strands of DNA together in this anti-parallel alignment with
1070320	1071320	one another.
1071320	1076160	That's right, the double helix in your DNA is held together by little more than a few
1076160	1078160	hydrogen bonds.
1079160	1083240	Okay, in the human genome, it's about seven or eight billion hydrogen bonds for every
1083240	1085960	strand of DNA.
1085960	1090160	But there's even more interaction going on within those base pairs.
1090160	1096040	The pi systems of neighbors stack with one another, creating a strong contributing dispersion
1096040	1101440	force between their electron clouds, which holds them together even more.
1101440	1105960	And this interaction has been successfully targeted as a site for anti-tumor drugs.
1106360	1112760	See, they can slip in between adjacent bases in rapidly growing cancer cells, and this causes
1112760	1118160	kinks in their DNA strands, inhibiting their ability to replicate and grow.
1121160	1126040	DNA is a very exciting structure to study in and of itself, but in recent decades, research
1126040	1130760	has gone well beyond simply characterizing this fascinating structure.
1130760	1135720	Ingenious molecular biologists and chemists have devised new applications using the understanding
1135720	1140520	of DNA given to us by all those who came before.
1140520	1145360	Probably the most well-known of these is the art of DNA profiling, identifying an individual
1145360	1150080	and linking them to even the smallest hair, skin, or fluid sample, usually for the purpose
1150080	1151240	of forensics.
1151240	1157520	Now there's a common misconception that the sheer size of the human genome makes DNA fingerprinting
1157520	1162640	statistically irrefutable, and this is because some believe that it involves characterizing
1162640	1167520	the entire genome of an individual and comparing it to yet another entire genome from a sample
1167520	1169480	found elsewhere.
1169480	1171200	But this is not the case.
1171200	1176520	It can't be, since DNA testing was used long before Ventracompleted the human genome in
1176520	1177520	2000.
1177520	1184720	Now the truth is that a DNA fingerprint is a bit less reliable, but only slightly so.
1184720	1191480	See, some of the DNA which makes us human is very similar from one person to the next.
1191480	1195960	In particular, the portions of DNA which code for proteins, sometimes called coding
1195960	1199400	DNA, is highly similar.
1199400	1202080	But not all DNA codes for proteins.
1202080	1207000	In fact, much of it is used as a structural support which holds the coding pieces of the
1207000	1213360	sequence in their proper place or performs other non-coding functions.
1213360	1219120	These structural support regions of DNA are sometimes called junk DNA.
1219120	1224280	This is an unfortunate choice of language, because without it the genes which your body
1224280	1228480	expresses to keep you alive wouldn't function properly, so this hardly sounds like junk
1228480	1229980	to me.
1229980	1235920	Nonetheless, the exact sequence in size of these regions is not as crucial as those comprising
1235920	1241240	coding regions, and nature knows this, so she lets us get away with greater variability
1241240	1245240	in these regions of our DNA.
1245240	1249720	Now there are several methods for what is commonly referred to as DNA fingerprinting,
1249720	1253920	and all of them focus on non-coding regions of DNA.
1253920	1259160	In all of the techniques a special process called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR,
1259160	1264200	is used to induce a DNA sample to replicate, creating a huge number of copies of these
1264200	1268160	regions from just a small original sample.
1268160	1273920	We call this process amplification, and this is why just a vanishingly small physical sample
1273920	1279360	is all that is needed for this kind of technique.
1279360	1283920	In early methods, a special enzyme known as a restriction enzyme was then added to the
1283920	1286040	amplified mixture.
1286040	1292160	The restriction enzyme cuts the amplified DNA, but only at very specific points defined
1292160	1297040	by a sequence about a half a dozen or so bases long.
1297040	1303680	This hydrolysis creates a set of fragments whose sizes are unique to an individual.
1303680	1308660	The fragments are then analyzed using a technique known as gel electrophoresis, which uses an
1308660	1313560	electrostatic potential to drag pieces of DNA through a thick gel.
1313560	1319680	This sorts the fragments by size, producing a pattern which is ostensibly unique to the
1319680	1323320	individual.
1323320	1327760	More modern testing involves the selective amplification of non-coding regions of DNA
1327760	1332240	from specific sequence starts, allowing us to bypass the use of a restriction enzyme
1332240	1333800	altogether.
1333800	1336520	But the essential concept remains the same.
1336520	1341400	The statistical likelihood of the number and size of the fragments created by your so-called
1341400	1348160	junk DNA and mine is vanishingly small.
1348160	1352280	Another game-changing use found for DNA is in the production of proteins for chemical
1352280	1354560	research and as medical therapies.
1354560	1358840	We'll be discussing proteins in detail in our next lecture, but for now I want to focus
1358840	1363760	on just one of them, called human insulin.
1363760	1369920	Human insulin is a relatively small protein, but it is crucial to proper blood sugar management.
1369920	1374700	And adults with type 2 diabetes suffer from an inability to produce the insulin needed
1374700	1379520	to properly manage this critical solute in their blood.
1379520	1384440	For decades, sufferers had to inject themselves with solutions of insulin taken from the pancreas
1384440	1390000	of pigs, which is a great solution for most of the population, but a small variation in
1390000	1396640	the pig version of insulin elicited an allergic reaction in a small fraction of patients.
1396640	1401520	So it would be much better if we could offer perfect copies of human insulin for therapies
1401520	1404400	like this.
1404400	1407840	Enter DNA in the world of microbiology.
1407840	1412400	For the past few decades, patients requiring insulin therapy get not the pig version of
1412400	1417160	the protein, but an exact copy of human insulin, and it doesn't come from the pancreas of a
1417160	1418680	human either.
1418680	1424560	See, scientists take the DNA sequence, which codes for human insulin, and they insert it
1424560	1428800	into the DNA sequence of E. coli bacteria.
1428800	1433720	Now don't panic, this is a non-pathogenic strain of the bacteria, and it's dead long
1433720	1436920	before the therapy is actually conducted on a person.
1437920	1442320	See, the bacterial DNA is modified in three important ways.
1442320	1447720	First, the native genes in the bacteria, which code for enzymes that chew up foreign materials,
1447720	1449840	are removed.
1449840	1455160	Second, the gene coding for the desired protein is then inserted.
1455160	1459920	And third, a special trigger is placed right next to that gene that's been inserted.
1459920	1466760	And in the presence of the proper signaling molecule, this trigger will induce the bacteria
1466920	1472240	to express a huge quantity of that inserted gene.
1472240	1476400	With no protective enzymes to clean up the huge quantity of protein being created, the
1476400	1479040	bacteria are utterly helpless.
1479040	1484760	They express and express and express until eventually they're not much more than microscopic
1484760	1487360	bags of human insulin.
1487360	1492320	And these bags are then broken open, and their contents collected for use in human insulin
1492320	1493320	therapy.
1493880	1497840	Now I'll bet you never thought you'd see the day when E. coli would be an asset to
1497840	1499360	human health.
1499360	1504840	In truth, it already has been for decades.
1504840	1509880	The sensational impact that our understanding of DNA has on society makes it a central topic
1509880	1512800	on any lecture covering nucleic acids.
1512800	1516880	But I don't want you to fall into the trap of thinking that DNA and RNA are the only
1516880	1523160	way that these powerful little molecules drive biological processes.
1523160	1528480	Adenosyn, for example, is not only one of the four nucleotides used to produce RNA, but
1528480	1532720	it's also one of the body's energy storage vehicles.
1532720	1538280	When sugars are oxidized in cells, some of the energy produced is used to produce adenosyn
1538280	1543240	triphosphate, which contains three phosphate ester groups attached to the five prime carbon
1543240	1546520	of the nucleotide.
1546520	1551160	The phosphate ester bonds are somewhat unstable, and that should be immediately evident from
1551160	1555600	the concentration of all that negative charge in such a small space.
1555600	1559400	So breaking just one of them can release a considerable amount of energy, not only as
1559400	1563480	a result of hydrating a phosphate, but also relieving the clash of charges.
1563480	1571720	In the process, about 31 kilojoules per mole or about 7.3 kilocalories per mole is released.
1571720	1577680	Among other things, this ATP to ADP conversion serves as a quick source of stored energy
1577680	1579760	for muscle contraction.
1579760	1584480	This is the process which many athletic supplements claim to target, most notably the wildly
1584480	1586800	successful supplement creatine.
1586800	1592680	Now, creatine is used as a vehicle in the body to transport phosphate, which is transferred
1592680	1597360	to ADP by an enzyme called creatine kinase.
1597360	1601920	It's this function that some believe gives creatine supplementation the ability to increase
1601920	1606360	endurance during exercise.
1606360	1610280	Whether creatine supplementation improves physical performance significantly is still
1610280	1612120	a matter of some debate.
1612120	1616400	But what is inarguable is that it generates hundreds of millions of dollars of annual
1616400	1627840	sales in the U.S. alone, and it's all based on its ability to phosphorylate ADP.
1627840	1629680	So let's summarize.
1629680	1636080	In this lecture, we dug deep into the structure of some familiar biopolymers, RNA and DNA.
1636080	1641200	We looked at the structure of ribose and its beta-D-pheronose form, which makes up part
1641200	1644160	of the backbone of RNA.
1644160	1650480	We saw how four different aglaicones attached to this ring lead to the four RNA nucleosides,
1650480	1657520	which we call cytosine and uredine, the pyrimidine-based ones, and adenine and guanine, the purine-based
1657520	1661000	nucleosides.
1661000	1664880	Then we took a look at the phosphate ester linkage, which starts with the 5-prime carbon
1664880	1668800	of a nucleoside, making it a nucleotide.
1668800	1673080	When connected to another nucleotide through its 3-prime hydroxyl, we have the makings
1673080	1679320	of RNA, the molecule responsible for translating the genetic code into proteins.
1679320	1683080	After that, we considered the source of that genetic code, DNA.
1683080	1688360	We saw how DNA is tailored to provide a long-lasting informational template by the removal of the
1688360	1694120	2-prime hydroxyl group from ribose to slow hydrolysis, and by replacement of uracil with
1694120	1698920	thymine to provide a system which can be easily repaired when cytosine is damaged by
1698920	1702920	deamination.
1702920	1707240	We saw how the double helix was discovered, and how it explained so much about the previous
1707240	1711680	90 years of observations by geneticists and chemists.
1711680	1716040	Next we looked at how DNA can be used as a substitute for fingerprinting, providing
1716040	1720600	a much more easily left and much more accurately matched identifier for victims and perpetrators
1720600	1722920	of crimes.
1722920	1727280	We also saw how genetics has given us a way to use DNA to manipulate the biochemistry
1727280	1733160	of bacteria, exploiting their biochemistry to create therapeutic agents for humans.
1733160	1738240	And finally, we looked at how nucleotides themselves can serve as energy storage units
1738240	1740120	in living systems.
1740120	1746920	Specifically, we saw how the conversion from ATP to ADP releases a large amount of energy,
1746920	1751440	which the body can use for muscle contraction, and how creatine and creatine phosphate can
1751440	1754800	help to reload this reaction so it can be used again.
1754800	1759000	This prompts athletes around the world to munch down grams of this organic compound
1759000	1762840	on a daily basis.
1762840	1767720	In our next lecture, we will concern ourselves with the downstream end of biology's central
1767720	1770280	dogma, proteins.
1770280	1773960	We will learn about the structure of amino acids and how they come together, both in
1773960	1778840	biological systems and in the lab, to create the powerful enzyme catalysts that I've described
1778840	1780360	to you in this lecture.
1780360	1781320	I'll see you then.
