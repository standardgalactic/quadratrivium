1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Your physician screens you to determine risk factors for genetic diseases.

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,560
A criminal forensics lab links a sample of blood, skin, or hair from a crime scene to

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,240
a suspected criminal.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,240
A zoologist or botanist confirms that his or her latest discovery is in fact a new species.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,080
A pharmaceutical company manufactures human insulin used to treat diabetics using a bacterium

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,960
as a microscopic production plant.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,960
All of these remarkable accomplishments have one thing in common, DNA.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,680
Elegantly simple in its library of just four letters, but stunningly complex in the size

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,960
and organization of those four letters, DNA and its chemical cousin RNA stand alone among

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,440
biomolecules in their ability to help us carry out these kinds of tasks.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,920
That's right, just four letters.

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,080
That's all it takes to sum up your entire chemical essence.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,280
Using just four simple letters, modern scientists can document, store, and even reproduce a

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,840
code which contains all the basic information which makes you who you are, at least in a

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,480
physiological sense.

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,880
It might sound too simple to be true.

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,080
Why such small alphabet of letters to make up a code as complex as the one that makes

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,680
you, you in a chemical sense?

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,880
Well Nature makes up for the small library of letters with scale.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,240
A single strand of your DNA contains over three billion of these letters.

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,080
Now three billion positions with four possibilities for each makes for more possibilities than

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,120
one can realistically imagine.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,040
To get the same number of possible permutations with 26 letters like our alphabet would require

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:10,280
a literary work equivalent to about 430 copies of Tolstoy's classic War and Peace.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,760
Most of us are familiar with these four letters A, G, C, and T. There are a shorthand notation

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,880
used by geneticists and molecular biologists to represent adenine, guanine, cytosine, and

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
thymine.

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Now these are the four subunits of a compound which is very familiar to us, DNA.

29
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,320
But remember that Voler helped to demonstrate that the chemistry of life is not off limits

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,640
to the organic chemists.

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,040
So awesomely complex those cellular biochemistry may be, it is still rooted in the same foundations

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,240
as the rest of organic chemistry.

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,200
The power of understanding and manipulating DNA has been demonstrated time and again since

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,440
its structure was solved in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick.

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,640
After decades of study, the United States National Institutes of Health and private entrepreneur

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,360
Craig Venter jointly announced that the human genome had been completely mapped.

37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,680
Now mapping genes and sequencing DNA has given us a tool which can be used not only to scan

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,440
for particular health risks in a person, but also to use as a forensic identification

39
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
tool, a guide for targeted gene therapy, and a way to understand the chemical basis on

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,440
which life evolves and changes in response to environmental stimuli.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,000
Our understanding of DNA and the biochemical processes surrounding it has altered our perception

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
of what it is to be a living thing.

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,080
As scientists, we endeavor to study it, understand it, and ultimately manipulate it in ways which

44
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,240
improve our lives.

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,840
Of course, none of this understanding is possible without tearing this beautiful complex down

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,600
into its most basic constituent parts.

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,240
This is what we will do in this lecture.

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Starting from the individual molecules and motifs, we will work our way up to a full

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,760
model for the structure of nucleic acid-containing compounds.

50
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,120
So let's begin with RNA, or ribonucleic acid.

51
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,440
RNA serves several critical roles in converting your genetic code, or genome, into the proteins

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,600
essential to life, also called a proteome.

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,640
In addition to other roles, one of RNA's most important jobs is to transport the information

54
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,840
in the DNA of your cells to areas in those cells where proteins are made.

55
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,440
Now this is a gross underestimation of the versatility of RNA, but for this lecture we're

56
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,920
going to focus on this particular role, since it helps to explain some of the chemical differences

57
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,480
between it and its very close chemical relative, DNA.

58
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,400
The ribo part of that name refers to the carbohydrate ribose.

59
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,680
Now the Fischer projection of D-ribose looks like this.

60
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,120
It's an aldopentose, and like any aldopentose, ribose can undergo cyclization to form the

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:20,120
associated ribofurinose, with its anomeric carbon in one of two positions, alpha or beta.

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,800
It's the beta form of this ribofurinose, which is the central building block of RNA.

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,360
Ribose alone, however, is a fairly uninteresting molecule from a genetic coding perspective.

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,640
I mean, after all, there's only one beta ribofurinose molecule possible.

65
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,620
There's no variation among these structures yet.

66
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,920
To produce the building blocks of RNA, the anomeric hydroxyl in beta ribofurinose is

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,200
replaced with an organic base to a nitrogen atom.

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:02,320
In the case of RNA, these four bases are cytosine, uracil, adenine, and guanine.

69
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,000
RNA uses uracil as opposed to the thymine of DNA, for reasons that we're going to discuss shortly.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,160
Now these units are further subdivided into the class of pyrimidine bases and purine

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,760
bases based on their backbone structures.

72
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,360
So, using one of these four bases as the aglaicone in beta ribofurinose produces one of the four

73
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,760
subunits of RNA, collectively called nucleosides.

74
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,600
And not surprisingly, these nucleosides have names similar to those of the bases which

75
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,120
gave them their identity.

76
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,840
An aglaicone of cytosine forms the nucleoside cytidine.

77
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
Uracil leads to uredine.

78
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,520
Adenine produces adenosine, and guanine produces guanosine.

79
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,200
So we're slowly constructing the monomers of our miraculous biopolymer.

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,480
We've attached a pyrimidine or pyrimidine base to ribofurinose as an aglaicone to create

81
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,160
four different letters in the coding alphabet of life.

82
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,160
But a simple collection of letters is not a code.

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,120
Consider this random collection of letters from our alphabet, randomly distributed about

84
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,200
the screen.

85
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,280
There's a little bit of information here in the quantity and identity of the letters.

86
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,320
But I can communicate even more specific and detailed information if I order the letters

87
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,560
in a certain way.

88
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
So let's put the letters together and see if we can figure out what I'm trying to say

89
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,520
here.

90
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,080
Teachers get sour.

91
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,720
Maybe not.

92
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Carugate sheets.

93
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,600
Well, if this were an engineering course, that would probably be it.

94
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
But it's not.

95
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,840
So let's keep going.

96
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,600
These same letters can be put together to form saucers together, which maybe would be

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
a cooking course.

98
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I don't know.

99
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
UFOs, possibly.

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
Who knows?

101
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,840
Or maybe what I'm trying to say is the great courses.

102
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,560
I can communicate very detailed information with the same letters by combining them in

103
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,360
different orders.

104
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,600
DNA does the same thing.

105
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,240
See the building blocks of each of these phrases are the same.

106
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,680
It's the arrangement of the building blocks, which enriches the code and allows me to encode

107
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,360
far more information using far fewer subunits.

108
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,600
So let's go back to RNA.

109
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,960
We must now find a way to link those nucleoside subunits together into a chain so that there's

110
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,480
a sequence to the collection of Cs, Us, As, and Gs, which will make up the information

111
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,080
in our RNA molecule.

112
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,040
We need a way to string them together, just like we string letters to make words and sentences.

113
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,440
The glue which holds our nucleosides together is a phosphate functional group.

114
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Now, by attaching a phosphate group at the five prime position on the sugar of our nucleoside,

115
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,440
we create a motif called a phosphoester.

116
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,920
This phosphoester group will be the linkage through which our nucleosides are connected

117
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,120
to give our collection of building blocks order.

118
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,400
The collection of three crucial elements, information in the base, the backbone of the

119
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:28,840
ribose, linking the glue of the phosphoester, all together make up what is called a ribonucleotide.

120
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,320
A ribonucleotide is one complete subunit of RNA, ready to be linked to others to create

121
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,840
a useful code.

122
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,440
So let's put our simple code together, consisting of four ribonucleotides condensed into a chain.

123
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,760
We'll use our examples of cytidine monophosphate, uredine monophosphate, adenosine monophosphate,

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,880
and guanidine monophosphate.

125
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,600
These will be our ribonucleotides.

126
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,880
Now if we align them so that the five prime phosphoester of one can condense with the three

127
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,760
prime hydroxyl of another, we can form a phosphoester bridge between the two bases, producing

128
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,000
three water molecules in this case as a byproduct.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,320
So here I put C, U, A, and G together in a very specific sequence.

130
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,680
Now as a convention we always read from the five prime end of the chain toward the three

131
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
prime end of the chain.

132
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,280
Of course this is a very small chain by biochemistry standards as many RNA strands can be thousands

133
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,440
of units long and they're all performing their functions in your body right now.

134
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,040
Among other functions, RNA is nature's messenger molecule.

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,480
This information from the genetic code stored in DNA and assists in the conversion of that

136
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:52,840
information into the vast library of proteins which our bodies use to regulate the biochemistry.

137
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,600
So now we understand a bit about the structure of RNA, a complex biomolecule whose job is

138
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,360
to act as the middleman, getting information from your permanent genetic code to the site

139
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,560
where that code is used to build other compounds.

140
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,520
Because the role of RNA is transmission of information which is carried out on a fairly

141
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,840
rapid timescale, RNA itself doesn't need to endure for long periods of time to effectively

142
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,000
perform its duties in living systems.

143
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,640
In fact, it's part of RNA's design that it can be broken down easily and its components

144
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,280
recycled for use in creating more RNA as it's needed.

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,760
RNA already has a pretty stable backbone, but there's a chink in the armor and it's

146
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,920
right here at the 2-prime hydroxyl group.

147
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,680
This little nucleophile is hanging out right next to the phosphate ester group of the following

148
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,200
nucleoside which has an electrophilic phosphorous atom.

149
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,800
So the connection may last for a while, but before long, a 2-prime hydroxyl of RNA just

150
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,760
can't help but attack the phosphorus, initiating a mechanism which ultimately cuts the chain

151
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,120
that gives RNA its information-carrying ability.

152
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,880
So RNA can carry huge amounts of information back and forth, being broken down and rebuilt

153
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,280
as the organism needs it.

154
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,760
But there would be no information to transport or translate if there were no method of storing

155
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,400
that information indefinitely until it's called upon.

156
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,000
This task of information storage falls to a close chemical cousin of RNA, the famous

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,680
DNA.

158
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,400
Dioxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short, is another ribose-based biopolymer which serves

159
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,680
a very different purpose.

160
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,800
DNA is very similar to RNA, consisting of a phosphate, sugar, and base to form what

161
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,880
we call a deoxyribonucleotide.

162
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,160
But there are two key structural differences which make DNA more robust than RNA.

163
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,880
First, it's the lack of the 2-prime hydroxyl group of the beta ribofurinose sugar.

164
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,400
Instead, this group is replaced with a hydrogen, which is non-nucleophilic.

165
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,840
This removal of the one very specific oxygen from the ribose is the source of the deoxyribo

166
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,320
portion of DNA's name.

167
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,080
With that promiscuous little nucleophile out of the picture, DNA hydrolyzes about 100

168
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,800
times slower than RNA.

169
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,080
And this makes DNA a much better choice, not for a short-lived messenger, but for the

170
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,360
permanent storage of a genetic code which needs to last you the rest of your life.

171
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,560
A second feature of DNA, which makes it a more robust system, is the replacement of

172
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,920
uracil with thymine, a methylated version of uracil.

173
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,520
Now the reason for this difference is that cytosine itself can deaminate spontaneously

174
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,960
to become uracil.

175
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,320
Now obviously, when this happens to your DNA, this is bad news, your DNA just mutated.

176
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,320
But your body has a defense mechanism for this, a complex molecule called an enzyme,

177
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,600
which finds that uracil in your DNA and reaminates it to recover the original cytosine.

178
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
That's amazing, isn't it?

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Your body can actively repair this kind of damage to DNA.

180
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,960
Now, this incredible repair mechanism comes with a cost.

181
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,760
If DNA actually used uracil, how would the enzyme know which uracil is to alter and which

182
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,000
one is to leave alone?

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,960
Well, it wouldn't.

184
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,640
So DNA instead uses thymine as the complementary base for cytosine.

185
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,760
The distinguishing methyl group is acting as a signal to the enzyme saying, hey, I'm

186
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:54,160
supposed to be here, please don't amenate me.

187
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,000
Of course, most of us are familiar with this form of DNA, the double helix.

188
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,720
This structure was first proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, two names which

189
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,080
are often associated with it.

190
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Of course, the truth is that the discovery of the DNA double helix was really the result

191
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:19,600
of a concerted effort on the part of many talented researchers over many decades.

192
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,120
In 1869, Friedrich Miescher first isolated DNA from the nuclei of cells.

193
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,640
It was this biological source which prompted him to name it nucleon, a name which was later

194
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,800
revised to DNA to better reflect its chemical composition.

195
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,480
Russian researcher Phoebus Levine was able to identify the individual components of DNA,

196
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,520
including the sugars, phosphates, and bases which comprised it.

197
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,760
But he lacked the necessary tools to properly explain exactly how each of these pieces came

198
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,400
together to form a structure for DNA.

199
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,920
In the 1940s, Erwin Chargaff developed a method for isolating the bases from DNA samples,

200
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,080
and he found that the number of cytosine bases in any given sample very closely matched the

201
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,760
number of guanine bases.

202
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,520
He also determined that the number of adenine bases closely tracked that of thymine.

203
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,560
In the 1950s, the X-ray crystallography lab of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at

204
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,440
King's College finally reached a milestone in genetics.

205
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,120
They were able to use a technique called X-ray diffraction to determine the spatial arrangement

206
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,000
of atoms within the DNA molecule.

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,160
In the end, it was Watson and Crick, however, who made it to press first with their model

208
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,360
of the double helix, earning them their place in history.

209
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,720
What Watson and Crick proposed explained every observation to date.

210
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,240
The sugar, the phosphate, and the base molecules found by Levine were all accounted for.

211
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,720
And equal amounts of purine and pyrimidine bases from Chargaff's experiments were also

212
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,280
easily explained.

213
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,560
Even the crystallography data from Wilhelm and Franklin's labs, as well as their own,

214
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:15,440
all clearly showed that this helical structure held them all together.

215
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,240
The key to putting it all together was that the two bases, adenine and thymine, when held

216
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:30,960
in place by the proposed helix, form a network of hydrogen bonds, causing them to pair up.

217
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,360
And in cytosine, they form a similar set, but this time with three hydrogen bonds, when

218
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,720
placed on adjacent strands.

219
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,640
So these base pairs, and their noncovalent interactions, which we now call Watson-Crick

220
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,320
pairs, are what hold the two strands of DNA together in this anti-parallel alignment with

221
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
one another.

222
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,160
That's right, the double helix in your DNA is held together by little more than a few

223
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
hydrogen bonds.

224
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,240
Okay, in the human genome, it's about seven or eight billion hydrogen bonds for every

225
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,960
strand of DNA.

226
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,160
But there's even more interaction going on within those base pairs.

227
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,040
The pi systems of neighbors stack with one another, creating a strong contributing dispersion

228
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,440
force between their electron clouds, which holds them together even more.

229
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,960
And this interaction has been successfully targeted as a site for anti-tumor drugs.

230
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,760
See, they can slip in between adjacent bases in rapidly growing cancer cells, and this causes

231
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,160
kinks in their DNA strands, inhibiting their ability to replicate and grow.

232
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,040
DNA is a very exciting structure to study in and of itself, but in recent decades, research

233
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,760
has gone well beyond simply characterizing this fascinating structure.

234
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,720
Ingenious molecular biologists and chemists have devised new applications using the understanding

235
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,520
of DNA given to us by all those who came before.

236
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,360
Probably the most well-known of these is the art of DNA profiling, identifying an individual

237
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,080
and linking them to even the smallest hair, skin, or fluid sample, usually for the purpose

238
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,240
of forensics.

239
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,520
Now there's a common misconception that the sheer size of the human genome makes DNA fingerprinting

240
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,640
statistically irrefutable, and this is because some believe that it involves characterizing

241
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,520
the entire genome of an individual and comparing it to yet another entire genome from a sample

242
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,480
found elsewhere.

243
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,200
But this is not the case.

244
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,520
It can't be, since DNA testing was used long before Ventracompleted the human genome in

245
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
2000.

246
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,720
Now the truth is that a DNA fingerprint is a bit less reliable, but only slightly so.

247
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,480
See, some of the DNA which makes us human is very similar from one person to the next.

248
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,960
In particular, the portions of DNA which code for proteins, sometimes called coding

249
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,400
DNA, is highly similar.

250
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,080
But not all DNA codes for proteins.

251
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,000
In fact, much of it is used as a structural support which holds the coding pieces of the

252
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,360
sequence in their proper place or performs other non-coding functions.

253
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,120
These structural support regions of DNA are sometimes called junk DNA.

254
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,280
This is an unfortunate choice of language, because without it the genes which your body

255
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,480
expresses to keep you alive wouldn't function properly, so this hardly sounds like junk

256
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,980
to me.

257
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,920
Nonetheless, the exact sequence in size of these regions is not as crucial as those comprising

258
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,240
coding regions, and nature knows this, so she lets us get away with greater variability

259
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,240
in these regions of our DNA.

260
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,720
Now there are several methods for what is commonly referred to as DNA fingerprinting,

261
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,920
and all of them focus on non-coding regions of DNA.

262
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,160
In all of the techniques a special process called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR,

263
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,200
is used to induce a DNA sample to replicate, creating a huge number of copies of these

264
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,160
regions from just a small original sample.

265
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,920
We call this process amplification, and this is why just a vanishingly small physical sample

266
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,360
is all that is needed for this kind of technique.

267
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,920
In early methods, a special enzyme known as a restriction enzyme was then added to the

268
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,040
amplified mixture.

269
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,160
The restriction enzyme cuts the amplified DNA, but only at very specific points defined

270
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,040
by a sequence about a half a dozen or so bases long.

271
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,680
This hydrolysis creates a set of fragments whose sizes are unique to an individual.

272
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,660
The fragments are then analyzed using a technique known as gel electrophoresis, which uses an

273
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,560
electrostatic potential to drag pieces of DNA through a thick gel.

274
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,680
This sorts the fragments by size, producing a pattern which is ostensibly unique to the

275
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,320
individual.

276
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,760
More modern testing involves the selective amplification of non-coding regions of DNA

277
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,240
from specific sequence starts, allowing us to bypass the use of a restriction enzyme

278
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,800
altogether.

279
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,520
But the essential concept remains the same.

280
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,400
The statistical likelihood of the number and size of the fragments created by your so-called

281
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,160
junk DNA and mine is vanishingly small.

282
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,280
Another game-changing use found for DNA is in the production of proteins for chemical

283
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,560
research and as medical therapies.

284
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,840
We'll be discussing proteins in detail in our next lecture, but for now I want to focus

285
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,760
on just one of them, called human insulin.

286
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,920
Human insulin is a relatively small protein, but it is crucial to proper blood sugar management.

287
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,700
And adults with type 2 diabetes suffer from an inability to produce the insulin needed

288
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,520
to properly manage this critical solute in their blood.

289
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,440
For decades, sufferers had to inject themselves with solutions of insulin taken from the pancreas

290
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,000
of pigs, which is a great solution for most of the population, but a small variation in

291
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,640
the pig version of insulin elicited an allergic reaction in a small fraction of patients.

292
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,520
So it would be much better if we could offer perfect copies of human insulin for therapies

293
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,400
like this.

294
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,840
Enter DNA in the world of microbiology.

295
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,400
For the past few decades, patients requiring insulin therapy get not the pig version of

296
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,160
the protein, but an exact copy of human insulin, and it doesn't come from the pancreas of a

297
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
human either.

298
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,560
See, scientists take the DNA sequence, which codes for human insulin, and they insert it

299
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,800
into the DNA sequence of E. coli bacteria.

300
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,720
Now don't panic, this is a non-pathogenic strain of the bacteria, and it's dead long

301
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,920
before the therapy is actually conducted on a person.

302
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,320
See, the bacterial DNA is modified in three important ways.

303
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,720
First, the native genes in the bacteria, which code for enzymes that chew up foreign materials,

304
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,840
are removed.

305
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,160
Second, the gene coding for the desired protein is then inserted.

306
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,920
And third, a special trigger is placed right next to that gene that's been inserted.

307
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,760
And in the presence of the proper signaling molecule, this trigger will induce the bacteria

308
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,240
to express a huge quantity of that inserted gene.

309
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,400
With no protective enzymes to clean up the huge quantity of protein being created, the

310
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,040
bacteria are utterly helpless.

311
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,760
They express and express and express until eventually they're not much more than microscopic

312
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,360
bags of human insulin.

313
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,320
And these bags are then broken open, and their contents collected for use in human insulin

314
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
therapy.

315
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,840
Now I'll bet you never thought you'd see the day when E. coli would be an asset to

316
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
human health.

317
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,840
In truth, it already has been for decades.

318
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,880
The sensational impact that our understanding of DNA has on society makes it a central topic

319
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,800
on any lecture covering nucleic acids.

320
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,880
But I don't want you to fall into the trap of thinking that DNA and RNA are the only

321
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,160
way that these powerful little molecules drive biological processes.

322
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,480
Adenosyn, for example, is not only one of the four nucleotides used to produce RNA, but

323
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
it's also one of the body's energy storage vehicles.

324
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,280
When sugars are oxidized in cells, some of the energy produced is used to produce adenosyn

325
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,240
triphosphate, which contains three phosphate ester groups attached to the five prime carbon

326
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,520
of the nucleotide.

327
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,160
The phosphate ester bonds are somewhat unstable, and that should be immediately evident from

328
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,600
the concentration of all that negative charge in such a small space.

329
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,400
So breaking just one of them can release a considerable amount of energy, not only as

330
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,480
a result of hydrating a phosphate, but also relieving the clash of charges.

331
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:11,720
In the process, about 31 kilojoules per mole or about 7.3 kilocalories per mole is released.

332
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,680
Among other things, this ATP to ADP conversion serves as a quick source of stored energy

333
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,760
for muscle contraction.

334
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,480
This is the process which many athletic supplements claim to target, most notably the wildly

335
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,800
successful supplement creatine.

336
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,680
Now, creatine is used as a vehicle in the body to transport phosphate, which is transferred

337
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,360
to ADP by an enzyme called creatine kinase.

338
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,920
It's this function that some believe gives creatine supplementation the ability to increase

339
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,360
endurance during exercise.

340
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,280
Whether creatine supplementation improves physical performance significantly is still

341
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,120
a matter of some debate.

342
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,400
But what is inarguable is that it generates hundreds of millions of dollars of annual

343
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:07,840
sales in the U.S. alone, and it's all based on its ability to phosphorylate ADP.

344
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,680
So let's summarize.

345
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,080
In this lecture, we dug deep into the structure of some familiar biopolymers, RNA and DNA.

346
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,200
We looked at the structure of ribose and its beta-D-pheronose form, which makes up part

347
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,160
of the backbone of RNA.

348
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,480
We saw how four different aglaicones attached to this ring lead to the four RNA nucleosides,

349
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,520
which we call cytosine and uredine, the pyrimidine-based ones, and adenine and guanine, the purine-based

350
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,000
nucleosides.

351
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,880
Then we took a look at the phosphate ester linkage, which starts with the 5-prime carbon

352
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,800
of a nucleoside, making it a nucleotide.

353
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,080
When connected to another nucleotide through its 3-prime hydroxyl, we have the makings

354
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,320
of RNA, the molecule responsible for translating the genetic code into proteins.

355
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,080
After that, we considered the source of that genetic code, DNA.

356
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,360
We saw how DNA is tailored to provide a long-lasting informational template by the removal of the

357
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:14,120
2-prime hydroxyl group from ribose to slow hydrolysis, and by replacement of uracil with

358
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,920
thymine to provide a system which can be easily repaired when cytosine is damaged by

359
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,920
deamination.

360
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,240
We saw how the double helix was discovered, and how it explained so much about the previous

361
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,680
90 years of observations by geneticists and chemists.

362
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,040
Next we looked at how DNA can be used as a substitute for fingerprinting, providing

363
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,600
a much more easily left and much more accurately matched identifier for victims and perpetrators

364
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,920
of crimes.

365
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,280
We also saw how genetics has given us a way to use DNA to manipulate the biochemistry

366
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:53,160
of bacteria, exploiting their biochemistry to create therapeutic agents for humans.

367
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,240
And finally, we looked at how nucleotides themselves can serve as energy storage units

368
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,120
in living systems.

369
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:06,920
Specifically, we saw how the conversion from ATP to ADP releases a large amount of energy,

370
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,440
which the body can use for muscle contraction, and how creatine and creatine phosphate can

371
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,800
help to reload this reaction so it can be used again.

372
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,000
This prompts athletes around the world to munch down grams of this organic compound

373
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,840
on a daily basis.

374
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,720
In our next lecture, we will concern ourselves with the downstream end of biology's central

375
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,280
dogma, proteins.

376
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,960
We will learn about the structure of amino acids and how they come together, both in

377
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,840
biological systems and in the lab, to create the powerful enzyme catalysts that I've described

378
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,360
to you in this lecture.

379
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,320
I'll see you then.
