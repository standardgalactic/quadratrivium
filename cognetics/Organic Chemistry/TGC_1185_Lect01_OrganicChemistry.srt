00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,720
You're lecture is Dr. Ron B. Davis, Jr. Dr. Davis is a

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,480
visiting assistant professor of chemistry at Georgetown

4
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,640
University, where he has been teaching introductory organic

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,680
chemistry laboratory since 2008. He earned his PhD in

6
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
chemistry from the Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Davis

7
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,600
research has been published in such scholarly journals as

8
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,200
proteins and biochemistry and has been presented at the annual

9
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
symposium of the Protein Society. He also maintains an

10
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,920
educational YouTube channel and provides interviews and content

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,600
to various media outlets, including the Discovery

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Channel. At Penn State, Dr. Davis received a Delilian

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,320
Fellowship and the Denmark Teaching Award.

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Most of our understanding of the chemistry of carbon based

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,640
compounds has been accumulated since the discovery of some

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,680
of the most fundamental elements less than 300 years ago. In

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,040
fact, it was only about 3000 years ago that ancient Greek and

18
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Chinese thinkers were the first to postulate the existence of

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,400
fundamental substances at all. But Mother Nature got a head

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,360
star on us about 3 billion years ago, when the first living

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,200
organic chemist on Earth came into existence. Here's one.

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,240
Cyanobacteria believed by most to be the first living organisms

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,400
to inhabit the face of the Earth. Fossil evidence shows that

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,040
these bacteria took up residence here about 2.7 billion years

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,200
ago. Now these little creatures fed, grew and self replicated.

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,440
They contain lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, all the usual

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,040
suspects from a modern biochemistry course. And for the

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
basis of their biochemistry, the central element upon which they

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,720
built the molecular machinery which sustained their own

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,640
existence, they chose carbon. Through the process of evolution,

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,920
the foundations of their biochemistry were passed on to

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,280
each and every living thing that has ever lived on Earth. As

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,240
unicellular organisms continued to evolve and their chemical

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,160
systems grew in complexity, more ordered eukaryotic cells formed

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,960
with organelles to carry out specialized functions. Then came

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,360
multicellular aquatic organisms and terrestrial plant life and

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,520
animals. But through 2.7 billion years of evolution, to the best

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,120
of our knowledge, life as we know it has never, not once

39
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,760
abandoned its choice of carbon as the foundation onto which it

40
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,440
builds its most essential chemistry. With almost 100

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,680
naturally occurring elements and such an expansive time frame,

42
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,960
you might think that somewhere, sometime under some set of

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,880
environmental stresses, life would try a different element and

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,640
have some success. Yet all evidence points to the contrary,

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,800
it simply hasn't. But why?

46
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,280
Carbon is not the most abundant element on Earth, nor is it

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,200
particularly scarce. It's easily made in the furnace of a star

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,680
like our sun. But then so are the other 25 of the lightest 26

49
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,200
elements in our universe. At the sixth smallest in size, its

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,240
atoms don't have an unusually complex or simple structure to

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,080
them. Can't stack up to the ferocious reactivity of elements

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,840
like fluorine, nor is it rock stable like helium. At a glance,

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,880
it seems that there is nothing special about carbon. But in a

54
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,760
way, that is just what makes carbon such a perfect choice to

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,880
serve as the scaffold for the chemistry of life. It strikes the

56
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,800
right balance of properties, which make it uniquely suited to

57
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,960
its role in living systems. And it's this balance that makes

58
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,800
carbon the undisputed centerpiece of living systems.

59
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,920
But carbon's story doesn't end there. Not only is it central to

60
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,400
the chemistry of life, but it also serves as a structural basis

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,400
for materials of incredible strength, fuels with tremendous

62
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
amounts of stored chemical energy, and life saving

63
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,280
medicines. Carbon's story is nothing short of incredible. So

64
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,040
incredible that we've honored it with something no other element

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,440
has its own branch of chemistry. And we call this branch organic

66
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:32,920
chemistry.

67
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,240
Today, I would like to discuss the essentials of organic

68
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,240
chemistry. We'll be looking at what organic chemistry is, how

69
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,960
organic chemistry is practiced, and where we can find organic

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,360
chemistry operating in our world. And don't fall into the trap of

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,200
thinking about the science that goes on in laboratories. Organic

72
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,280
chemistry is going on in places many of us may not typically

73
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,600
imagine. We can find it at work all around us in places as

74
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
distant and exotic as deep within the Earth's crust, or

75
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,280
interstellar space. It's also all around us going on right now

76
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,400
inside countless manufacturing facilities around the world. It's

77
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
powering the engines of the vehicles passing by this studio. And

78
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,040
it's even going on in your own body right now.

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,520
During our time together today, I'll be discussing what is

80
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
arguably one of humanity's greatest intellectual achievements,

81
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,560
the science of chemistry. Then we'll explore how our growing

82
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,320
understanding of how to manipulate the molecules of life

83
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,840
eventually led us to establish the discipline of organic

84
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,080
chemistry. Next, we will briefly discuss the structure of the

85
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,560
fundamental unit of all known elements, the atom. We'll also

86
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
take a look at a portion of the well-known tool of chemists, the

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
periodic table of the elements, which helps us to predict their

88
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
behavior and their properties. Here we will be answering the

89
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
question, what is it about carbon that makes it nature's choice

90
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,000
to serve as the basic scaffold for many of the molecules we

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,680
depend on to sustain and improve life. Finally, we'll take a

92
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,440
look at a few real world examples of how carbon atoms come

93
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,680
together to form the backbones of the molecules that become our

94
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,040
building materials, food, fuels, drugs, and so much more.

95
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,840
By the end of our discussion, I hope that you'll have a deeper

96
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,920
appreciation of organic chemistry, of its definition, its

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,160
origins, and how it helps to improve the quality of life of

98
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,320
nearly every human on the planet. If I'm able to succeed in

99
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,680
that endeavor, I invite you to stay for the next 35 lectures to

100
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,920
learn even more about this well understood, but ever evolving

101
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,760
and growing branch of chemistry. So first, let's define the

102
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,760
science of chemistry. Scientists define chemistry as the study

103
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,520
of matter and its properties, particularly those of atomic and

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,040
molecular systems. One of the defining tenets of chemistry is

105
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,480
the idea that all substances can be broken down into their

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,040
basic elements, which can no longer be subdivided while still

107
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,880
retaining their identity. Ancient Greek and Chinese

108
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,240
civilizations are often credited with first theorizing the

109
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,400
existence of fundamental elements that combine to form all

110
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,920
other substances. Both of these civilizations postulated that

111
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,000
air, water, earth, and fire were among these elements. Of

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
course, today we know this list to be inaccurate. Now, the

113
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,040
realization of this began in the 18th century, when a French

114
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,800
chemist and nobleman named Antoine Lavoisier became the

115
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,240
first to catalog the existence and properties of some of the

116
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,680
elements as we know them today. Lavoisier started to develop

117
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
this catalog when he challenged the two millennium old notion

118
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,120
that water is an element. He knew that if water were an

119
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,880
element, then he should not be able to decompose it into

120
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,120
simpler substances. But he noted that heating water in the

121
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,440
presence of iron in a closed system had two intriguing

122
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,240
effects. First, it turned the iron to rust, which appeared to

123
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,920
increase the mass of the iron sample. And second, it produced

124
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,880
a vapor which could be collected separately and then burned in

125
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,240
air to regenerate water. What was going on here was that the

126
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,800
iron was acting as a sink for oxygen, pulling the oxygen out

127
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,320
of the water to become iron oxide and leaving hydrogen gas

128
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,800
behind as a byproduct. Any doubt that water had in fact been

129
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,280
decomposed was eradicated when Lavoisier showed that he could

130
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,960
burn the collected gas to reform his water. So, Lavoisier had

131
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,920
successfully disassembled and then reassembled water in the

132
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,160
1700s. Lavoisier's tinkering proves that contrary to ancient

133
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,960
thought, water is not an element, but instead is made up of

134
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,440
more basic materials in combination with each other. But

135
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
Lavoisier's best efforts to decompose the resulting gases

136
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,280
from his first experiment failed, prompting him to

137
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,120
categorize those as elements. Now, since it could be burned in

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,800
air, at least the gas that he collected, could be burned in air

139
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,960
to produce water, he dubbed it hydrogen, meaning water maker.

140
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,040
Lavoisier's classification techniques quickly gained favor

141
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,240
in the scientific community and the list of identified elements

142
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,000
rapidly grew in the decades following his work. In the late

143
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,600
1800s, a Russian chemist by the name of Dmitry Mendeleev took

144
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,680
notice of something extraordinary. Mendeleev realized

145
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,560
that when he listed the known elements in order of increasing

146
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,240
atomic mass, they formed a series of materials, some of which

147
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,760
seemed to have similar sets of chemical and physical properties.

148
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
And when he spaced these elements so that similar properties

149
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,720
repeated every eight positions in the list, he could account for

150
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,000
all the known elements of his day. But what is even more

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,760
amazing is that the gaps left in Mendeleev's table allowed him

152
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,240
to predict the properties of yet undiscovered elements, all of

153
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
which eventually turned up. Mendeleev's true genius was to

154
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,720
visually demonstrate this repeating pattern by wrapping

155
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,080
the lines of atoms into rows, much like lines of text in a

156
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,280
paragraph. And by doing this, he created a table with columns of

157
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,640
elements sharing similar chemical properties. We call these

158
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,320
columns from his table groups of elements. More than 200 years

159
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,800
later, his pivotal invention has been refined and expanded into

160
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,520
what we know as the modern periodic table. So we've seen

161
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,960
that chemistry is the study of matter and its properties.

162
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,240
Given that all objects in the universe can be classified as

163
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,840
matter, and that nearly all of this matter is made up of atoms

164
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,760
and molecules, you can understand why chemistry is an

165
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,920
extremely broad field of study. And with such a tremendous field

166
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,840
of cover, it's easy to see why those practicing the science

167
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,280
divide their interest into subdisciplines, like biological

168
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,800
chemistry, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and more. And

169
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,520
while each subdiscipline is a topic worthy of study and

170
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,800
appreciation, for the duration of this course, we will be

171
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,320
interested in organic chemistry. Although there will

172
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,280
inevitably be times when organic chemistry bleeds into these

173
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:50,280
other realms. So what is organic chemistry? When most people

174
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,520
think of the word organic, they may think of expensive

175
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,440
salad greens, health food stores or sustainable farming

176
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,880
techniques. But to the chemist, the word organic means

177
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,320
something very different. Organic chemistry is most simply

178
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,240
defined as the study of carbon based molecules. Compounds

179
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,720
such as the hydrocarbons and gasoline, the sugars in the

180
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
foods we eat, many modern materials ranging from

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,480
explosives to plastics are all built on carbon based

182
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,200
backbones, and therefore all fall into this category. The term

183
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,840
organic as it pertains to the study of chemistry was coined in

184
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,080
the late 1700s. It's a reflection of a common paradigm of

185
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,840
that day, that only organisms could create these kinds of

186
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,960
carbon based molecules. See, scientists of that day had

187
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,760
already successfully isolated carbon based compounds like

188
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,200
urea from biological sources. And it was commonly presumed that

189
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,240
living things possessed a special trait known as vitality that

190
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,080
was necessary to produce the chemicals of living systems.

191
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,640
This dogma persisted for many decades, until 1828, when

192
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,120
German chemist Friedrich Voller produced urea without the aid of

193
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,800
a living organism. Voller simply heated the inorganic materials

194
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,760
ammonia and cyanic acid in an attempt to synthesize another

195
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,480
inorganic material called ammonium cyanate. But much to his

196
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,440
surprise, the product of his synthesis was instead urea. Since

197
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,680
then, Voller's synthesis has become the stuff of chemistry

198
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,240
lore. Many chemists point to it as a seminal moment in chemistry

199
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,240
when vitalism was disproven, and scientists began to realize

200
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,680
organic compounds could be made and manipulated, not just in

201
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,000
living things, but in a beaker as well. In the nearly two

202
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,360
centuries since Voller's inspiration will all be at

203
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,160
accidental synthesis. Organic chemists have classified and

204
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
created millions of organic compounds that enhance the

205
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:07,440
quality of life of nearly everyone on Earth. With over 100

206
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
elements in the modern periodic table, we're forced to ask the

207
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,440
question, What makes carbon so special? Why does carbon get

208
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,320
its own branch of chemistry? Now, the answer to this question

209
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,200
lies in a balance of three key factors, abundance, complexity,

210
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,040
and stability. When we compare carbon to the other elements

211
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,000
in the first three rows of the periodic table, we'll see that

212
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,160
only carbon is able to blend these three factors in a unique

213
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,400
way. Let's start by comparing abundance. If we were to make a

214
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,280
table of the estimated relative abundance of elements in our

215
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,000
solar system by mass, we'd see something like this. Many of the

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,160
elements are so vanishingly rare that they don't even register

217
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,520
on our chart. Hydrogen is the clear winner at about 73

218
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,320
mass percent, followed by helium comprising 24% and then

219
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,440
oxygen at about 1%. So out of more than 100 known elements,

220
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,200
just this trio makes up 98% of all the matter in our solar

221
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,920
system. But coming in at number four is carbon, making up

222
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,560
somewhere around one half of 1% of all the matter in the solar

223
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,160
system. Now, based on this information alone, you might

224
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,800
expect to find subdisciplines of chemistry focusing on the

225
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,280
chemistry of hydrogen, helium or oxygen as well. Yet these

226
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,000
subdisciplines do not exist. These numbers are a bit different

227
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,680
when we consider just the earth or even portions of it. Now, the

228
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,120
truth is, we're not quite sure just how much of each element

229
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,920
makes up the overall mass of our planet. We do know, however,

230
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,080
that as the planet cooled more than 4 billion years ago, much of

231
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,920
the denser elements like iron and nickel found their way to the

232
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,800
core of the planet. Intermediate sized elements like silicon and

233
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,600
aluminum were sorted into the crust, leaving behind even

234
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,000
lighter elements like carbon and higher concentrations at and

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,760
near the surface. So carbon is ever present near the surface of

236
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
the earth in environments which might support life as we know

237
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,960
it. But our best estimates of the amount of carbon in those

238
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,560
environments, the world's atmosphere, oceans and crust is

239
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,360
never more than about 1% of the total mass. This means that

240
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,240
there's enough carbon there to work with. But if abundance were

241
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,800
the only concern, then there would clearly be better choices.

242
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,320
And yet, when we turn our attention to our own bodies, we

243
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,120
see that we are actually made up of about 20% carbon by mass.

244
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,680
This is far more than the relative abundance of carbon in our

245
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,200
environment, far more than the oceans, the atmosphere or dry

246
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,400
land. So carbon is available, but so are many other candidates.

247
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080
So what's going on here? What makes the difference? Why use

248
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,560
carbon?

249
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,400
Well, clearly, there's something about carbon that makes it a

250
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,680
better choice for the structural basis of organic

251
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,080
molecules. With such an enormous amount of carbon in

252
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,160
biological systems relative to the environment around us, it's

253
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,000
easy to see how the concept of vitalism was originally

254
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,720
conceived.

255
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,920
But if vitalism has been shown to be an invalid theory, why is it

256
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,240
that carbon has been selected by nature to be the backbone for

257
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,800
the molecules essential to life?

258
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,440
Why would life go to the trouble of increasing carbon content

259
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,840
20 fold over what was available in the environment, especially

260
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,560
when there are much more abundant elements available, like

261
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,160
nitrogen, which makes up 78% of our atmosphere, or oxygen and

262
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,440
hydrogen, which combined to make up a staggering 96% of our

263
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,360
oceans, or silicon, which comes in at a very respectable 27% of

264
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,280
the Earth's crust?

265
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,040
In order to answer this question, we'll have to take a look at

266
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,080
the bonding behavior of carbon compared to other even more

267
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,480
abundant elements and try to explain a bit better why carbon

268
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,360
is so special when compared to them.

269
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,320
But before we can have this discussion, we first need to

270
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,120
consider the structure of atoms.

271
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,120
All atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded

272
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,600
by a cloud of negatively charged electrons.

273
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
The electron clouds of two or more atoms can interact with one

274
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
another in ways which can find those atoms to a fixed distance

275
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
in space.

276
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,120
We call this interaction between atoms a covalent chemical bond.

277
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Now, one of the remarkable things about Mendeleev's brain

278
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,120
child, the periodic table of the elements, is that it actually

279
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
predicts the maximum number of these covalent bonding

280
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,120
interactions that a particular atom can form with others.

281
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
If we start from the leftmost column of the table, elements

282
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
of the first group can form one bond at most.

283
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Those of the second can form two, and the trend continues

284
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
until we reach the fourth group.

285
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
After this, the maximum number of possible bonds begins to

286
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,120
decrease again to three, two, one, and finally, zero.

287
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,120
This makes hydrogen a relatively uninteresting nucleus

288
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
from the bonding perspective, since it can only form a single

289
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
bond with another atom.

290
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
So hydrogen atoms are the end-linked chains of bonded atoms.

291
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,120
They can't bond any more or two anymore atoms to continue

292
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,120
creating a complex structure, because doing so would require

293
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
that they make a second bond.

294
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,120
That makes hydrogen the placeholder of organic chemistry,

295
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,120
occupying locations on a molecule in which differing groups

296
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
of atoms might be placed to alter that molecule's

297
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
identity and reactivity.

298
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Helium, nature's second most abundant element overall,

299
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
though vanishingly rare on Earth, appears in group

300
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
eight of the periodic table, making it unlikely to form

301
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
any bonds at all.

302
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Helium actually exists only naturally as isolated atoms

303
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,120
that don't commonly react with other elements.

304
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
It's not essential to life at all.

305
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,120
In fact, Helium's lack of reactivity kept its existence

306
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,120
concealed from chemists for nearly a century after the

307
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
discovery of elements like hydrogen.

308
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,120
French astronomer Pierre Janssen first observed Helium

309
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,120
when studying a solar eclipse in 1868, a century after

310
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Lavoisier's work.

311
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,120
And it was only after several more decades of searching

312
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
that Helium was finally found to be present on Earth.

313
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
An English physicist, Sir William Ramsey, found it,

314
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
trapped inside of radioactively decomposing minerals,

315
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
not exactly a biologically relevant environment.

316
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,120
And our final contender with carbon for the role of backbone

317
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
molecule is oxygen.

318
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Oxygen typically makes two bonds to other atoms.

319
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,120
In doing so, oxygen can act either as a bridge,

320
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,120
bonding two different atoms together perpetuating a chain,

321
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,120
or as a terminal atom, making what is known as a double bond.

322
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,120
But once oxygen's two bonds are established,

323
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,120
it is satisfied, and there are no additional locations

324
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
available to decorate or modify an oxygen chain.

325
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Using an oxygen chain as a backbone would then lead to

326
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,120
a rather dull set of molecules, just a set of ever-lengthening

327
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,120
chains of oxygen atoms with no additional complexity at all.

328
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
But carbon interests organic chemists because it's found

329
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
in group four of the periodic table.

330
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,120
This means that it can, and often does, form four bonds

331
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,120
to complete its electron-shell octet.

332
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,120
This is more bonds than any other element in the second row

333
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
of the periodic table.

334
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,120
And this allows carbon to bond to itself to form not only chains,

335
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,120
but branched structures, loops, and many, many more.

336
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Furthermore, these complex carbon scaffolds often have

337
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,120
remaining unsatisfied bonds, which can be terminated

338
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,120
by hydrogen atoms, or decorated by hydrogen atoms,

339
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,120
or decorated by hydrogen atoms.

340
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,120
So it should be clear now that those extra bonds

341
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,120
that carbon can form are going to make all the difference.

342
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
But we aren't quite done yet.

343
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,120
If you're keeping score, we still have nitrogen

344
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,120
and silicon on the list of possible backbone elements

345
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
for larger complex scaffolds.

346
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Nitrogen and silicon have withstood the test

347
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
of both abundance and of bonding conditions

348
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
in the second row of the periodic table.

349
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,120
And silicon and silicon have withstood the test

350
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,120
of both abundance and of bonding complexity.

351
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
With nitrogen abundant in the atmosphere,

352
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,120
able to form three bonds, while silicon makes up

353
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,120
a large part of the Earth's crust and is able to make four bonds.

354
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
So we're close.

355
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,120
But what separates carbon from nitrogen and silicon

356
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,120
is the last factor that we have to consider, strength.

357
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,120
You wouldn't build a skyscraper with a frame

358
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,120
because the structural support has to be stronger

359
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,120
than the doors, windows, and walls which it holds in place.

360
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Organic molecules are no different.

361
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Just like a building, they need a support structure

362
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,120
tough enough to hold the functional parts

363
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
of the compound in place.

364
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Any candidate for this role will have to be tough enough

365
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,120
to withstand the conditions which cause other parts

366
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,120
of the compound to break their bonds and react.

367
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,120
So the final factor leading to nature's choice of carbon

368
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
for small molecule scaffolds is the stability

369
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
of the carbon-carbon bond.

370
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,120
You see, bonding is an energetically beneficial arrangement.

371
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
And a bond's strength is usually measured

372
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,120
by the amount of energy required to separate the bonded atoms.

373
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Scientists call this the bond enthalpy.

374
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,120
So the larger the bond enthalpy, the harder it is

375
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,120
to pull two bonded atoms apart,

376
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,120
and the stronger the chemical bond is.

377
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,120
If we compare the experimentally determined bond enthalpies

378
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
of all first, second, and third row elements

379
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,120
in the periodic table to other atoms of the same kind of element,

380
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,120
we can see that only hydrogen and boron form single bonds

381
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,120
to other atoms of the same kind with similar strengths to carbon.

382
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,120
So hydrogen does bond to itself strongly

383
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,120
and is very abundant, but its one bond limit rules it out.

384
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
Boron can form stable bonds with itself

385
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,120
in networks with up to three bonds.

386
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
But it's so vanishingly rare in the environment

387
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
that it simply can't play an important role

388
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
in the chemistry of life.

389
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Our last two viable candidates, nitrogen and silicon,

390
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
are finally ruled out when we consider bond strength.

391
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
With bonds only about half as strong as carbon,

392
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
nitrogen can't compete.

393
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,120
And even silicon, a favorite candidate of sci-fi aficionados everywhere,

394
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,120
as carbons alternate because of its abundance

395
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,120
and ability to form four bonds, fails to meet the final standard.

396
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Because a covalent network of silicon atoms

397
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,120
would simply not be stable enough to survive chemical reactions

398
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,120
meant to modify other bonds within the molecules it would comprise.

399
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,120
So if we consider the first three rows of the periodic table,

400
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,120
removing elements of prohibitively low abundance,

401
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,120
elements incapable of forming more than two bonds,

402
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,120
and those which do not form strong single bonds to themselves,

403
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,120
it now becomes obvious how these three factors

404
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,120
make carbon uniquely suited to the formation of molecular scaffolds.

405
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
So I hope that by now I've convinced you

406
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,120
that carbon is nature's best available choice

407
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
for the construction of molecular scaffolds

408
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,120
because of its abundance, complex bonding

409
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,120
and the stable bonds it forms with other carbon atoms.

410
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Now I would like to show you specifically how carbon atoms

411
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,120
can combine to form distinct structures

412
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
and how decorating these structures with other atoms

413
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,120
can lead to a rich and diverse library of compounds.

414
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Part of what makes carbon scaffolds so prolific and diverse

415
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,120
is the multiple ways in which the four bonds to carbon atoms

416
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
can arrange themselves in space.

417
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Remember that chemical bonds are formed when electron clouds overlap

418
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,120
and this produces a region of dense negative charge

419
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
between the atom's nuclei.

420
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
So these bonds made up of negatively charged electrons

421
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,120
can be thought of as being negatively charged themselves

422
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
and just as you might expect

423
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,120
because they're made up of like charged particles they repel one another.

424
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Positioning themselves as far apart as possible

425
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
around the central atom.

426
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,120
So when a carbon atom is connected to two other atoms

427
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,120
either by two double bonds or by a single bond and a triple bond

428
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,120
the connected atoms are 180 degrees apart from one another

429
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,120
forming a linear geometry among those three atoms.

430
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,120
When a carbon atom is connected to three other atoms

431
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,120
two atoms by a single bond and one other atom by a double bond

432
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,120
the atoms form a planar geometry in the shape of an equilateral triangle

433
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,120
with bond angles of 120 degrees among all of the atoms.

434
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,120
We call this type of geometry trigonal planar.

435
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,120
But the real magic happens when we use all four bonds

436
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,120
to connect to four distinct bonding partners.

437
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,120
In this case a planar geometry would require 90 degree bond angles

438
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,120
but giving these bonds access to the third dimension

439
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
allows them to separate even more from one another

440
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,120
forming bond angles of 109.5 degrees.

441
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
And we call this arrangement tetrahedral

442
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,120
because tracing lines among all bonded atoms produces the shape of a tetrahedron.

443
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,120
So by bonding carbon atoms together using some or all of these geometries

444
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,120
linear trigonal planar and particularly tetrahedral

445
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,120
we can form almost any three-dimensional arrangement imaginable.

446
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,120
But notice that in all of the examples of carbon scaffolds shown here

447
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,120
there are remaining bonds terminated by hydrogen atoms

448
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,120
which could easily be replaced by other sets of atoms.

449
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,120
This means that each carbon scaffold can act as a backbone

450
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,120
supporting hundreds, thousands or even millions of distinct atom combinations.

451
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
By designing molecules in this way

452
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,120
chemists are able to create compounds with very specific and rationally designed shapes

453
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,120
physical properties and reactivities.

454
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,120
As you can probably imagine this quickly leads to a virtually limitless library of possible compounds

455
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,120
all of which rely on the stability and geometry of their carbon scaffold to function.

456
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
As we progress through the course

457
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,120
we will take a detailed look at how building upon these scaffolds

458
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,120
leads to libraries of compounds with extremely diverse properties.

459
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,120
And I'd like to close our conversation today with a few examples.

460
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Consider compounds with only six carbons in their scaffold.

461
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Using these six atoms we can construct a variety of scaffolds

462
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,120
such as straight chains, branched scaffolds, cyclic scaffolds, fused bicyclics and even more.

463
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Now let's see what we can do with just six carbon atoms in a scaffold

464
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
and a little bit of imagination.

465
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Let's bring up those six carbon atoms and place them in a linear chain.

466
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
If I saturate this structure with hydrogens

467
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,120
meaning I put hydrogens at all the remaining bonding locations on the carbons

468
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,120
I create a molecule known as hexane.

469
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Hexane is a component of motor fuels.

470
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,120
But if I make just a few alterations inserting some oxygen atoms

471
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
I create a molecule known as glucose

472
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,120
a simple sugar found in foods and used by your body to store energy.

473
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,120
If we make a few more changes and throw in a nitrogen atom here

474
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,120
we create lysine, an essential amino acid which your body uses to make enzymes and tissues.

475
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
But let's go back to our carbons and rearrange them.

476
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Let's create a branched chain now.

477
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,120
This branched chain when saturated with hydrogens

478
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,120
is isohexane, yet another component that's blended into motor fuels.

479
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
If I add a little bit to it

480
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,120
I can create leucine, yet another amino acid essential to life.

481
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
But I can make another change

482
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,120
and create isohexyl acetate, a flavor and fragrance additive that smells a bit like fruit.

483
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Let's continue. Let's take those carbons and put them into a ring.

484
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,120
When I saturate my six-membered ring I create cyclohexane, yet another motor fuel.

485
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
But that's not all cyclohexane can do.

486
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,120
If I make a little change I can create the heart medication, cyclohexyl nitrite.

487
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,120
Or I can make the artificial sweetener, cyclomate.

488
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,120
One last example. Let's take those atoms again and put them into a ring.

489
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,120
But this time let's put them into a ring where they have a different bonding structure to one another.

490
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
This is called a benzene ring.

491
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,120
And when it's saturated with hydrogens we call that molecule benzene,

492
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,120
an industrial solvent and also one that we use in the laboratory quite frequently.

493
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,120
But just a small change to that structure gives me aspirin, popular analgesic.

494
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Yet another change gives me TNT, a high explosive.

495
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Impressive versatility and variability, isn't it? All done with just six atoms.

496
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,120
So all of these possibilities and countless more are accessible with just six carbon atoms.

497
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,120
Not only can the number of carbon atoms in scaffolds be changed,

498
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,120
but there is a long library of reactive groups made from other elements

499
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,120
that can be bonded to these carbon scaffolds that we've discussed today.

500
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,120
In tandem, these two factors combine to form a practically inexhaustible library of possibilities.

501
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
So let's review what we've discussed today.

502
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,120
We've explored what organic chemistry is, how it got started,

503
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,120
and how our understanding of it has changed over the years.

504
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,120
We've also scratched the surface of explaining how carbon's abundance,

505
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,120
bonding complexity and bonding strength all combine to make it such a unique

506
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,120
and versatile element for building complex small molecules.

507
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Finally, we've looked at how the decoration of these scaffolds with groups of other atoms

508
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,120
can lead to a diverse library of useful compounds.

509
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Next time, we'll take a much more detailed look at atomic structure and chemical bonding,
