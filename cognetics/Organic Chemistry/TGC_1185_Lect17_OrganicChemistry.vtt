WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.120
So, we're now knee-deep in what I like to call the alphabet soup segment of the course,

00:18.120 --> 00:22.480
where every few lectures we introduce a new element to the train wreck of lines, letters

00:22.480 --> 00:24.080
and dots on the screen.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.200
I make no mistake, there are many players in the organic chemistry game, but there are

00:29.200 --> 00:34.720
just a few which make up the vast majority of the science, and with just two more lectures

00:34.720 --> 00:39.720
to go, we're on the downslope of our short tour, so hang in there.

00:39.720 --> 00:45.440
Now, nitrogen, it's been a player in the chemistry of life since day one, playing an

00:45.440 --> 00:49.720
integral role in the makeup of our simplest organic compounds which came together to create

00:49.720 --> 00:55.240
the spark of life on the early Earth some three billion years ago.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.680
And the biological relevance of nitrogen is evident today, in the experience we get when

00:59.680 --> 01:02.680
we happen on a piece of rotten flesh or spoiled meat.

01:02.680 --> 01:08.520
See, some of the earliest discovered nitrogen-containing compounds received very unappetizing names

01:08.520 --> 01:11.680
like cadaverine and putrassine.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.240
This is a testament to the first source from which they were isolated, and of course to

01:16.240 --> 01:20.120
the smell that they produced.

01:20.120 --> 01:25.200
No discussion of nitrogen is ever complete without the mention of one name in particular,

01:25.200 --> 01:29.960
it's Haber, and you may remember from our lecture on drawing chemical reactions that

01:29.960 --> 01:35.600
Haber was a German chemist working in Germany during the first part of the 20th century.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.800
As one of the more eccentric personalities in the history of organic chemistry, Haber's

01:39.800 --> 01:45.640
famous or infamous for making some very dubious choices about how to pursue and apply the science

01:45.640 --> 01:47.880
of chemistry.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.560
But whatever you may think of as politics, there is one incontrovertible fact that we

01:51.560 --> 01:53.800
can all agree on.

01:53.800 --> 01:59.120
Haber may be responsible for the single, most influential chemical development of the 20th

01:59.120 --> 02:04.680
century, and possibly of all human history, the Haber-Bosch process which allows us to

02:04.680 --> 02:10.240
convert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into ammonia.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.120
You might also remember that I mentioned in a previous lecture, Haber's process for

02:14.120 --> 02:19.400
converting nitrogen to ammonia isn't technically an organic reaction at all, since it lacks

02:19.400 --> 02:21.760
the involvement of carbon.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.200
But by the end of today, I think you'll begin to see why organic chemists owe so much to

02:26.200 --> 02:30.640
this inorganic reaction that we've adopted Haber as one of our own.

02:30.640 --> 02:38.040
In short, the product of his reaction, ammonia, is one of the primary entry points for nitrogen

02:38.040 --> 02:41.520
into the field of synthetic organic chemistry.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.360
Just as certain plants use ammonia from this process as a nutrient to build the organic

02:45.360 --> 02:51.080
molecules they need to live, so do organic chemists often use ammonia to introduce nitrogen

02:51.080 --> 02:55.440
into organics in the laboratory.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.520
Nitrogen is a key element in the structures of many critical commercial materials.

02:59.520 --> 03:04.560
From explosives to fertilizers to polymers, nitrogen is frequently present and almost

03:04.560 --> 03:10.840
just as frequently irreplaceable in the process of creating certain essential goods.

03:10.840 --> 03:15.120
It can be found in a host of organic compounds with diverse applications.

03:15.120 --> 03:20.640
Being a key player in compounds is different and versatile as the explosive nitroglycerin,

03:20.640 --> 03:26.600
the powerful antibiotic vancomycin, and even the proteins making up 20% of the mass in

03:26.600 --> 03:30.280
your own body.

03:30.280 --> 03:36.920
Today we will begin our short survey of nitrogen-containing compounds with a look at amines, amines,

03:36.920 --> 03:42.720
and nitriles, compounds containing only nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.280
Next time we'll bring oxygen back to this dance, but for now let's just concentrate

03:46.280 --> 03:52.760
on the simplest possible classes of nitrogen-containing molecules.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.520
Now I hope I have convinced you that nitrogen is worth taking a look at if not a smell of,

03:57.520 --> 04:02.360
but let's take a look at nitrogen-containing compounds now.

04:02.360 --> 04:09.440
Nitrogen itself has an electron configuration of 1s2, 2s2, 2p3.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.800
So nitrogen's valence shell will be filled when it shares 3 covalent bonds with other

04:13.800 --> 04:15.680
atoms.

04:15.680 --> 04:21.080
This makes nitrogen quite an interesting structural twist, since unlike oxygen, in

04:21.080 --> 04:28.040
its sp3 hybridization state, it can perpetuate chains and can also bear one additional functional

04:28.040 --> 04:31.440
group or substituent.

04:31.440 --> 04:36.520
So the library of nitrogen-containing motifs can get unwieldy pretty quickly.

04:36.520 --> 04:41.480
So let's focus on just the simplest of all these groups to start, those consisting of

04:41.480 --> 04:46.000
only one nitrogen atom bonded to one or more hydrocarbons.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.880
Let's begin with an sp3 nitrogen.

04:50.880 --> 04:56.200
As you can see from this structure, the sp3 nitrogen contains enough electrons to make

04:56.200 --> 05:01.600
three different covalent bonds, but also keeps a lone pair for itself.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.520
The presence of that lone pair means that the three bonds to other atoms are actually

05:06.520 --> 05:11.440
about 109.5 degrees from one another, maybe ever so slightly closer because of the presence

05:11.440 --> 05:15.280
of pushing down from that lone pair of electrons, but in general we can think of them as being

05:15.280 --> 05:19.520
about the same as any other tetrahedral center.

05:19.520 --> 05:25.480
Now if we instead think about a nitrogen which contains a single bond and a double bond, what

05:25.480 --> 05:30.720
we get is a nitrogen in which the lone pair is pushing down on those bonds as well, and

05:30.720 --> 05:36.200
therefore even though there are only two bonded substituents, the angle is closer to 120 degrees

05:36.200 --> 05:38.400
than we might think, it's not 180.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.720
So let's put that one away.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.480
Now let's take a look at one of our nitrogen atoms, but in this case one that is in the

05:45.480 --> 05:47.840
sp hybridized state.

05:47.840 --> 05:54.160
Now in this hybridized state we can have only one bond, excuse me, to our nitrogen and that

05:54.160 --> 05:55.760
is a triple bond.

05:55.760 --> 06:00.080
So in this case the triple bond to our nitrogen leaves the lone pair dangling on the end and

06:00.080 --> 06:04.720
leaves our substituent, whether it's an alkyl substituent or a nitrogen, pointing directly

06:04.720 --> 06:06.920
in the other direction.

06:06.920 --> 06:12.440
Now this means that the family of simple nitrogen-containing compounds is much larger and more complex

06:12.440 --> 06:14.320
than oxygen.

06:14.320 --> 06:19.000
So we now have to consider not just how our heteroatom can terminate or perpetuate a chain,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.800
but also how it can potentially modify that chain, introducing branching in ways that

06:23.800 --> 06:28.600
oxygen simply can't.

06:28.600 --> 06:33.760
So let's start our survey of nitrogen-containing compounds by considering the simplest of all

06:33.760 --> 06:35.720
the amine functional group.

06:35.720 --> 06:42.720
Now an amine functional group is defined as one containing a carbon-nitrogen single bond.

06:42.720 --> 06:48.960
So three examples are here, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.440
You notice that in each case the nitrogen atom indicated in blue is singly bonded to

06:53.440 --> 07:01.320
at least one other hydrocarbon, otherwise we would end up with an ammonia molecule.

07:01.320 --> 07:06.360
Now when a single R-group is attached, we call this a primary amine.

07:06.360 --> 07:12.120
When there are two, a secondary amine, and three, a tertiary amine.

07:12.120 --> 07:18.040
This is our basic method of classifying this kind of molecule.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.160
But it's not enough to simply call them primary, secondary, and tertiary.

07:21.160 --> 07:26.640
We need a nomenclature system which will allow us to identify specific amine molecules, and

07:26.640 --> 07:29.040
we rely on IUPAC for this.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.800
We'll be naming these amines in exactly the same way as we would most other molecules

07:33.800 --> 07:36.680
with one very important change.

07:36.680 --> 07:40.080
Not only will we be doing the usual of finding our longest continuous chain with the functional

07:40.080 --> 07:44.480
group and giving the lowest possible number to the carbon varying the functional group,

07:44.480 --> 07:49.800
but we're going to have a new address of n for the substituent that's bonded to the

07:49.800 --> 07:52.600
actual amine functional group.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.000
Let's take a look at an example.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.800
Let's say we wanted to name this amine.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.480
But we'd go through our usual IUPAC system in which we find the functional group and

08:02.480 --> 08:06.480
the longest attached chain indicated here in orange.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.960
So this would be a pentanamine.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.080
It has a single methyl substituent, and we'll give it an address based upon the location

08:14.080 --> 08:17.120
of the functional group, which is the NH2.

08:17.120 --> 08:21.800
So we would number our parent hydrocarbon in this way, thereby giving the lowest number

08:21.800 --> 08:29.480
to the functional group and giving us the name three methyl, one, and tannamine.

08:29.480 --> 08:33.880
As another example, let's try a secondary amine and see how that affects the name.

08:33.880 --> 08:40.200
In my secondary amine, I have, again, my hydrocarbon parent here in orange.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.120
You'll notice that in this case, my functional group is not at the end of the chain, but

08:43.120 --> 08:45.480
that's okay.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.400
So I have a butanamine.

08:48.400 --> 08:53.320
My butanamine also has an ethyl group attached to its amine nitrogen.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.760
So the ethyl group will get a special address indicated not by a number, but by the letter

08:57.760 --> 09:00.080
n.

09:00.080 --> 09:08.240
So in this case, after numbering my chain, I find that I have an n-ethyl-2-butanamine.

09:08.240 --> 09:16.720
I've now unambiguously named this particular isomer of this particular secondary amine.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.600
What makes amines so different from other compounds is the types of properties that

09:20.600 --> 09:23.960
their polarity and their hydrogen bonding gives them.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.880
When we think about primary and secondary amines, we see that they have Cn dipoles, but that

09:28.880 --> 09:35.080
they also have a very important NH bond, which gives them not only another dipole, but also

09:35.080 --> 09:41.320
gives them the ability to be not only the H bond donor, but also an H bond acceptor.

09:41.320 --> 09:45.880
So just like carboxylic acids, these amines, when they're primary and secondary, have

09:45.880 --> 09:50.280
the ability to hydrogen bond to other molecules of the same kind.

09:50.280 --> 09:56.480
Now, what we find in the case of tertiary amines, however, is that although they contain plenty

09:56.480 --> 10:03.760
of dipoles, making them polar molecules, that they have no NH bonds, therefore they can

10:03.760 --> 10:06.680
only act as hydrogen bond acceptors.

10:06.680 --> 10:12.160
So if we place a trimethylamine molecule next to another trimethylamine molecule, they can't

10:12.160 --> 10:16.760
interact in the same way as their primary and secondary counterparts.

10:16.760 --> 10:21.360
And what this means is that they tend to have much lower boiling points than do primary

10:21.360 --> 10:24.040
and secondary amines, as we can see here.

10:24.040 --> 10:29.640
Now, aside from their volatilities and their ability to hydrogen bond to one another, amines

10:29.640 --> 10:33.560
are most well known in the organic lab as bases.

10:33.560 --> 10:39.000
And the reason that we use them as bases is that the nitrogen, of course, has that special

10:39.000 --> 10:46.120
lone pair right there, which is able to pick up an H+, forming its conjugate acid.

10:46.120 --> 10:51.000
If we consider using methylamine first as an acid, we see that we have to make something

10:51.000 --> 10:56.040
called an amide anion, which is extremely unstable.

10:56.040 --> 11:03.200
So the amide anion not being so stable, the pKa of neutral methylamine is about 35.

11:03.200 --> 11:09.560
And when we reach pKa this level, we tend to think of things as being not acidic at all.

11:09.560 --> 11:15.480
But what methylamine can do instead is use the nitrogen as a base, picking up a proton

11:15.480 --> 11:19.640
from elsewhere, and becoming a methyl ammonium ion.

11:19.640 --> 11:25.460
Now, the methyl ammonium ion is actually fairly stable, and that leads to a pKa of this conjugate

11:25.460 --> 11:27.840
acid of about 11.

11:27.840 --> 11:32.600
So when we mix methylamine into many different organic reactions and organic systems, they

11:32.600 --> 11:37.880
have a strong tendency to accept protons and act as a base.

11:37.880 --> 11:42.560
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about how amines are made.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.440
And I have to admit this again.

11:44.440 --> 11:49.440
When it comes to organic synthesis, the human race has been vested time and time again by

11:49.440 --> 11:52.140
single-celled organisms.

11:52.140 --> 11:57.000
Just as was the case in the synthesis of acid aldehyde, acetic acid, and other oxygen-containing

11:57.000 --> 12:02.280
compounds, it would seem that an extra three billion years of practice afforded to microorganisms

12:02.280 --> 12:09.240
has made them far more prolific at synthesizing nitrogen-containing compounds, too.

12:09.240 --> 12:14.800
Our best natural resource or best natural source for nitrogen-containing organics comes from

12:14.800 --> 12:20.560
the rhizobia bacterium, which live in the root nodules of legumes.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.960
So have you ever driven or walked past a cornfield one year, only to see a field of

12:24.960 --> 12:29.920
soy plants in it the next, and maybe wondered why the farmer suddenly had a change of heart

12:29.920 --> 12:32.160
over which crop to plant?

12:32.160 --> 12:37.720
Well, there's actually far more to the change in crop selection than the whim of a farmer.

12:37.720 --> 12:43.680
You see, corn is very taxing on soil, draining it of nutrients, including nitrogen, and

12:43.680 --> 12:49.360
leaving even the best fertilized fields too depleted to support a following year's crop.

12:49.360 --> 12:55.760
The solution to this problem is crop rotation, in which soybeans and their nitrogen-fixing

12:55.760 --> 13:01.000
stowaways are given a season to grow before their root systems are tilled under to replenish

13:01.000 --> 13:03.880
the nitrogen content of the soil.

13:03.880 --> 13:08.160
So once again, we find ourselves depending on the synthesis skills of these micron-sized

13:08.160 --> 13:14.160
chemists to help us better our quality of life.

13:14.160 --> 13:19.000
But organic chemists aren't cyanobacteria, we're people, and we work in labs.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.360
So let's take a look now at some of humanity's rather clumsy attempts to duplicate this amazing

13:23.360 --> 13:25.720
feat.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.400
Amines are the simplest starting point from which Haber-Bosch ammonia can be injected

13:29.400 --> 13:32.120
into the organic chemistry realm.

13:32.120 --> 13:36.960
And one very simple method used to accomplish this is the direct alkylation of ammonia using

13:36.960 --> 13:41.640
a familiar compound, alkylchlorides.

13:41.640 --> 13:47.000
You see, ammonia is a fairly good nucleophile, and it can be coarsed to react by an SN2 reaction

13:47.000 --> 13:52.720
with a primary or methyl alkyl halide, like this ethylchloride.

13:52.720 --> 13:59.480
When mixed, a nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place, generating a primary amine and

13:59.480 --> 14:02.560
one mole of hydrochloric acid.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.640
So here we run into a potential problem.

14:05.640 --> 14:11.920
Notice that the product amine is also nucleophilic, and in theory can react with yet another

14:11.920 --> 14:16.920
alkyl halide to form a secondary amine, which could then again react to form a tertiary

14:16.920 --> 14:19.400
amine.

14:19.400 --> 14:24.360
So it's rather easy to make a tertiary alkyl amine by direct alkylation, just use a very

14:24.360 --> 14:27.120
large excess of the alkyl halide.

14:27.120 --> 14:31.880
And conversely, we can force the reaction system in the direction of primary alkyl amines

14:31.880 --> 14:36.960
by using a large excess of ammonia, limiting the chances that an already formed primary

14:36.960 --> 14:44.600
amine will productively collide with another alkyl halide before they're all consumed.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.320
But this requires a very large excess of ammonia, and even though his process has helped to

14:49.320 --> 14:54.360
make ammonia relatively abundant and inexpensive, I don't think Fritz Haber would be very happy

14:54.360 --> 14:58.400
with us wasting his hard-earned fixed nitrogen like that.

14:58.400 --> 15:04.320
And Rhizobia is probably already having a pretty good laugh at our expense anyway.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.680
So the solution to this problem, not being mocked by bacteria, but the synthetic problem

15:08.680 --> 15:13.800
at hand, was actually worked out well ahead of Haber's time by one of his countrymen,

15:13.800 --> 15:15.920
Sigmund Gabriel.

15:15.920 --> 15:20.760
Gabriel used what we commonly refer to as a protecting group, to temporarily render

15:20.760 --> 15:26.680
two sites on ammonia unreactive, then restore them to their original state only after the

15:26.680 --> 15:30.480
alkylation was complete.

15:30.480 --> 15:35.800
Gabriel used a compound called thalamine, in place of ammonia, activating it with potassium

15:35.800 --> 15:40.760
hydroxide to create a more nucleophilic thalamide ion.

15:40.760 --> 15:46.840
This ion attacks the alkyl halide much like ammonia would, this time forming an N-alkyl

15:46.840 --> 15:49.480
thalamide intermediate.

15:49.480 --> 15:54.720
But notice that there are no more NH protons to lose, which is a requirement for the reaction

15:54.720 --> 15:58.920
to proceed beyond the first alkylation.

15:58.920 --> 16:04.680
Now after this step, a molecule known as hydrazine is used to remove that protecting group.

16:04.680 --> 16:09.040
Notice that hydrazine contains two potentially nucleophilic nitrogens.

16:09.040 --> 16:14.040
Gabriel also probably noticed that the thalamide motif has two electrophilic carbonyl carbons.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.320
Now that's no coincidence.

16:16.320 --> 16:23.440
The hydrazine first attacks one carbonyl, and then the next, forming a very stable by-product

16:23.440 --> 16:29.840
thalamide hydrazide and our primary amine.

16:29.840 --> 16:34.000
So we've seen that direct alkylation is an easy way to make tertiary amines, and that

16:34.000 --> 16:37.560
primary amines can be made using thalamine.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.080
Amine groups like that are called the Gabriel synthesis.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.560
But what about secondary amines?

16:43.560 --> 16:47.520
They can't be favored by stoichiometric control, meaning adding lots of one reagent or the

16:47.520 --> 16:52.600
other, nor can they be favored using the Gabriel synthesis because that would be a very difficult

16:52.600 --> 16:54.280
modification.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.240
So what do we do?

16:57.240 --> 17:02.360
The simplest solution to this problem is a technique known as reductive amination.

17:02.360 --> 17:07.360
In this reaction, a primary amine, formed by direct alkylation, the Gabriel synthesis

17:07.360 --> 17:14.600
or some other means, is reacted with a ketone or an aldehyde under acidic conditions.

17:14.600 --> 17:19.360
Now under these conditions, an N-substituted amine is formed.

17:19.360 --> 17:23.840
Once this amine intermediate is formed, the product is reduced using a very familiar reagent

17:23.840 --> 17:27.080
to us, lithium aluminum hydride.

17:27.080 --> 17:31.400
This adds hydrogen across the double bond, producing a secondary amine.

17:32.160 --> 17:37.600
In the case of ketones, a branched alkyl group is obtained, whereas with aldehydes, we get

17:37.600 --> 17:40.000
a straight chain secondary amine.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.880
Okay, so now that we've gotten to know amines a little bit, let's take a look at nitrogen

17:44.880 --> 17:48.280
containing compounds with double bonds, or imines.

17:48.280 --> 17:53.920
As I just mentioned, imines are defined as those compounds which contain CN double bonds.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.760
So I've highlighted those for you here in yellow.

17:55.760 --> 18:00.160
Notice that each of these compounds has a carbon double bonded to a nitrogen.

18:00.160 --> 18:04.280
Now having this carbon double bonded to a nitrogen means that they'll behave somewhat

18:04.280 --> 18:10.960
similarly to their carbonyl brethren, ketones and aldehydes, meaning that we can have either

18:10.960 --> 18:18.480
nothing bonded to the carbonyl or we can have one R-group bonded or two R-group bonded.

18:18.480 --> 18:23.280
When we have no R-groups on the carbon of it, we call it a formimine.

18:23.280 --> 18:29.240
When one R-group is present on the doubly bonded carbon, we call this compound an aldimine.

18:29.240 --> 18:35.600
When we have two, we call this type of compound a ketamine, not to be confused with ketamine,

18:35.600 --> 18:39.760
the horse tranquilizer, which is a completely different type of compound.

18:39.760 --> 18:45.080
Now, imines are most easily synthesized by the reaction of ammonia, or primary amine

18:45.080 --> 18:50.960
with ketones and aldehydes, using a strong non-nucleophilic mineral acid like sulfuric

18:50.960 --> 18:52.360
acid.

18:52.360 --> 18:56.880
In this situation, the nitrogen acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl, which

18:56.880 --> 19:03.640
causes one of the amine protons to tautomerize into what we call a beta-hydroxyamine.

19:03.640 --> 19:10.320
Finally, a second tautomerism occurs, leading to departure of a water molecule and formation

19:10.320 --> 19:11.840
of the imine.

19:11.840 --> 19:17.400
Of course, having a double bond, imines can always be reduced to their analogous amines

19:17.400 --> 19:22.600
using lithium aluminum hydride or palladium on carbon or similar chemistry.

19:23.120 --> 19:29.040
Just as we previously did to create a secondary amine, so can a linear primary amine be made

19:29.040 --> 19:32.400
by the reduction of a primary aldamine?

19:32.400 --> 19:37.840
Branched primary amines can be prepared from reduction of primary ketamines.

19:37.840 --> 19:43.600
Linear secondary amines can be prepared from secondary aldamines and branched secondary

19:43.600 --> 19:48.200
amines from secondary ketamines.

19:48.200 --> 19:53.040
But imines are so much more than just intermediates in the synthesis of amines.

19:53.040 --> 19:57.560
They hold their own as a commercially useful class of materials.

19:57.560 --> 20:01.920
You see, imines have the ability to do something that no other functional group we've yet

20:01.920 --> 20:04.480
looked at can accomplish.

20:04.480 --> 20:11.080
They can be used to connect two large pi systems together through resonance.

20:11.080 --> 20:16.720
Let's take a look at a reaction that's actually quite famous.

20:16.760 --> 20:23.440
I'm going to react two molecules of aniline with two different isomers of the molecule

20:23.440 --> 20:24.800
toluidine.

20:24.800 --> 20:31.560
Now, when I do this under oxidative conditions, I get a compound that looks like this called

20:31.560 --> 20:32.560
mauveine.

20:32.560 --> 20:39.360
Now, mauveine has two imine groups highlighted here.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.160
But what's really interesting about these imine groups is that they're not isolated,

20:43.160 --> 20:44.480
they're in resonance.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.440
They have pi systems on both sides.

20:47.440 --> 20:52.760
So if I think about this mauveine molecule as more of its resonance hybrid, I notice

20:52.760 --> 20:57.520
that there's a very large region of delocalized pi electrons.

20:57.520 --> 21:03.160
And as we're going to see in some future lectures, when we have large regions of pi electrons

21:03.160 --> 21:07.560
that can move like this in resonance, we tend to have compounds that can absorb visible

21:07.560 --> 21:08.560
light.

21:09.240 --> 21:15.920
Now, mauveine was first synthesized in 1856 by a British student named William Henry Perkin.

21:15.920 --> 21:21.680
Now, like so many other groundbreaking products, it wasn't design synthesis, but it was actually

21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
an accident.

21:22.680 --> 21:29.320
See, Perkin was trying to oxidize aniline using an oxidizing agent called potassium dichromate.

21:29.320 --> 21:36.040
Now, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how fond you are of the color purple,

21:36.040 --> 21:41.880
his dichromate was contaminated with toluidine, and his synthesis resulted in a thick black

21:41.880 --> 21:44.280
mess of material.

21:44.280 --> 21:49.640
A disappointed Perkin set to cleaning the black sludge from his flask with alcohol only

21:49.640 --> 21:55.760
to find that the resulting solution was a beautiful, brilliant shade of purple.

21:55.760 --> 22:00.720
Perkin quickly sorted out the puzzle of the beautiful purple compound, developing a synthesis

22:00.720 --> 22:04.160
which launched the synthetic dye industry.

22:04.160 --> 22:08.680
His discovery proved so influential that the American branch of the society of chemical

22:08.680 --> 22:13.520
industry has made him the namesake of their highest professional award, conferring the

22:13.520 --> 22:17.960
first one to Perkin himself on the 50th anniversary of his discovery.

22:17.960 --> 22:23.520
So, this is just one more anecdote proving that sometimes an accident and keen powers

22:23.520 --> 22:28.520
of observation are all it takes to make it to the top in science.

22:28.520 --> 22:35.440
Now, let's turn our attention to the simplest compounds containing an SP hybridized nitrogen,

22:35.440 --> 22:38.920
known as nitrials.

22:38.920 --> 22:45.800
So, nitrials contain an SP nitrogen, which means that it's likely to contain a triple

22:45.800 --> 22:47.040
bond.

22:47.040 --> 22:52.600
Now, when we have CN triple bonds like these, there are really only two possible structural

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
approaches.

22:53.600 --> 22:58.200
One is to have a hydrogen attached as the fourth bond to carbon.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.520
The other is to have an R-group.

23:01.520 --> 23:07.400
When the attached motif is a hydrogen, we call this molecule cyanic acid.

23:07.400 --> 23:12.520
If instead the carbon that's triply bonded to the nitrogen contains some kind of R-group,

23:12.520 --> 23:16.840
we call this class of compounds a nitrile.

23:16.840 --> 23:26.040
Now, nitrials are weakly acidic, but HCN, hydrocyanide, or hydrocyanic acid rather, is

23:26.040 --> 23:32.160
actually much more acidic than any other nitrile because its hydrogen is bonded directly to

23:32.160 --> 23:35.600
the carbon which bears the CN triple bond.

23:35.600 --> 23:41.040
So, removal of this hydrogen creates what we call a cyanide ion, which I'm sure we're

23:41.040 --> 23:43.080
all familiar with hearing.

23:43.080 --> 23:48.240
This is the ion that actually is generated in your bloodstream when you inhale hydrogen

23:48.240 --> 23:54.000
cyanide gas as you might if you were in an execution chamber several decades ago.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.520
The ion is actually resonance stabilized and therefore gives HCN a pKa of around 9,

23:59.520 --> 24:03.320
which means that at physiological pHs, it can actually give up a small amount of these

24:03.320 --> 24:07.720
protons leading to the lethal cyanide ion.

24:07.720 --> 24:13.480
Now, acetylnitrile and other nitriles, on the other hand, don't have a hydrogen bonded

24:13.480 --> 24:17.080
directly to the carbon of the nitrile group.

24:17.080 --> 24:21.960
And so, although they can lose these protons and form a resonance stabilized conjugate

24:21.960 --> 24:27.920
base, because it's not directly on the carbon bearing the electron withdrawing nitrogen,

24:27.920 --> 24:33.720
the pKa of compounds like this is actually significantly reduced, about 25.

24:33.720 --> 24:39.440
Now, hydrogen cyanide, of course, is special among nitriles because its pKa allows it to

24:39.440 --> 24:43.880
dissociate partially at physiological pH conditions.

24:43.880 --> 24:48.600
This means in your bloodstream, if you were to ingest or in some other way take in hydrogen

24:48.600 --> 24:51.720
cyanide, there would be a small amount of this ion.

24:51.720 --> 24:57.140
Now, the ion cyanide is a powerful binder to certain proteins involved in the electron

24:57.140 --> 25:04.280
transport chain, which our bodies use to process energy and stay alive.

25:04.280 --> 25:10.360
But cyanide ion is not only very toxic, it's also very nucleophilic, and it interacts strongly

25:10.360 --> 25:12.720
with certain metals too.

25:12.720 --> 25:16.800
And this prompts many chemists to brave this potentially lethal compound in pursuit of their

25:16.800 --> 25:18.440
chemical goals.

25:18.440 --> 25:26.160
For example, cyanide was, and in some cases still is, used as an agent to extract gold

25:26.160 --> 25:29.600
from low-grade ore.

25:29.600 --> 25:36.120
Cyanide and gold form a strong complex known as orosionine, and this complex is far more

25:36.120 --> 25:41.560
water soluble than gold itself, and the gold can be leached from rock using strong solutions

25:41.560 --> 25:43.760
of cyanide in water.

25:44.320 --> 25:49.160
Naturally, this process has to be very carefully monitored, controlled, and of course, its

25:49.160 --> 25:52.440
byproducts thoroughly treated before disposal.

25:52.440 --> 25:57.240
So it would seem that only the lure of something as precious as gold could convince a person

25:57.240 --> 25:59.920
to work with this deadly compound, right?

25:59.920 --> 26:05.160
Well, maybe organic chemists live for danger, because we also use cyanide to produce a much

26:05.160 --> 26:11.360
larger nitrile compound from primary and secondary alkyl halides in a simple SN2 reaction.

26:11.360 --> 26:16.360
Using cyanide as a nucleophile, carbon chains can be conveniently extended by one carbon

26:16.360 --> 26:18.720
creating larger nitriles.

26:18.720 --> 26:23.400
And these nitriles have many uses, including as an alternative to the Gabriel synthesis

26:23.400 --> 26:29.680
to manufacture primary amines without concern of oversubstituting the product.

26:29.680 --> 26:36.720
For example, ethyl bromide plus a cyanide ion leads to a compound known as propane nitrile,

26:36.720 --> 26:42.720
which can be easily converted into propanamine with H2 and platinum catalyst.

26:42.720 --> 26:48.800
Of course, having pi bonds to their heteroatoms means that nitriles can also be thought of

26:48.800 --> 26:53.240
as being similar to carbonyls, just like their immune cousins.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.720
And they tend to have a very electrophilic nitrile carbon, and so they're susceptible

26:57.720 --> 27:00.920
to a nucleophilic attack at that location.

27:00.920 --> 27:05.720
So we can design synthesis in which the electrophilic nitrile carbon is attacked, leading to strategies

27:05.720 --> 27:11.960
to create many of the other functional groups that we've discussed so far.

27:11.960 --> 27:16.160
Probably the most familiar use of the term nitrile is in reference to functional groups

27:16.160 --> 27:21.800
used in certain rubber products, the best example being nitrile examination gloves.

27:21.800 --> 27:27.920
See, the polymer used to produce nitrile rubber is created from a reaction using acrylonitrile

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
as one of its starting materials.

27:29.920 --> 27:34.360
And we're going to take a closer look at this process later on in the course.

27:34.360 --> 27:37.880
But the result of this process is a polymer, which is decorated with repeating nitrile

27:37.880 --> 27:43.960
groups, giving it greater resistance to oils than natural rubber latex.

27:43.960 --> 27:49.040
Of course, another benefit of nitrile latex is that it's prepared completely synthetically,

27:49.040 --> 27:54.000
and therefore it contains no plant material like natural rubber latex does.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.440
And this is why nitrile products don't fall prey to the same allergy-related issues as

27:58.440 --> 28:03.360
natural rubber latex.

28:03.360 --> 28:07.800
So today we injected a whole new element into our thinking about organic chemistry,

28:07.800 --> 28:10.080
the element nitrogen.

28:10.080 --> 28:16.680
We discussed how crucial nitrogen is to many biological molecules, both small and large,

28:16.680 --> 28:21.280
and the length to which Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch were willing to go to get fixed nitrogen

28:21.280 --> 28:24.680
in the form of ammonia.

28:24.680 --> 28:29.840
We talked about how nitrogen typically has three bonds, making it structurally diverse

28:29.840 --> 28:34.360
as an atom, and giving it geometric complexity in the second row of the periodic table that's

28:34.360 --> 28:38.040
only exceeded by that of carbon.

28:38.040 --> 28:43.560
We also talked about the simplest of nitrogen-containing compounds, amines, and how they're classified

28:43.560 --> 28:47.120
as primary, secondary, and tertiary.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.280
We saw how primary amines can be made using the Gabriel synthesis.

28:51.280 --> 28:55.400
Secondary amines can be made by the reduction of amines produced by amination of ketones

28:55.400 --> 28:57.120
and aldehydes.

28:57.120 --> 29:01.640
And we also saw how tertiary amines can be easily made by the direct amination of alkyl

29:01.640 --> 29:05.160
halides.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.640
We touched on the structure and classification of amines, in which the nitrogen contains

29:09.640 --> 29:12.600
a pi bond to an adjacent carbon.

29:12.600 --> 29:18.560
We discussed how primary and secondary, ketamines, and aldehydes can be formed from ketones and

29:18.560 --> 29:22.280
aldehydes using ammonia or primary amines.

29:23.040 --> 29:27.840
And finally, we considered nitrials, in which two pi bonds are present.

29:27.840 --> 29:32.880
We looked at the simplest and most well-known of these nitrials, hydrogen cyanide, which

29:32.880 --> 29:37.440
can be deprotonated to create a potent toxin that's also a good nucleophile in the form

29:37.440 --> 29:40.680
of cyanide ion.

29:40.680 --> 29:45.320
We talked about how cyanide ion can be used to produce larger nitrials by us in two reactions,

29:45.320 --> 29:47.920
with primary and secondary alkyl halides.

29:48.640 --> 29:52.920
And finally, we saw how, in a second step, these nitrial products can be converted into

29:52.920 --> 29:57.960
compounds with a host of other functional groups.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.880
Next time, we're going to bring oxygen back to the discussion and look at some functional

30:01.880 --> 30:07.920
groups which contain both nitrogen and oxygen, from biopolymers to artificial sweeteners

30:07.920 --> 30:08.920
to explosives.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.840
It should be a wild ride.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.840
I'll see you then.
