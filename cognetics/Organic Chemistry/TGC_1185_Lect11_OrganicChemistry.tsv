0	16780	For all the preaching that chemistry professors do about lab safety, it's amazing how many
16780	21480	advances have been made by those who ignored or broke those rules.
21480	26360	As the powerful biological activity of certain small molecules has become more and more apparent,
26360	31880	one of the classic methods of analysis, tasting, has become an absolute taboo in the chemistry
31880	32880	lab.
32880	38300	Yet, some great discoveries have been made by those who broke this very simple rule.
38300	42580	Take the example of Ira Remsen, an American born researcher who had spent significant
42580	47800	time in Germany in the 1870s, studying some of the most advanced chemical techniques of
47800	48800	the day.
48800	54520	Now, we're talking about the late 1870s, the same time as the boom of standard oil and
54520	56360	petroleum processing.
56360	61320	So, when Remsen returned to America to found the chemistry department at Johns Hopkins
61320	66360	University, he chose to study products which could be extracted from coal tar, ostensibly
66360	71240	for use as fuels, building materials and other industrial applications.
71240	76440	But Remsen's fate and the taste buds of his collaborator, Konstantin Fahlberg, took him
76440	78960	down a different path.
78960	83440	One night, after a day in the lab, Fahlberg noticed that his hands were contaminated with
83440	85840	a sweet-tasting substance.
85840	90600	It seemed that Remsen's laboratory had produced something remarkably sweet-tasting.
90600	97120	A quick investigation revealed that the sweet substance is what we now call saccharin, the
97120	100480	age of the artificial sweetener had been born.
100480	105880	In the century and a half since Remsen's isolation of saccharin, artificial sweeteners
105880	108880	have proven to be a blessing and a curse to society.
108880	113200	They clearly offer benefits in the reduction of calories in sweet foods and drinks.
113200	117280	But at the same time, their overall effect on health is hotly debated and thoroughly
117280	120800	researched even today.
120800	124720	These health concerns, along with free market competition, have led to the discovery and
124720	129160	development of a broad range of such sweeteners over time.
129160	134200	And early versions of these products, like saccharin and aspartame, look downright foreign
134200	139280	next to a molecule of sucrose, the molecule which they're all meant to mimic.
139280	144600	But newer options are more closely structurally related to sugar itself, like a molecule of
144600	145600	sucralose.
145600	150880	Now, we're all familiar with the molecule sucrose, or at least what it does.
150880	152480	We use it as a sweetener.
152480	158560	Now, the artificial sweetener sucralose is actually synthesized directly from sucrose
158560	160760	as a starting material.
160760	168240	In order to do this, I have to convert these three OH groups, or hydroxyl groups, into chloride
168240	169760	groups.
169760	174360	Once this is done, I've constructed my sucralose and I'm ready to take it to market.
174360	179720	Now, sucralose costs a little bit more because it has to be synthesized in a lab from sucrose's
179720	180720	raw material.
180720	184300	So, it's going to be about 10 times as expensive to make.
184300	190800	But in addition to being non-caloric, it's also 600 times as sweet as sugar.
190800	195440	Now, I'm not John Rockefeller, but I think I sense a good business opportunity here.
196000	200640	So today, we're going to cross a very palpable threshold in the study of organic chemistry.
200640	206080	Today, we're going to begin considering the fundamental mechanisms by which one compound
206080	207600	can become another.
207600	212600	We'll take the first few steps in our journey to understand exactly how it is at some of
212600	218040	the simpler molecules we've seen so far, and even more complex molecules like sucrose,
218040	223520	can be altered in a meaningful, targeted fashion using the knowledge that we've acquired since
223520	225360	the days of Woller's great accident.
225360	229680	Remember, he's the one that produced urea from inorganic substances giving birth to
229680	231920	the field of organic chemistry.
231920	237920	Now, as complex and detailed as our understanding of the science of chemistry has become, it's
237920	242560	sometimes easy to forget that the vast majority of our understanding of the science is rooted
242560	248960	in just over 200 years of intense study by just a handful of highly influential thinkers.
249920	256400	In the days of Loisier, Woller, and even Markovnikov and Zetsev, organic chemistry consisted of
256400	262400	mainly blindly, albeit very hopefully, mixing reagents in an empirical search for order in
262400	265280	the products that resulted.
265280	269520	As we settled into the 1900s, however, things began to change.
269520	274400	That large body of observational knowledge accumulated over a century had reached a critical
274400	279480	tipping point, the point at which the sum of all former observations started to lead
279480	283120	us to predictive rules about reactions.
283120	288880	In short, observation had led to understanding, which in turn was slowly manifesting an ability
288880	294320	to predict and design reactions.
294320	299440	As we begin our investigation into some reaction pathways, we're going to revisit an old friend,
299440	304400	Christopher Kelk Engeld, who did so much more for the science than just participating
304400	309520	in developing the now familiar con Engeld-Prelog nomenclature convention.
309520	313760	It's also Engeld, who's often credited with first proposing some of the fundamental rules
313760	319520	governing organic reaction mechanisms, which are still in use today.
319520	326240	In 1933, Engeld and his collaborator, E. D. Hughes, wrote a letter to the vaunted scientific
326240	328160	journal Nature.
328240	332880	In this letter, they laid out their argument for a systematic and predictive approach to
332880	340960	understanding one of three basic reaction types in organic chemistry called substitution.
340960	346880	Shortly thereafter, Engeld made this sense of change very clear when in 1934 he wrote
346880	348960	the following of his own research.
348960	349960	Quote,
349960	355440	The new work made it inescapably clear that the old order in organic chemistry was changing.
355440	359360	The art of the subject was diminishing, its science increasing.
359360	364820	No longer could one just mix things, sophistication in physical chemistry was the base from which
364820	368920	all chemists, including the organic chemists, must start.
368920	369920	End quote.
369920	373040	Powerful words.
373040	376840	Over the next three lectures, we're going to investigate the three general reaction types
376840	379960	most often encountered in organic chemistry.
379960	385420	Those are substitution, in which one substituent or functional group is exchanged for another
385420	394460	elimination, in which substituents or functional groups are lost in favor of pi bond formation,
394460	399580	and addition, in which pi bonds are sacrificed to form sigma bonds to new substituents or
399580	402500	functional groups.
402500	407740	So let's begin with substitution reactions and see if we can better understand how sucrose
407740	409740	is turned into sucralose.
409740	414420	Now, before we go quite that far, let's take a look at a simpler reaction than one might
414420	417500	use to convert sucrose to sucralose.
417500	422940	Here I have a hydroxide ion reacting with a methyl chloride molecule.
422940	430300	Now the product of this reaction is a chloride ion and methyl alcohol, also known as methanol.
430300	434140	The reaction if I were to draw as line angle formula would look something like this, in
434140	440420	which the chlorine substituent from my methyl chloride has been replaced by the hydroxyl
440420	442540	from the hydroxide reagent.
442540	447540	So this is a classic example of a very simple substitution reaction.
447540	453660	You'll notice that in my starting materials I have two different species, and in my products
453660	456580	I also have two different species.
456580	460900	So a substitution reaction is what we would call entropically neutral.
460900	466100	It's not really driven or fought against by randomness, it's sort of on the fence on
466100	467100	that.
467100	471460	So what's going to determine whether these reactions occur or not is not the entropy,
471460	475580	but the enthalpy, the strength of the bonds that are breaking and forming.
475580	479060	Now any substitution reaction will have the same basic cast of characters.
479060	485300	A nucleophile, a substrate, an electrophile and a leaving group.
485300	489980	So let's define each of these individually before we proceed.
489980	493940	Nucleophiles are defined as species which easily donate an electron pair to form a new
493940	496900	chemical bond with another nucleus.
496900	500540	Their name in fact literally means nucleus loving.
500540	505100	In our example, the hydroxide ion with a complement of three electron pairs in a full
505100	508580	negative charge is clearly the nucleophile.
508580	513340	It's poised to donate one of those pairs to a new bond and in doing so to relieve that
513340	514900	formal charge.
514900	521220	An electrophile is a nucleus which, unlike the nucleophile, is deficient in electrons
521220	525820	and is capable of receiving electrons from the nucleophile.
525820	530580	In our example, the bond dipole created by the presence of the chlorine substituent makes
530580	537980	the carbon of methylchloride electrophilic, or electron loving.
537980	542780	In contrast to nucleophiles, leaving groups are those groups which easily withdraw their
542780	549780	bonding electrons to become a separate stable species, like the chlorine from our methylchloride.
549780	554340	Recall from our lecture on alkyl halides that withdrawing its bonding electrons and becoming
554340	559300	a chloride ion is more acceptable to chlorine because its large electron cloud allows it
559300	562980	to distribute its charge over a larger volume.
562980	569820	Finally, we term the entire molecule undergoing substitution as the substrate.
569820	577100	In our case, methylchloride would be the substrate for our substitution reaction.
577100	581220	So let's think for just a moment about how a substitution might take place.
581220	586060	With a nucleophile and a leaving group both in the mix, there are three possible permutations
586060	588420	of such a reaction.
588420	593540	One in which the nucleophile first attacks, establishing its bond, then the leaving group
593540	596740	departs, breaking its bond.
596740	602460	There's one in which the nucleophile attacks as the leaving group departs, and one in which
602460	607900	the nucleophile attacks only after the leaving group has departed.
607900	612740	The first of these three situations is impossible, since it would require that a transition state
612740	618340	form in which the electrophilic carbon has more than eight valence electrons.
618340	622900	Many organic professors will joke that to draw such a pentavalent carbon is to immediately
622900	624740	fail their exam.
624740	629660	And there is a modicum of truth in that statement, and I have a reputation to uphold, so we're
629660	632060	not going to go there today.
632060	635740	But the other two are equally valid possibilities.
635740	639460	There's one in which simultaneous attack and departure maintains a balance of eight
639460	645180	electrons around the carbon throughout the transition, and the other in which initial
645180	650180	departure of the leaving group produces a carbocation intermediate with only six valence
650180	651180	electrons.
651180	656820	Non-ideal, yes, but a blatant violation of the octet rule like our pentavalent carbon?
656820	657820	No.
657820	661860	Now one of Ingalls' great contributions to the discipline of organic chemistry is his
661980	668620	1933 description of these two possible pathways by which a substitution can take place.
668620	674780	We call these reaction pathways SN1 and SN2.
674780	682260	This is for nucleophilic substitution, so SN2 stands for substitution, nucleophilic,
682260	690820	second order, and SN1 stands for substitution, nucleophilic, first order.
690820	695300	These names are based upon the reaction mechanism which Ingalls was able to infer from changes
695300	699340	that he made to reagent concentrations.
699340	704380	Any mechanism, no matter how complex, will have what's called a rate limiting step.
704380	708740	This is the slowest elementary step in the mechanism, and it defines the rate of the
708740	709780	reaction.
709780	714860	So just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so a reaction is only as fast
714860	717700	as its slowest step.
717700	723300	So the rate limiting step and all steps before it are affected to some extent by the concentration
723300	727580	of the reagents involved in those steps.
727580	731460	In other words, the rate of a reaction is proportional to the concentration of reagents
731460	737140	in its rate limiting step, but it's unaffected by concentrations of reagents which participate
737140	739260	after that.
739260	744140	In chemistry, we use a rate proportionality constant, written as the lower case letter
744140	750020	K, to produce what's known as a rate law for a given reaction.
750020	754620	So let's take a moment and look at our two generic substitution reactions and try to
754620	759940	get inside of Ingalls' head and see how he came up with his system.
759940	765460	One of the possibilities involved the nucleophile attacking the electrophilic carbon at the
765460	768780	same time that the leading group departs.
768780	774660	Now when this happens, the entire reaction takes place in a single concerted step.
774660	779100	Because there's only one step, clearly this must be the rate limiting step.
779100	783660	And that means that the rate law for this reaction is expected to contain both the concentration
783660	789700	of the nucleophile and the concentration of the substrate, meaning that altering the concentration
789700	793700	of either one should affect the reaction rate.
793700	799220	Because this rate order is two, it's got two different concentrations in it, Ingalls
799220	804460	call this the SN2 reaction.
804460	809540	Now if instead we go through our other possible reaction, one in which first a leaving group
809540	815460	departs from the substrate creating a carbocation intermediate, which is then attacked by the
815460	821420	nucleophile leading to product, we have a situation in which the slow initial step takes
821460	825660	place before the nucleophile ever reacts.
825660	830980	So the rate law for this particular reaction will not contain a factor for nucleophile
830980	832660	concentration.
832660	837140	It will depend only on the concentration of the substrate and because it depends on only
837140	843420	one reactant concentration, Ingalls dub this a first order reaction.
843420	849020	So Ingalls began the process of linking molecular structure with function and reactivity.
849020	854100	He observed that not only did two substitution pathways exist, but that the tendency of reactions
854100	859020	to proceed by one or the other was predictable based on correlated structural features in
859020	861340	the starting materials.
861340	866260	Ingalls sought to explain this in his famous 1933 letter to Nature, and this is what I'm
866260	871060	going to try to explain to you now.
871060	878060	The second order nucleophilic substitution pathway, SN2, is characterized by a bimolecular
878060	884700	reaction in which a nucleophile attacks and a leaving group departs simultaneously.
884700	888980	Because it's the nucleophile's attack which initiates the leaving group's departure,
888980	893140	the attack must take place from the opposite side of the substrate in order to break the
893140	895660	associated bond with the leaving group.
895660	900380	We call this orientation a backside attack.
900380	904940	This type of reaction is expected to take place in a single concerted step with only
904940	909300	one elementary step in the reaction, so we expect the rate to be affected equally by
909300	914060	the concentration of both starting materials.
914060	920820	The key to a reaction running by the SN2 mechanism lies primarily in two factors, strong reactive
920820	927620	nucleophiles like hydroxide and less substituted electrophiles like methyl chloride.
927620	931180	So let's consider each of these factors individually.
932180	937740	A strong nucleophile like hydroxide, it's inherently unstable, its high density of negative
937740	942340	charge around the oxygen atom is the source of that instability, and hydroxide is going
942340	946020	to seek to relieve it at its earliest chance.
946020	952500	Now, another crucial feature is the degree of substitution at the electrophile.
952500	958620	You see, hydroxide might be poised to attack, but it can't attack what it can't get to.
958620	962860	So let's take a look at the substrate from our SN2 reaction.
962860	967740	This is a molecule of methyl chloride, drawn in the usual format so that you can see the
967740	971460	chlorine atom on one side and the methyl group on the other.
971460	975860	But my hydroxide nucleophile has to attack from the opposing side.
975860	980340	So what I'm going to do now is turn my ball and stick model into a space filling model,
980340	983940	and then I'm going to turn that model so that you have the perspective of a nucleophile
983940	985780	that's approaching.
985820	990380	So I'm going to turn my substrate this way, and you can see clearly the electrophilic
990380	992460	carbon is wide open.
992460	996620	We can fit almost anything in there to react with it.
996620	1002860	But what if I were going to use an analogous substrate, which was tertiary, like say T-butylchloride?
1002860	1004980	Let's bring that one up.
1004980	1008580	And again, I'll convert this into a space filling model, and I'm going to rotate it
1008580	1011980	in the same orientation.
1011980	1016620	So now you're the nucleophile looking at a T-butyl substrate and looking at a methyl
1016620	1017820	substrate.
1017820	1022180	I think it's very clear which one you're going to be able to get to easier.
1022180	1026780	So this is the reason why less substituted substrates find themselves in SN2 reactions.
1026780	1030620	They're simply more accessible to the nucleophile.
1030620	1034420	So we've seen what can happen when strong nucleophiles react with substrates of low
1034420	1037900	substitution in an SN2 reaction.
1037900	1043100	Now what if we reverse these conditions, and instead we attempt to react a weak nucleophile
1043100	1047020	with a highly substituted substrate?
1047020	1050940	Let's take a look at water reacting with T-butylchloride.
1050940	1054220	Now water is clearly a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide.
1054220	1058580	It has lone pairs of electrons on its oxygen, but it lacks the negative charge which made
1058580	1062580	the hydroxide attack with such urgency.
1062580	1067780	T-butylchloride has three methyl substituents on the electrophilic carbon, making attack
1067780	1070740	difficult even for a strong nucleophile.
1070740	1074540	So what's going to happen in this situation?
1074540	1079700	Well a patient nucleophile like water, with nowhere to attack, is going to simply wait,
1079700	1084660	biding its time until something more accessible and reactive presents itself.
1084660	1089300	In the case of T-butylchloride, this happens when the chloride ion departs on its own,
1089300	1092780	leaving behind a carbocation.
1092780	1097620	Now T-butylchloride is a distinctively more attractive substrate for two reasons.
1097620	1104220	First, the electrophilic carbon now has only six valence electrons and a full positive charge.
1104220	1111220	Second, its new planar arrangement of substituents means that it's much more accessible to nucleophiles.
1111220	1118100	So this cation is practically begging to be attacked by even the weakest of nucleophiles.
1118100	1123900	Water will oblige in short order, attacking the carbocation and completing the reaction,
1123900	1131740	producing a protonated alcohol which quickly deprotonates to form a neutral molecule.
1131740	1136740	So in this case, it's the formation of a carbocation which is the first and rate limiting
1136740	1140020	of two steps in the reaction process.
1140020	1144620	Because the nucleophilic attack happens after the slow formation of the carbocation, the
1144620	1149500	nucleophiles concentration no longer affects the rate of this reaction.
1149500	1155220	Now remember that SN2 reactions take place in one concerted step, requiring that the
1155220	1161180	nucleophile attack the carbon bearing the leaving group and only that specific carbon.
1161180	1165140	But if we've arrived at our first example of carbocation intermediates, so we have to
1165140	1169380	consider the possibility that rearrangements, like those we discussed in our alkyl halide
1169380	1172980	lecture, might occur.
1172980	1178260	Take the example of 2-chloro-3-methylbutane reacting with water.
1178260	1183660	Just as before, a chloride ion will depart from the molecule, creating a secondary carbocation.
1183660	1188780	But in this example, the resulting carbocation will have that special recipe of a secondary
1188780	1193340	carbocation adjacent to a tertiary carbon.
1193340	1200260	So before a nucleophile attacks, the carbocation can rearrange by hydride shift to form a tertiary
1200260	1201740	alcohol ultimate.
1202500	1208180	Instead of that secondary alcohol that we may have initially predicted, the analogous
1208180	1215540	reaction with 3-chloro-2-2-dimethylbutane would proceed with a secondary methyl shift,
1215540	1220380	also producing a tertiary alcohol, but this time with a different connectivity of carbon
1220380	1225180	atoms altogether.
1225180	1231340	Alkyl shifts can also affect the product in cyclic substrates, such as 1-1-chloroethyl
1231460	1232940	2-methylcyclobutane.
1232940	1237060	I know that's a mouthful, but it's a very simple structure.
1237060	1241060	But remember that the Bayer ring strain theory tells us that these 3 and 4-membered rings
1241060	1244860	in particular are less stable than 5 and 6.
1244860	1249060	So in this case, the carbocation can form adjacent to the strain ring, and the ring
1249060	1254420	can then expand in a sort of alkyl shift, which leads to a product with 5-membered ring
1254420	1257900	instead of 4.
1257940	1261740	Now you've no doubt noticed that our reaction examples today all involved conversion of
1261740	1265740	one tetrahedral carbon center into a different one.
1265740	1270780	So this leads us to our final set of reactions for the day, substitution reactions involving
1270780	1272780	chiral substrates.
1272780	1277700	Now you'll recall that SN2 reactions have to take place by the backside attack, but
1277700	1282980	SN1 reactions produce a planar carbocation intermediate which can be attacked from either
1282980	1286740	side with equal efficiency.
1286740	1291860	This leads to a difference in product composition from a stereochemical standpoint.
1291860	1298860	Now if we were to react a chiral substrate by SN2, for example, enantiopur R2-chlorobutane,
1300180	1303860	we can expect an enantiopur product to form.
1303860	1308180	The identity of the substrate has not only changed, but the stereochemistry has been
1308180	1311540	inverted as a consequence of backside attack.
1311540	1316580	So this reaction would produce S2-butanol.
1316580	1323180	In contrast, let's consider the SN1 reaction between water and R2-chlorobutane.
1323180	1327380	In this case, our substrate must first convert to a carbocation, which can then be attacked
1327380	1331020	by the nucleophile from either side.
1331020	1336940	This leads to what we call a racemic mixture of 2-butanol, in other words, a 50-50 composition
1336940	1342020	of both R and S enantiomers.
1342020	1346700	So we've broken our two substitution mechanisms down to their elementary steps.
1346700	1351820	Of course, for SN2 this means a bimolecular reaction in a single concerted step, but for
1351820	1357060	SN1 there's a unimolecular rate-limiting dissociation of the substrate at the beginning
1357060	1359540	of a two-step mechanism.
1359540	1364660	An Engel proved long ago that the concentration of the nucleophile affects the rate of SN2,
1364660	1367220	but not of SN1.
1367220	1371860	This is a consequence of its absence in the rate-limiting step of the SN1 pathway.
1371860	1376740	But reagent concentration is not the only way to alter the rate of an SN1 or SN2 reaction
1376740	1378420	to our benefit.
1378420	1385060	See, because the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms differ in the chemistry of their rate-limiting steps,
1385060	1389340	it stands to reason their rates can be affected differently by changes in the surrounding chemical
1389340	1391340	environment.
1391340	1395520	Usually, this environment is a liquid solvent in which they're dissolved.
1395520	1399740	So let's take a look at a few substitution reactions and ask ourselves how choosing a
1399740	1404060	different solvent might change the rate of that reaction.
1404060	1412300	We'll start with an SN2, a nice concerted mechanism taking place in a single step.
1412300	1416700	Recall that SN2 reactions are characterized by the presence of strong nucleophiles, which
1416700	1422620	tend to have high negative charge density, species like hydroxide.
1422620	1426620	Now let's consider the effect of running an SN2 reaction between methyl chloride and
1426620	1430660	hydroxide starting materials.
1430660	1436820	The starting material includes the hydroxide with a full, localized negative charge.
1436820	1441740	The reaction then proceeds through a transition state in which that negative charge is spread
1441740	1445700	out across the nucleophile and the leaving group.
1445700	1448580	So the transition state has less charge density.
1448580	1452780	Of course, there are other factors making it less stable in the starting materials like
1452780	1456740	the two bonds that are in the process of breaking and forming.
1456740	1461700	But the fact remains that the activation energy of the reaction is simply the difference between
1461700	1463740	the starting and final states.
1463740	1469220	So anything we can do to close that energy gap will speed up the reaction.
1469220	1473460	Anything we can do to destabilize that starting material more than the intermediate is going
1473460	1477820	to result in acceleration.
1477820	1481980	One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is to choose the right solvent.
1481980	1487780	As you might imagine, solvents of low polarity like the hydrocarbon hexane don't interact
1487780	1491980	well with charged nucleophiles, leaving them highly reactive.
1491980	1495540	And therefore, these nucleophiles are more likely to attack.
1495540	1500020	And the problem which sometimes arises in this situation is that charged nucleophiles
1500020	1506020	simply aren't soluble at all in nonpolar solvents, so we have to choose very carefully.
1506020	1514180	We sometimes classify solvents based not only on their polarity, but also on their acidity.
1514180	1523100	We call solvents like acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and acetonitrile, polar A-protic solvents,
1523100	1526100	because they lack any real acidic hydrogens.
1526100	1533620	Conversely, solvents like isopropanol, ethanol, and water are called polar protic.
1533620	1538460	See all of these solvents have a strong molecular dipole, but the real difference is the orientation
1538460	1540860	of that dipole.
1540860	1545140	You'll notice that all the A-protic solvents have a dipole oriented with the negative end
1545140	1549900	near the surface of the molecule, while all the protic solvents have a dipole oriented
1549900	1554820	just the opposite, with the positive charge density at the periphery of the solvent molecule,
1554820	1558620	and the negative end buried deep within.
1558620	1563500	So the interaction between solvent dipoles and the nucleophile in our example reaction
1563500	1568220	is greater in magnitude than that in the transition state, owing to the stronger charge of that
1568220	1569620	starting material.
1569620	1575500	If we use a polar protic solvent like isopropanol, the positive end of its dipole is readily
1575500	1579340	available to stabilize that charged nucleophile.
1579340	1584220	This lowers the energy of the starting material and increases the activation energy barrier,
1584220	1587860	slowing the reaction down.
1587860	1593020	But if we use a polar A-protic solvent like acetone for this reaction, the positive end
1593020	1597180	of the dipole is buried within the molecule of solvent and can't interact as well with
1597180	1598500	the nucleophile.
1598500	1603660	Instead, the nucleophile sort of sees more negative charge density at the surface of
1603660	1607760	the solvent molecules, and this is very destabilizing.
1607760	1613580	It raises the energy of the nucleophile and lowers the activation energy barrier, which
1613580	1614900	results in a faster reaction.
1617940	1621900	Now in the case of SN1 reactions, we tend to begin the rate limiting step with a neutral
1621900	1627860	substrate like t-butyl chloride, and this neutral substrate dissociates into two ions
1627860	1630460	in that rate limiting step.
1630460	1635900	So since this reaction involves the formation of both a cation and an anion, either protic
1635900	1639340	or A-protic solvents, that's usually not the big concern to us.
1639340	1641260	We could use either one.
1641260	1646540	But the overall polarity of the solvent is crucial, since stronger dipoles in the solvent
1646540	1652580	can produce more stabilizing interactions with the charged intermediates.
1652580	1659060	So while low polarity or polar A-protic solvents tend to accelerate SN2 reactions, polar solvents
1659060	1663420	in general tend to accelerate SN1 reactions.
1663420	1669220	This is a good general rule for prototypical substitution mechanisms I've shown you today.
1669220	1672740	But you should be aware that we'll see many exceptions to this rule as we continue our
1672740	1676580	course and the nature of these species becomes more complex.
1676580	1683100	I'll be pointing them out and explaining what makes these exceptions occur as we reach them.
1683100	1690060	So let's take a final look at the differences in the structures of sucrose and sucralose.
1690060	1696460	The question that we're going to ask today is, when we want to convert sucrose into sucralose,
1696460	1701780	do we need to use an SN1 reaction to complete the synthesis or an SN2 reaction to complete
1701780	1702780	the synthesis?
1702780	1707260	Now, the actual reagents that we'll need to complete the synthesis will come in a later
1707260	1711820	lecture, so we'll be revisiting this synthesis at least one more time.
1711820	1716780	But for today, let's just take a look at sucrose and sucralose and the changes that we want
1716780	1718080	to make.
1718080	1725180	There are three hydroxyl groups on our sucrose molecule, which need to be altered into chlorine
1725180	1726460	groups.
1726460	1732300	But not only that, we have two of them on primary carbons and we have another one on
1732300	1734340	a secondary carbon.
1734340	1739160	So this one is attached to a primary, this one is attached to a primary, and this one
1739160	1743300	over here is attached to a secondary.
1743300	1748580	But another piece of interest here is that that secondary carbon is chiral.
1748580	1753420	And if you look closely, you notice that here I have inverted the stereochemistry, where
1753420	1758380	in this perspective formula my hydroxide is falling behind the plane of the monitor,
1758380	1763540	but in this depiction my new chloride group is coming out of the plane of the monitor.
1763540	1769100	So not only do I have to alter my two primary substrate locations and one secondary substrate
1769100	1774900	location, but I have to alter the secondary substrate location in such a way that it proceeds
1774900	1777540	with inversion.
1777540	1783340	Now all three of these are only congruent with an SN2 reaction.
1783340	1787800	So when the time comes, we're going to have to select reagents to complete our synthesis
1787800	1790860	by an SN2.
1790860	1794020	So let's sum up the work of Ingold and his contemporaries that we've covered in this
1794020	1796020	lecture.
1796020	1800820	We've defined nucleophilic substitution reactions as the reaction between a nucleophile and
1800820	1805700	a substrate to form a product and a leaving group.
1805700	1810060	We discussed how these reactions are usually entropically neutral and tend to be driven
1810060	1815220	by the enthalpies of the reactants and products.
1815220	1819600	We discussed how nucleophilic substitution mechanisms are divided into two classes based
1819600	1822900	upon the rate laws for each pathway.
1822900	1830180	SN2 for bimolecular reactions taking place in a single concerted step and SN1 for reactions
1830180	1834660	taking place in a sequence of steps beginning with the slow departure of a leaving group
1834660	1838380	from the substrate.
1838380	1843500	We took a look at the two most important factors influencing a substitution pathway.
1843500	1848500	How strong nucleophiles and low substitution substrates favor SN2?
1848500	1855020	While weak nucleophiles and highly substituted substrates favor the SN1.
1855020	1861500	We also took a look at the effect each pathway has on the retention of chirality in substrates.
1861500	1866860	Finally, we considered solvent selection for substitution reactions.
1866860	1871940	We looked at how the high negative charge density in strong nucleophiles makes SN2 reactions
1871940	1880180	tend to run best in low polarity solvents or polar aprotic solvents like acetone.
1880180	1884780	We then considered SN1 reactions and how their charged intermediates make them tend to run
1884780	1892900	poorly in low polarity solvents but usually run well in a very broad range of polar solvents.
1892940	1897140	We concerned ourselves today with some of the very ideal conditions of nucleophile strength
1897140	1902420	and substrate substitution to achieve an SN1 or SN2 reaction.
1902420	1905900	Next time we're going to consider what happens when the factors influencing these pathways
1905900	1911300	are in conflict with one another rather than conspiring to a specific substitution mechanism.
1911300	1912420	I'll see you then.
