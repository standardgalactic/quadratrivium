WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.600
It's happened to us all at one time or another.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.320
You sneak down to the kitchen in the dark in the middle of the night for a late night

00:18.320 --> 00:23.840
snack and just as you're about to reach for that last cupcake on the counter, the lights

00:23.840 --> 00:26.520
flip on.

00:26.520 --> 00:31.560
Through your dilated pupils flooded with light, struggle to make out the image of your wife.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.060
Arms folded, foot tapping.

00:34.060 --> 00:38.720
Of course, your pupils quickly constrict in an attempt to limit the amount of light reaching

00:38.720 --> 00:42.960
the receptors in the back of your eye, but it's already too late.

00:42.960 --> 00:47.440
The torrent of photons has done its damage, and you seem to suffer the ill effects of

00:47.440 --> 00:50.880
the overexposure for the next 10 or 20 minutes.

00:51.880 --> 00:57.360
Have you ever wondered what's going on inside your eyes in situations like this?

00:57.360 --> 01:01.360
And aside from the conundrum of why your wife doesn't want you to enjoy that last delicious

01:01.360 --> 01:07.120
morsel before bed, there's also the mystery of why it takes so long to recover your normal

01:07.120 --> 01:11.960
vision after she springs her trap.

01:11.960 --> 01:16.640
The answer to this riddle lies in the structure and behavior of pie bonds and the molecules

01:16.640 --> 01:23.440
responsible for vision, and its alkenes and alkynes, hydrocarbons sharing the same structural

01:23.440 --> 01:29.960
feature as the receptors in your eyes that are the topic of today's lecture.

01:29.960 --> 01:36.040
Now you should recall from our lecture on bonding that the first bond between any two atoms

01:36.040 --> 01:41.120
in organic chemistry is almost always a sigma bond.

01:41.120 --> 01:46.880
The electrons in these bonds occupy an area along the internuclear axis, so they can rotate

01:46.880 --> 01:53.160
like the axle of a car without any meaningful energetic input.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.000
But pie bonds are very different.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.480
During the formation of double and triple bonds, the second and third bonds have to find a

02:00.480 --> 02:05.560
different region of space to inhabit, one which still screens the two nuclei from one

02:05.560 --> 02:10.400
another but doesn't occupy the space directly between them since the original sigma bond

02:10.400 --> 02:14.720
electrons already have claimed to that space.

02:14.720 --> 02:22.480
So pie bonds form as a consequence of side-on overlap of unhybridized atomic P orbitals.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.820
The shape of the P orbitals allows them to overlap in a region above and below the internuclear

02:27.820 --> 02:29.520
axis.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.560
This leads to two distinct differences between pie bonds and sigma bonds, and we've discussed

02:34.560 --> 02:39.440
both of these consequences in earlier lectures, but they bear repeating here.

02:39.440 --> 02:47.200
The first is that double and triple bonds can't rotate freely the way single bonds can.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.700
Rotation of the bond would require that the pie bond be broken completely, leaving only

02:51.700 --> 02:55.360
the remaining sigma bond intact, restoring the rotation.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.840
I can then stop the rotation and restore my pie bond.

02:59.840 --> 03:03.440
Now the second is that pie bonds are weaker than sigma bonds.

03:03.440 --> 03:08.200
Being located in a less centralized molecular orbital means that pie electrons tend to be

03:08.200 --> 03:12.940
held less tightly in the resulting bonding orbital.

03:12.940 --> 03:18.000
This means that less energy is required to break a pie bond.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.280
And when we test the overall bonding energy, we see that a carbon-carbon single bond requires

03:22.280 --> 03:29.080
about 348 kilojoules of energy to break one mole of those bonds.

03:29.080 --> 03:34.120
When we look for a carbon-carbon double bond energy, we see that it requires about 614

03:34.120 --> 03:38.160
kilojoules to break a mole of these bonds.

03:38.160 --> 03:42.320
Assuming of course that the sigma bonds in both of these motifs are of similar energy,

03:42.320 --> 03:48.400
we can easily calculate that it requires about 266 kilojoules to break a mole of pie bonds,

03:48.400 --> 03:53.780
compared to 348 kilojoules for a similar number of sigma bonds.

03:53.780 --> 03:58.920
This means that it's possible to break just a pie bond of a double bond while leaving

03:58.920 --> 04:03.560
the sigma bond intact, if the proper energy is provided.

04:03.560 --> 04:11.840
So the atoms can be kept connected even while free rotation is temporarily restored.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.200
Pie bonds make up the second and third pair of electrons in double and triple bonds respectively.

04:17.200 --> 04:22.400
Yet there's no such thing as a quadruple bond in introductory organic chemistry.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.800
So why is this?

04:23.800 --> 04:28.560
Well, the reason is rooted in the geometry of P orbitals.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.320
Now that pie bonds are formed by the side-on overlap of P atomic orbitals, and this naturally

04:34.320 --> 04:41.880
requires that the orbitals be aligned parallel and adjacent to one another.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.800
So let's take another look at that double bond.

04:44.800 --> 04:49.680
In this case, double bonds are made from one sigma bond and one pie bond, having that pie

04:49.680 --> 04:53.040
bond above and below the inter-nuclear axis.

04:53.040 --> 04:58.320
So the bond angles around these atoms that are involved in the pie bond is about 120

04:58.320 --> 05:00.120
degrees.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.920
If I add a triple bond, I need a region of space to put a new P orbital overlap, so I

05:04.920 --> 05:10.640
can put my two P orbitals which overlap, moving into and out of the plane of the screen here.

05:10.640 --> 05:17.400
So I have yet another pie bond, and now bond angles of 180 degrees among all the atoms.

05:17.400 --> 05:23.400
But a quadruple bond in this case is impossible, because that last P orbital is not aligned

05:23.400 --> 05:28.440
in such a way that the end-on overlap can be achieved.

05:28.440 --> 05:34.360
So it's physically, geometrically impossible to obtain the orbital alignments required

05:34.360 --> 05:37.440
to form a carbon-carbon quadruple bond.

05:37.440 --> 05:42.240
So as far as we're concerned in this course, a quadruple bond to a carbon is just as great

05:42.240 --> 05:50.680
an offense as an expanded octet would be for a carbon atom with five bonds.

05:50.680 --> 05:56.120
Now hydrocarbons, like alkanes, consisting of only sigma bonded hydrogen and carbon atoms

05:56.120 --> 05:58.920
are called saturated hydrocarbons.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.880
Conversely, those hydrocarbons which contain pie bonds are sometimes collectively referred

06:03.880 --> 06:08.560
to as unsaturated hydrocarbons.

06:08.560 --> 06:13.160
This reference is born from the fact that each time I introduce a pie bond to a hydrocarbon,

06:13.160 --> 06:18.760
I have to remove two substituents from the molecule to accommodate it.

06:18.760 --> 06:22.880
Introduction of a double bond here requires that I remove two hydrogens, and a triple

06:22.880 --> 06:25.720
bond requires that I remove four.

06:25.720 --> 06:33.960
So alkanes are saturated with hydrogens, but there are hydrocarbons which are not.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.680
So at the most basic level of organization, I have saturated hydrocarbons, which are also

06:39.680 --> 06:45.880
called alkanes, and two classes of unsaturated hydrocarbons, those with a double bond, which

06:45.880 --> 06:52.200
we call alkenes, and those with a triple bond, which we call alkynes.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.560
So now we understand the geometries of multiple bonds and the classes of hydrocarbons they

06:56.560 --> 06:59.360
create a little bit better.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.960
Let's continue our discussion by considering the simplest possible hydrocarbon containing

07:03.960 --> 07:11.320
a double bond, ethene, also known by its more common name, ethylene.

07:11.320 --> 07:15.160
Ethylene is a naturally occurring alkene and a plant hormone which is critical to the

07:15.160 --> 07:19.040
ripening process and a number of fruits and vegetables.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.920
It's also the single most produced organic molecule in the world, valued for its use

07:23.920 --> 07:30.640
as a synthetic starting material, as well as for its amazing power to ripen foodstuffs.

07:30.640 --> 07:37.360
We take a look at the structure of ethylene, we see that it has a single pi bond.

07:37.360 --> 07:42.200
Propylene contains an extra carbon, but still a single pi bond.

07:42.200 --> 07:48.080
And butylene would be one containing four carbons with one pi bond.

07:48.080 --> 07:52.840
But when we reach butylene, we have to consider the fact that there are different isomers

07:52.840 --> 07:54.600
which can form.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.200
So here I have what I call alpha butylene in which the double bond is at the end of

07:58.200 --> 08:04.280
the molecule, but with four carbons introduced, it's now possible to make beta butylene.

08:04.280 --> 08:11.080
In fact, beta butylene can exist in one of two stereoisomers, cis beta butylene or trans

08:11.080 --> 08:13.600
beta butylene.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.400
They all have the same empirical molecular formula.

08:17.400 --> 08:26.520
So ethylene is C2H4, propylene is C3H6, and my butylenes are C4H8, or a generic formula

08:26.520 --> 08:32.000
of CNH2N, where N is an integer number.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.920
Now moving on to alkynes, the simplest of all alkynes is acetylene.

08:38.920 --> 08:44.440
Now this is a standalone alkyne, there's only one kind like it itself, and that's because

08:44.440 --> 08:49.920
acetylene has hydrogens attached, remember chain terminating hydrogens, attached to both

08:49.920 --> 08:53.640
of the carbons involved in the triple bond.

08:53.640 --> 08:59.560
Whereas the next most complex would be methyl acetylene, and this particular molecule would

08:59.560 --> 09:05.240
be called a terminal alkyne, because one side of the triple bond is continued by another

09:05.240 --> 09:10.720
R group or another bond to carbon, whereas one end of it is terminated and capped off

09:10.720 --> 09:13.800
by that hydrogen.

09:13.800 --> 09:19.000
The final example I'm going to show you here is dimethyl acetylene, in which we have what

09:19.000 --> 09:24.320
we call an internal alkyne, because both of the carbons involved in the triple bond are

09:24.320 --> 09:27.880
bonded to other carbons themselves.

09:27.880 --> 09:35.640
Now the formula for these compounds are C2H2, C3H4, and C4H6.

09:35.640 --> 09:40.360
So though they don't have identical empirical formula, they do follow a mathematical formula

09:40.360 --> 09:48.920
of CnH2n-2.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.920
So far in this lecture we've discussed a few simple hydrocarbons which have pi bonds.

09:53.920 --> 09:59.400
I've used common names to refer to a few simple alkenes and alkynes, but just like any other

09:59.400 --> 10:05.840
class of compounds, there's an IUPAC system which can be used to name them as well.

10:05.840 --> 10:10.760
The presence of weaker and therefore more reactive pi bonds gives alkenes and alkynes

10:10.760 --> 10:14.240
a special place among motifs in nomenclature.

10:14.240 --> 10:19.760
We call them functional groups rather than substituents, and as functional groups they

10:19.760 --> 10:23.600
receive special attention in IUPAC nomenclature.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.320
So these and all other functional groups are indicated not at the beginning of a molecule's

10:28.320 --> 10:32.480
name like substituents are, but rather at the end.

10:33.160 --> 10:37.800
Alright, so let's begin by giving some simple IUPAC names to some of the simplest possible

10:37.800 --> 10:41.120
alkenes and alkynes.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.600
Let's start with ethene.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.880
So named because it has two carbons, hence the eth prefix, and a double bond giving it

10:48.880 --> 10:52.280
the ene suffix.

10:52.280 --> 10:56.760
If I instead have a triple bond between two carbons, I call my molecule eth-ine.

10:56.880 --> 11:03.000
Again, eth for two carbons, i-ine indicating that they're separated by a triple bond.

11:03.000 --> 11:10.840
Now, adding another carbon to this gives me propene and propine.

11:10.840 --> 11:16.720
I can continue adding carbons to my unsaturated hydrocarbons to get butene, but when I get

11:16.720 --> 11:21.200
to this point, again I have four atoms so I have to consider isomerism.

11:21.200 --> 11:26.360
So in this case I use an IUPAC convention to designate the location of the double bond

11:26.440 --> 11:31.280
by giving the number of the first carbon in the chain containing that double bond.

11:31.280 --> 11:36.800
So since in this case my double bond is at the end of the chain, I'll call this one butene

11:36.800 --> 11:43.640
or bute-one-ine as the IUPAC conventions have changed in the 1990s and you'll hear them

11:43.640 --> 11:47.280
used both ways, both the old and the new.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.760
Similarly, we can look at an alkyne the same way.

11:50.760 --> 11:55.160
With four carbons we need to designate the location of the triple bond in this example

11:55.160 --> 12:00.280
it's at the end so this is one butene or bute-one-ine.

12:00.280 --> 12:07.520
And then moving on, I have two butene which actually has multiplisomers and I can also

12:07.520 --> 12:13.760
place my triple bond in the center giving myself two butene or bute-two-ine.

12:13.760 --> 12:19.800
But as the size of alkenes and alkynes grows and the number and complexity of their substituents

12:19.800 --> 12:24.640
increases, using a common nomenclature system just isn't going to take care of the job

12:24.640 --> 12:25.640
anymore.

12:25.640 --> 12:29.280
So we have to switch over to IUPAC.

12:29.280 --> 12:35.840
So let's try a few IUPAC rules out on alkenes and alkynes keeping in mind that the pi-bonds

12:35.840 --> 12:39.840
are not substituents but functional groups so we're going to have to change our rules

12:39.840 --> 12:42.360
a little bit to treat them specially.

12:42.360 --> 12:47.880
Now here's an alkyne, let's try to name this using our IUPAC rules considering the following

12:47.880 --> 12:48.880
changes.

12:48.880 --> 12:53.560
The functional group must have the lowest possible number regardless of other substituents and

12:53.560 --> 12:57.940
also we're going to end our parent compound with ene or ein depending on whether it's

12:57.940 --> 13:00.680
a double or triple bond.

13:00.680 --> 13:08.080
So in our first example, we have a carbon chain with one, two, three, four, five, six

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
atoms total.

13:09.080 --> 13:16.280
It may not be readily apparent because remember the bond angles in alkynes are 180 degrees.

13:16.280 --> 13:20.360
So our parent compound is highlighted in orange.

13:20.360 --> 13:26.040
The alkyne is here between these two carbons.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.720
So this is going to be a hexine molecule.

13:30.720 --> 13:36.840
Now my hexine molecule has a methyl substituent because there's one carbon here, methyl is

13:36.840 --> 13:39.640
the name of that substituent.

13:39.640 --> 13:45.600
And I can number my chain one of two ways either from left to right which puts the methyl

13:45.600 --> 13:52.120
at two and my alkyne at four since we use the lowest numbered carbon that contains that

13:52.120 --> 13:59.320
pi bond or we can number from right to left which would give a two and a five.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.840
Now even though it gives overall higher numbers, I'm going to choose the numbering system that

14:03.840 --> 14:08.760
gives the lowest number to the functional group because it gets priority.

14:08.760 --> 14:15.080
So I'm going to name this compound five methyl to hexine.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.080
Let's try one more.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.240
How about this alkyne?

14:18.240 --> 14:21.240
Well step one is to find the longest chain.

14:21.240 --> 14:25.200
Well the longest chain in the whole molecule is here but there's a problem with that.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.640
It doesn't contain the functional group.

14:28.640 --> 14:33.320
So I can't use this six carbon chain instead I'll have to use this six carbon chain or

14:33.320 --> 14:38.040
excuse me this five carbon chain, one, two, three, four, five.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.240
Even though it's smaller it contains the pi bond.

14:42.240 --> 14:46.000
So this is going to be a pentene molecule.

14:46.000 --> 14:53.760
My pentene molecule has an ethyl substituent with two carbons and again numbering my parent

14:53.760 --> 14:59.920
hydrocarbon giving the pi bond the lowest possible number will give me this numbering

14:59.920 --> 15:06.040
scheme where my lowest numbered carbon in the pi bond is one and the number of the carbon

15:06.040 --> 15:08.680
bearing the ethyl group is two.

15:08.680 --> 15:17.360
So this will be a two ethyl one pentene.

15:17.360 --> 15:22.200
Now we've already looked at how both structural isomerism and stereoisomerism is possible in

15:22.200 --> 15:28.240
alkenes meaning that a wide variety of alkyne structures is possible with just a few carbon

15:28.240 --> 15:30.440
and hydrogen atoms.

15:30.440 --> 15:35.040
These resulting isomers can and often do have differing chemical properties which are of

15:35.040 --> 15:36.920
interest to us.

15:37.920 --> 15:43.200
No discussion on the topic of alkenes is complete without a mention of two of the most influential

15:43.200 --> 15:46.440
chemists in the development of their understanding.

15:46.440 --> 15:51.200
Vladimir Markovnikov and Alexander Zetsev.

15:51.200 --> 15:56.160
Markovnikov and Zetsev were contemporaries studying under another great chemist, Alexander

15:56.160 --> 16:01.280
Butlerov in the Russian system in the 1870s.

16:01.280 --> 16:04.640
These two shared a striking number of commonalities.

16:04.640 --> 16:09.040
Both had entered the Russian university system as students of economics.

16:09.040 --> 16:15.120
Both were wooed to a career study in chemistry by the revered chemist Butlerov and both made

16:15.120 --> 16:19.960
some of their greatest contributions to the field of chemistry by uncovering rules dictating

16:19.960 --> 16:24.280
reactivity and stability involving alkenes.

16:24.280 --> 16:29.200
Now final similarity, one which may have had the greatest influence on their careers was

16:29.200 --> 16:36.600
their unabashed mutual disdain and burning desire to one up one another.

16:36.600 --> 16:41.320
The origins of their personal conflicts are lost to history, but however strained their

16:41.320 --> 16:45.760
personal relationship might have been, the field of organic chemistry undoubtedly benefited

16:45.760 --> 16:47.560
from it.

16:47.560 --> 16:52.120
The resulting rivalry drove them to make discoveries about some of the most basic tenets governing

16:52.120 --> 16:54.520
the chemistry of alkenes.

16:54.520 --> 16:59.160
As our course progresses, we will learn rules bearing the names of both of these great inventories.

17:00.200 --> 17:08.680
With respect to stability of alkenes, Markovnikov believed that less substituted alkenes like

17:08.680 --> 17:12.360
this one butene were more stable.

17:12.360 --> 17:17.000
While Zetzev held the opposing view that the more substituted alkenes isomer, like two

17:17.000 --> 17:21.040
butene, would be more stable.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.520
It may seem like a minor point to quibble over, but at the time the science of organic chemistry

17:25.520 --> 17:27.800
was just beginning to blossom.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.800
So both men knew that the answer to such a question would have a monumental bearing on

17:32.800 --> 17:37.600
our understanding of the most fundamental tenets of organic chemistry.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.640
Greatness was at stake, and both men knew it.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.200
In this crucial debate, it was Zetzev who proved victorious when he published a paper

17:47.200 --> 17:50.080
in 1875.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.200
We already have the tools needed to make his prediction for ourselves.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.640
You may remember that we discussed hyperconjugation previously, how adjacent alkyl groups can

17:58.640 --> 18:01.920
interact favorably with p orbitals.

18:01.920 --> 18:07.840
Well, just like radicals, alkenes have p orbitals.

18:07.840 --> 18:13.000
And because of that, if there are adjacent r-groups which have their bonding orbitals

18:13.000 --> 18:19.600
aligned with that pi system, the electrons from the adjacent bond can participate with

18:19.600 --> 18:24.400
the pi electrons, giving a larger system through which they can move.

18:24.400 --> 18:30.160
And we all know that when you extend the region through which electrons can move, you increase

18:30.160 --> 18:35.760
the stability of the species.

18:35.760 --> 18:41.240
Now Zetzev used an alcohol dehydration reaction, which we're going to look at in a future lecture,

18:41.240 --> 18:47.240
to demonstrate that alkenes of higher substitution are indeed more stable.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.960
Zetzev needed to use this system because, frankly, it was one of the very few understood

18:50.960 --> 18:53.040
reactions in his day.

18:53.040 --> 18:59.920
But this part of the story is going to have to wait for another lecture.

18:59.920 --> 19:04.760
Modern chemists can much more easily verify Zetzev's conclusions.

19:04.760 --> 19:11.880
Today we often compare the stability of unsaturated hydrocarbons using the technique of calorimetry.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.920
Remember that in a calorimetry experiment, a reaction is allowed to run to completion

19:15.920 --> 19:19.440
in a closed, well-insulated vessel.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.560
And the temperature of the contents is then monitored.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.640
On completion of the reaction, the amount of chemical potential energy gained or lost

19:27.640 --> 19:32.320
by the reacting molecules is proportional to the temperature change of the surroundings

19:32.320 --> 19:34.720
within the calorimeter.

19:34.720 --> 19:40.040
Take our example of the two structural isomers of butene, the simplest alkene to have both

19:40.040 --> 19:42.720
structural isomers and stereoisomers.

19:43.720 --> 19:49.480
It's obvious that one butene is unique from two butene, and that one butene has only a

19:49.480 --> 19:55.520
single stereoisomer because one of its alkene carbons has two hydrogen substituents.

19:55.520 --> 20:00.920
Two butene, however, can exist in two different stereoisomeric states.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.480
But which of these three isomers is most stable, and how can we tell?

20:05.480 --> 20:10.280
If we want to compare the relative stability of several related alkenes, we can simply

20:10.320 --> 20:15.560
convert samples of each molecule into their saturated counterparts in a calorimeter using

20:15.560 --> 20:20.680
a reaction known as hydrogenation.

20:20.680 --> 20:26.920
Hydrogenation is a process which saturates alkenes and alkynes using hydrogen gas.

20:26.920 --> 20:32.760
Essentially we're trading two hydrogen atoms for each pi bond in the starting material.

20:32.760 --> 20:37.180
We investigate the details of how and why this reaction happens during our lecture on

20:37.180 --> 20:42.440
addition reactions, but for now let's just focus on the starting materials in the products.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.060
Take a look at all three hydrogenation reactions.

20:46.060 --> 20:52.500
They all start with one mole of alkene, one mole of hydrogen, and end with the exact same

20:52.500 --> 20:56.300
product, butane.

20:56.300 --> 21:01.500
Because the only difference among the reactions is the identity of the alkene, any difference

21:01.500 --> 21:06.500
in the amount of heat released in the reaction must be a reflection of the differences in

21:06.500 --> 21:09.440
the free energies of those alkenes.

21:09.440 --> 21:15.100
In other words, hydrogenation of less stable alkenes releases more heat, causing a greater

21:15.100 --> 21:19.980
temperature change in the calorimeter.

21:19.980 --> 21:23.960
Conducting our simple calorimetry experiment gives us great insight into the factors affecting

21:23.960 --> 21:25.980
alkene stability.

21:25.980 --> 21:31.740
An equal quantity of one butene releases more heat when hydrogenated, which validates Zetzev's

21:31.740 --> 21:33.480
rule.

21:33.480 --> 21:38.480
We also see that not only is Zetzev's rule validated, but the geometric arrangement

21:38.480 --> 21:45.320
of larger substituents also appears to affect stability somewhat, with E2 butene being more

21:45.320 --> 21:50.360
stable than Z2 butene.

21:50.360 --> 21:56.280
The difference in stability between the E and Z isomers is usually attributed to sterics,

21:56.280 --> 22:02.200
that is, the physical proximity of substituent electron clouds in the molecule, placing two

22:02.200 --> 22:08.760
larger alkyl substituents closer to one another as in the Z isomer, causes a natural repulsion

22:08.760 --> 22:15.120
which is not present when those substituents are at opposition in the E isomer.

22:15.120 --> 22:21.120
Not surprisingly, internal alkenes also prove more stable than their external counterparts.

22:21.120 --> 22:26.040
So we see the same trend that Zetzev would predict for internal and terminal alkenes,

22:26.040 --> 22:33.840
though the linear geometry of these compounds precludes any geometric isomerism.

22:33.840 --> 22:38.160
So let's return now to our introductory story.

22:38.160 --> 22:42.640
What goes on chemically when your eyes are overexposed to light?

22:42.640 --> 22:47.160
Or for that matter, when your eyes are exposed to normal levels of light?

22:47.160 --> 22:53.000
The rods and cones in your eyes contain specific molecules which interact with light.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.920
We call molecules like this chromophores.

22:56.920 --> 23:03.320
The chromophore responsible for your vision is called retinol, and it looks like this.

23:03.320 --> 23:08.840
Now retinol has a number of alkene groups, all of which we know from our earlier calorimetry

23:08.840 --> 23:16.280
data should be most stable when in the trans or E configuration.

23:16.280 --> 23:22.560
But the retinol in your eyes has one double bond in the cis or Z-confirmation.

23:22.560 --> 23:27.400
It's locked in this way because of the pi bond on the 11th carbon of the chain.

23:27.400 --> 23:34.320
So this 11-cis retinol wants to be all trans retinol, but it can't get there without some

23:34.320 --> 23:37.500
help.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.440
The help comes in the form of photons, light.

23:41.440 --> 23:46.440
When a photon of appropriate energy strikes the retinol molecule, breaking just the pi

23:46.440 --> 23:54.400
bond on the 11th carbon, sterics calls the C11-C12 bond to rotate before re-establishing

23:54.400 --> 23:59.320
the pi bond in the more stable trans configuration.

23:59.320 --> 24:05.320
This change in the shape of retinol, promoted by absorption of light, induces a conformational

24:05.320 --> 24:08.800
change in a protein to which it's bound.

24:08.800 --> 24:13.920
And this starts a cascade of electrochemical signaling which your brain ultimately interprets

24:14.000 --> 24:18.260
as vision.

24:18.260 --> 24:24.000
An enzyme known as retinol isomerase then resets the alkene bond in retinol to the higher

24:24.000 --> 24:30.340
energy, 11-cis-confirmation, making it ready to detect light again.

24:30.340 --> 24:35.680
This process takes a little bit of time, which explains why it becomes difficult to see for

24:35.680 --> 24:40.400
several minutes after exposure to a very bright light.

24:40.400 --> 24:44.440
So the light sensors in your eyes are really just an elegant application of the concepts

24:44.440 --> 24:49.800
we've been discussing in this lecture.

24:49.800 --> 24:55.280
So I hope we can all agree now that structural and stereoisomerism make alkenes very interesting

24:55.280 --> 24:56.960
to us.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.540
Now it's time for alkynes to take the spotlight.

25:00.540 --> 25:05.160
We know from the geometry of a carbon-carbon triple bond that alkynes are not capable of

25:05.160 --> 25:10.200
that kind of stereoisomerism that makes alkenes so fascinating.

25:10.200 --> 25:13.200
But it doesn't make them uninteresting.

25:13.200 --> 25:20.080
Alkines have properties all their own which make them interesting to organic chemists.

25:20.080 --> 25:23.480
One very interesting property of alkynes is their acidity.

25:23.480 --> 25:28.240
Now it should be evident that internal alkynes don't have a very acidic proton since all

25:28.240 --> 25:33.280
of their hydrogens are on sp3 carbons, just like an alkane.

25:33.280 --> 25:40.360
The pKa of a terminal alkyne however is about 26, which may seem like a very weak acid and

25:40.360 --> 25:43.280
in fact it is.

25:43.280 --> 25:49.320
But compared to the acidity of alkenes with the pKa of 44 and of alkenes whose pKa is

25:49.320 --> 25:55.440
about 60, alkynes start to look like a pretty acidic compound.

25:55.440 --> 26:01.560
So at a pKa of 26, terminal alkynes are weak acids in the overall scheme of things but

26:01.560 --> 26:05.840
they are rock stars of acidity among hydrocarbons.

26:05.840 --> 26:10.680
In fact there are just a few bases available to us in the laboratory, albeit very strong

26:10.680 --> 26:16.240
ones which are capable of deprotonating terminal alkynes.

26:16.240 --> 26:21.320
Most notable of these is the amide ion, the conjugate acid of ammonia, which has a pKa

26:21.320 --> 26:23.480
of about 35.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.800
Easy to work with, no.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.400
But available, yes.

26:28.400 --> 26:33.640
So what's the source of the acidity in compounds like acetylene or propyne?

26:33.640 --> 26:38.440
The answer is that alkyne carbons are sp hybridized.

26:38.440 --> 26:44.360
Now heterolytically breaking the CH bond means that both bonding electrons will go to the

26:44.360 --> 26:46.540
carbon.

26:46.540 --> 26:54.240
This means that the hybrid orbital into which the bonding electrons go has about 50% s-character

26:54.360 --> 27:01.360
as opposed to about 33% s-character for an alkene and 25% s-character for an alkane.

27:04.480 --> 27:09.000
S orbitals hold their electrons tighter and closer to the nucleus than dupi orbitals of

27:09.000 --> 27:11.360
the same principal energy level.

27:11.360 --> 27:17.760
So a more s-character in a hybrid orbital means a more stable lone pair in that orbital.

27:17.760 --> 27:23.560
And a more stable conjugate base means a more acidic conjugate acid.

27:23.560 --> 27:28.800
These deprotonated alkynes are remarkably reactive compared to neutral hydrocarbons.

27:28.800 --> 27:33.240
And we'll see in a few lectures how these deprotonated alkynes can prove very useful

27:33.240 --> 27:39.480
reagents in the synthesis of other organic compounds.

27:39.480 --> 27:44.000
So far we've concerned ourselves with relatively simple, straight and branched alkenes and

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
alkynes.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.440
But just as alkenes can be cyclic, so can alkenes and alkynes.

27:51.440 --> 27:55.960
In fact, we already saw an example of this during our discussion of chirality when we

27:55.960 --> 28:01.800
analyzed the stereochemistry of limony.

28:01.800 --> 28:06.640
Cyclic alkenes and cyclic alkynes follow many of the same rules as cyclic alkenes, but with

28:06.640 --> 28:08.640
two important considerations.

28:08.640 --> 28:13.960
First, just like with linear and branched hydrocarbons, the presence of the pi system

28:13.960 --> 28:18.640
usually makes them much more reactive than similar alkane counterparts.

28:18.640 --> 28:25.720
Second, the inclusion of a double bond with sp2 carbons and angles of about 120 degrees

28:25.720 --> 28:31.080
or a triple bond with sp carbons in a bond angle of about 180 degrees can significantly

28:31.080 --> 28:35.240
affect the ring strain of a cyclic hydrocarbon.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.920
Just take the example of cyclohexane.

28:38.920 --> 28:44.160
If we add a pi bond making cyclohexane, we create a molecule with bond angle strains

28:44.160 --> 28:49.240
forced upon it by the presence of four coplanar atoms from the alkene motif.

28:49.240 --> 28:54.480
Nonetheless, there are many examples of this motif in nature, including our familiar limony

28:54.480 --> 28:58.960
from the rinds of citrus fruits.

28:58.960 --> 29:04.560
Cyclicization of small alkenes also has the important effect of stabilizing the cis isomer.

29:04.560 --> 29:08.840
Recall that when we looked at linear alkenes, we saw how heats of combustion demonstrate

29:08.840 --> 29:14.680
that the trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer.

29:14.680 --> 29:20.160
But in the case of cyclohexane, the trans isomer is impossible to make.

29:20.160 --> 29:24.080
So I've built a model here, including six atoms.

29:24.080 --> 29:29.720
And within these six atoms, I placed a single double bond here, one double bond.

29:29.720 --> 29:37.120
Now if I cyclize this with a cis double bond, I have a pretty good, pretty stable looking

29:37.120 --> 29:38.400
model here.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.960
Maybe not quite as good as cyclohexane, but pretty close.

29:41.960 --> 29:47.800
But what happens if I try to convert this double bond from a cis into a trans?

29:47.800 --> 29:53.320
Well in the case of a six-membered ring, I'm going to break my model kit.

29:53.320 --> 29:57.920
Notice how badly distorted this double bond is just to accommodate what I've attempted.

29:57.920 --> 30:03.440
It's essentially impossible to create this structure.

30:03.440 --> 30:07.920
In fact, in order to be able to create such a structure, a cyclic alkene that is in the

30:07.920 --> 30:11.360
trans confirmation requires at least seven atoms.

30:11.360 --> 30:15.200
Now here I have eight so that I don't break two model kits on one day.

30:15.200 --> 30:21.600
Again, very, very easy to create a cis alkene that looks fairly stable.

30:21.600 --> 30:31.520
But if I try to make the trans alkene, although I can, definitely doesn't look like a very

30:31.520 --> 30:32.840
happy molecule.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
Clearly there's additional ring strain.

30:35.840 --> 30:41.720
Many of my bonds are in poor bond angles and I've had to develop some new clashes from

30:41.720 --> 30:44.880
eclipsing interactions as well.

30:44.880 --> 30:50.680
So in the case of seven, eight, nine, or ten atoms, we can make the trans but not very

30:50.680 --> 30:51.680
stable.

30:51.680 --> 30:59.320
In fact, we have to get all the way to eleven atoms before we reach the point where a trans

30:59.320 --> 31:02.000
isomer is actually more stable once again.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.480
When we reach eleven atoms, we have enough conformational flexibility that my double

31:06.480 --> 31:10.760
bond in the trans configuration is tolerated very well.

31:10.760 --> 31:15.520
I can find lots of good stable conformations, which give it lots of room, and I don't break

31:15.520 --> 31:18.520
the double bond and I can reuse it later.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.640
Now take your model kit.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.040
Try to make cyclohexine.

31:26.040 --> 31:31.080
The 180 degree bond angle in the alkyne part of that system makes it almost geometrically

31:31.080 --> 31:34.440
impossible for this molecule to exist.

31:34.440 --> 31:39.920
I say almost because the carbon-carbon triple bond of an alkyne is about 20 percent shorter

31:39.920 --> 31:43.240
than a typical carbon-carbon single bond.

31:43.240 --> 31:48.600
Now this means that cyclohexine can theoretically exist and it probably does form as a high

31:48.600 --> 31:54.000
energy intermediate in certain reactions, but it can't be isolated and bottled like

31:54.000 --> 31:58.560
it's cyclohexene and cyclohexane cousins.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.760
Of course larger cyclic alkynes do exist.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.640
Cyclo-octyne for example is the smallest cyclic alkyne which is stable enough to be prepared

32:06.640 --> 32:08.640
and collected.

32:10.720 --> 32:16.080
So in this lecture we investigated how pi bonds change the chemistry of hydrocarbons.

32:16.080 --> 32:20.640
We took a look at how the geometry of the orbitals involved results in a weaker bond

32:20.640 --> 32:26.440
than their sigma-conner parts, but which restricts rotation about carbon-carbon bonds and also

32:26.440 --> 32:30.240
carbon-carbon triple bonds.

32:30.240 --> 32:36.320
We discussed alkenes, hydrocarbons containing double bonds, as well as alkynes, hydrocarbons

32:36.320 --> 32:38.540
containing triple bonds.

32:38.540 --> 32:43.200
We saw how these double and triple bonds are reactive and therefore are treated with higher

32:43.200 --> 32:47.720
priority in nomenclature than the simple alkyl substituents.

32:47.720 --> 32:52.960
We call these higher priority reactive motifs functional groups.

32:52.960 --> 32:57.560
We took a look at one of the great chemistry rivalries of all time, that between Markovnikov

32:57.560 --> 33:02.660
and Zetzev over trends in the stability of alkenes.

33:02.660 --> 33:06.840
We investigated how their work led to our understanding of trends in stability among

33:06.840 --> 33:13.640
various regio and stereoisomers of the same molecular formula.

33:13.640 --> 33:19.160
We took a look at how the function of a biologically relevant molecule, retinol, is tied to these

33:19.160 --> 33:25.520
trends in stability, that the spontaneous conversion of retinol from 11 cis to all trans

33:25.520 --> 33:31.120
conformations takes place when a photon temporarily breaks the associated pi bond.

33:31.120 --> 33:37.560
Next, we covered the unusual acidity of terminal alkynes and how the presence of a hydrogen

33:37.560 --> 33:43.520
on an SP-hybridized carbon is a rare structural feature which makes alkynes much more acidic

33:43.520 --> 33:46.120
than ordinary hydrocarbons.

33:47.120 --> 33:52.440
Finally, we investigated the effect of pi bonds on cyclic structures and how their presence

33:52.440 --> 33:58.400
can not only introduce cis transisomerization, but also chirality.

33:58.400 --> 34:04.000
We also saw how a clash of personalities in 1870s Russia led to a race to understanding

34:04.000 --> 34:09.560
alkene chemistry, which in turn helps us to arrive at a better understanding of the molecular

34:09.560 --> 34:12.520
mechanism of vision employed in modern medicine.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.320
We've had quite a journey this lecture.

34:17.320 --> 34:21.680
Next time, we will introduce a new class of atoms to the structural mix when we expand

34:21.680 --> 34:27.200
our inventory of compounds to include the halogens, fluorine, fluorine, bromine and

34:27.200 --> 34:31.800
iodine in a class of compounds called alkyl halides.

34:31.800 --> 34:32.800
I'll see you then.
