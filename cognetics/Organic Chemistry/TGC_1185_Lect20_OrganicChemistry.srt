00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,160
You may recall from our discussion on alkanes that the discovery of petroleum took place

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,760
around 1860, drastically altering the methods used to recover and refine fuel oils.

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
To begin today's discussion, we'll have to move farther back in time, several decades

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,600
before Drake's discovery of petroleum, to a time when fuel oils were still sourced

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,320
from whale and fish oil.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
Now Michael Faraday was an English researcher, and he's most well known for his work in

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,920
the field of electromagnetism.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,680
But in 1820, he developed a keen interest in the chemistry of fuels.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,600
So interested was Michael Faraday, that he all but abandoned his very successful line

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,200
of research in electromagnetism, so that he could begin deconstructing the composition

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,160
of what was then commonly known as illuminating gas, a processed form of fish or whale oil

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,440
commonly used in the lamps of the day.

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,160
A Faraday worked for nearly five years refining his techniques for isolation of certain components

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,440
from that material.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,240
Most notable among them was a liquid, which he found he could produce by pressurizing

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,160
the gas to 30 atmospheres and isolating the condensate which formed.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,000
Even in Faraday's time, it was known that hydrocarbons with suboptimal amounts of hydrogen

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,960
were susceptible to reactions with such reagents as chlorine gas or molecular bromine.

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,640
So Faraday dutifully determined the hydrogen to carbon ratio in his isole, finding that

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,560
it was extremely low.

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,160
Now in his day, scientists thought that carbon had an atomic mass only half that of what

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
it actually is.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
So Faraday erroneously named his new discovery bicarboret of hydrogen.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,240
In fact, carbohydrate of hydrogen or monocarboret of hydrogen would have been more appropriate.

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,960
But considering the circumstances, I think we can forgive this little miscalculation.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,480
And this error notwithstanding, when comparing Faraday's bicarboret of hydrogen formula to

27
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,120
other hydrocarbons of the day, it was very clear that his new compound had a very low

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,320
hydrogen to carbon ratio.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,720
So Faraday had already isolated his new compound bicarboret of hydrogen from his lamp oil.

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
But he wanted to go about doing some more analysis.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,560
He had combusted this material already, measuring how much carbon dioxide and water formed in

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,560
the process, which gave him a rough idea of the formulas.

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,120
He was off by a factor of two because of the putative mass of carbon in that day, but I've

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,440
corrected that in my formulas here for my demonstration.

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,040
So what I have here, as soon as I protect myself properly from it, are some vials containing

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,240
molecular bromine.

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,200
These colorful solutions here are Br2 contained in an inert solvent, methylene chloride.

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,400
I also have samples of some of the hydrocarbons that have been isolated in Faraday's time.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:19,520
And those include C6H14, C6H12, C6H10, C6H8, and C6H6.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Again I've corrected these formulas for the actual mass of carbon.

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,520
Now I'm going to cover my hands with something a little bit to make sure that they're safe

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
as well.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,240
And I'm going to recreate the experiment that Faraday would have done in his day, which

44
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,560
generated such a buzz about his new bicarboret of hydrogen.

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,560
What I'm going to do here first is I'm going to uncap my bromine solutions, and I'm going

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,880
to add them to the various hydrocarbons that I have placed here as well.

47
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,560
And when I do that, if a reaction takes place between the bromine and the hydrocarbon, naturally

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,440
we would expect that the bromine would be something other than bromine, and the color

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,240
will change.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:10,720
So let's start with the first hydrocarbon, C6H14.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,000
So I add my bromine, make sure that we're well agitated, you may notice that no reaction

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
is taking place.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
Now this was well known to Faraday.

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,200
Now he also knew that if he took this other compound here, C6H12, which had a slightly

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,320
lower hydrogen to carbon ratio, and added, again, molecular bromine, that a reaction

56
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,800
took place.

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,000
Clearly, no pun intended, a reaction has happened here.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,520
Move my bromine vial to the back.

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,040
Now he could continue this experiment, going along all the various isolates from all the

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,680
various sources available to him, including C6H10.

61
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,640
We have our reaction gone clear.

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
One more.

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Let's uncap our C6H8, again an unsaturated hydrocarbon, and a reaction takes place.

64
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,200
Now Faraday knew all of this was happening.

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,360
All these experiments had been done previously.

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
So when he isolated a new compound and determined that its formula had even less hydrogen, he

67
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,120
clearly predicted, and everyone thought he'd be right, that this new bicarburet of hydrogen

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,840
would also react with molecular bromine.

69
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,840
So just as any good scientist would, he validated that by adding molecular bromine.

70
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Give it a swirl to be sure that we're well mixed.

71
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,720
We have a problem, don't we?

72
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
The trend is bucked here.

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,800
The C6H6 doesn't react the same way as all of the other hydrocarbons with suboptimal hydrogen

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,120
to carbon ratios.

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,200
So Faraday found this fascinating, and he needed to figure out what was going on.

76
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,640
Alas, Faraday never completed his characterization of this new compound.

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,680
And sadly for us chemists, Faraday's first love of electromagnetism took hold again and

78
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,880
distracted him from his curious hydrocarbon.

79
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,800
So Faraday had to settle for inventing electromagnetic induction, which essentially heralded the arrival

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,640
of the age of widely useful electricity.

81
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,040
Not a bad consolation prize, I suppose.

82
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,960
Instead the world would have to wait until the 1860s, when August Kekule, a German-born

83
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,000
scientist working in Belgium, took up the mantle of explaining the low hydrogen content

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,040
and unusual stability of this compound, which had since been renamed benzene.

85
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,560
Now this guy's a real looker, isn't he?

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
This is how I know I would never make it as an Eastern European chemist in the 1800s.

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,700
I can't pull off a beard that good.

88
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,640
So it's known for quite some time that a compound of unusual stability and a very low hydrogen

89
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,440
to carbon ratio could be isolated from torch fuel.

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
Although the compound was clearly a hydrocarbon, its unusual chemical stability and reduced

91
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,240
hydrogen content defied explanation.

92
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,760
At least until Kekule had what he claimed in later years was a genuine revelatory dream.

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,060
In an 1890 interview, near the end of his career, Kekule claimed that he had this famous

94
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,600
vision while dozing on the upper deck of a horse-drawn bus in 1850s London.

95
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,400
As he tells it, he dreamt of a snake biting its own tail, and woke to the revelation

96
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,720
that benzene's formula and properties could be explained if the molecule were in fact

97
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
cyclic.

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,520
Now there are many who wonder to this day why Kekule would wait nearly four decades

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,960
to tell such a fantastic tale.

100
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,680
In fact, most doubt the story's validity, but the story is so colorful and inspirational

101
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,200
that it lives on in text to this day.

102
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,680
So whether it came by divine revelation or educated guess, we may never know.

103
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,880
But we do know today Kekule was right.

104
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,240
What Kekule had proposed was this, that we have a molecule which is cyclic containing

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,640
spaced double bonds around that molecule.

106
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,040
And this would explain why it would have different chemistry than all of the other conjugated

107
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,800
alkenes or hydrocarbons as they would call them in his day.

108
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,000
Now if you take a look at this structure, we want you to notice something important.

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,760
Kekule's theory about the cyclization of a hexatriene is not beyond reproach, because

110
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,440
benzene itself would have three double bonds if they were isolated, leading to the potential

111
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,720
for two different isomers.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,000
Once scientists were able to figure out how to attach halogens, there are actually two

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,200
potential arrangements for the addition of a halogen to a benzene ring, or more accurately

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
a substitution.

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,600
We can put two halogens at the top here where the double bond is located, meaning that our

116
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
halogens will be across a double bond.

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,560
But if I wanted to, I could place those halogens on opposite sides of a single bond instead.

118
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,440
So if Kekule's theory was right that this was simply a cyclic hexatriene, then there

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,880
should be two isolatable isomers of say dichlorocyclohexatriene.

120
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,360
And yet there were not.

121
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,840
An interesting conundrum, isn't it?

122
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,240
Now Kekule attempted to explain this observation as a fast interconversion between the two

123
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
putative isomers.

124
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,520
But there was no revelatory dream to save him this time.

125
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,360
He was actually wrong about that.

126
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,960
The story of benzene was completed in 1925 when Sir Robert Robinson published a paper

127
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,160
in the Journal of the Chemical Society postulating that what he called an aromatic sextet of

128
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,720
electrons stabilized the ring by moving unrestricted about the entire circular pi system.

129
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
This would create a ring of identical carbons joined by bonds of one and a half order and

130
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,120
would solve the problem of why there aren't two different isomers.

131
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,720
This theory leads us to more accurately draw benzene molecules using a circle or a dashed

132
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,720
interior hexagon to represent the aromatic sextet of electrons.

133
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,440
But it isn't the early 1900s, it's the 21st century and we have much more sophisticated

134
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,320
techniques than Faraday, Kekule and even Robinson had.

135
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,320
So let's bring those to bear on the issue of benzene stability.

136
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,240
Far from just qualitatively observing the stability of benzene, we can use our familiar

137
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,160
technique of calorimetry to determine its heat of hydrogenation.

138
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,560
This is the amount of heat released when the unsaturated compound is completely saturated

139
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,720
with hydrogen.

140
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,480
If we conduct this experiment using cyclohexene, 13-cyclohexadiene also as controls, we can

141
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,600
determine with relative ease that the double bonds in these systems are nearly equivalent

142
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,760
to one another.

143
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,000
But when we add that magical third pair of pi electrons, the heat of hydrogenation is

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,300
far less than we would have expected, about 150 kilojoules per mole less.

145
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,600
We call this discrepancy the resonance energy for benzene.

146
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,680
To put the size of that resonance energy into perspective, it's just less than half the

147
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,160
bond enthalpy of a covalent carbon-carbon bond.

148
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,720
So about a century passed between Faraday's first isolation and characterization of benzene

149
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,080
and Robinson's final description of the aromaticity that it possesses.

150
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,100
And this opened the floodgates, and it wasn't long after this that the molecular orbital

151
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,320
energetics of benzene and other cyclic molecules with alternating double bonds, which we collectively

152
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,960
call anulines, were worked out by a German chemist named Erich Huckel.

153
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,320
You see, just as we produced mathematical combinations of piatomic orbitals to model

154
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,600
pi systems in linear conjugated compounds last time, we can use the same technique for

155
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,080
cyclic alkenes with overlapping pi bonds.

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,040
Let's start by sticking with the familiar aromatic compound benzene.

157
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,080
Benzene consists of six sp2 carbon atoms joined in a ring.

158
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,480
Now this ring is perfectly flat in the case of benzene, which allows all of its piatomic

159
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,560
orbitals to combine to form one large pi system with density both above and below the ring.

160
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,320
But remember our rules for the formation of molecular orbitals.

161
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,040
Six atomic orbitals in means six molecular orbitals out.

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,640
These orbitals all correspond to the linear addition of piatomic orbitals with varying

163
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,720
combinations of phase.

164
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,960
For example, when all six p orbitals are in phase, the lowest possible energy molecular

165
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,800
orbital is obtained.

166
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,320
We call this the pi1.

167
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,680
But it's also possible to form five other permutations of molecular orbitals.

168
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,400
Two possibilities exist with a single nodal plane.

169
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,440
Let's call them the pi2 and the pi3.

170
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,000
Two possibilities with two node planes also exist.

171
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,960
So let's call those the pi4 and pi5.

172
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,680
Finally, there's one possibility in which all six p orbitals are aligned anti-parallel,

173
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,280
creating three nodal planes and a sixth possible molecular orbital, pi6.

174
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,400
So let's take a look now at aromaticity and our famous popular benzene molecule as well

175
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,840
as a different cyclic compound with alternating pi bonds.

176
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,880
And what we're going to do now is analyze the energetics of those pi molecular orbitals

177
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,000
that we just looked at, not only for benzene, but also for a different cyclic compound with

178
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,160
multiple pi bonds.

179
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,640
Let's use 1,3 cyclobutadiene and benzene as our subjects.

180
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:49,000
So here I've drawn 1,3 cyclobutadiene with two isolated pi bonds.

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,520
And yet I've drawn benzene with three delocalized pi bonds, denoted by the dashes moving all

182
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,680
the way around the ring.

183
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,600
And that's not an accident.

184
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,400
So if we think about the energetics of those six molecular orbitals from benzene to start,

185
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,240
there's a little mnemonic trick we can use to determine the relative energies of those

186
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,400
orbitals.

187
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,480
What we do is we draw a circle on an energy axis.

188
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,800
And we inscribe within that circle, point down a polygon with a number of sides equal

189
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
to that of the cyclic compound we'd like to analyze.

190
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,280
For example, benzene having six atoms in the ring is going to have six corners in its polygon

191
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,040
with one corner pointed straight down.

192
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,160
When I do this, the corners of the polygon where they touch the circle indicate the relative

193
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,280
energies of the six pi molecular orbitals of this particular compound.

194
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,480
So if I draw my non-bonding energy line through the center and populate it, what I discover

195
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,840
is that the bonding region gets all of the electrons from the pi system, all six of them.

196
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,200
So clearly, benzene's perspective on this molecular orbital system is that it would

197
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
like to have it.

198
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,720
If I populate this, this is great because all of my electrons get to go down in energy.

199
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,440
But what if we do a similar analysis for 1,3 cyclobutadiene, which is another angeline

200
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,960
which looks for all intents and purposes like it should be aromatic?

201
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,680
Well, if we do the exact same exercise, inscribing our polygon and forming our molecular orbital

202
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,120
energies, we find something quite different.

203
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,280
We find that when we populate it with the four pi electrons from cyclobutadiene, that

204
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,320
two of them go into non-bonding molecular orbitals.

205
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,920
In other words, there's little or in this case really no energetic benefit to this particular

206
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,640
molecule being planar and forming these new molecular orbitals.

207
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,200
But the trend actually continues.

208
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,680
It's a predictable trend in the stability of annulings.

209
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,640
So we've already seen 1,3 cyclobutadiene and benzene treated in this way.

210
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,000
So let's go on through those, create their polygons and populate them.

211
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,800
Cyclobutadiene, rather, we know is anti-aromatic.

212
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,920
If we do the same exercise for benzene as we did previously, we see that benzene is aromatic

213
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,400
because of the extra stability.

214
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,840
Cyclo-octotetraene, on the other hand, will actually populate non-bonding orbitals if

215
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:25,080
it's planar, whereas cyclo-decapentaene will not, making it aromatic.

216
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,200
So you're probably beginning to notice a trend here.

217
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,920
Well, you're not the first.

218
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Huckel was the first.

219
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,680
That's why he was the one who got to name it, sorry.

220
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,160
But what it turns out is happening here is that every time we add two pi electrons, we

221
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,640
switch from anti-aromatic to aromatic, anti-aromatic to aromatic.

222
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,360
And therefore, we can model this as a simple mathematical equation.

223
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,200
Four n pi electrons leads to an anti-aromatic system, while four n plus two electrons leads

224
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,520
to an aromatic system.

225
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,720
This is the origin of Huckel's rule.

226
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,440
But the utility of Huckel's rule extends well beyond just hydrocarbons like benzene.

227
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,080
It can be used to explain the behavior of other cyclic systems with aligned p-orbitals

228
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
as well.

229
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,360
For example, the tropillium ion, which is a carbocation consisting of a seven-membered

230
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,240
ring with six pi electrons and a positive charge.

231
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,320
Polygon analysis of this species shows us that it's also aromatic.

232
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,960
In fact, the effect of resonance on the stability of tropillium is so powerful that it's one

233
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,600
of the few carbocation which can be purchased as a stable salt and stored on a shelf in

234
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
the laboratory.

235
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,920
That's right, those pesky intermediates from first-order reactions have become a starting

236
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,200
material owing to the stabilization provided by this very special type of resonance.

237
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,760
So cyclopentadienyl anion also contains six pi electrons, and this time a system of five

238
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,600
molecular orbitals.

239
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,840
And you can clearly see that in both instances all six pi electrons find homes in bonding

240
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,800
orbitals lending extra stability to the ions.

241
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,000
But we don't need to stop at hydrocarbons in their ions.

242
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,800
Huckel's rule can be extended even farther to systems containing heteroatoms as well.

243
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,760
Take the example of perol C4H5N.

244
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,240
Now when I draw this molecule in class I usually have more than a few hands go up, and that's

245
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,040
because as I've drawn it the lone pair of nitrogen seemed to be in an sp3 orbital, isolated

246
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,400
on the nitrogen atom.

247
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,760
And you could argue this molecule can't be aromatic as drawn because the pi system is

248
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,240
encyclic, and you'd be right.

249
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,040
To properly depict the perol I have to move that lone pair into a p-atomic orbital, allowing

250
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,880
it to join that pi system of the ring.

251
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,000
And in doing so I produce an aromatic system in which the amine nitrogen and hydrogen are

252
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
both coplanar with the rest of the molecule.

253
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:56,200
The energetic benefit of aromaticity exceeds that of orbital hybridization in this situation.

254
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,880
The effects of aromaticity on the basicity of perol are also dramatic.

255
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,400
Note that accepting a proton for perol means sacrificing that stabilizing aromaticity.

256
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,240
While the same process for its close chemical cousin, pyridine, does not.

257
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,600
So it should come as no surprise that perol is literally millions of times less basic

258
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,160
than pyridine.

259
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,560
This is all a powerful testament to the influence of aromaticity, and also a very obvious application

260
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,720
of Huckel's rule in action.

261
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,280
There are many other examples of aromatics which contain heteroatoms, like the mauving

262
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,240
that we encountered in our nitrogen lecture.

263
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,240
But for today we're going to turn our attention back to hydrocarbons to keep our discussion

264
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
focused.

265
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,120
Just as with all other molecules, if we want to have meaningful discussions about benzene

266
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,360
and its derivatives, then we need to agree on a nomenclature standard.

267
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,920
The revelation that all carbons of benzene are equivalent simplifies the process of naming

268
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,400
them when they're substituted.

269
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,200
Since all six carbons are identical and the pi-bonding electron density is the same, using

270
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:09,080
the name 135 cyclohexatriene per the IUPAC standard is a bit misleading, so we usually

271
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,200
default to describing this ring motif as benzene.

272
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,160
Now just as any other hydrocarbon scaffold can be modified by replacing its hydrogen

273
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,640
atoms with more complex substituents in functional groups, so can benzene.

274
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,760
We'll take a look at some techniques used to accomplish these modifications next time,

275
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,920
but for now let's focus on the nomenclature of the modified compounds.

276
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,360
When a single substituent is attached to a benzene ring, we simply start the name with

277
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,480
that substituent's prefix.

278
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:47,640
For example, chlorobenzene, hydroxybenzene, or methylbenzene.

279
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Since all six carbons of benzene are equivalent, the position of that first modification is

280
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,200
of no consequence.

281
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,920
We get chlorobenzene no matter which carbon I attach my chlorine to.

282
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,080
Attaching a single functional group to the ring prompts us to place a modifier at the

283
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,240
end of the name.

284
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,600
For example, benzaldehyde, or benzoic acid.

285
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,080
Now, if this distinction between substituents and functional groups isn't confusing enough,

286
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,080
sometimes the groups and the parent get turned on their head, and we describe the benzene

287
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,200
ring as a substituent, so we would use the identifier phenyl or aryl in situations like

288
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,880
this.

289
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:33,960
For example, chlorobenzene is also often called arylchloride, and hydroxybenzene, sometimes

290
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,720
called phenol.

291
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,480
But what really spices up the nomenclature of benzene rings is when we have two or more

292
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,440
attached substituents and functional groups.

293
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,640
Since the attachment of a single substituent renders the remaining unmodified carbons different

294
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
from one another.

295
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,040
Let's take a look at methylbenzene.

296
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,060
There are now three chemically distinct locations on the ring.

297
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:04,640
One of them is just a bond away, another two bonds away, and a final position three bonds

298
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,320
away on the opposite side.

299
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,360
So where we place the second group makes a profound difference in the identity and chemistry

300
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,520
of the new compound.

301
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,920
For example, dimethylbenzene, commonly called xylene, can form three different isomers.

302
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:30,460
One two dimethylbenzene, one three dimethylbenzene, and one four dimethylbenzene.

303
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,080
Now often we use a more common method of nomenclature to indicate which regioisomer of the compound

304
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:42,640
we're discussing using prefixes ortho, meta, and para in place of the numbered locations

305
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,160
on the groups.

306
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,960
The prefixes are often shortened to a single italicized letter.

307
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:58,640
So here we would describe these three isomers as o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene.

308
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,120
The nomenclature system is the source of the para in the popular pain reliever, paracetamol,

309
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,560
also known as acetaminophen.

310
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,840
Now notice that the two groups in this compound are attached to the benzene ring in the para

311
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,680
arrangement.

312
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:18,720
It's only when they're at that specific position relative to one another that the drug works.

313
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,840
In fact, during the industrial scale synthesis of acetaminophen, a portion of the phenol

314
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,440
starting material is converted to ortho-nitrophenol, which would lead to the ortho-isomer of acetaminophen

315
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,680
in a completed synthesis.

316
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,500
But this ortho-nitrophenol is removed before continuing because it leads to an inactive

317
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,640
isomer of the compound.

318
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,360
It's worth mentioning that aromatics don't have to exist as isolated rings, though most

319
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,320
if not all of the compounds we'll be investigating will have isolated benzene motifs.

320
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,680
A newer class of compounds has gathered considerable interest more recently.

321
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:06,240
Picture two benzene rings fused along one edge, essentially sharing a carbon-carbon bond.

322
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,360
We call this compound naphthalene.

323
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,400
Notice that by fusing the rings we create an aromatic system in which two rings share

324
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,320
a common pair of p-orbitals.

325
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,800
So it should come as no surprise that naphthalene's resonance energy is about 252 kilojoules

326
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,000
per mole, slightly less than two separate benzene rings, but substantial nonetheless.

327
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,360
Now for planar compounds, this trend continues through tricyclics like anthracine and phenanthrene,

328
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:45,040
all the way up to graphite, which is essentially a never-ending sheet of fully fused benzene

329
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
rings.

330
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,440
Now this allotrope of carbon benefits from such significant resonance stabilization that

331
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,680
at standard temperatures and pressures, it's even more stable than diamond.

332
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,280
In the 1980s, chemists began devising ways to impart curvature to these so-called graphene

333
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,760
sheets by changing which edges each ring shares with others, creating new allotropes of carbon

334
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,840
in the form of spheres, the most famous of which is hands down, the truncated icosahedron

335
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,360
C60 molecule buckminster fillering, affectionately referred to as buckyballs, and named for the

336
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,760
famous architect, inventor and futurist buckminster fuller.

337
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,640
Now one can envision how the buckyball motif could act as an end cap, connecting a graphene

338
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,240
sheet which is rolled up on itself.

339
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,920
This structure is commonly called a carbon nanotube, and these materials show some promise

340
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,600
in some very exciting applications, such as gas storage media and building materials,

341
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,960
to electronics, engineering and medicine.

342
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,280
But much of that potential is yet to be realized.

343
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,600
Even if we never find a good use for them, I think we can all agree they are just beautiful

344
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,680
to look at, aren't they?

345
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,320
Now yet another useful material created from graphene sheets is what's commonly known as

346
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,520
carbon fiber.

347
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,320
Most of us are probably familiar with this material, which was first created in the 1980s

348
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,960
and has since found its way into a host of applications.

349
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,800
Many of these applications exploit carbon fibers' enormous tensile strength, which

350
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,160
rivals that of steel, but in a material four times less dense.

351
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:36,560
Now graphite consists of flat planar sheets of graphene, which can easily slide along

352
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,540
one another's pi electron clouds, making it soft and slippery to the touch.

353
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,440
And this is why we see it used commonly in writing instruments and lubricants.

354
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,840
But carbon fiber, as opposed to graphite, can be thought of as a series of graphene sheets

355
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,120
which are bunched and tangled with one another.

356
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,360
And this bunching and tangling prevents the graphene sheets from sliding along one another,

357
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:08,600
creating a material with great tensile strength rather than soft lubricating properties.

358
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,700
So today we focused on characterizing and naming a class of compounds known as aromatics.

359
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:20,280
We discussed how cyclic pi systems of 4n plus 2 pi electrons have a remarkable stability,

360
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,520
which was recognized very early in the history of organic chemistry.

361
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,960
We covered Huckel's Rule, which predicts that this trend continues on to larger systems

362
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,240
as well.

363
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,480
We examined what's commonly called the polygon rule, an extension of the mnemonic we use

364
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,920
for linear conjugated alkenes, which is used to construct energy diagrams for cyclic pi

365
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,520
systems.

366
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,920
We also used this tool to demonstrate the principles on which Huckel's Rule is founded.

367
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,840
We took a look at how aromaticity can profoundly influence the acid-base properties of organics

368
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,240
by stabilizing conjugate acids and bases.

369
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,280
Particularly we looked at the example of parole in comparison to pyridine.

370
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,160
Next we tried our hand at naming some of these compounds, placing substituents ahead of benzene

371
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,800
and functional groups after benzene in the names, and how we used the prefixes ortho,

372
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,920
meta, and para to describe disubstituted benzene regioisomers.

373
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,440
We then concluded by considering situations in which aromatic rings fuse together to create

374
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,320
a new class called polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and how this naturally extends to buckminster

375
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,320
fullerines, and carbon nanotubes, and carbon fibers, which are the focus of current research

376
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,600
in many labs around the world.

377
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,400
Next time we'll take a look at some of the techniques that organic chemists use to create

378
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,200
these modified benzene rings, and I'll see you then.
