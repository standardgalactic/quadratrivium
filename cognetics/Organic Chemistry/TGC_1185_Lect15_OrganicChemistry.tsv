0	18080	Ben Franklin is purported to have once penned that beer is the best evidence we have that
18080	22640	there is a God that he loves us and wants us to be happy.
22640	27040	The accuracy of this quote is disputed by historians, but its sentiment is one which
27040	31200	most of us probably share during a night of celebration with friends.
31200	35720	So we've already taken a brief look at the structure, properties, and reactivities of
35720	36720	ethanol.
36720	40880	This is one of the key components of that delightful concoction.
40880	44200	Then, the next morning arrives.
44200	49000	And those of us who took the most extreme advantage of old Ben's good-hearted observation
49000	54960	might wake to a headache, sensitivity to light, fatigue, and a general sense that maybe Dr.
54960	57760	Franklin led us a bit astray.
57760	62240	Of course, I'm talking about hangovers, the general sense of awfulness that comes along
62240	69880	with the buildup of metabolites of the very compound we enjoyed so much the night before.
69880	74240	We're now familiar with the structure of ethanol, also known as beverage alcohol.
74240	78200	And we're aware of the presence of an sp3 hybridized oxygen that it bears in the form
78200	80920	of a hydroxyl group.
80920	85880	But enzymes in the liver convert ethanol into a new organic compound, actually several
85880	91040	of them, which are easier to remove from the human body, but some of which have a significantly
91040	94080	less pleasant effect on your mood.
94080	97920	Today we're going to be taking a closer look at at least one of the chemicals which participate
97920	103920	in this rite of passage for beer enthusiasts and wine lovers alike.
103920	107560	Now we will not concern ourselves so much with the biological pathways to these products
107560	111640	which occur in vivo, meaning in living organisms.
111640	115840	But rather we're going to take more of a look at how organic chemists imitate this chemistry
115840	122840	in a beaker, an environment which we commonly refer to as in vitro, meaning in glass.
122840	127520	But before we can discuss the details of their synthesis and reactivity, we must first familiarize
127520	132000	ourselves with their structure.
132000	136920	Last time we investigated the structure, synthesis and reactivity of alcohols and ethers, which
136920	143440	have an sp3 hybridized oxygen, which is single bonded to a carbon and one other atom, either
143440	148920	hydrogen to form an alcohol or carbon to form an ether.
148920	153320	Today we will look at a different class of oxygen containing compounds known as aldehydes
153320	160280	and ketones, those in which we still have only one oxygen atom, but it's sp2 hybridized,
160280	167280	meaning that it's double bonded to just one carbon atom.
167280	173680	So let's have a look at just the sp2 part of this type of motif here.
173680	177140	So right now what's connected to this carbon is really not of consequence.
177140	181720	What's important is to look at the oxygen and carbon and how they've been connected
181720	183880	to one another.
183880	187320	Remember that in our alcohols and ethers, the oxygen had two single bonds, but here
187320	190580	there's a double bond between the oxygen and the carbon.
190580	195560	This means that both the oxygen and carbon must have an sp2 hybridization state, and
195560	198480	even more importantly that there's a pi bond.
198480	204120	So if I rotate this molecule so that we can see the bond and on, you can clearly see the
204120	208680	sigma bond containing electron density in between the two atoms, but also the presence
208680	213400	of a pi bond, which gives electron density above and below that bond.
213400	218280	And that's going to be crucial to not only the physical, but also the chemical properties
218280	220480	of this type of compound.
220480	224800	So let's have a look at some very simple carbonyl containing compounds.
224800	225920	Let's start with formaldehyde.
225920	231200	This is the simplest possible carbonyl containing compound with a carbon oxygen double bond
231200	235640	and bond angles of 120 degrees all the way around this carbon, right?
235640	240960	That's what we would expect for an sp2 hybridized atom.
240960	245760	The next most complex is acetaldehyde, in which we've added a methyl group to the carbon
245760	248640	which is attached to our sp2 oxygen.
248640	252520	This has a formula C2H4O.
252520	256600	We can get even larger by adding a methyl group to the other side and create something
256600	261400	called acetone, compound with which we're all very familiar.
261400	267720	And I can continue extending these alkyl chains if I'd like, creating, for example, methylethylketone,
267720	271440	which is a common solvent used in adhesives.
271440	275400	Now all of these share one structural feature in common.
275400	281960	That is the carbonyl group, an sp2 carbon double bonded to an sp2 oxygen.
281960	286040	I've highlighted those here so you can see them well.
286040	290440	Some of them have hydrogens attached to those sp2 carbons.
290440	295360	When they have these, we call those hydrogens aldehyde hydrogens.
295400	299400	But there are others which don't contain this particular type of hydrogen.
299400	304280	They contain carbons that are bonded directly to the sp2 carbon only.
304280	307440	This location is called an alpha carbon.
307440	310640	So you can already see where we're going to draw a distinction here.
310640	316880	Those carbonyls with which have aldehyde hydrogens tend to get the name aldehyde.
316880	321280	And those which have only alpha carbons attached to the carbonyl carbon tend to get names
321280	323080	that end in OWN.
323120	324760	These are ketones.
327760	332440	From an IUPAC nomenclature perspective, we treat both aldehydes and ketones as functional
332440	336720	groups because as we'll see soon, they're very reactive.
336720	341320	So in this example, I have to choose a parent chain which contains the carbon which is double
341320	345760	bonded to the oxygen making up the carbonyl group.
345760	348320	So this is a butanal molecule.
348320	353120	The AL suffix lets me know that I'm dealing with an aldehyde.
353120	360000	In other words, a carbonyl which has at least one hydrogen attached to its carbon.
360000	362760	My butanal has a methyl substituent.
362760	366840	So now all I have to do is label my chain in such a way that the functional group,
366840	371080	which is highest priority, gets the lowest possible number.
371080	374160	So clearly, my best choice is to label it in this way.
374800	382000	If I label the other way, my butanal functional group ends up with a number 4 instead of 1.
382000	384760	So I'm going to choose the top numbering scheme.
384760	391760	And this would make the name of my compound 3-methyl 1 butanal, except that we often don't
391760	393280	see the 1.
393280	398000	And the reason for that, of course, is that aldehydes by definition have to end the carbon
398000	402160	chain because one of their bonded partners must be a hydrogen.
402160	406160	So to say 1 butanal is a little bit redundant.
406160	412320	Now in the case of ketones, I'm going to follow the same protocol.
412320	414440	Let's name this ketone.
414440	419760	I'll choose my parent hydrocarbon, the longest possible one which contains the carbon which
419760	422840	is part of my group.
422840	430200	So there's my functional group at the second carbon in making this a pentanone.
430200	432440	So I'll look at my prefixes.
432440	438440	I'll have a chloro because I've got a chlorine which is also attached to the parent hydrocarbon.
438440	442800	Now I give my addresses to these in such a way that the ketone functional group gets
442800	449600	the lowest possible number, meaning that when I construct my name, I'll have a 4-chloro
449600	455080	to pentanone.
455080	458960	So now that we know a little bit about naming and identifying these ketones and aldehydes,
458960	462960	let's take a look at their physical properties and what the introduction of this carbonyl
462960	466400	bond really does for them.
466400	471800	We'll start with an aldehyde, a very simple one like this propanal molecule.
471800	476960	The propanal molecule has a carbon-oxygen double bond which creates a dipole, the positive
476960	481600	end of the dipole at the carbonyl carbon, the negative end of the dipole at the carbonyl
481600	484800	oxygen.
484800	489720	This means that it's going to have an electronegative oxygen with freelone pairs which can act as
489720	494480	a hydrogen bond acceptor, in other words it can hydrogen bond with other compounds which
494480	500520	have OH, NH, and FH motifs in their functional group.
500520	504640	But the propanal itself doesn't have such a bond, which means that it can't hydrogen
504640	507120	bond to other propanal molecules.
507120	512540	So this is not an H bond donor, only an H bond acceptor.
512540	517940	When we turn our attention to ketones, we see, for example, in propanone, the exact
517940	519660	same issue.
519660	523940	We have a carbon-oxygen double bond with the positive dipole at the carbon, the negative
523940	529260	dipole at the oxygen, and again we have lone pairs which can participate in H bonding with
529260	534260	other types of molecules, but they can't hydrogen bond to themselves because they don't have
534260	539300	the requisite OH, NH, or FH bond.
539300	543420	So when we look at the boiling points of these compounds, we see something very different
543420	549220	than we saw with the alcohols and ethers because neither of them can hydrogen bond well.
549220	552740	Their boiling points are actually quite similar to one another.
552740	557140	Recall that in the case of ethanol and dimethyl ether, that the boiling points differed by
557140	559500	about 100 degrees centigrade.
559500	564580	So in this case, we can see a very clear manifestation of the fact that neither of these two can
564580	566580	hydrogen bond to themselves.
570220	575780	In addition to being polar, these compounds are also amphoteric.
575780	581380	We can see this by looking at a molecule of, this is acid aldehyde, if we take a look at
581380	587820	its conjugate acid, we can protonate that oxygen from the carbonyl and create a resonance
587820	590620	stabilized conjugate acid.
590620	596100	Now it's not terribly stable, as you can see, the pKa is negative 7, so it's very acidic,
596100	601260	but it can form, and it does have the effect of increasing the positive charge density
601260	602780	around the carbonyl carbon.
602780	606300	This will be very important when we get to reactivity.
606300	612900	Similarly, carbonyl compounds can act as acids, but they don't lose the protein that you might
612900	615180	think they do.
615180	620380	Even in the case of aldehydes, the hydrogen attached to the sp2 carbon is not the most
620380	621380	acidic carbon.
621980	627620	In fact, the one that's removed most frequently is the adjacent alpha carbon, and the explanation
627620	631980	for this is that it forms not only what we call a carbanion, which puts some negative
631980	637780	charge density down here at the site of its removal, but it also creates a new resonance
637780	644500	contributor called an enolate, where that negative charge is up on what was the carbonyl oxygen,
644500	649860	and this provides a lot of stabilization to the conjugate base and results in a pKa of
649860	652980	about 20 for compounds like these.
652980	658860	Okay, so carbonyl compounds are named differently, they have different hydrogen bonding behavior,
658860	663820	and they're amphoteric with slightly different pKa values than alcohols.
663820	668140	But what really distinguishes the carbonyl motif from alcohols and ethers, and gives
668140	671860	them such different reactivity, is the presence of that pi bond.
671860	676220	So I'm going to take this motif and show it to you one more time on its side, and we're
676220	680300	going to see exactly why and how these bonds react the way they do.
680300	685380	Let's try formaldehyde, the simplest possible carbonyl-containing compound.
685380	690060	We're all familiar with formaldehyde, and especially its primary application, which
690060	695500	is a biological preservative, or we call it a fixative.
695500	700580	But this is not the form of the molecule that actually performs that fixation.
700580	705500	Formaldehyde, as I've drawn it here, does not react with proteins, it does not fix them
705500	709500	in place, and it does not preserve animal tissue in that way.
709500	711180	So what's going on here?
711180	713620	Let's turn it on its side.
713620	717620	So again, here are the regions of space where I expect the electrons involved in my pi
717620	720100	bond to be.
720100	722460	But there's another region of space that I'm concerned with.
722460	727300	It's the area that new incoming electrons have to reach in order to create a new bond
727300	732620	to the carbonyl carbon, and break the pi bond to the carbonyl oxygen.
732620	737340	That region of space looks like this, and it's called an antibonding orbital.
737340	742060	So in order to populate that antibonding orbital, an incoming nucleophile doesn't come from
742060	747580	the backside directly, as we would expect in a traditional nucleophilic substitution.
747580	752660	Instead, it comes in from above and below and slightly behind.
752660	757780	So let's try to represent the reaction of formaldehyde with water, and a little bit
757780	762740	of hydroxide, which is naturally present in the water, and see if we can make its actual
762740	765780	functional form that serves as a biological fixative.
765780	770260	Again, here's my molecule of formaldehyde, but now I'm going to put it in water, which
770260	774140	naturally contains a small amount of hydroxide.
774140	780420	Now that hydroxide can act as a nucleophile, and it's going to attack my carbonyl carbon
780420	781420	like so.
781420	785860	Now I've highlighted my two different oxygens so we can keep track of them, but they're
785860	790540	actually still just ordinary run-of-the-mill oxygen atoms.
790540	795180	So as that attack takes place, not only do I form a new sigma bond, but I also break
795180	798740	the original pi bond from the carbonyl.
798740	802380	So I've created this negatively charged species in the presence of water.
802380	804380	This looks awfully basic, doesn't it?
804380	807700	And water, as we all know, is a weak acid.
807700	814980	So the water will very quickly transfer a proton and give me a new kind of molecule.
814980	817300	This is called methylene glycol.
817300	822460	It's methylene glycol that reacts with the tissues and animal samples to preserve them.
822460	824140	Interesting, isn't it?
824140	828620	We say formaldehyde is a great preservative, but in truth, the equilibrium constant for
828620	835340	this interconversion is about 40, meaning that in any given aqueous solution of formaldehyde,
835340	841140	somewhere around 98% of it is in this state as methylene glycol.
841140	846820	So a solution of formaldehyde in water really isn't a solution of formaldehyde at all.
846820	849980	It's actually a solution primarily of methylene glycol.
849980	853740	This is a good thing because it's the solution of methylene glycol, called formalin, which
853740	857380	has the desired preservative properties.
857380	861420	In the crucial reaction, it's the hydroxyls of methylene glycol, which are removed to
861420	866500	produce two molecules of water and a new link to nitrogen atoms found in proteins that make
866500	869260	up the tissues of biological samples.
869260	875420	Two hydroxyls means two links, and this crosslinking of proteins, which blocks them in place, preserving
875420	880140	the tissue in all the fats, carbohydrates, and other biologic molecules entombed inside
880140	883220	the matrix of the protein.
883220	887940	No hydroxyl groups, no crosslinks, but it all starts with the addition of formaldehyde
887940	890020	to a preservative solution.
890020	894700	In light of this, it's clear why formaldehyde is the go-to carbonyl compound for this purpose.
895260	899580	First it's the smallest possible molecule with a desired chemistry, helping it find
899580	906220	its way into those interstitial spaces within and between proteins in a biological sample.
906220	910140	But before we head any further into reactions involving ketones and aldehydes, let's first
910140	914900	take a look at a few ways to make them.
914900	918420	Aldehydes and ketones can be produced by a number of synthetic routes, some of which
918420	923220	we're ready to investigate, and others of which are going to require a little more foundation.
923220	926900	Now for today, let's concentrate on emulating the chemistry that goes on in your body as
926900	930740	you sleep off that night of fun.
930740	934660	In your body, ethanol is recognized by your liver as a toxin.
934660	938900	Whether or not your brain agrees, as soon as the ethanol hits your bloodstream, enzymes
938900	942980	in your liver go to work preparing to eliminate it from your system.
942980	948180	Now in order to attenuate the neurotoxic effects of the ethanol and prepare it for removal,
948180	953100	an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase converts the offending intoxicant into a more
953100	958580	oxidized state, that of acid aldehyde.
958580	963100	The process of enzymatic oxidation is complex and involves the assistance of large, complicated
963100	968380	biomolecules, but it essentially consists of the removal of the hydroxyl proton and one
968380	973540	of its neighbors, thereby producing a double bond between the carbon and oxygen.
973540	977980	Essentially this is an oxidative elimination reaction.
977980	981660	We call it oxidation because the central carbon is gaining additional attachment to
981660	988580	oxygen atoms, in this case trading a single bond to oxygen for a double bond.
988580	993460	The product aldehyde is eventually metabolized further as the process continues, but in the
993460	998340	meantime it interferes with mitochondrial activity, liver function, and a host of other
998340	1003500	biological mechanisms contributing to the condition which we colloquially refer to as
1003500	1006780	a hangover.
1006780	1011100	In the laboratory, ketones and aldehydes can be produced using various oxidizing agents
1011100	1016900	which accomplish the very same task that the alcohol dehydrogenase does in your body.
1016900	1022060	A classic example of this technique is the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone
1022060	1025260	using chromic acid.
1025260	1029740	In this multi-step reaction, the secondary alcohol is substituted for one of the OH groups
1029740	1034420	on the chromic acid, creating a compound known as a chromate ester.
1035420	1039540	This mechanism depends on the presence of an alpha hydrogen on the starting material.
1039540	1044860	A secondary alcohol has only one of these, so this oxidation can only take place once,
1044860	1050900	ending at the ketone stage in which the carbonyl carbon has no more hydrogens to give up.
1050900	1055780	In the case of primary alcohols, however, two oxidations can occur, leading not to the
1055780	1062060	desired aldehyde, but rather to a more oxidized compound called carboxylic acid.
1062060	1068340	So how do we stop the oxidation at that desired point if that's what we want to do?
1068340	1072820	Well the key to stopping the oxidation selectively at the aldehyde stage is in remembering that
1072820	1077940	aldehydes and aqueous solution tend to form reactive hydrates, those geminal dials like
1077940	1081260	we saw in the case of formaldehyde.
1081260	1085260	So to achieve our goal, we have to substitute a different oxidizing agent which is soluble
1085260	1089980	in an organic solvent so we remove water from the process.
1089980	1094280	Pyridinium chlorochromate is one reagent which proves very useful in the oxidation of primary
1094280	1099420	alcohols to aldehydes in particular because of its solubility in solvents like methylene
1099420	1103420	chloride which are anhydrous.
1103420	1110940	So this reaction with PCC, Pyridinium chlorochromate, is actually the organic chemistry equivalent
1110940	1114300	of the biological effects of this.
1114300	1119300	This is the drug dysulfiram, more commonly known by its trade name, Antibus.
1119300	1124980	Now, Antibus is often prescribed to discourage alcohol abuse in alcoholic patients and it
1124980	1131500	does so by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, that enzyme which continues the process of
1131500	1136700	oxidatively breaking down the alcohol metabolite acid aldehyde into more manageable and far
1136700	1139140	less toxic acetic acid.
1139140	1145820	So this would be our small molecule version of shutting down that system.
1145820	1151220	Now, Antibus binds to and shuts down enzymes in the liver which further oxidize acid aldehyde
1151220	1154420	and move it along that natural process of removal.
1154420	1160140	So stopping the oxidation process for ethanol at the aldehyde step like this causes an unusually
1160140	1165380	high level of acid aldehyde to build up in a patient's bloodstream which in turn causes
1165380	1169300	what could best be described as a super hangover.
1169300	1173780	PCC simply accomplishes the same effect on the lab bench.
1173780	1178900	The difference is that it does so by preventing aldehyde hydrate formation instead of enzyme
1178900	1179900	inhibition.
1179900	1184580	It can be done not only for ethanol, but for practically any primary alcohol starting
1184580	1188700	material that we can imagine.
1188700	1193380	That's important for a chemist to always be cognizant of reversibility in chemical reactions,
1193380	1198980	which is to say that today's starting materials may be tomorrow's products and vice versa.
1198980	1203060	Today it might be our goal to produce an aldehyde from a primary alcohol or a ketone from a
1203060	1206020	secondary alcohol by oxidation.
1206020	1210740	But if I can do that, then there's almost certainly a way to somehow produce the alcohols
1210740	1214460	from the associated carbonyl compounds.
1214460	1219180	So let's begin our discussion on the reactivity of these compounds in that spirit.
1219180	1224060	Since we oxidized alcohol to form acid aldehyde previously today, we should be able to find
1224060	1227300	a way to reduce the acid aldehyde back.
1227300	1232500	That's right, catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyls leads to an addition product which
1232500	1237380	hydrogen gas is added across the carbonyl double bond.
1237380	1241900	So the mechanism is completely analogous to hydrogenation of alkenes.
1241900	1246220	And this method is often chosen in industrial settings where gas handling equipment is available
1246220	1250740	and inexpensive hydrogen gas offsets the cost of the equipment.
1250740	1255180	But in the laboratory, where we usually want to perform reactions on smaller scale, we
1255180	1259820	often turn to the use of hydride reagents.
1259820	1264340	Both sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride can accomplish this modification when
1264340	1268740	added to a ketone or aldehyde in protic solvent.
1268740	1274380	You see, the boron or aluminum in these reagents are both extremely electropositive and they
1274380	1279020	make bonded hydrogens act more like hydride ions.
1279020	1284560	These hydride ions are very nucleophilic and will attack the carbonyl very efficiently.
1284560	1289580	The resulting alkoxide simply removes a proton from the solvent to become the neutral alcohol
1289580	1292980	product.
1292980	1298680	Just as with alcohols, aldehydes and ketones are amphiprotic or amphoteric.
1298680	1303180	So we have to consider the possibility that ketones and aldehydes might act as nucleophiles
1303180	1306500	or electrophiles depending on their pH environment.
1306500	1311460	Again, just like alcohols, compounds containing carbonyl groups are prone to reactions under
1311460	1315580	conditions of extreme pH, either high or low.
1315580	1320980	When placed in a basic environment, deprotonation of an alpha carbon can form a resonance stabilized
1320980	1323220	enolate nucleophile.
1323220	1327720	The removal of the alpha proton produces a carbanion, but one which can easily be drawn
1327720	1332300	with its charge delocalized onto the oxygen atom of the neighboring carbonyl.
1332300	1337580	So in this state, the conjugate base of an aldehyde or ketone can act as a good nucleophile,
1337580	1341420	attacking electrophiles and forming new carbon-carbon bonds.
1342260	1346740	Now, neutral ketones and aldehydes can be considered to be weakly nucleophilic based
1346740	1351100	on the formation of an enaltautomer, which forms when a proton from its alpha carbon
1351100	1354900	is relocated to the carbonyl oxygen.
1354900	1361220	But neutral ketones can also act as weak electrophiles, owing to the dipole between the carbonyl-carbon
1361220	1362900	and oxygen atoms.
1362900	1368060	Now, what's particularly interesting about carbonyls is the role and the ability of these
1368060	1372940	compounds to undergo nucleophilic attack without the loss of a leaving group.
1372940	1377100	Instead, those antibonding orbitals of the carbonyl, which reach out above and below
1377100	1382180	the plane of the group itself, can be attacked, breaking only the pi bond and preserving the
1382180	1385700	connection between carbon and oxygen.
1385700	1390860	Now that process is even more favorable in acidic conditions, when the carbonyl compound
1390860	1393920	is protonated at its oxygen.
1393920	1398100	Reaction at that site increases the electrophilic character of the carbonyl-carbon by creating
1398100	1402560	a resonance contributor with a positive formal charge at that atom.
1402560	1409680	So, basifying and acidifying are both viable strategies for activating ketones and aldehydes,
1409680	1411840	inducing them to react.
1411840	1417400	And no reaction is a better example of this property than the aldol condensation, a reaction
1417400	1423440	between two carbonyl compounds which can be conducted under either basic or acidic conditions
1423440	1426140	with similar efficiency.
1426140	1430480	The first report of an aldol condensation was given by French chemist Charles Adolf
1430480	1433800	Wertz in 1872.
1433800	1439000	Now Wertz discovered that addition of a strong mineral acid to ethanol led to a strange new
1439000	1446240	product which shared properties with both ketones and alcohols.
1446240	1450640	The reaction of one ethanol with another takes place when a portion of the sample becomes
1450640	1453440	protonated at the carbonyl oxygen.
1453440	1459560	So a mixture of both neutral aldehyde and protonated aldehyde needs to be present.
1459560	1463640	Now the protonated aldehyde has a resonance contributor with positive charge density at
1463640	1468960	the carbonyl-carbon and the neutral aldehyde can tautomerize to form a species known as
1468960	1475440	an enol, for alkene and alcohol motifs which combine to make it up.
1475440	1480040	So in this system that I've just set up, we have an electrophilic protonated aldehyde
1480040	1485080	and a nucleophilic enol-tautomer, all the ingredients necessary for an addition reaction
1485080	1487240	to take place.
1487240	1492760	As the enol attacks the protonated carbonyl, a new alcohol group forms.
1492760	1496760	The enol then quickly deprotonates to reform a carbonyl group.
1496760	1506920	Our aldol condensation is complete and a beta-hydroxy ketone has formed.
1506920	1511560	So words first accomplish this reaction by increasing the electrophilicity of a portion
1511560	1514360	of aldehyde using acid.
1514360	1518760	It wasn't long however before it was realized that the same result could be accomplished
1518760	1523840	by instead increasing the nucleophilicity of a portion of aldehyde by addition of a suitable
1523840	1524920	base.
1524920	1530880	So the addition of a base like hydroxide or methoxide can cause a portion of ethanol to
1530880	1535640	become deprotonated at its alpha-carbon which can participate in resonance and form that
1535640	1538960	resonance stabilized enolate.
1538960	1545740	So the enolate nucleophile attacks a neutral but electrophilic carbonyl carbon, breaking
1545740	1552120	its pi bond and promoting a series of steps which lead to the same exact product as in
1552120	1557120	words' acidic reaction.
1557120	1561780	Reactions like the aldol reaction are a shining example of how carbonyl chemistry is a very
1561780	1567960	versatile tool in organic synthesis, often leading us to consider making the same products
1567960	1570820	under either acidic or basic conditions.
1570820	1575340	It gives us a choice of reaction conditions which is a very nice thing to have in a complex
1575340	1579060	synthesis.
1579060	1582660	But carbonyl-containing compounds don't just react with themselves.
1582660	1589100	They make great nucleophiles and electrophiles to react with a large library of other compounds.
1589100	1593540	Another commonly used reaction employing ketones and aldehydes as electrophiles is the
1593540	1595940	reactions with alcohols.
1595940	1601140	When we do this, we get compounds reminiscent of hydrates like methylene glycol, but one
1601140	1606420	or both of the OH hydrogens has been replaced with an alkyl group.
1606420	1612100	In the case of an aldehyde like formaldehyde, replacement of 1OH leads to what we call a
1612100	1618220	hemiacetal, while the replacement of both gives us an acetal.
1618220	1621940	When the carbon bearing the two groups is instead derived from a ketone, meaning it
1621940	1628460	has two R groups attached to the carbonyl carbon, we call the resulting compounds hemiacetals
1628460	1630460	and ketals.
1630460	1637060	So let's take a look at how these two motifs can be created using formaldehyde as an example.
1637060	1641700	Now the formation of hemiacetals and hemiacetals from aldehydes and ketones are accomplished
1641700	1645220	in exactly the same way that their hydrates are made.
1645220	1651220	We simply substitute an alkoxide in place of the hydroxide nucleophile.
1651220	1655940	After one nucleophilic attack has taken place, there's no good leaving group to depart and
1655940	1658220	make room for a second attack.
1658220	1665600	Therefore the reaction stops at the hemiacetal or hemi-ketal stage.
1665600	1671820	We can instead create acetals and ketals by mixing aldehydes and ketones with an alcohol
1671820	1674260	under acidic conditions.
1674260	1679860	Under these conditions the carbonyl group can be protonated, making it a good electrophile.
1679860	1685180	It's then attacked by the weakly nucleophilic alcohol through an SN1 reaction.
1685180	1689980	This forms a protonated ether which we know will quickly lose its proton to solvent because
1689980	1694100	of its very low pKa.
1694100	1699740	But under acidic conditions a second attack is possible because the hemiacetal or hemi-ketal
1699740	1705260	formed can be protonated to create an oxonium ion in which a water leaving group can be
1705260	1710300	displaced by yet another alcohol nucleophile.
1710300	1714700	This leads to the acetal or ketal depending on whether the starting material was an aldehyde
1714700	1719180	or a ketone respectively.
1719180	1724020	Both acetals and ketals are very stable to strong bases in nucleophiles, but they can
1724020	1730100	be easily converted back into their ketone or aldehyde counterparts using acidic hydrolysis,
1730100	1734020	essentially just reversing the reaction by adding water.
1734020	1738020	Now these characteristics make acetals and ketals very useful as protecting groups in
1738020	1743820	synthesis, masking reactive carbonyl sites which can later be unmasked after doing other
1743820	1748660	chemical modifications to other regions of the molecule.
1748660	1754100	So today we explored the properties and the reactivity of some simple carbonyl compounds.
1754100	1758540	We discussed how the carbon-oxygen double bond necessitates an sp2 hybridization state
1758540	1764020	for both atoms, leading to a trigonal planar geometry about the carbonyl carbon, leaving
1764020	1766820	two available substrates.
1766820	1771020	When one or both of those substrates is a hydrogen, we have an aldehyde.
1771020	1775740	When neither are a hydrogen, we have a ketone.
1775740	1779580	We reviewed nomenclature of these compounds, how the carbonyl is treated as a functional
1779580	1787500	group and the suffixes al and own are used to designate aldehydes and ketones respectively.
1787500	1792100	We explored how these compounds can be produced by oxidation of alcohols, using either aqueous
1792100	1798380	chromic acid in the case of secondary alcohols to ketones or peridinium chlorochromate in
1798380	1804540	an organic solvent in the case of primary alcohols to aldehydes.
1804540	1808260	We then turned the tables and considered the reduction of aldehydes and ketones, using
1808260	1813820	a familiar reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, which essentially reverses the oxidation process
1813820	1816740	producing the alcohol.
1816740	1821580	We also met sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride, reagents which act as a
1821580	1827560	source of hydride nucleophiles, turning ketones and aldehydes into alkoxides, which quickly
1827560	1832260	convert to alcohols and protic solvent.
1832260	1836760	We discussed how carbonyl compounds react in substitution reactions, including their
1836760	1842260	nucleophilic enolates which form under basic conditions and their electrophilic characteristics
1842260	1844900	when protonated.
1844900	1849060	We surveyed how these characteristics affect reactivity in the aldol condensation between
1849060	1854500	two carbonyl compounds and how they can take place under basic or acidic conditions leading
1854500	1857900	to essentially the same products.
1858900	1863660	Finally we considered how aldehydes and ketones can be reacted with alcohols under basic conditions
1863660	1871380	to form hemiacetals and hemiketals, or under acidic conditions to prepare acetals and ketals.
1871380	1875260	And of course along the way we compared how some of these reactions are merely a clumsy
1875260	1880180	attempt by chemists to duplicate feats of synthesis which go on in your own body with
1880180	1884900	remarkably greater efficiency, even if they do come with a little headache.
1885900	1889860	And that's all for this lesson, but next time we'll continue our tour of oxygen-containing
1889860	1895060	compounds by considering those which contain multiple oxygen atoms with differing hybridization
1895060	1896060	states.
1896060	1896740	See you then.
