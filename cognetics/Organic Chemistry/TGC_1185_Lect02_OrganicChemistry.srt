1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Chemical bonds form the basis for not only organic chemistry, but indeed for all of chemistry.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,840
And as we saw last time, just how important bonding is in determining the chemical properties

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,040
of elements.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,080
So with the cosmos consisting of fewer than 100 naturally occurring elements, lack of

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,080
a way to bond multiple atoms of those elements together to create more complex materials

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,280
would lead to a pretty dull universe.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,560
Now, fortunately for us, chemical bonding provides a way to take relatively simple

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,080
atom and combine it with other atoms, thereby creating a set of combinations so vast that

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,280
it's virtually infinite.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,960
Bonding is, in fact, much more than just a way to connect atoms together.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,320
Bonding has a way of changing atoms themselves in ways which alter their physical properties

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,560
and reactivity, and it can do so so profoundly that many materials of identical atomic composition

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,000
have drastically different chemical and physical properties.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,880
Let's take the example of carbon, the star of our show.

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,240
Now, carbon atoms are so keen to bond to other atoms that atomic carbon is essentially unheard

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,400
of under the conditions we experience here on Earth.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,520
And even when pure, a sample of carbon will take on one of several different bonding schemes,

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,720
which lead to some very familiar but strikingly different materials from our everyday lives.

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,040
This is graphite.

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,680
It's the principal component of bituminous coal, valued for its softness, giving it the

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,280
properties of a good lubricant.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,040
It also makes up the lead in modern pencils, which isn't really lead at all.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,800
It consists of pure carbon in a bonding arrangement which looks like this.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,320
It consists of vast sheets of carbon atoms bonded together along a plane.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,040
Now, take a look at this sample of carbon.

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,080
This familiar form of carbon is diamond.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,960
And diamond is famous for its clarity and its hardness, exactly the opposite from graphite,

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,880
which is valued for being dark and soft.

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,880
Now, diamond gets these properties not because its composition is any different.

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,960
They're both pure carbon.

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,440
It gets the different properties because of the nature of the bonds holding the atoms

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
together.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,480
Now, we call materials like these, these samples of pure elements, which differ only by the

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,680
way in which their atoms are bonded, allotropes.

35
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,920
And these two allotropes of carbon offer a clear example of just how critical it is

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,280
to understand chemical bonding in order to understand how organic compounds will behave.

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,320
So, let's investigate exactly why and how atoms bond to one another, and see if we can't

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,320
explain why graphite and diamond have such drastically different properties, even though

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,440
they're made up of exactly the same types of atoms.

40
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,120
So let's take a look at an atom.

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,040
Now, atoms are comprised of three types of subatomic particles, positively charged protons,

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,800
uncharged neutrons, and negatively charged electrons.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,440
Niels Bohr is most famous for many of his scientific accomplishments, but the most notable is his

44
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,560
model of the atom, in which a dense, positively charged nucleus containing protons and neutrons

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,680
is surrounded by a cloud of very small, fast-moving electrons carrying negative charges.

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,960
Now, each of these three particles plays a role in the properties of a given atom.

47
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,120
So most of us have seen cartoon representations, which look like the one I have here.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,000
But in truth, the relative positions of the particles in this particular model are accurate.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,280
The scale has been drastically distorted to make the system easier for us to view.

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,480
Now, in reality, if the electron cloud were the size I've represented here, the nucleus

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,760
itself would only be about 40 microns wide, about the size of a dust mite, a little bit

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,520
smaller than the width of a human hair.

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,280
Now, instead, let's bring that nucleus back to the scale that we used today.

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,520
If I use this nucleus as my scale, the electron cloud surrounding it is going to be several

55
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,360
kilometers wide.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,680
OK, so let's go back to our representation, the way that it was, so that we can study

57
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
these different parts of the atom.

58
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,280
Now, protons in the center provide the atom with its identity.

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,640
Our example here is a nucleus with six protons, so this would be a carbon atom.

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,080
Regardless of the number of other subatomic particles in the structure, the nucleus with

61
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,360
six protons will always be carbon.

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,000
The green neutrons that accompany those protons at the center of the atom do not alter its

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
identity.

64
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,960
So our example here has a carbon atom with six neutrons.

65
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,680
So this would be an isotope of carbon, which we call carbon 12.

66
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,840
But if I add an extra neutron to the nucleus, I still have carbon, but it's got a little

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,600
bit more mass, and we call this carbon 13.

68
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,240
If I add yet another neutron, still carbon, but now it's carbon 14.

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,040
So we call these combinations of neutrons that can accompany a specific number of protons

70
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,240
in the nucleus isotopes.

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,040
So neutrons have their place in organic chemistry, but it's really not in today's lecture, because

72
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,640
they don't have a tendency to affect the chemical properties of elements very strongly.

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,920
So we're going to concentrate more on protons and electrons for the rest of the day.

74
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,200
So let's get on to the electrons now.

75
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,460
Electrons most directly affect the charge of an atom, and in order for this atom here

76
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,560
to be neutral, we have to have the same number of electrons as we do protons.

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,760
So our central nucleus has six protons giving it a positive charge of six.

78
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,000
Therefore our electron cloud must have six electrons as well to create a neutral atom.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,560
And when the number of electrons in the cloud is not equal to the number of protons, we'll

80
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,960
have a charged species resulting from that, and we call these charged species ions.

81
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,200
So if I were to add an extra electron to my atom here, I now have seven electrons and

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,280
six protons, meaning I'll have a negatively charged species, which we call an anion.

83
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,000
If instead I remove two electrons, so now I have my original six protons and only five

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,560
electrons, I form something called a cation, which carries a positive charge.

85
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,200
Now as the discrepancy in the population of electrons and protons grows, so does the

86
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,520
charge in the ion.

87
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,080
For example, a carbon atom with seven electrons in its cloud would have a net charge of negative

88
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,880
one, and a carbon atom if it could have eight electrons in its cloud would have a charge

89
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,600
of negative two, etc.

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,640
Now what I'd like to focus on now is what made Bohr's model truly unique when compared

91
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,840
to its predecessors.

92
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,760
And this is that Bohr's model was the first to suggest that electrons are not spread evenly

93
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,240
through the volume of an atom, but rather that they only made up the outer portion of

94
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,480
the atom.

95
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,360
Now furthermore, he suggested that there are distinct energy levels around the nucleus,

96
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,120
each of which can only hold a finite number of those electrons.

97
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,320
And they fill sequentially from the smallest to the largest.

98
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,320
He also postulated that each energy level was divided into specific volumes which could

99
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,320
only hold two electrons each, and we call those volumes orbitals.

100
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,560
Now as we'll often do for clarity in this course, we'll concern ourselves only with

101
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,360
the first three rows of the periodic table.

102
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,280
So when we apply this constraint, we see that there are three rows in the table, each of

103
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,280
which represents the filling of a different energy level by those electrons.

104
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Now if we limit ourselves to neutral atoms, meaning the addition of electrons must match

105
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,080
the rate at which we add the protons, each of the first three rows of the periodic table

106
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,080
represents the filling of those different energy levels.

107
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,120
Since energy levels fill from lower to higher, only the highest energy level in any atom

108
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,160
can be unfilled.

109
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,240
We call that outermost energy level the valence shell.

110
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,240
So let's begin constructing an atom by adding protons and electrons to our hypothetical atom.

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,520
One pair at a time, tracking our progress through the periodic table.

112
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,320
Our first pair gives us a hydrogen atom.

113
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Now obviously the first energy level will be the valence shell for this atom.

114
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,020
Currently it has one electron in that first level.

115
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,620
With the addition of a second pair, another proton and another electron takes us to helium.

116
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,660
Now helium has two electrons in the first energy level, so the first energy level is

117
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,900
still the valence shell.

118
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,620
But as we prepare to continue, we notice that the first energy level is completely filled.

119
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,460
So the third electron has to be placed in the second energy level.

120
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,860
So now we've begun a new row in the periodic table.

121
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,620
A row of elements with their valence shell in the second energy level.

122
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,300
Now the second energy level is much larger than the first, so it can hold as many as

123
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,220
eight electrons.

124
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:58,700
So as we progress through beryllium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon, we see

125
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,580
that the same energy level is being populated.

126
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,740
And as we round out our trip through the first three rows, we begin populating the third

127
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,220
energy level, which can also hold only eight electrons.

128
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:21,740
Now the filling of this energy level comprises sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus,

129
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,220
sulfur, chlorine, and argon.

130
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,860
Now in truth, the third energy level can hold even more electrons, but it's usually

131
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,420
just these eight which are of interest to us in introductory organic chemistry courses.

132
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,420
So we're going to stop populating our periodic table there.

133
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,700
So what is it about the structure of atoms, which really drives chemical bonds to form?

134
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,220
And why is it that there's a periodic trend in the number of bonds atoms tend to form?

135
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,380
Now the answer to these questions is deeply rooted in a concept which we'll visit time

136
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,580
and time again in this course, a concept called free energy.

137
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,220
The free energy of a substance is simply a measure of its stability.

138
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,420
It tells us something about how much potential the system has to do work.

139
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,020
And just as physical processes tend toward lower energy states, like a ball rolling down

140
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,220
a hill, or heat transferring from a hot radiator into a cold room, it's the more stable states

141
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,620
of matter which will tend to form in chemical processes as well.

142
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,900
Now this concept was developed by American chemist Willard Gibbs in the late 1800s.

143
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,940
And Gibbs modeled the free energy of a system as a function of two important factors.

144
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,980
So let's take a look at a process which will actually allow us to demonstrate how these

145
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,220
factors push a reaction.

146
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,180
And I'm going to start with an organic compound with which most of us are familiar.

147
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,300
This is a molecule of propane, the type of which you might find in a backyard grill.

148
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,780
So you probably didn't think that you were doing organic chemistry the last time you

149
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,420
grilled a steak on your patio, but the truth is actually something different.

150
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,300
You see, propane can react with oxygen.

151
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,340
And when one molecule of propane reacts with five molecules of oxygen gas, it produces a

152
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,220
few things.

153
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,480
First it produces carbon dioxide.

154
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,500
It also produces a little bit of water.

155
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,420
But it also produces something else.

156
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,780
In fact, what we're after is not the carbon dioxide or the water.

157
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,020
When we start our barbecue grill, what we're after is another byproduct of the reaction,

158
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,020
heat.

159
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,100
Now chemists have a different name for this.

160
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,460
We call it enthalpy, and we represent it with the letter H.

161
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,220
We can determine the approximate enthalpy change during a reaction simply by taking an

162
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,760
inventory of all the bonds broken and all the bonds formed in our reaction.

163
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,280
So in the case of reacting propane with oxygen in what we call a combustion reaction, the

164
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,480
breaking of two carbon-carbon single bonds, eight carbon-hydrogen single bonds, and five

165
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,540
oxygen-oxygen double bonds actually releases more energy than the formation of six carbon-oxygen

166
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,360
double bonds and eight hydrogen-oxygen single bonds.

167
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,440
So we can use this bond inventory to predict that this reaction should generate heat.

168
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,080
Now the second byproduct of this reaction is randomness, and this is something you may

169
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,280
not have thought of quite as much before.

170
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,880
Think about this as being the exhaust from the burning of the propane.

171
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,440
Now you'll notice that I've converted one molecule of propane, five molecules of oxygen

172
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,880
into three molecules of carbon dioxide, and four molecules of water.

173
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,400
So I've increased the randomness, or what chemists call entropy of the system, because

174
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,800
I've turned six molecules of gas into seven, so I'm making larger quantities of smaller

175
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,840
molecules throughout my reaction.

176
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,520
It is these parameters, the enthalpy and the entropy of a reaction, which we can use to

177
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,560
estimate the driving force behind the process.

178
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,520
So let's take a look at how we actually do this.

179
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,480
The Gibbs free energy equation for any system at any state is simple.

180
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,680
The Gibbs free energy is equal to the enthalpy of that system minus the absolute temperature

181
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,600
at which that system currently rests, so this would be temperature in Kelvin's, multiplied

182
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,880
by the total entropy for that system in a given state.

183
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,760
Now the problem with this is that we don't actually know this number.

184
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,960
We can't calculate absolute entropies or absolute enthalpies for a given system.

185
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,520
But remember that chemical reactions are all about change.

186
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,120
There's an initial state and a final state, and it's the difference in the free energy

187
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,020
between those two that really matters.

188
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,600
So if I take the Gibbs energy equation for the final state of a reaction and the Gibbs

189
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,720
energy equation for the initial state of the materials in my reaction, I can simply subtract

190
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,960
one from the other, and this gives me a more usable equation in the form of the difference

191
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,760
in free energies, equaling the difference in enthalpies, minus the absolute temperature

192
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,600
times the difference in entropies.

193
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,640
Now this is a long equation with a lot of letters, so chemists like to shorten it by

194
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,360
using the Greek symbol delta to represent change.

195
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,000
And when we do this, we get the familiar form of the Gibbs free energy equation.

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,560
Delta G equals delta H minus T delta S.

197
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,520
Okay so that's enough math for a moment.

198
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,080
Let's apply this to the system that we looked at earlier.

199
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,600
Remember we took propane and reacted it with five equivalents of oxygen to produce seven

200
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
equivalents of exhaust gases or products.

201
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,560
And in doing so we create some heat, we increase the randomness of the system.

202
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,880
So in this case, because it releases heat, the system's energy has gone down.

203
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,400
So the sign of my enthalpy change will be negative.

204
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,100
And because I've increased randomness, the delta S term of my equation will necessarily

205
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,660
be positive.

206
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,220
So in this case, I've got an equation where my free energy change is equal to a negative

207
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,620
number minus a positive number.

208
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,660
In other words, delta G has to be negative for this process.

209
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,460
So reactions which trend in this fashion, releasing heat and increasing randomness, tend to be

210
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,540
what we call spontaneous.

211
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,260
Now spontaneous is a little bit different than the term that we use colloquially.

212
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,420
When chemists talk about spontaneous processes, we're talking about a process which is favored

213
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,980
simply because the energy of the products is lower.

214
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,740
Now we can think of that as a situation where a reaction is going downhill.

215
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,380
So don't let this name fool you because sometimes the term spontaneous invokes thoughts of speed.

216
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,540
But here we're using it to mean proceeding without any outside perturbation.

217
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,540
So a spontaneous reaction will eventually happen on its own.

218
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,340
But it may not happen at all.

219
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,780
For example, ordinary temperatures and pressures, the conversion of diamond into graphite is

220
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,100
actually spontaneous.

221
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,180
But thankfully, it takes geologic time scales for this to occur.

222
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:21,700
So on the time scale of a human lifetime, your diamond jewelry is safe.

223
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:27,620
So one can easily guess that entropy or disorder, it's not on the side of chemical bonding.

224
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,660
So bonds attach freely moving atoms into higher order structures.

225
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,180
So there's an entropic penalty for bonding which must be overcome somehow if we expect

226
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,700
a bond to form at all.

227
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,700
So the key to chemical bonding is its effect on the enthalpy of a system, or the energy

228
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,660
released when a bond forms.

229
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,940
If this process of fixing atoms in space relative to one another is going to be spontaneous,

230
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,100
there must be something about the linkage which lowers the chemical potential energy.

231
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,620
But what's the driving force?

232
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,580
Well, the answer to that question is the octet rule.

233
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,540
An observation first made by Irving Langmuir in 1919.

234
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,820
He noted that atoms of smaller elements seem to have an unusual stability when the outermost

235
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,140
energy level of their electron cloud was filled with electrons.

236
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Now octet rule might be a somewhat unfortunate choice of a name since it creates the conundrum

237
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,220
that the first principle energy level can only hold two electrons, not eight.

238
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,300
But the general spirit of the rule holds even for that energy level.

239
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:40,340
Having a full outer energy level, or valence shell, lowers the energy of an atom.

240
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,300
So you probably noticed in our previous discussion on energy levels in the electron clouds that

241
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:52,780
only helium, neon, and argon naturally have these completely filled outer energy levels.

242
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:59,300
This makes helium, neon, and argon particularly stable and unreactive, earning this column

243
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,980
of the periodic table the moniker noble gases.

244
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,540
But of our first 18 elements, only three of them have a naturally filled valence shell

245
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,860
when they're isolated neutral atoms.

246
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,900
So how is it that the atoms of other elements under consideration today can achieve a similar

247
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
condition?

248
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,780
And the answer to that question is chemical bonding.

249
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:28,460
Now so far we've established that very few elements in their isolated, neutral state

250
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,780
naturally have filled outer energy levels.

251
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,660
And we've also noted that having such a filled outer energy level lends extra stability to

252
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,300
atoms.

253
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,120
So all other atoms aspire to have the electron configuration of a noble gas, and we call

254
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,380
this tendency the octet rule.

255
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,660
I've already mentioned that the most available method for atoms to create that full valence

256
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,340
shell is a bond.

257
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,220
But what is bonding?

258
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,940
Well, chemical bonding, simply defined, is an energetically beneficial interaction between

259
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,420
atoms which requires them to maintain a specific distance from one another in space.

260
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,900
Bonds are so small, and when bonded, the distance is between them so short that a special unit

261
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,100
of distance has to be created, called an angstrom.

262
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,540
And we use this unit of distance to measure bond length.

263
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,980
It's about one ten billionth of a meter.

264
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,860
In introductory chemistry courses, we often teach that there are two kinds of bonds, ionic

265
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
and covalent.

266
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,780
But the truth is that there's a continuum of bonds, with ionic at one extreme and covalent

267
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,580
at the other.

268
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,180
And these two modes of bonding are distinct, but both are driven by the same drive for

269
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,420
atoms to obtain that full valence shell.

270
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:49,220
And the easiest way to understand this continuum of bonds is to first discuss the extremes.

271
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,620
Ionic bonding occurs when atoms of significantly different electro-negativity come together.

272
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:01,140
Simply put, electronegativity is a measure of how hungry an atom is for electrons.

273
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,100
And in general, if we neglect the noble gases, electronegativity increases as we move from

274
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,100
left to right across the periodic table, because the nuclei of atoms are becoming increasingly

275
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,740
positively charged.

276
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,620
Electronegativity also increases from bottom to top of the periodic table, because the

277
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,620
electron clouds are becoming smaller, screening the nucleus from the outermost electrons the

278
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
least.

279
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,300
For example, fluorine is the most electronegative of all elements, because within the second

280
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,300
row it has the most positively charged nucleus with nine protons.

281
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,580
And because it's small electron cloud with only two energy levels, makes the positively

282
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,060
charged nucleus better able to attract that extra electron.

283
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,820
If we move down and across our small portion of the periodic table, at the opposite end

284
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:56,100
we find sodium, which has just one weakly held electron in its outermost energy level.

285
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,060
This means that sodium is instead very eager to give up an electron.

286
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:05,180
And we call sodium either very electropositive or not very electronegative.

287
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,940
Either description works.

288
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,980
The combination of these two elements leads to a classic example of an ionic bond.

289
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,500
An atom of sodium having just one electron in its outermost energy level gives up that

290
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,020
electron to achieve a full outer energy level.

291
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,740
And fluorine, on the other hand, having seven electrons in its outer energy level, needs

292
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,140
to gain one to achieve an octet.

293
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,820
And adding one more gives it eight electrons in its valence shell.

294
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,300
So if sodium is very electropositive and needs to lose the electron to achieve an octet,

295
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,780
the fluorine is very electronegative, needs to gain an electron to achieve an octet, it

296
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,340
seems obvious that the two can strike a deal.

297
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,780
The unwanted electron from sodium is fully transferred to the fluorine, giving both an

298
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,420
octet, but also ionizing them in the process.

299
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,740
So sodium now has a charge of plus one.

300
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,340
And fluorine now has a charge of minus one.

301
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,260
And it's the electrostatic attraction between these two ions, which holds them together.

302
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,140
And we call this ionic bonding.

303
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,020
The alternative end of the bonding spectrum is the covalent bond.

304
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,100
When we pair two atoms of very similar electronegativity, neither is particularly willing to exchange

305
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,740
electrons with the other.

306
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,740
There are two atoms of fluorine.

307
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:29,740
With equal electronegativity, neither is willing to donate an electron to form an ionic bond.

308
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,900
But there is a second solution to the problem.

309
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,580
The sharing of electrons rather than the transfer.

310
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,140
So if the two fluorine atoms come together in an arrangement in space which allows them

311
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,580
to share one extra electron each, each atom has been fooled into thinking it has its own

312
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,940
octet.

313
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,820
And this is the driving force behind covalent bonding.

314
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,100
But the complexity of electron sharing doesn't stop there.

315
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,300
Two oxygen atoms, for example, must each donate two electrons to a bond, joining these atoms

316
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,560
in an oxygen molecule.

317
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,140
We call this arrangement a double bond, since two pairs of electrons are shared.

318
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,780
So now that we understand the process by which fully ionic and fully covalent bonds help

319
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,180
atoms to satisfy their octets, let's turn our attention back to that continuum of bonds

320
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,860
that I mentioned earlier.

321
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,260
Naturally, oxygen atoms need not bond only to other oxygen atoms.

322
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,600
We can instead envision a system in which an oxygen atom satisfies its octet by bonding

323
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,220
covalently to two hydrogen atoms.

324
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,860
In this case, we've bonded a more electronegative oxygen to a less electronegative hydrogen

325
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,380
atom.

326
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,940
And the electronegativities of each are not as drastically different as in our sodium

327
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,740
fluoride example, but they're not exactly the same as in our example of oxygen gas either.

328
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,300
So we expect sharing to take place, but the sharing is unequal, meaning that the bonding

329
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,500
electrons spend more time in the proximity of the more electronegative oxygen atom.

330
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,140
The result of this is what we call a polar covalent bond, which gives water its high

331
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,740
polarity among common solvents.

332
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,180
As the course progresses, we'll see many examples in which the relative polarity of

333
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,860
bonds is the driving factor in chemical reactions.

334
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,580
So it's important to understand this type of bonding early in the course.

335
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,500
In the previous section, we concerned ourselves only with the principal energy levels of an

336
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,620
atom's electron cloud and how they affect the bonding behavior of different pairs of

337
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,740
atoms.

338
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,160
But the representation that we used to show the relative energy of electrons didn't really

339
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,160
convey their true positions around the atom, just their approximate energies.

340
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,680
Simply put, our diagrams conveyed the energetics of bonding, but didn't finish the story by

341
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,000
telling us about the spatial arrangement of those bonds about the central atom.

342
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,440
To understand this geometry of bonding, we need to invoke one more fundamental component

343
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,880
of atomic structure, atomic orbitals.

344
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,360
You see, all valence electrons are not equal.

345
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,480
There's more to defining the orbits of electrons than just the principal energy level in which

346
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,960
they reside.

347
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,520
In order to show the specific volume of space in which each electron resides within an energy

348
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:21,400
level, we have to introduce a second level of organization, atomic orbitals.

349
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Once again, we're graced by the simplifying fact that our discussion only entails the

350
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,080
first three rows of the periodic table, through which relatively simple progressions of atomic

351
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
structure evolve.

352
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,680
Now, all energy levels contain a single S orbital.

353
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,320
And S orbitals are spherical in shape, and increase in size with increasing principal

354
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,280
energy level.

355
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,360
This is to say that the one S orbital is smaller than the two S, which again is smaller than

356
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,360
the three S.

357
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,760
And since each S orbital can only hold two electrons, the remaining six electrons, from

358
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,720
the second and third principal energy levels, have to find another home.

359
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,040
And they do this in an array of three distinct P orbitals per level.

360
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:14,240
Now, just like S orbitals, P orbitals increase in size with increasing principal energy level.

361
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,560
But unlike S orbitals, P orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell, with a node at the nucleus

362
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,080
of the atom.

363
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,080
So if we were to plot out the energy of all the atomic orbitals in argon, the largest of

364
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,200
the atoms under consideration today, we would see something like this.

365
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:39,880
This would be a one S2, two S2, two P6, three S2, three P6 configuration.

366
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,120
Now notice that all three P orbitals of any given energy level are slightly higher in

367
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,760
energy than the corresponding S orbital, but equal in energy to one another.

368
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,840
Now chemists use the word degenerate to describe energetically equivalent orbitals like these

369
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,280
groups of P orbitals.

370
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,360
So I'll be using this word from time to time as well.

371
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,640
And now that we understand the size and shape of atomic orbitals, we can begin to understand

372
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,200
how these regions of space can overlap to produce new covalent bonds.

373
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,720
The two major classes of covalent bonds pervade the science of organic chemistry, and we

374
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,600
call these classes sigma bonds and pi bonds.

375
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,840
Sigma bonds form whenever orbitals overlap along the internuclear axis, such as two esatomic

376
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,640
orbitals overlapping.

377
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,800
Atoms with available P orbitals can also accomplish this type of bonding by overlapping one lobe

378
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,480
of a P orbital.

379
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,440
Placing electron density directly between the two positively charged nuclei screens

380
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,600
them from repelling one another, creating a very strong bond.

381
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,520
In fact, sigma bonds are so stable that they're always the first type of bond to form between

382
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,560
two atoms.

383
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,320
It does, however, create a bond around which the attached atoms can spin, like the axle

384
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,680
of a vehicle, giving these bonds what chemists call free rotation.

385
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,840
But pi bonds, on the other hand, form when P atomic orbitals overlap in a side-to-side

386
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,320
fashion as shown here.

387
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,520
Now notice that there's no electron density along that internuclear axis, but rather above

388
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,720
and below the bonded atoms.

389
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,240
This makes pi bonds a little bit weaker than sigma bonds, but also gives them some very

390
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,560
interesting properties, like restricted rotation, and in many cases greater reactivity since

391
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,680
their electrons are easier to remove.

392
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,440
So we'll explore both of those properties a little bit later in the course.

393
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,080
So far we've discussed atomic structure, the energetics driving bonding, and some of the

394
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,800
simpler ways in which orbitals can overlap to form new chemical bonds.

395
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,600
We've covered quite a bit, but there's still one last very important process which helps

396
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,960
us explain exactly why atoms take on the geometries they do when bonding.

397
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,760
So let's begin by taking a look at a methane molecule.

398
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,040
Now you'll notice that I've drawn the atoms here around a central carbon of methane in

399
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:13,280
a tetrahedral arrangement, and all four bonds are evenly spaced around that central carbon.

400
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,360
We know this is true from experimentation, but the atomic orbitals, those S and P orbitals

401
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,400
that I showed you previously, they don't have this tetrahedral geometry.

402
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,040
So if the sigma bonds holding each hydrogen to the central carbon were produced by either

403
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,360
a P orbital or an S orbital from the central carbon, the resulting molecule would have

404
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:42,040
a very unusual geometry, and yet here we have this beautiful elegantly symmetrical molecule.

405
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,040
That elegant simple symmetry of methane was actually a puzzle to chemists until the renowned

406
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:54,560
physical chemist Linus Pauling published a theory on orbital hybridization in 1931.

407
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,600
Pauling postulated that atomic orbitals could combine with one another, creating new sets

408
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,280
of orbitals with some S character and some P character.

409
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,400
So according to Pauling's new idea, any number of S and P atomic orbitals can combine to

410
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,320
form an equal number of degenerate hybrid orbitals.

411
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,520
And these new orbitals are neither S nor P, but a mixture of the two, having properties

412
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,200
of both.

413
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,440
And this led Pauling to refer to them as hybrid orbitals.

414
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,920
For example, one S and one P orbital can combine to form two SP hybrid orbitals.

415
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,320
Each of the new hybrid orbitals has about 50% S character and 50% P character.

416
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,400
The influence of both contributing atomic orbitals is evident.

417
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,920
Both can form sigma bonds and are at a 180 degree angle to one another.

418
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,560
Now this phenomenon extends to hybridization of one S and two P orbitals to form three

419
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,800
equivalent SP two orbitals.

420
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,480
These orbitals would be 120 degrees apart, and it also applies to the combination of

421
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:06,640
one S and three P orbitals to form four SP three hybrid orbitals, all of equal energy

422
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,560
and identical geometry spaced 109.5 degrees apart.

423
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,320
So in the case of SP three hybridization, the hybrid orbitals all point at the corners

424
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,480
of this tetrahedron.

425
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,040
This leads chemists to call atoms like methane, at least the central carbon of methane, tetrahedral

426
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,040
atoms.

427
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,960
Now remarkably Pauling's theory was spot on.

428
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,600
Hybridization is a perfect explanation for the symmetry of the methane gas molecule.

429
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,400
It's four identical carbon-hydrogen bonds spaced evenly can only be explained by Pauling's

430
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,960
new hybridization theory.

431
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,080
So let's sum up what we've covered today.

432
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,880
We've discussed the structure of the atom, how positively charged nuclei are surrounded

433
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,600
by a highly ordered cloud of orbiting negatively charged electrons.

434
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,600
We consider the octet rule, and how it is an atom's desire to have a full valence shell

435
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,920
which drives the process of chemical bonding.

436
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,720
We saw how atoms of drastically different electronegativity can exchange electrons completely

437
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,880
to form ionic bonds, which are then held together by an electrostatic attraction.

438
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,600
We also took a look at purely covalent bonds, in which atoms of identical electronegativity

439
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,320
share one or more pairs of electrons between themselves to increase their valence electron

440
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,960
count without altering their charge.

441
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,120
We also talked about how smaller differences in electronegativity between covalently bonded

442
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,120
atoms can lead to what are known as polar covalent bonds.

443
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,920
We studied how the principal energy levels of larger atoms can be divided into finer structures,

444
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,000
which are used to explain the two types of chemical bonding most often encountered in

445
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,840
organic chemistry.

446
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,800
How strong, freely rotating sigma bonds form along the inter-nuclear axis of the two bonded

447
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,360
atoms, and how somewhat weaker rotation-restricting pi bonds form by a side-to-side overlap of

448
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,600
p orbitals.

449
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,240
And finally, we took a look at how hybridization of atomic orbitals can create sets of hybrid

450
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,680
orbitals which explain the observed geometries in most organic molecules.

451
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,240
So now that we understand a bit about the process and geometries of chemical bonding,

452
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,520
our next task will be to put some atoms together into molecules and survey a few of the many

453
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,760
ways that chemists draw the resulting molecules.

454
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,120
This is our topic for next time, and I'll see you then.
