1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,920
Let's get back to one of my favorite stories.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,000
The years 1870, and in the laboratories of Alexander Butlarov at the University of Kazan,

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,920
are working two men who will become arguably the two most prolific chemical researchers

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,720
of the coming decade.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,320
Vladimir Markovnikov and Alexander Zetsev.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,200
Now Markovnikov and Zetsev have little love for one another.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,360
Their mutual contempt is driving these two men to forge ahead in their research in the

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,520
hopes of not only making a name for themselves, but of one upping the other.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,880
We've already seen how one of their most prominent battlegrounds was the chemistry

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,640
of alkyl halides and alkenes, both how they're made and how they react.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,200
During our lecture on alkenes, I told you about Zetsev's great victory in the debate

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,280
over alkene stability.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
But I chose to show you how modern chemists go about proving his rule.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
By the end of the day today, we'll have all the necessary understanding to survey the

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,000
reactions Zetsev himself used, one of the principle methods of producing alkenes, elimination

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,720
reactions.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,080
Alkyl halides and other compounds containing good leaving groups need not necessarily undergo

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
substitution reactions.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,960
There's another class of reactions in which these types of compounds often participate.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Now instead of substituting a new group in place of the leaving group, a pi bond is formed

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,760
by the loss of an adjacent proton, which we call the beta proton.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,440
Elimination reactions always proceed with the production of a byproduct formed by the

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,400
leaving group, but they don't consume a nucleophile in the process.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,360
So in contrast to substitution reactions, which are entropically neutral, elimination

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,140
reactions actually proceed with a pretty significant increase in entropy, because they're making

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,000
two or more molecules from one.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,360
Now this is a good thing, because the exchange of sigma bonds for a pi bond means that the

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,320
enthalpy of this reaction is not usually favorable.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,160
So elimination reactions are driven by factors like increased heat and time, as well as the

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,160
formation of stable leaving groups and alkene products.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,580
Eliminations are always a possibility and are usually competing pathways in substitution

32
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,080
reactions.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:39,000
It's when this competing pathway becomes dominant that we call the reaction an elimination.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,120
So just as we did with substitution, let's start from the very beginning.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,600
Let's limit ourselves to only the knowledge available to Markovnikov and Zetsev in the

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:54,360
1870s and consider exactly how elimination reactions might take place.

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,960
Completing an elimination reaction requires that two things be removed from the starting

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,080
material, a stable leaving group and a beta proton from an adjacent carbon.

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
Zetsev's theory that more substituted alkenes would form in these reactions proved true.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,200
Markovnikov instead hung his hat on a theory called microscopic reversibility.

41
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,040
Having observed that alkyl halides of low substitution could be used to prepare alkenes,

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,200
he theorized that reversing the reaction should produce the original starting material.

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,880
But Markovnikov and Zetsev lacked the tools to probe these mechanisms much, if at all.

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Decades later it was our friend Christopher Engeld who once again left his mark on organic

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,400
chemistry by recognizing that there were three potential mechanisms which he had to consider.

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,520
The first of these three possibilities would involve having the base abstract the proton

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,480
from our alkyl halide's beta carbon to initiate the reaction, so first the base will take

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,080
the proton, then the remainder of the reaction will complete.

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,680
If I do this, I have to go through an intermediate called the carbanion which then undergoes

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,240
the remainder of the reaction, losing the leaving group to form the new alkene.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,880
The problem with this particular mechanism is that our base is trying to abstract a

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,720
proton from something with a pKa of about 50.

53
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,680
And you'll recall from our lecture on alkenes and alkynes that pKa's of 44, like those

54
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,520
in an alkene, are considered to be prohibitive.

55
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,640
So in this case with a pKa of 50, it's simply not possible.

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,840
The substrate is just not acidic enough.

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,680
But we still have two more possibilities.

58
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
So let's take a look at another one.

59
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,640
How about a reaction in which the base abstracts that beta proton at the same time as departure

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,600
of the leaving group and the formation of the pi bond?

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,000
If this all takes place in a single concerted step, we avoid that very unstable conjugate

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,240
base.

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,600
So this is a very viable reaction mechanism.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,160
And if this were a reaction mechanism that we're taking place, since it happens in a

65
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,040
single step, we expect its rate law to involve both the concentration of the base and the

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,600
concentration of the substrate.

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,160
In other words, this is a second order elimination engulfed called these E2 mechanisms.

68
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,760
The third possibility would involve the departure of the leaving group before the base abstracts

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
the proton.

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,480
In other words, we're going to go through a carbocation intermediate.

71
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,440
This carbocation intermediate can then act as an acid protonating our base and leading

72
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
to products.

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
This is also a perfectly viable mechanism, as we're well aware carbocation is frequently

74
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
formed from alkyl halides.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
So in this case, because the rate limiting step occurs before the base reacts with the

76
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,720
acidic proton, the rate law should only contain the substrate concentration.

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,800
In other words, this is a first order elimination or an E1 reaction.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,520
So just as in the case of substitution, we're left pondering two believable mechanisms for

79
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,240
the elimination of an alkyl halide to form an alkene, one with a rate dependent only

80
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:12,880
on substrate concentration and another dependent on both substrate and base concentration.

81
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
So which is correct?

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,400
Well, just as with substitution, the conditional answer here is both.

83
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,120
Engle realized that in each potential reaction mechanism was a base accepting a beta proton

84
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
from the substrate.

85
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,600
But in one mechanism, the base participates in the rate limiting step while in the other,

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,840
it did not.

87
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:43,080
And again, kinetic studies were the key to unlocking the rules governing these two mechanisms.

88
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Let's begin with the E2 reaction pathway, which involves simultaneous deprotonation

89
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,840
and leaving group departure.

90
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,800
In our previous lecture, we defined nucleophiles as electron rich species, which have high

91
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,040
negative charge density and lone pair electrons to donate in heterogenic bond formation.

92
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,560
You may recall that in an earlier lecture, we mentioned another type of reagent which

93
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,920
has a very similar set of properties, right?

94
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,560
Lewis bases.

95
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,160
So if nucleophiles and bases have similar properties, is it possible for a nucleophile

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,000
to act as a base?

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
And the answer is yes.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,640
You may also recall from our last lecture that SN2 reactions take place when strong

99
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,200
nucleophiles attack a substrate of low substitution from the backside.

100
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,280
A natural question to follow that observation is, what happens if the nucleophile is strong,

101
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:44,400
like hydroxide, but the substrate is of high substitution, like t-butyl chloride?

102
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
The answer to this question should be clear.

103
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,160
The nucleophile unable to attack the obstructed electrophile is not going to wait to react.

104
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,720
When nucleophilic attack isn't possible, it will instead react as a base.

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,840
The protonation of the beta carbon seems like the next best alternative to satiate these

106
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
very reactive species.

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,720
But we already know simple deprotonation would be a highly disfavored reaction because of

108
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,560
the high pKa of the alkyl halide beta protons.

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,440
But there's a second process which can be coupled to the proton removal, that's the

110
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,320
departure of the leaving group.

111
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,800
And it's the simultaneous removal of the beta proton, departure of the leaving group, and

112
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,720
formation of a new double bond, which all come together to form a single step process

113
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,360
resulting in the formation of an alkene.

114
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,520
Now a beta proton, which is at opposition to the leaving group, is the one which will

115
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
be removed.

116
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Remember leaving groups and second order reactions depart when electrons move in from the backside

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,000
of the electrophilic carbon.

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,760
In order to accomplish this in an E2 substrate, the bond holding the acidic proton has to

119
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:01,040
be on the backside of the molecule relative to the leaving group.

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,960
This orientation is only achieved when the beta proton has a 180 degree dihedral angle

121
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,160
relative to the leaving group.

122
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,080
We call this orientation of substituents anti-coplanar.

123
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,600
Fortunately, in this saturated alkyl halide, the bond joining the electrophilic carbon

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,560
and the beta carbon has free rotation, so it can easily achieve this arrangement, allowing

125
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,080
the E2 reaction to take place.

126
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,080
So in this case, we form 2-methylpropene.

127
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:39,480
Now let's consider a different situation, which might lead to a first order reaction.

128
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,120
One in which an alkyl halide of high substitution is placed in the presence of a very weak base.

129
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,320
In a situation like this, any elimination which might occur would likely fall into the

130
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
E1 class of reactions.

131
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,920
Now by very weak base, I mean a species which can accept a proton only under extreme conditions.

132
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Usually this means a neutral compound such as a molecule of solvent, or one which is

133
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,120
negatively charged but has lots of resonance to help stabilize that charge, like this dihydrogen

134
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,600
phosphate ion.

135
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,280
So let's consider the same substrate as before, but with a weak nucleophile like water.

136
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,640
In this situation, carbocation should form quite easily from something like t-butyl chloride,

137
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,520
but even so, there's no strong nucleophile to be found.

138
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,240
So what's a carbocation to do?

139
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,320
Under the circumstances, the only way to produce a product is to lose an adjacent proton and

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,560
form an alkene.

141
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,560
In the case of t-butyl chloride, the elimination product is exactly the same as that obtained

142
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,920
in our E2 example, but don't be fooled.

143
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,200
We'll soon see some examples in which this is not true.

144
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,100
So you can see the distinguishing property of E1 reactions is that they tend to run best

145
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,540
under acidic conditions where there's no good nucleophile, and at higher temperatures

146
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:12,180
which favor systems of greater entropy.

147
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,380
One consideration which sets second order elimination, or E2 reactions, apart from second

148
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,960
order substitution, SN2 reactions, is the wide variety of possible products which can

149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,540
form from the same combination of reagents.

150
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,380
For example, unlike the SN2 pathway, which involves the attack of a nucleophile on the

151
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,300
carbon-bearing the leaving group, giving it only one potential reactive site, the E2 reaction

152
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:44,120
requires the abstraction of an adjacent proton, of which there may be many.

153
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,700
When I first introduced this mechanism, I was careful to select a t-butyl halide, since

154
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,700
all of its beta protons are equivalent, so eliminates that consideration.

155
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,100
But most substrates for elimination reactions aren't so convenient.

156
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,460
Issues of regiospecificity and stereospecificity will arise quickly.

157
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:12,060
So let's take a look at this reaction between hydroxide ions and S2 bromo-3-methylbutane.

158
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,100
Now in this case I'm going to have an elimination mechanism take place so that we can observe

159
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,140
the potential products that form.

160
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,380
Now in this case I actually have a substrate which has two different kinds of beta protons.

161
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:29,060
I have the outside ones here labeled in green on a primary carbon, and I have this more

162
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,420
interior beta proton which is on a tertiary carbon.

163
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,140
So if hydroxide ion is going to act as a base rather than a nucleophile in this situation,

164
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,540
there are two different protons which it can abstract from my alkyl halide.

165
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,860
And depending upon which one it takes, I will get a different structural isomer of the resulting

166
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,300
alkene.

167
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,220
So if the green proton participates in the reaction, I'll get this product.

168
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,700
This particular alkene has three hydrogens and one R-group attached to its functional

169
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,140
group.

170
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,260
But if instead the purple interior proton is abstracted, I'll get the lower product

171
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,260
in which there is one hydrogen and three attached alkyl groups.

172
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,460
So in this case I'm also going to get a little bit of water and bromide ion, but my primary

173
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,540
product is going to be the Zetsev product.

174
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,060
That is the one that's more substituted because we know it to be more stable.

175
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,500
Now in situations like this one, the more substituted alkene product tends to be the

176
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
major product of the reaction.

177
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,980
And you'll recall from the alkene lecture that Zetsev's rule states the major product

178
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,660
of an elimination reaction will be the most substituted alkene possible.

179
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,460
So applying Zetsev's rule to our problem of 2-bromo-3-methylbutane with hydroxide gave

180
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,780
us the tri-substituted product in greater abundance than the monosubstituted product.

181
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,340
By extension, Zetsev's rule accurately predicts the major products of these elimination reactions

182
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,740
as well.

183
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,100
But there's one more wrinkle to this story that we have to consider.

184
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,780
You see, we can safely apply Zetsev's rule for E2 reactions when the base is particularly

185
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,660
small like that hydroxide ion was.

186
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,940
The picture, however, can become a bit more complicated when we use bulkier bases like

187
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,580
tbutoxide.

188
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,540
When we attempt to react tbutoxide with 2-bromo-3-methylbutane to obtain an elimination product,

189
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,700
we run into a little snag in predicting what's going to happen.

190
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,780
So here's an example of a reaction between tbutoxide ion and the same substrate as in

191
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,860
our previous example where we used hydroxide as the base.

192
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,980
So just like hydroxide, the tbutoxide ion has a choice of two different protons, which

193
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:49,340
it can abstract, to form two different structural isomers of the alkene product.

194
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,860
The difference in this situation is that the ratio of these products is flipped over.

195
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,220
It's on its head.

196
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,580
When we do this analysis, we find that we get tbutanol and bromide ion byproducts.

197
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,740
And as the major product, we have our alkene, which has only one R group.

198
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:11,220
So in this case, we've made more of the antiseptsep product or the Hoffman product.

199
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
So the question here is, why did this happen?

200
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,900
Well, the reason that it happened is because this large, bulky tbutoxide base has difficulty

201
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,820
accessing this sterically crowded interior hydrogen.

202
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,420
So more often than not, it simply reacts with its third choice.

203
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,020
Can't get to the electrophilic carbon, can't get to the interior hydrogen.

204
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,140
The only thing left to react with are these protons that are out on the edge of the molecule.

205
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,740
And removing one of those protons results in the formation of the antiseptsep or Hoffman

206
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,940
product.

207
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,540
Now let's consider regiospecificity in the E1 mechanism.

208
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,340
Just as with E2 reactions, we need to be careful to consider how an E1 might produce multiple

209
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,140
products of varying stability.

210
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,540
And we've already established that E1 reactions are expected to proceed through a carbocation

211
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,740
intermediate.

212
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,100
And this has two important influences on the products formed by such a reaction.

213
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,260
First, the carbocation is planar, which means that they form a planar intermediate, making

214
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,980
the even more sterically obstructed beta protons accessible to the weak base.

215
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,500
This means E1 reactions are much less prone to form Hoffman or antiseptsep products.

216
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:33,420
So the reaction of water with 2-bromo-2-methylbutane forms 2-methyl-2-butene, just as the analogous

217
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,740
E2 reaction.

218
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,020
But the reaction with t-butanol, a bulky weak base, has little effect.

219
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,140
We still get the zets of product as the major species.

220
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,300
But there's another consideration which always comes with first-order reactants, carbocation

221
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,340
rearrangements.

222
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:59,980
So the reaction of water with 2-bromo-3-4-dimethylpentane will produce a carbocation, which can not

223
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,300
only undergo a secondary rearrangement, but will then form the tetra-substituted zetsip

224
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,780
product.

225
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,540
So take a look at this product.

226
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,900
The double bond is not even on the original electrophilic carbon.

227
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:24,660
Now, our explanation of these mechanisms, though, isn't quite complete.

228
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,580
See, when we work with elimination reactions, just like with substitution reactions, we

229
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,660
must not only consider regiospecificity, but also consider the possible effects on the

230
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,300
stereochemistry of products.

231
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Since the product of this reaction is an alkene, of course there's no potential for a chiral

232
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:50,460
center to form, but a stereocenter may yet be produced in the form of cis and trans isomers.

233
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,360
Take the example of 2-bromo-butane.

234
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,780
Because this is a secondary alkyl halide, it can undergo an E2 elimination in the presence

235
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,580
of a strong base or an E1 elimination in the presence of a weak one.

236
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Let's begin by considering an E2 product, which we might generate with a strong base

237
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,460
like t-butoxide or hydroxide.

238
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,700
We already know that Zetsev's rule predicts the reaction to take place through deprotonation

239
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:23,680
of the secondary beta proton, leading to a disubstituted alkene, 2-butene, rather than

240
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,180
a primary hydrogen, which would lead to a monosubstituted alkene.

241
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,740
But the 2-butene products can form two different isomers, cis or trans.

242
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,340
Now, each of these products results when we have a different dihedral angle among the

243
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,660
methyl and bromine substituents.

244
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,460
You might recall that I alluded to this issue when we first introduced Newman projections.

245
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:52,140
Well, here's my Newman projection of S2-bromobutane.

246
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:58,780
I can place this molecule in a reactive position for an E2 by aligning either of the two beta

247
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,020
protons anti-coplanar to the bromine.

248
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,940
But look at what happens to the methyl substituents.

249
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:11,340
Depending on which rotational state, or rotamer, is adopted, a different beta proton is removed

250
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,940
and I get a different arrangement of substituents in the resulting alkene.

251
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,100
With methyl groups anti-to-one another, I get the transisomer, or E2-butene.

252
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,300
Whereas when the alternative hydrogen is aligned for the E2 reaction, methyl groups are gauche

253
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,740
to one another, creating a less stable starting state for the reaction.

254
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,900
So as you might guess, the major elimination product is the one formed by the most often

255
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:45,940
sampled reactive rotamer in the starting material, or the E-isomer.

256
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,100
But there are instances in which only one isomer is possible for an E2.

257
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,460
For example, take S2-bromo R3-methylpentane.

258
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,980
If I were to begin with this starting material, a large base like t-butoxide might give me

259
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,460
the Hoffman or anti-Zetzep product of which only one isomer exists.

260
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,540
But if we use a compact, strong base like hydroxide, there's only one rotameric state

261
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,740
which will allow an E2 reaction to take place.

262
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,940
As you can see from the Newman projection, the predicted product is actually the Z-isomer

263
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,060
of the alkene.

264
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:29,660
E1 reactions are also prone to stereospecificity, but almost always preferentially form E-isomers

265
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:35,180
because carbocation have free rotation, which allows them to adopt the most stable confirmation

266
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,740
with large groups at opposition before the elimination completes.

267
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:51,780
So in most cases, this means the E-isomer.

268
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,820
So far, we've considered elimination reactions using branched and linear alkyl halides as

269
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,940
starting materials.

270
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,500
All of these examples have enjoyed free rotation about the bonds between alpha and beta carbons,

271
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,180
allowing them to adopt reactive confirmations for E2 reactions.

272
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,340
But there's a class of alkyl halide which doesn't have this free rotation.

273
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,500
Think about a cyclic alkyl halide.

274
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,820
Just as with cyclic alkanes, there is an associated ring strain in smaller cyclic alkyl halides,

275
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,300
which means that the carbon-carbon bonds making up the ring can't freely rotate, and this

276
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,340
can cause a serious problem.

277
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:38,380
Let's consider the first-order reaction between trans, 1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane, and water.

278
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,180
Water is a very weak nucleophile, and our substrate is secondary.

279
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,220
So when I react these two with one another, what potential products might I make?

280
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,700
Well, the secondary carbocation produced in this E1 reaction can form one of two products,

281
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,940
three-methylhexene, or one-methylhexene.

282
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,300
But this carbocation can also rearrange by a hydride shift to form a tertiary carbocation,

283
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,940
which can also produce one-methylhexene.

284
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,260
But also a small amount of methylene-cyclohexane can occur as well.

285
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,340
So by switching to an E2 mechanism, using hydroxide, you might be tempted to say that

286
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,660
the major product would be one-methylcyclohexane in accordance with Zetzsev's rule.

287
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,660
But in this case, there's a problem.

288
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,660
The ring restricts rotation of the bond between the alpha and beta carbons, and simply will

289
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,740
not allow the tertiary beta proton to achieve the necessary anti-coplanar alignment for

290
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,940
the reaction.

291
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:49,620
So this reaction will produce only one elimination product in the form of three-methylcyclohexane.

292
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,540
The ability of cyclic alkyl halides to undergo E2 reactions is also severely limited by the

293
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:01,100
need for the halide to be in an axial position for the proper orbital alignments.

294
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,940
Consider the two isomers of one T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane.

295
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,340
The trans-isomer is essentially incapable of undergoing E2 reactions, because a set of

296
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,300
one-three-diaxial interactions is so strong that the molecule simply can't achieve that

297
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,660
reactive confirmation.

298
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,460
But now take a look at the cis-confirmation.

299
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,220
Now that T-butyl group wanting to be equatorial forces the chloride-leaving group into a reactive

300
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:38,780
confirmation, so the order of reactivity with respect to E2 is trans-1-T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane,

301
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:46,020
then chlorocyclohexane, and finally the most reactive is cis-1-T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane.

302
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,900
So far I've done my best to keep the world of substitution and elimination reactions

303
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,020
separate from one another, showing my best attempts at examples which strongly favor

304
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,900
one process or the other.

305
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,620
Even so, you might have already noticed that I used the exact same set of reagents to show

306
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,620
you SN1 and E1 reactions, so clearly there's a potential here for competition.

307
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,500
And the truth is that substitution and elimination reactions go together like coffee and donuts.

308
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,980
They are seldom found occurring exclusively, and they often compete with one another.

309
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,940
And the key to defining which mechanism will prevail is in the reaction conditions.

310
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,860
Now you'll recall that the Gibbs free energy equation is a function of temperature, so

311
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,140
the extent to which entropy contributes to a process's spontaneity is a function of

312
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,940
temperature.

313
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,380
Higher temperature means entropy has a greater role, and as you might expect, increasing

314
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:54,300
temperature makes the increased entropy of the elimination products more favored.

315
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,100
So if I have a reaction with competing substitution and elimination pathways, one way to tip the

316
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,380
scales in the direction I want is to use a little bit of heat.

317
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,220
For example, the reaction of methoxide with tube-romo-3-ethyl pentane forms the substitution

318
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,300
product predominantly at room temperature.

319
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,740
But there will be more of the 3-ethyl-2-pentene product forming when the reaction is run at

320
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,260
elevated temperatures.

321
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:26,540
So if we instead want to maximize the yield of the antiseptic product, 3-ethyl-1-pentene,

322
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:32,140
we can substitute a bulkier base like t-butoxide in place of the methoxide, still running

323
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,140
at higher temperatures to encourage elimination.

324
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,380
We can actually direct the double bond to the primary carbon by careful selection of

325
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,740
the base.

326
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:48,060
The strong bases favor second-order reactions, lower temperatures favor substitution, higher

327
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,460
temperatures with small strong bases favor elimination to form the Zetzev product, while

328
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:06,020
higher temperatures with bulky bases tend to favor the antisetzev or Hoffman product.

329
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,340
So today we've covered our second major class of organic reaction, eliminations.

330
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,020
We got to know Zetzev again, a Russian chemist whose epic power struggle with Markovnikov

331
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,620
at the University of Kazan in the 1870s led to much of our understanding about this class

332
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,140
of reaction.

333
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,860
We saw how elimination takes place when Lewis bases abstract beta protons instead of acting

334
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,500
as nucleophiles.

335
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,280
We looked at second-order E2 elimination reactions, in which direction takes place with a highly

336
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,860
substituted substrate or strong base.

337
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,460
We saw how a beta proton in an anticoplanar relationship to the leaving group can be abstracted,

338
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,860
causing simultaneous leaving group departure to form an alkene.

339
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,660
We also looked at E1 reactions, which take place when there is only a weak non-nucleophilic

340
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,700
base present.

341
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:07,060
These reactions progress through a carbocation intermediate, which makes them subject to rearrangements.

342
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,220
We took a look at how the strength of the base dictates the order of the reaction.

343
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,180
Strong bases for second-order, weaker bases for first-order.

344
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,740
We saw how bulky bases combined with more substituted beta carbons can lead to a situation

345
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,340
in which Zetzev's rule fails to accurately predict the major product.

346
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,880
We also briefly discussed the idea that substitution and elimination frequently compete with one

347
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,520
another in the same flask, and how certain reaction conditions, most notably the temperature,

348
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,020
can be altered to promote the desired mechanism.

349
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,580
We'll see all of these topics applied again as we begin to discuss more specific and complex

350
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,620
elimination reactions.

351
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,060
But before we can do that, we need to complete the trifecta of major organic reaction types.

352
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,420
We still have to consider addition reactions, in which alkenes and alkynes can give up,

353
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,300
some are all of their pi bonds, to be converted into a host of useful compounds, from vinyl

354
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,040
chlorides used to make plastics to the margarine that you put on your toast this morning.

355
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,600
I'll see you then.
