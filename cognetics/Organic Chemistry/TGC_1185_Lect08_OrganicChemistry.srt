1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,280
In 1928, a Scottish chemist by the name of Alexander Fleming noticed something strange

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,240
in his laboratory.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,480
He saw that a culture plate containing Staphylococcus bacteria had been left open overnight

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,800
and had been contaminated by mold.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,720
Now, we can all thank Fleming for his keen powers of observation, as rather than simply

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,600
throw the plate away, he decided to examine it.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,720
What Fleming saw was that the mold had produced a zone of inhibition around itself.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Clearly, the mold was producing and excreting something which was protecting its biospace

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,920
from the Staphylococcus.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,720
So Fleming cultured the mold and determined that it was the presence of a bacterium called

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,120
Penicillium Rubens, which inhibited the growth of that Staphylococcus.

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,840
Now, he grew up a culture of that Penicillium Rubens, filtered the broth of that culture

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,000
and dubbed that filtrate Penicillin.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,440
The age of modern antibiotic discovery had begun.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,520
Now, it wasn't long before it was discovered that Penicillin was safe for human injection

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,120
or ingestion, and that its antibacterial properties remained intact in the bloodstream of humans.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,840
And by World War II, this drug was being mass produced for use in protecting injured

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,360
soldiers from infection.

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,960
In 1945, its structure was determined by noted British x-ray crystallographer and Nobel

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680
laureate Dorothy Hodgkin.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,880
The floodgates of mass production were opened in 1957, when John C. Sheehan completed the

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,280
first total synthesis of Penicillin at MIT.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,600
Now, since the discovery of Penicillin, its characterization in mass production, thousands

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,560
of antibiotic compounds have been discovered and put into use for medical purposes all

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
around the world.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,480
But it all started with a botched experiment in the basement of St. Mary's Hospital in

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
1928.

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,360
Now, there's no doubt in my mind that all of our lives have been touched by an antibiotic

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,120
in some way or another.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,840
And by the end of today's lecture, I hope you'll have a new perspective on exactly

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,600
how Penicillin, the seminal antibiotic compound, functions at the molecular level.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Let's get started.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,240
Previously, we discussed linear and branched alkanes, in which the connectivity of carbon

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,960
atoms in these hydrocarbons leads to millions of possible geometric isomers.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,680
But we left out one obvious type of connectivity, cyclization.

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
In light of the fact that the carbon can bond so well to itself, you might have already

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,320
asked yourself the question, can a chain of atoms turn back on itself and create a cyclic

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,840
chain?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,640
The answer is not only yes, but frequently.

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,800
We see these cyclic chains in a variety of organic compounds, from medicines to explosives.

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Today we're going to focus on the structure of cyclic hydrocarbons.

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,600
So let's get started by examining the simplest possible cyclic hydrocarbon, one with three

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,560
carbon atoms.

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,760
And don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity of this structure.

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,280
This compound has found uses as a starting material in many organic syntheses, as well

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,920
as medical applications as an anesthetic.

47
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
So this deceptively simple molecular structure belongs to a very powerful and versatile organic

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
compound.

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:41,000
If we start by taking a look at the linear cousin of our cyclic three-membered compound,

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,960
propane, what we want to do is cyclize this compound.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,280
So I'm going to turn the carbon-carbon bonds in such a way that I can bring it together

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,440
and form my new cyclic compound with three carbon atoms.

53
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Now cyclizing this compound, we can see that we have to bond the two terminal atoms together,

54
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,880
which has several consequences.

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,640
First, the terminal carbon atoms must each give up a hydrogen to make space available

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,800
for the cyclizing bond.

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:16,960
Now this means that the generic formula for my cyclic alkane is CnH2n compared to CnH2n

58
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,680
plus 2 as in its analogous linear hydrocarbon.

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,720
Next I want you to notice that even though all the carbons are sp3 hybridized, and so

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,360
they should have free rotation, that they in fact do not.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,980
This ring structure prohibits the carbon-carbon bond axis from rotating.

62
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,500
So this lends a new type of isomerism, one in which the side of the ring to which a substituent

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,620
is attached makes a difference.

64
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,020
See when they're placed on the same side of the ring, we have to use the term cis to

65
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,940
describe their relationship, whereas when they're placed on opposite sides of the ring

66
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,900
like this, we have to use the term trans.

67
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,260
Now the IUPAC system of nomenclature for cycloalkanes is very similar to that for linear alkanes

68
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,260
with just a few basic modifications.

69
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,620
First the root name is given the prefix cyclo, as an indication that the parent chain is

70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,380
in fact cyclic.

71
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,780
So our three-membered ring depicted here would be named cyclo-propane.

72
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:26,500
Similarly, rings of increasing size would be named cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane.

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,660
Our next consideration is that those cyclic alkanes with a single substituent don't require

74
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,020
a number to give that substituent its location on the ring, and this of course stems from

75
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,320
the fact that all carbons on any unsubstituted ring are equivalent.

76
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,580
So we would name this molecule methylcyclobutane.

77
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,440
Now when two identical substituents are bonded to the ring, we designate their locations

78
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,820
using one as the first and then proceeding around the ring in a manner which gives the

79
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,220
lowest second number to the other substituent.

80
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:07,540
For example, we begin by naming this compound 1-3-dimethylcyclobutane.

81
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,340
Now when two or more different substituents are present, we number the ring atoms, starting

82
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,580
with a substituent which comes first alphabetically, and then proceed around the ring in a direction

83
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,420
leading to the lowest possible substituent numbers.

84
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:30,020
For example, we would name this compound 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclobutane.

85
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,340
But there's more to this structure.

86
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,900
Because the carbon-carbon bonds can no longer freely rotate, placing my two substituents

87
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,500
on the same side of the ring produces an isomer which is distinct from that when I place

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,660
substituents on opposite sides of the ring.

89
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,060
And again, to distinguish the isomers, we have to name them cis for the same side and

90
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,020
trans for the opposite sides.

91
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,100
And I'm sure that you've also wondered about our discussion on chirality.

92
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,180
Can such molecules have a chiral center which must be ranked by the Conningold pre-log convention

93
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,620
and given R and S designations?

94
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,500
Well, absolutely.

95
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,300
So let's try working with cyclic compounds which don't contain a mirror plane like the

96
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,340
1-3-dimethylcyclobutane example.

97
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,420
How about 1-2-dimethylcyclobutane?

98
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,860
Now in this case, the cis isomer has equal and opposite chiral centers, which makes it

99
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,980
superimposable with its own mirror image.

100
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,340
This means it's a mesocompound.

101
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,060
In other words, the chiral centers are equal and opposite.

102
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,940
But the trans isomer doesn't meet this requirement.

103
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:42,020
The non-canceling chiral centers on trans 1-2-dimethylcyclobutane means that this compound is expected

104
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:53,180
to exist as a set of enantiomers, RR and SS, each of which is distinct from the other.

105
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,900
In addition to new nomenclature and isomerism, small cyclic alkanes, like those containing

106
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,300
three to ten atoms, come with another consideration, and this affects their reactivity.

107
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,660
You'll notice that in cyclopropane, the carbon-carbon bonds must be 60 degrees since the three atoms

108
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,380
are necessarily coplanar, yet we already know that sp3 carbons ideally form bond angles

109
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,620
of 109.5 degrees.

110
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,380
Now the fact that the ring structure forces bond angles into suboptimal geometries is

111
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,940
known as angle strain.

112
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,940
We sometimes also call this bier strain.

113
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,900
It's named for a notable chemist and a Nobel Prize winner, Adolf von Beyer, who first proposed

114
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,500
the concept.

115
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,820
Now also, if I turn cyclopropane on its side and produce a Newman projection along one

116
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,620
of the carbon-carbon bonds, it also becomes clear that all the substituents of this cyclic

117
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,740
compound are locked in an eclipsed conformation, and the inability to achieve a staggered conformation

118
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,700
is referred to as torsional strain.

119
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,620
When we combine these two forms of strain, the angle and the torsional, we get an overall

120
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,420
measure of instability known as ring strain.

121
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,740
It's the total energetic cost of having CH2 groups forced into the geometry dictated

122
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,580
by the ring, as opposed to freely rotating CH2 groups as you would have in a hypothetical

123
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,020
linear alkane.

124
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,940
So let's consider the conformation in ring strains associated with a few small cycloalkanes.

125
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,380
Cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane.

126
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,260
First, imagine that I could somehow create a linear alkane with no end.

127
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,980
It could, in theory, achieve perfect 109.5 degree bond angles throughout, and a perfectly

128
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,820
staggered conformation for all substituents, which in this case are hydrogens.

129
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,060
If such a molecule existed, I could determine its free energy and use that as my reference

130
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,940
point for a perfect ring strain free hydrocarbon.

131
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:09,940
Now let's pit each of our cycloalkanes against this ideal alkane and see how they do.

132
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,420
Cyclopropane has only three ring atoms, and since three points define a plane, these atoms

133
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,940
are locked in a planar arrangement.

134
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:23,500
That results in 60 degree bond angles and 0 degree substituent dihedral.

135
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,900
These two factors combined lead to a ring strain value of 115 kilojoules per mole.

136
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,460
Now normalizing this to the number of CH2 groups in the molecule gives me 38.3 kilojoules

137
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,740
per CH2.

138
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,300
Cycloputane, on the other hand, has four ring atoms.

139
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,580
So looking down on the ring from above, we might estimate that its bond angles are exactly

140
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,100
90 degrees.

141
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,900
But we'd be wrong.

142
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,700
A 90 degree bond angle would require 0 degree substituent dihedral angles.

143
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,820
And unlike cyclopropane, cycloputane can twist or pucker just slightly in an attempt to remove

144
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,300
that torsional strain, even though that increases angle strain in the process.

145
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,500
So this results in a slightly puckered conformation in which all ring atom bond angles are about

146
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,460
88 degrees and all substituent dihedral are about 20 degrees.

147
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,700
This is slightly better than cyclopropane, but it's still a far cry from our ideal geometry.

148
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,980
So the total ring strain in cycloputane is about 110 kilojoules per mole, which corresponds

149
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,620
to 27.6 kilojoules per CH2.

150
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,260
Now when we get to cyclopentane, we're starting to get close to ideal bond angles, but we're

151
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,940
not quite there.

152
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,660
A flat 5-membered ring would have angles of about 108 degrees, but remember those eclipsing

153
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:56,180
interactions cause cyclopentane to pucker in very much the same way cycloputane does.

154
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,980
Now in its most stable conformation, four atoms are nearly coplanar and a fifth atom

155
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,860
is raised out of the approximate plane defined by the other four.

156
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,980
This leads to an arrangement commonly called the envelope conformation for cyclopentane.

157
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,340
This is because tracing out the surface created by the atoms leads to a shape that reminds

158
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,340
us of an open envelope.

159
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,340
So average carbon-carbon bond angles and dihedral angles in cyclopentane are beginning to approach

160
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,580
ideal values, but they're not quite there yet.

161
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,300
So there's still going to be some ring strain associated with this motif, but it's going

162
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,220
to be significantly reduced compared to cycloputane.

163
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,180
In fact, cyclopentane has a total ring strain of 27.2 kilojoules per mole, or only about

164
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,220
5.4 kilojoules per CH2.

165
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,100
Now our next example is cyclohexane.

166
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,340
And when we reach a cyclic hydrocarbon of six atoms, something special happens.

167
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:01,380
I can produce a conformation in which I have four coplanar atoms, one atom rising up above

168
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,940
the plane and one atom falling down below the plane.

169
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,940
We call this the chair conformation because we can imagine it as a lounge chair with a

170
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,300
headrest and footrest.

171
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,540
The chair conformation of cyclohexane produces a ring with 109.5 degree bond angles throughout

172
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,420
and ideal 60 degree bond dihedral angles among all of its substituents.

173
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,620
So with cyclohexane, we've come full circle as it were, to a situation in which there's

174
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,300
essentially no energetic penalty for ring formation.

175
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,660
So chair cyclohexane's ring strain is effectively 0 kilojoules per mole, which naturally leads

176
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,860
to 0 kilojoules per CH2.

177
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,460
So it might seem on casual observation that once we've passed the six carbon mark, we've

178
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,180
achieved the necessary flexibility to overcome any energetic penalties incurred by the act

179
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,900
of ring closure.

180
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,380
Organic chemists however rarely observe things casually and detailed consideration shows

181
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,980
that this is not the case.

182
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,420
Now construction of a model of cyclohexane shows pretty clearly that the addition of

183
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,940
a seventh atom to the ring creates a geometric problem, one in which bond angles of the ring

184
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,740
carbon atoms can no longer be optimized while also avoiding eclipsing interactions among

185
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,100
its substituents.

186
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,620
And this of course leads to a less stable cyclic alkane.

187
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,820
So just as three, four, and five membered rings have systematically decreasing ring

188
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,780
strain, seven, eight, and nine membered rings also have increasing ring strain associated

189
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,620
with them.

190
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,700
Even with the addition of more atoms and therefore more conformational flexibility, it's impossible

191
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,700
to produce the unique harmony of 109.5 degree bond angles and completely staggered substituent

192
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,620
relationships in cyclohexane.

193
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,940
In other words, the virtually non-existent ring strain of cyclohexane, and therefore

194
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,820
its unusual stability, cannot be recreated with any other number of ring atoms, up to

195
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,020
and including 16 carbons.

196
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,100
So what does all this have to do with the action of penicillin?

197
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,260
Well, penicillin works by inhibiting an essential enzyme called transpepsidase.

198
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,500
Now transpepsidase is used by certain types of pathogenic bacteria to build their cell

199
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,060
walls.

200
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,340
But when a molecule of penicillin interacts with the enzyme, a four-membered ring called

201
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,900
a lactam ring, which contains a nitrogen, so it's not just four carbons, but that nitrogen

202
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,060
is also sp3 hybridized, so it's subject to much of the same ring strain as a cyclobutane

203
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,060
would be.

204
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,900
Now that ring opens as it reacts with the enzyme's active site, and that active site

205
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,620
is the region where the cell wall reinforcing bonds are normally made.

206
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,180
So by bonding to the enzyme, penicillin chemically modifies the active site, causing the enzyme

207
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,180
to malfunction.

208
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,220
And it can do this with remarkable efficiency, because the formation of the new bond to the

209
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,040
enzyme is energetically driven by the opening of the four-membered lactam ring.

210
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,300
And this guarantees that the process proceeds with a reduction in overall free energy,

211
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,820
and therefore it's spontaneous.

212
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:24,420
So we just saw how a strained ring of sp3 atoms can give a molecule powerful chemistry.

213
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,820
But lack of strain can be every bit as important of a feature in a biologically relevant molecule.

214
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,420
For example, it's lack of strain which makes a cyclohexane such a pervasive motif in the

215
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,540
chemistry of life.

216
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,920
We see this structure in powerful hormones, like human sex hormones, testosterone and

217
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,620
estrogen.

218
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,620
We see it in the antibiotic drug Tobromycin, and in the metabolite, anacetol, which can

219
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,180
be modified to make chemicals with varied uses ranging from explosives to investigational

220
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,440
anti-cancer drugs.

221
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,620
So this ubiquity and versatility that makes cyclohexane the gold standard of cyclic alkanes

222
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,740
in any organic chemistry course.

223
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,380
And ours is not going to be an exception.

224
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,580
So let's take a little bit of time now and explore cyclohexane's conformational behavior

225
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
just a bit.

226
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,700
Okay, so here's a cyclohexane molecule in the chair conformation.

227
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Now you can see that I've got my forcoplanar atoms, I have my headrest, and I have my footrest.

228
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:31,940
Now I can approximate this ring of carbon atoms with a circle if I tilt the molecule slightly.

229
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,460
When I do this, you can see that there are two distinct substituent positions, one above

230
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,620
and below the ring, and another which runs around the perimeter of the ring.

231
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,220
And since these positions are distinct from one another, we can give them special names.

232
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,060
We call them axial.

233
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,540
If they're up and down, we call them equatorial if they're along the perimeter.

234
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,140
But molecules aren't static entities.

235
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,060
They're bonds vibrate and twist under the influence of thermal energy.

236
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,540
And because of this, cyclohexane's capable of a remarkable transformation known as a

237
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
ring flip.

238
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,860
Now when a ring flip takes place, the headrest and footrest of my imaginary chair are going

239
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,460
to interchange.

240
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,260
And in doing so, they'll create a second chair conformer in which all of the axial substituents

241
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,700
are now equatorial, and all of the equatorial substituents are now axial.

242
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,220
So let's take a look at this.

243
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,620
Right now I have axial, white, and equatorial, red.

244
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,580
And now I'm going to do my ring flip.

245
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,380
Remarkable transformation, isn't it?

246
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,220
All my red atoms have now become axial, all my white atoms equatorial.

247
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,900
And I can ring flip right back the way I was.

248
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Very simply.

249
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,580
No bonds are broken or formed, so this is simply a conformational change as a result

250
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,900
of bond rotation.

251
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,940
Now I did that ring flip pretty quickly.

252
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,340
So let's slow it down a little bit and explore this really important conformational change

253
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,980
a bit slower.

254
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,740
As a ring flip begins, one of the carbon atoms moves into a coplanar arrangement with the

255
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,620
four others.

256
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,820
We call this a half chair conformation.

257
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,700
And you'll notice that adopting that conformation increases the ring carbon bond angles and

258
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,820
also creates new eclipsing interactions.

259
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,660
So this is a very high energy state, and in fact it represents a transition state between

260
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,900
the chair conformation and the intermediate for our ring flip process called the twist

261
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,900
boat.

262
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,180
In a twist boat conformation, the foot rest of my original chair is now level with my

263
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,660
head rest.

264
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,500
But there's a slight twist to the structure which gives it its name.

265
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,940
Now recovering the ideal bond angles within the ring to form a boat conformation means

266
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,860
that I have to create some eclipsing interactions between certain substituents, and the ring

267
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,180
flip tries to attenuate these by twisting ever so slightly.

268
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,980
So this is the boat conformation.

269
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,460
It represents a transition state between the two different twist boat intermediates.

270
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,340
Now the ring flip completes with the twist boat passing again through the half chair

271
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,660
transition state on its way to the alternate chair conformation.

272
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,540
And generally speaking, although conformers like the twist boat do exist, they have a

273
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,220
much higher energy than the chair conformation.

274
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,300
So chemists tend to model cyclohexane conformational equilibria as two state systems with only

275
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,460
one chair or the other being possible.

276
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,220
So we're going to make this assumption ourselves in many cases.

277
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,660
Now you may find that somewhat uninteresting at the moment because all of the substituents

278
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,740
are the same.

279
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,740
They're all hydrogens.

280
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,820
But what happens if we're dealing with a substituted cyclohexane molecule with various

281
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,380
groups attached to the ring?

282
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,720
At this point, the ring flip becomes very, very important conformational change because

283
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,060
it will alter the location of that substituent from an axial to an equatorial or back again.

284
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,700
So let's keep our discussion as simple as possible and focus on the conformational behavior

285
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,180
of a very simple substituted cyclohexane.

286
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,660
This is methylcyclohexane.

287
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,660
Now as you can imagine, a methyl group is much larger than a hydrogen.

288
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,660
So we expect that this methyl substituent, which I've marked in red, will want to take

289
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,380
up a position which gives it the largest volume of free space.

290
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,620
So if I draw a cyclohexane in the chair conformation that looks like this with its methyl group

291
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:36,140
in an axial position, is this really the best representation of the molecule?

292
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,860
The way that I've constructed this, the methyl group is close in space to two other hydrogens.

293
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,940
With the physical collisions of these larger groups with one another, we call one-three

294
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,220
diaxial interactions because the influencing substituents are on positions of the ring,

295
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,100
which would be one and three if we were labeling it as disubstituted.

296
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:01,380
In the case of methylcyclohexane, the diaxial interactions among these groups can be relieved

297
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,460
by a ring flip.

298
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,140
Notice that the ring flip places my larger methyl group in the equatorial position and

299
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,620
in the case of methylcyclohexane, having it out here where there's more space, lowers

300
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:19,260
its energy by about seven and a half kilojoules per mole, which corresponds to a 20 to 1 excess

301
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:26,220
of the equatorial conformer over the axial conformer.

302
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,260
So if it's my goal to approximate the chemical and physical properties of methylcyclohexane,

303
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:39,300
the best single representation that I can offer is that of the equatorial conformer.

304
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,020
Now you might have noticed in my previous example that the cyclohexane ring on testosterone

305
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,460
is not an isolated ring structure, but rather it's part of a larger network of rings, all

306
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,180
of which are bonded together in a very specific geometry.

307
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,300
So when two carbon or two hydrocarbon rings share one or more atoms, we call them bicyclic

308
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:05,820
systems and by extension we might call a molecule like the testosterone tetracyclic molecule

309
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,660
because it actually has four rings, each of which shares atoms with others.

310
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,940
Now today I'd like to show you just the most basic bicyclic systems in detail and show

311
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,300
you how we name them and how their connectivity can have a profound influence on their geometry

312
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:26,580
and therefore their behavior.

313
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,180
So let's begin by considering the different types of bicyclic structures.

314
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,380
There are actually three that we'll talk about today.

315
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,860
The first is sphero.

316
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,300
We define a sphero bicyclic structure as one which contains a single common carbon.

317
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,700
So here I have what we can view as two six-membered rings which are being conjoined by a single

318
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,860
atom that they share in common.

319
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,660
An example of this is a molecule cannabis spiran, also called cannabis spirone, which

320
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,660
is found in marijuana plants.

321
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:05,340
We can see very clearly that there is a sphero carbon here which creates this bicyclic motif.

322
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,180
Now the second type is a fused bicyclic and my example here is a molecule called decolin.

323
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,660
These fused bicyclics contain two adjacent carbons which fuse the rings together and

324
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,980
when this happens we call them bridgehead carbons.

325
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,020
So here I have two common carbons directly bonded to one another.

326
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,740
When this happens we call it a fused ring and a classic example of a fused system is

327
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,660
again our testosterone molecule.

328
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,300
We can see the fused motif right here.

329
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,900
Finally there's a third way to combine two rings and that is in a bridged motif.

330
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,940
And in the bridged motif we have two non-adjacent bridgehead carbons.

331
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,020
So in this case my two bridgehead carbons are not bonded to one another but are connected

332
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,580
through other atoms on all sides.

333
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,940
Example of this is the familiar molecule camphor.

334
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,100
You can see the motif right there.

335
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,940
So let's take a moment and think about how chemists actually think about bicyclics.

336
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,460
We call these structures bicyclic because we can create them mentally by combining two

337
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,020
rings together.

338
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,800
Now this is not how they're actually synthesized but rather this is how we think about them

339
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,860
from a structural perspective.

340
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,940
So we're not going to do a reaction here but I am going to show you what happens when we

341
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,700
put two rings together in our minds.

342
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,420
For this example I'm going to use five-membered rings.

343
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,940
The first example I bring my five-membered rings together and combine them at a single

344
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,620
common atom.

345
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,220
So that single bridgehead carbon is a spiro compound.

346
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,540
If I take my two five-membered rings and combine them at adjacent carbon atoms I now

347
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,980
have a fused system.

348
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,260
And again if I take my two rings and conjoin them at non-adjacent atoms I have what we

349
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,060
would call bridged.

350
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,180
So this is the way that we think about these kinds of systems.

351
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,240
Finally of course we need to know how to name them.

352
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,380
So if we know how we think about them naturally the next task at hand is to figure out how

353
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,900
to tell other people about them.

354
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,380
So we name these compounds using a system that is very akin to other IUPAC names but

355
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,140
we have a few extra considerations here.

356
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,860
For example in the spiro compound that I've just created I need to communicate how many

357
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,540
carbons are present in all of the bridges within the molecule.

358
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,940
So I have a bridge here which consists of four carbon atoms.

359
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,060
And I have a second bridge which also consists of four carbon atoms.

360
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,700
So my goal is to tell my reader that I have two bridges of four connected through a spiro

361
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,180
carbon.

362
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,100
So I start by naming my compound a spiro compound.

363
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:46,340
And then in brackets I indicate the size of each bridge separated by a period.

364
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,580
Finally I count all of the atoms within the molecule and use that to generate the final

365
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
name.

366
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:58,460
So in this case I have nine atoms in the total molecule meaning this is a spiro, four, four,

367
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
no name.

368
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,420
In the case of a fused bicyclic I have a bridge of three in my example here.

369
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,500
I have a second bridge of three and I have two directly connected bridgehead carbons

370
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,980
which can be thought of as a bridge of zero.

371
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,620
So to distinguish this system from the spiro I call it a bicyclo and I give the length

372
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,060
of all three bridges even though one of them is zero.

373
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,460
So this compound is a bicyclo 330.

374
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,540
And finally counting all of the atoms within the molecule I can get the root of the name

375
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:39,020
this is a bicyclo 330 octane molecule.

376
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,340
Alright now let's name our bridge compound.

377
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,660
We'll do exactly what we did with the fused.

378
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:52,100
We have a bridge of two, another bridge of two, and now a bridge of one.

379
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,940
So I'm going to call this also a bicyclo system because it, just like the fused, has two bridgehead

380
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,780
carbons.

381
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:03,420
What the distinction here is that I don't have any zeros in my brackets.

382
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:10,020
So this bicyclo 2, 2, 1 compound clearly has to be bridged, it's not fused.

383
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,700
And finally I do exactly what I've done for my other two which is I take an inventory

384
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,860
of the total number of atoms within that scaffold.

385
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:26,860
This is a bicyclo 2, 2, 1 heptane molecule.

386
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,180
So in this lecture we discussed the general formula of cyclic alkanes and how closing

387
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:38,780
a loop of carbons removes two hydrogens and gives us the general formula CnH2n.

388
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:43,420
We discussed nomenclature of this new class of hydrocarbons and we also touched on how

389
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,420
cyclization creates new geometric relationships among hydrogens and substituents known as

390
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,780
cis and trans.

391
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,940
We covered the phenomenon of ring strain, a combination of the two factors of angle

392
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,860
strain and torsional strain.

393
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,500
We saw how three, four and five-membered rings are unable to fully relieve this strain, making

394
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,180
them more unstable than their normal chain counterparts.

395
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,160
And we also noted that although more stable than very small cycloalkanes, rings of seven

396
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,380
atoms and more are also unable to achieve zero ring strain.

397
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,300
We then met cyclohexane, a very special cyclic hydrocarbon with virtually no ring strain

398
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,780
at all.

399
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,860
And we saw how its chair conformation can interconvert between two different conformers

400
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,780
which interchange axial and equatorial substituents.

401
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,460
We also considered how the size of substituents on substituted cyclohexanes can affect the

402
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,500
equilibrium between the two chair conformers, with larger groups pushing the equilibrium

403
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,180
in favor of their equatorial conformers.

404
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,780
Finally, we looked and named a few bicyclic hydrocarbons.

405
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:00,180
We saw how spirobicyclics contain two rings conjoined at a single carbon atom, fused bicyclics

406
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:07,660
share adjacent bridgeheads, and how bridged bicyclics share non-adjacent bridgeheads.

407
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,860
Along the way, we also saw how a laboratory error in an English basement in 1928 ultimately

408
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,260
led decades later to the discovery of the reaction between penicillin and transpepsinase.

409
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,980
And it's this reaction which gives this history-altering drug its antibiotic properties.

410
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,140
And it's our understanding of this reaction, which gave birth to a whole class of antibiotics.

411
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,620
And it's all driven by the energy released when a strain ring opens.

412
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,500
Next time, we're going to turn our attention back to linear and branched hydrocarbons,

413
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,020
but we're going to explore the effects of the presence pi bonds.

414
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,620
I'll see you then.
