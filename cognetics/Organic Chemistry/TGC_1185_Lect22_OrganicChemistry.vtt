00:00.000 --> 00:18.280
In 1815, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history took place at Mount Tambora

00:18.280 --> 00:20.480
in Indonesia.

00:20.480 --> 00:25.480
This colossal volcanic eruption ejected an unfathomable amount of volcanic ash and debris

00:25.480 --> 00:30.560
into the atmosphere, blocking out a significant fraction of the sunlight reaching the Earth's

00:30.560 --> 00:31.560
surface.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.800
This sent parts of the world into a chill from which they did not awaken until the following

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
year.

00:36.800 --> 00:44.400
In the middle of the year of 1816, this cloud drifted over Western Europe, leading to what

00:44.400 --> 00:51.160
is sometimes referred to as the year without a summer, which brought a devastating famine.

00:51.160 --> 00:55.920
The result of this was a sustenance crisis, the likes of which the Western world has not

00:55.920 --> 01:00.520
seen in the 200 years since.

01:00.520 --> 01:05.720
Particularly hard hit in this crisis was the nation of Germany, where food riots, demonstrations,

01:05.720 --> 01:08.640
and looting were commonplace that year.

01:08.640 --> 01:14.080
One can only imagine how suddenly an incomprehensibly difficult life must have become for the people

01:14.080 --> 01:19.200
of Europe as this crisis played itself out.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.880
One of those people was a 13-year-old boy by the name of Justice Liebig.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.080
Many historians believe that his traumatic event taking place at such a formative age

01:30.080 --> 01:35.320
so shook this young man's faith in Mother Nature to provide that he dedicated his life

01:35.320 --> 01:39.520
later to researching agricultural chemistry.

01:39.520 --> 01:44.440
His motivations aside, it's undeniable that Liebig's contributions to the field of chemistry

01:44.440 --> 01:49.320
in the decades following the year without a summer opened up a whole new world of chemicals

01:49.320 --> 01:50.720
to study.

01:50.720 --> 01:57.360
Specifically, those chemicals involved in the biology of plants.

01:57.360 --> 02:03.240
Liebig earned his doctorate in 1822 at the University of Erlangen in Bavaria.

02:03.240 --> 02:08.560
After that, in his laboratory in GieÃŸen, Germany, and later Munich, Liebig spent much of his

02:08.560 --> 02:13.800
career characterizing and synthesizing a broad range of biologically relevant compounds

02:13.800 --> 02:15.960
from plants.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.960
So prolific was his work that he's often cited as the father of agricultural chemistry,

02:20.960 --> 02:23.360
a well-deserved acknowledgement.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.520
Today, we will swing a pretty wide turn in our study of organic chemistry.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.840
We're going to move from the realm of the harsh reaction conditions and unfamiliar materials

02:32.840 --> 02:38.800
of our synthesis lectures into a more biologically oriented look at organic chemistry, and we're

02:38.800 --> 02:44.520
going to start with one of the classes of compounds that Liebig himself studied.

02:44.520 --> 02:51.500
Now, from the sweet ingredient of sodas like this sugar to the fibrous particles making

02:51.500 --> 02:58.040
up this wood to the tough shell of crabs and lobsters, all the members of this extraordinarily

02:58.040 --> 03:02.720
diverse family of materials have one thing in common.

03:02.720 --> 03:10.200
They're all made up of the same general class of organic compounds, carbohydrates.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.760
In modern culture, we're trained to think of carbohydrates as not much more than a

03:13.760 --> 03:19.280
dietary source of calories, but we're about to see that carbohydrates make up not only

03:19.280 --> 03:25.720
small molecules of caloric value, but also other familiar materials like clothing, building

03:25.720 --> 03:29.640
materials, joint supplements, and even body armor.

03:29.640 --> 03:34.120
In short, we will take a look at these and other biologically important materials crafted

03:34.120 --> 03:40.840
from carbohydrates from the perspective of an organic chemist.

03:40.840 --> 03:46.160
Before we break into the exciting and complex world of materials fashioned from carbohydrates,

03:46.160 --> 03:49.800
let's begin by defining a carbohydrate.

03:49.800 --> 03:55.240
This term is sometimes confused by students with the similar sounding hydrocarbons that

03:55.240 --> 03:57.720
we encountered earlier in our course.

03:57.720 --> 04:03.360
The distinction here is that the hydro of hydrocarbons refers to just hydrogen, while

04:03.360 --> 04:10.880
the hydrate of carbohydrates refers not just to hydrogen, but to water, which includes

04:10.880 --> 04:14.400
one half molar equivalent of oxygen.

04:14.400 --> 04:20.000
So as I mentioned before, carbohydrate refers to a compound composed of carbon and water

04:20.000 --> 04:21.400
in equal parts.

04:21.400 --> 04:27.240
So they'll have a generic formula of CnH2oN.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.320
Now we've come pretty close to carbohydrates before with some of the compounds that we've

04:31.320 --> 04:33.640
looked at previously.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.960
Take the example of glycerol.

04:35.960 --> 04:40.920
Now glycerol's formula is C3H8O3.

04:40.920 --> 04:45.120
So it's got a little bit too much hydrogen in the formula to meet our requirements to

04:45.120 --> 04:48.640
be classified as a carbohydrate.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.440
But I can modify my glycerol structure slightly to make a carbohydrate.

04:53.440 --> 04:59.520
So let's bring up two copies of glycerol here and modify them to create a carbohydrate.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.760
I've got to get rid of two hydrogens.

05:01.760 --> 05:08.120
So let's start by removing two hydrogens from the end of my glycerol molecule.

05:08.120 --> 05:17.240
When I do this, I can insert a carbon-oxygen double bond, creating C3H6O3, a carbohydrate.

05:17.240 --> 05:21.920
But I can also remove two hydrogens from the center.

05:21.920 --> 05:30.360
If I remove two hydrogens from an interior motif here, I get C3H6O3, also a carbohydrate.

05:30.360 --> 05:36.160
But I've changed the names to glyceraldehyde and glycerone in my two structures.

05:36.160 --> 05:41.920
Glyceraldehyde because the carbonyl is a terminal position like it would be in an aldehyde.

05:41.920 --> 05:47.120
Glycerone because the carbonyl is in an interior carbon just as it would be if these groups

05:47.120 --> 05:50.240
were aliphatic and I were dealing with a ketone.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.560
So what I've done here is created three different classes of compounds.

05:54.560 --> 06:00.840
Glycerol would be considered a sugar alcohol, whereas my glyceraldehyde and glycerone are

06:00.840 --> 06:07.600
sugars which we call individually aldoses and ketoses, referring to whether the carbonyl

06:07.600 --> 06:13.520
is internal or external.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.760
Now I've mentioned Alexander Butlerov before, most notably as the mentor of two of the most

06:18.760 --> 06:25.840
revered and mutually repulsed chemists of the 19th century, Markovnikov and Zetsev.

06:25.840 --> 06:30.040
And just as he's contributed to many other fields, the history of carbohydrate chemistry

06:30.040 --> 06:32.720
would not be the same without him.

06:32.720 --> 06:38.840
In 1861 Butlerov published a paper entitled, Formation of a Sugar-like Substance, in which

06:38.840 --> 06:43.400
he detailed a synthesis using formaldehyde and a base to form what he believed to be

06:43.400 --> 06:45.840
simple sugars.

06:45.840 --> 06:51.120
He named his new substance Formos, for the formaldehyde starting material he used and

06:51.120 --> 06:55.760
the class of compounds which he believed he created, sugars.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.760
In a sense Butlerov was right, but he created not just one sugar, but a mixture of sugars

07:00.760 --> 07:07.560
which interconverted through a series of aldol reactions, forming a concoction of carbohydrates.

07:07.560 --> 07:14.000
Now in Butlerov's day, a quick taste would be all it took to make his observations publication-worthy.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.440
Today of course we cringe at the idea of tasting anything prepared in the lab, and we require

07:18.440 --> 07:24.960
a bit more detailed analysis to identify the structures of the compounds that we make.

07:24.960 --> 07:29.040
Butlerov was unable to surmise that there are many, many carbohydrates which can be

07:29.040 --> 07:33.760
produced and isolated from one another, using techniques more modern to the science of organic

07:33.760 --> 07:36.080
chemistry.

07:36.080 --> 07:40.400
These carbohydrates are broadly classified by the number of sugar molecules which we

07:40.400 --> 07:43.080
combine to make them up.

07:43.080 --> 07:48.120
Actually an individual simple sugar molecule can be connected to another one, in several

07:48.120 --> 07:52.040
ways which produce chains of varying lengths and geometries.

07:52.040 --> 07:57.600
And these larger structures, built of simple sugars, are still referred to as carbohydrates

07:57.600 --> 08:02.120
but we call them complex carbohydrates, and these are classified based on their lengths

08:02.120 --> 08:03.120
and geometries.

08:03.120 --> 08:08.000
But we're getting ahead of ourselves, let's step back and consider the most fundamental

08:08.000 --> 08:10.600
of carbohydrates first.

08:10.600 --> 08:14.600
There are those which cannot be hydrolyzed into simpler carbohydrates, and those are

08:14.600 --> 08:17.040
the ones we want to deal with now.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.880
We call these kinds of sugars monosaccharides.

08:20.880 --> 08:26.760
When two such units are joined together in a condensation reaction, we get a disaccharide.

08:26.760 --> 08:31.600
And finally we have polysaccharides, which can have anywhere from just a few to literally

08:31.600 --> 08:36.520
thousands of condensed monosaccharide units.

08:36.520 --> 08:41.600
So let's start at the beginning, the simplest class of carbohydrates, monosaccharides.

08:41.600 --> 08:47.120
As I mentioned before, we break down these simple sugars into two major classes, aldoses

08:47.120 --> 08:49.160
and ketoses.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.160
I've prepared the structures of four different aldoses for you here, so we can see their

08:53.160 --> 08:56.480
structural similarities and differences.

08:56.480 --> 09:03.240
Now the striking structural similarity here, of course, is that we have an aldehyde carbonyl.

09:03.240 --> 09:08.040
So we call this molecule an aldotryose.

09:08.040 --> 09:13.120
Aldo indicating that we have a carbonyl at the end of the chain, triose indicating that

09:13.120 --> 09:16.880
there are three carbons in the chain.

09:16.880 --> 09:24.920
So similarly we would call this one aldotetrose, aldo for a terminal carbonyl, tetrose for

09:24.920 --> 09:27.160
four carbons in the chain.

09:27.160 --> 09:34.680
And the trend continues through aldopentose and aldohexoses and beyond.

09:34.680 --> 09:39.200
Now we use a very similar naming system for ketoses, that is when the carbonyl bond is

09:39.200 --> 09:40.200
interior.

09:40.200 --> 09:47.160
For example, this molecule would be a keto because the carbonyl bond is internal and

09:47.160 --> 09:52.840
a triose because there are three carbons, so I have a keto triose.

09:52.840 --> 10:01.240
My next example would be a keto, tetrose, and so on through the remainder, a ketopentose

10:01.240 --> 10:04.080
and a ketohexose.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.200
But defining the number of carbons in the chain and the location of the carbonyl bond

10:08.200 --> 10:13.880
in a simple sugar isn't enough to let us unambiguously identify carbohydrates.

10:13.880 --> 10:20.960
You see, all along a chain of hexoses, pentoses, tetroses, and even trios, there are one or

10:20.960 --> 10:22.480
more chiral centers.

10:22.480 --> 10:28.640
Now, particularly in the case of longer monosaccharides like hexoses, chirality can generate a large

10:28.640 --> 10:30.520
number of potential stereoisomers.

10:30.520 --> 10:37.440
Now that's why I drew my sample molecules in the previous slides in a Fischer projection.

10:37.440 --> 10:42.100
Remember a Fischer projection is created by drawing a compound so that all of the horizontally

10:42.100 --> 10:46.640
depicted bonds are coming out of the plane and all the vertical ones are falling back

10:46.640 --> 10:50.040
behind the plane.

10:50.040 --> 10:55.080
Now Fischer won his Nobel Prize in part for his characterization of the structure of glucose,

10:55.080 --> 10:59.720
and a large part of his technique for this was to use his systematic form of projection

10:59.720 --> 11:05.320
which made all of the stereochemical relationships in these complex molecules evident.

11:05.320 --> 11:11.160
So let's begin with the simplest of all carbohydrates, the triose glyceraldehyde.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.720
You can see clearly that glyceraldehyde has only one chiral center, so this will be a

11:15.720 --> 11:18.600
relatively easy puzzle to solve.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.200
As a general rule, we draw monosaccharides in a Fischer projection with the terminal

11:22.200 --> 11:26.840
carbonyl at the top and then going downward.

11:26.840 --> 11:32.720
So we can then number the carbons of the chain from top to bottom to facilitate the discussion.

11:32.720 --> 11:39.000
Now notice that only C2 of glyceraldehyde is chiral, so I can draw two enantiomers, one

11:39.000 --> 11:44.960
of which was named plus glyceraldehyde and the other minus glyceraldehyde.

11:44.960 --> 11:49.720
Now remember, this was a long time before the Kahn Engel pre-log rules had been proposed,

11:49.720 --> 11:54.360
and Fischer had only physical properties of saccharides to go on for identifying their

11:54.360 --> 11:56.200
stereochemistry.

11:56.200 --> 12:01.640
So he designated glyceraldehydes as plus and minus based on their ability to rotate a special

12:01.640 --> 12:05.560
kind of light called plane polarized light.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.880
We're going to discuss this phenomenon in detail during our spectroscopy lectures.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.720
But for now, let's just say that the plus and minus glyceraldehyde designations stand

12:13.720 --> 12:20.240
for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of that light.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.960
Now if I start with glyceraldehyde and build larger monosaccharides by adding new interior

12:24.960 --> 12:30.080
carbons to the chain, I'll call my construct a D-sugar.

12:30.080 --> 12:37.040
If instead I start with a minus glyceraldehyde, I'll have to call that construct an L-sugar.

12:37.040 --> 12:42.080
The D and L designations are again based on the molecules interaction with light, D for

12:42.080 --> 12:48.560
clockwise from dextra and L for counterclockwise from livra.

12:48.560 --> 12:55.920
For example, I can create D-erythros by inserting one new carbon into the chain of D-glyceraldehyde.

12:55.920 --> 13:00.600
I can also make a molecule of D-threous in the same way by changing the chirality of my

13:00.600 --> 13:04.760
newly inserted chiral center.

13:04.760 --> 13:09.500
So not surprisingly, the introduction of a second chiral center has led to the possibility

13:09.500 --> 13:13.300
of diastereomers for my aldotetroses.

13:13.300 --> 13:17.960
Of course, I could instead have an L configuration for the bottom chiral carbon of my fissure

13:17.960 --> 13:24.700
projection leading to the other two possible stereochemistries, L-aldotetroses, each a mere

13:24.700 --> 13:29.900
image of one of the D-aldoterroses.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.900
Now this interesting set of stereoisomers in the fissure projection combined to produce

13:33.900 --> 13:41.300
a new relationship in stereochemistry known as erythro and threoenantiomers.

13:41.300 --> 13:46.260
When aligned in a fissure projection orientation, if similar groups are on the same side as

13:46.260 --> 13:51.900
they are in erythros, then we use a prefix erythro to name that enantiomer.

13:51.900 --> 14:00.300
Conversely, if groups of interest are at opposition, we use the threo designation.

14:00.300 --> 14:05.580
As the size of the monosaccharide grows, so do the number of possible stereoisomers.

14:05.580 --> 14:10.940
And by the time we reach hexoses, there are eight stereoisomers possible for D-aldohexoses

14:10.940 --> 14:13.100
and four for D-ketohexoses.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.980
Things get out of hand pretty quickly here.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.900
Now fortunately, there are just a handful of these which tend to make appearances in

14:18.900 --> 14:20.620
natural systems.

14:20.620 --> 14:27.740
And two of the most frequent are the aldohexose known as glucose and the ketohexose known

14:27.740 --> 14:30.120
as fructose.

14:30.120 --> 14:34.200
For simplicity's sake, we'll be using just these two monosaccharides as examples as we

14:34.200 --> 14:36.100
go forward in this lecture.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.480
But keep in mind that the chemistry we're about to see can easily be applied to any

14:40.480 --> 14:44.720
of the dozens of small saccharides that can be created with just a few carbons in the

14:44.720 --> 14:48.720
chain.

14:48.720 --> 14:54.420
So far, I've drawn all the carbohydrates under investigation today as linear compounds.

14:54.420 --> 14:59.600
But you may recall from our lecture on carbonyl compounds that a carbonyl activated by acid

14:59.600 --> 15:04.360
in the presence of an alcohol forms a motif called a hemiacetal.

15:04.360 --> 15:11.160
Well, in the case of monosaccharides, we have both a carbonyl and an alcohol available to

15:11.160 --> 15:16.280
participate in this kind of chemistry intramolecularly.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.980
When this reaction takes place between the carbonyl of a carbohydrate and one of its

15:19.980 --> 15:27.040
own hydroxyl groups, a relatively stable ring of five or six atoms can sometimes form.

15:27.040 --> 15:34.120
We call these cyclic sugars furanose, in the case of a five-membered ring, and pyranose,

15:34.120 --> 15:37.000
in the case of a six-membered ring.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.820
Each of these is named for the cyclic ether which makes up their backbone.

15:42.820 --> 15:48.120
The result of this is an equilibrium interconversion between the acyclic, aldose, or ketose form

15:48.120 --> 15:54.040
and the cyclic, furanose, or pyranose form.

15:54.040 --> 15:58.440
So let's take a look again at glucose, an aldohexose with a fissure projection which

15:58.440 --> 16:00.840
looks like this.

16:00.840 --> 16:05.240
Now we see yet another reason why fissure projections are so useful.

16:05.240 --> 16:10.800
Since all of the carbon-carbon bonds are already aligned so that they curve in on each other,

16:10.800 --> 16:15.960
the cis-trans relationships of groups within the cyclic form are very easy to determine

16:15.960 --> 16:18.160
from this projection.

16:18.160 --> 16:24.440
I simply turn my fissure projection on its side to get a better look at the forming ring.

16:24.440 --> 16:30.240
For example, hydroxyls which are erythro to one another in the aldohexose will be cis

16:30.240 --> 16:35.320
to one another in the resulting pyranose.

16:35.320 --> 16:39.960
If I complete the cyclization in this fictitious orientation, I get what's commonly known as

16:39.960 --> 16:45.880
a Hayworth projection, with a planar six-membered ring, which we all know can't exist, yet

16:46.080 --> 16:50.600
we do this anyway sometimes because it so clearly shows the cis-trans relationships in

16:50.600 --> 16:53.680
the cyclic form of the sugar.

16:53.680 --> 16:58.040
Now once the ring is placed into a proper chair conformation, we see that there's still

16:58.040 --> 17:01.960
one stereochemical consideration left.

17:01.960 --> 17:07.880
Since the carbonyl is planar, the attack on that motif during cyclization can take place

17:07.880 --> 17:13.600
from either face, meaning that there are really two different enantiomers of any pyranose

17:13.800 --> 17:19.800
or pyranose sugar, which we sometimes call animers, and we designate these as alpha and

17:19.800 --> 17:23.200
beta animers.

17:23.200 --> 17:27.760
In the case of D-leucopyranose, all of the existing hydroxyl groups can be placed in

17:27.760 --> 17:31.880
the equatorial position simultaneously, so it's not much of a wonder why this sugar

17:31.880 --> 17:35.720
likes to exist as a pyranose ring, right?

17:35.720 --> 17:42.320
If the newly formed hydroxyl is in the axial position, we call this an alpha-anomer.

17:42.320 --> 17:49.320
If the new group is instead in the equatorial conformation, we have the beta-anomer.

17:49.840 --> 17:54.240
By convention, we assign the designation of C1 for the terminal carbon at the closest

17:54.240 --> 18:00.440
to the carbonyl end of the uncyclized carbohydrate and number each carbon from there sequentially.

18:00.440 --> 18:06.720
So the anomeric C1 group of glucopyranose is a crucial site for modification in both

18:06.720 --> 18:09.840
the lab and in nature.

18:09.840 --> 18:14.600
This inspection of glucopyranose reveals that the C1 is the only carbon bonded to a

18:14.600 --> 18:17.960
pair of electron withdrawing oxygen atoms.

18:17.960 --> 18:24.320
So it's the most electrophilic and most likely to participate in substitution reactions,

18:24.320 --> 18:31.320
like this very simple reaction between alpha, D, glucopyranose, and acidified methanol.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.600
This reaction generates an equilibrium mixture of both the alpha and beta-functionalized

18:37.600 --> 18:39.920
monosaccharide.

18:39.920 --> 18:45.440
When the C1 is modified this way, we call the product a glycoside, and the newly added

18:45.440 --> 18:50.160
group an eglycone.

18:50.160 --> 18:55.760
So let's take a look at a glycoside that has some historical relevance.

18:55.760 --> 19:02.760
This is a molecule called salicin, and salicin is a glycoside with anti-inflammatory properties,

19:02.800 --> 19:06.320
and it's also present in the bark of willow trees.

19:06.320 --> 19:11.040
Recent Greeks knew that chewing on the bark of a willow tree gave pain relief and alleviated

19:11.040 --> 19:14.080
headaches and joint problems.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.040
What they didn't know was that what they were doing while chewing the bark was extracting

19:18.040 --> 19:21.560
this particular compound, salicin.

19:21.560 --> 19:28.560
Now salicin consists of a glucopyranose, which is bonded to a hydroxybenzyl alcohol, a glycon.

19:28.560 --> 19:33.560
And once this compound has been ingested, the water in your bloodstream and the enzymes

19:33.560 --> 19:38.560
in your blood go at breaking this down through a hydrolysis reaction.

19:38.560 --> 19:45.060
It takes a water molecule to break that link, separating the glucopyranose from the hydroxybenzyl

19:45.060 --> 19:46.560
alcohol.

19:46.560 --> 19:52.560
Now at this point, the hydroxybenzyl alcohol is oxidized by other enzymes in your body

19:52.560 --> 19:54.560
in preparation for removing it.

19:54.560 --> 20:01.560
And in doing so, it creates salicylic acid, the same compound into which aspirin degrades

20:01.560 --> 20:07.560
to give joint pain relief, headache relief, and other beneficial properties as well.

20:07.560 --> 20:12.560
Now, all of this amazing and rich chemistry is done with a few monosaccharides and an

20:12.560 --> 20:15.560
endless library of glycones.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.060
But I believe that you were promised more.

20:18.060 --> 20:21.560
I still owe you an explanation of disaccharides and polysaccharides.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.560
So let's get started on those.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.560
Our last topic was a perfect lead into disaccharides.

20:28.560 --> 20:33.560
We looked at how glycosidic linkages conform to almost anything with an amine or alcohol

20:33.560 --> 20:36.560
group on it, really anything that's nucleophilic.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.560
And if you were really on top of your game, you might have wondered if all those other

20:39.560 --> 20:44.560
alcohol groups on the sugar might make it possible for one sugar molecule to bond to

20:44.560 --> 20:47.560
another using the same motif.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.560
Now, if you had that thought, give yourself a gold star.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.560
You are spot on.

20:53.560 --> 20:58.560
Although theoretically it's possible for any hydroxyl of one monosaccharide to form

20:58.560 --> 21:02.560
a glycosidic linkage with another, there are three arrangements which we principally

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
see in nature.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.560
And we distinguish these linkages by numbering the monosaccharide acting as the

21:08.560 --> 21:11.560
glycone with prime numbers.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.560
So check this out.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.560
Take the system 1, 1 prime, 1, 4 prime, and 1, 6 prime.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.560
These are the linkages that we most often see in nature, meaning that the C1 will

21:20.560 --> 21:26.560
link to a different oxygen from one of the carbons in the other saccharide.

21:26.560 --> 21:32.560
Now, a familiar disaccharide with this 1, 4 prime linkage is maltose.

21:32.560 --> 21:37.560
Maltose is formed by the glycosidic linkage of two glucose units through an alpha

21:37.560 --> 21:38.560
anomer.

21:38.560 --> 21:44.560
Now, here one glucose acts as the glycoside, bonding through its C1, and the other acts

21:44.560 --> 21:48.560
as the aglycone, bonding through its C4 prime.

21:48.560 --> 21:53.560
And notice that this leaves the C1 prime to interconvert between enantiomers through

21:53.560 --> 21:57.560
an equilibrium process so this disaccharide can still open and close in at least one

21:57.560 --> 21:59.560
of its rings.

21:59.560 --> 22:04.560
Maltose is most familiar as the starting material for beer, made by the hydrolysis

22:04.560 --> 22:08.560
of starches from grains in the first part of the brewing process.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.560
Much of the maltose is consumed by the yeast, which are used to brew the beer,

22:12.560 --> 22:15.560
but a small amount is retained in the beverage.

22:15.560 --> 22:19.560
So the next time you have a beer with your friends, take a sip and pronounce.

22:19.560 --> 22:25.560
That has some lovely 4-0-alpha-D-glucoparanosyl-D-glucopyranos notes.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.560
You may wind up drinking alone after that, but at least you are telling the truth.

22:30.560 --> 22:36.560
Now, the 1-6 prime linkages are less common, but they do exist in a few disaccharides.

22:36.560 --> 22:40.560
They're actually more relevant to polysaccharides, as we'll soon see.

22:40.560 --> 22:45.560
One example of this type of linkage in a disaccharide is Gentio bios,

22:45.560 --> 22:49.560
a 1-6 prime disaccharide between two glucose units.

22:49.560 --> 22:54.560
Now, by connecting to the aglycone at its 6 prime carbon, which is not part of the

22:54.560 --> 22:58.560
Pyranos ring, additional conformational flexibility is introduced,

22:58.560 --> 23:03.560
making a nice building block for branched polysaccharides.

23:03.560 --> 23:10.560
Now, a prime example of a 1-1 prime linkage is the familiar sweetening agent, sucrose.

23:10.560 --> 23:15.560
Sucrose consists of a glucose and a fructose unit linked by a bridging oxygen

23:15.560 --> 23:18.560
through one another's anomeric carbons.

23:18.560 --> 23:23.560
So, in this unusual case, both sugars are acting as glycosides for themselves

23:23.560 --> 23:26.560
and as aglycones for their bonding partner.

23:26.560 --> 23:31.560
Since both anomeric carbons are occupied by the glycosidic linkage,

23:31.560 --> 23:37.560
sucrose has no free anomeric carbon to open back up in equilibrium with the cyclic form.

23:37.560 --> 23:42.560
Now, this is important because sugars are much more prone to oxidative degradation

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
when in their acyclic forms.

23:44.560 --> 23:49.560
So, this makes sucrose much slower to oxidize than other disaccharides

23:49.560 --> 23:53.560
and therefore a popular choice for use in preserves.

24:00.560 --> 24:05.560
Polysaccharides, as you might expect from the name, are simply longer chains of sugars

24:05.560 --> 24:10.560
in which most of them are acting as both glycosides and as aglycones.

24:10.560 --> 24:15.560
Perpetuating a polymer built from monosaccharide units.

24:15.560 --> 24:20.560
Many materials with which we're familiar are made from polysaccharides.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.560
For example, cellulose in the cotton fibers in these cotton balls.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.560
It's made up almost exclusively of D-glucose units

24:28.560 --> 24:34.560
attached by beta-1-4-prime glycosidic bonds.

24:34.560 --> 24:38.560
That same material makes up about one half of the matter.

24:38.560 --> 24:43.560
That same material makes up about one half of the mass of dry wood.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.560
Cellulose combines into closely packed fibrils

24:46.560 --> 24:49.560
which interact with one another by a hydrogen bonding,

24:49.560 --> 24:54.560
forming a strong, tough, insoluble material.

24:54.560 --> 24:59.560
Now, cotton balls and lumber don't seem terribly appetizing to me as a human,

24:59.560 --> 25:03.560
but certain animal species, most notably cows and termites,

25:03.560 --> 25:06.560
have symbiotic bacteria living in their digestive tract

25:06.560 --> 25:10.560
which help them to break down the cellulose in those materials

25:10.560 --> 25:14.560
and use them as a food source.

25:14.560 --> 25:20.560
Now, by contrast, switching the beta linkage to an alpha linkage gives us amylose,

25:20.560 --> 25:25.560
a starch which curves on itself into a helix.

25:25.560 --> 25:29.560
It can be digested and used as a source of nutrition for higher order animals,

25:29.560 --> 25:35.560
even those without bacterial help or four stomachs to help break it down.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.560
Now, if we take amylose and branch it out every 30 subunits or so

25:39.560 --> 25:43.560
by cross-linking another chain at a six prime position,

25:43.560 --> 25:50.560
we get amylopectin, a water-soluble thickening agent used in cooking applications.

25:50.560 --> 25:54.560
More extensive branching of the same kind leads to glycogen,

25:54.560 --> 25:58.560
one of the human body's primary energy stores.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
If you have enough glycogen stored up in your muscles,

26:00.560 --> 26:04.560
you're just a hydrolysis reaction away from additional glucose molecules

26:04.560 --> 26:10.560
for use as energy to help you run that marathon or finish that workday.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.560
As a final example of polysaccharides,

26:13.560 --> 26:17.560
let's take a look at the remarkable armor which protects insects and arthropods

26:17.560 --> 26:20.560
from cicadas to crabs.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.560
You might find it hard to believe that the same class of materials

26:23.560 --> 26:26.560
that's used to sweeten soft drinks can also make up armor

26:26.560 --> 26:29.560
which protects sea creatures and insects from predators.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.560
But it does.

26:32.560 --> 26:36.560
Chitin, the material from which this tough exoskeleton is made,

26:36.560 --> 26:41.560
is a polymer of a glucose derivative called n-acetylglucosamine.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.560
N-acetylglucosamine is a pyranose form of glucose

26:44.560 --> 26:50.560
with an amide-functional group substituted here at the C2 position of the ring.

26:50.560 --> 26:56.560
Now, polymerize this molecule through beta-1,4-prime glycosidic bonds

26:56.560 --> 27:01.560
and you have chitin, a material so tough that once formed it can't grow with the animal.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.560
This is why crabs and some insects periodically molt,

27:05.560 --> 27:10.560
shedding their chitin armor and producing a whole new, slightly larger suit of armor

27:10.560 --> 27:13.560
once the old one's been shuffled off.

27:13.560 --> 27:17.560
But the secret to chitin's strength is not only in the glycosidic linkages,

27:17.560 --> 27:21.560
but also in the amide-functionality added to that sugar ring.

27:21.560 --> 27:27.560
Now, you can see here that when multiple strands of chitin are aligned,

27:27.560 --> 27:34.560
the aminitrogen and carbonyl from one chitin can hydrogen bond to others on a separate strand.

27:34.560 --> 27:39.560
This H bond network contributes to the remarkable strength of chitin,

27:39.560 --> 27:41.560
which protects against predation.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.560
It's also the reason that crustaceans and insects have to molt,

27:44.560 --> 27:48.560
shedding their old exoskeletons during periods of concerted growth

27:48.560 --> 27:51.560
during which a new exoskeleton is formed.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.560
Now, the toughening provided by this hydrogen bonding network

27:55.560 --> 28:00.560
can simply be turned off again by modifying the amine group of glucosamine yet again.

28:01.560 --> 28:06.560
In the body, our joint cartilage is made up partially of glucosaminoglycans,

28:06.560 --> 28:11.560
which are long polysaccharides, consisting of alternating acetyl glucosamine

28:11.560 --> 28:15.560
and another modified sugar called uronic acid.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.560
As opposed to tough and flexible chitin,

28:19.560 --> 28:24.560
glucosaminoglycans like this one are springy and lubricating

28:24.560 --> 28:28.560
because the hydrogen bonding network is disrupted by the acetyl motif,

28:28.560 --> 28:32.560
which allows one chain to slide along the other more easily.

28:32.560 --> 28:36.560
This is the reason that many believers religiously take doses of glucosamine

28:36.560 --> 28:41.560
in the hopes of limiting cartilage loss associated with arthritis.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.560
So let's sum up for the day.

28:45.560 --> 28:50.560
Today we discussed carbohydrates, a broad and diverse class of compounds

28:50.560 --> 28:55.560
with the chemical formula CNH2ON.

28:55.560 --> 29:00.560
We took a look at Fischer projections of the two main classes of simple carbohydrates,

29:00.560 --> 29:06.560
those being aldoses and ketoses, which differ by the location of their carbonyl motif.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.560
We then discussed the stereochemistry of simple carbohydrates

29:10.560 --> 29:14.560
and the concept of erythro and threoenantiomers.

29:14.560 --> 29:18.560
After that, we discussed the cyclization of simple sugars

29:18.560 --> 29:22.560
by reacting a hydroxyl with the carbonyl in an intramolecular reaction

29:22.560 --> 29:25.560
to form a hemiacetal,

29:25.560 --> 29:31.560
and how the most common of these are 5-membered furanose and 6-membered purinose rings.

29:31.560 --> 29:36.560
We also recognized that the hemiacetal carbon can have two distinct stereochemistries,

29:36.560 --> 29:40.560
leaving us to label it an anomeric carbon.

29:41.560 --> 29:45.560
We looked at how these cyclic sugars can react through their anomeric carbon

29:45.560 --> 29:51.560
to form alpha and beta glycosidic linkages to new groups called aglycones.

29:51.560 --> 29:55.560
When the aglycone is another sugar itself, we form a disaccharide,

29:55.560 --> 29:59.560
like maltose from beer or sucrose in fruit preserves.

29:59.560 --> 30:05.560
We discussed the 1,4' 1,6' and 1,1' glycosidic linkages,

30:05.560 --> 30:10.560
and how the 1,4' linkage is well suited to formation of long polymer strands.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.560
The 1,6' linkage imparts branching to such polymers,

30:14.560 --> 30:19.560
and the 1,1' linkage in sucrose prohibits its two sugar units from opening and oxidizing,

30:19.560 --> 30:25.560
making it a perfect choice for food applications because of its resistance to oxidation.

30:26.560 --> 30:31.560
Finally, we considered polysaccharides of glucopyrinose, including cellulose,

30:31.560 --> 30:35.560
which has beta glycosidic linkages, giving it tensile strength,

30:35.560 --> 30:38.560
in contrast to amylose and amylopectin,

30:38.560 --> 30:40.560
which have alpha glycosidic linkages,

30:40.560 --> 30:45.560
endowing them with a higher solubility and making them more digestible for humans.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.560
We also saw how some animals like arthropods and insects

30:49.560 --> 30:52.560
chemically modify the glucoside subunits of cellulose

30:52.560 --> 30:56.560
to form even more powerful sets of interstrand hydrogen bonds,

30:56.560 --> 31:00.560
which endow their exoskeletons with formidable physical properties.

31:01.560 --> 31:06.560
Next time, we're going to take a look at a very special Aldo pentose,

31:06.560 --> 31:13.560
ribose, and how it acts as the central piece of one of nature's most awesome molecular creations,

31:13.560 --> 31:14.560
DNA.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
I'll see you then.
