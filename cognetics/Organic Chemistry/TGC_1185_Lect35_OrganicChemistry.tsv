0	18040	Last time, we investigated the phenomenon of partitioning and how it can be exploited
18040	24000	to separate compounds based on their relative affinities for two distinct chemical environments.
24000	30000	Specifically, we looked at liquid-liquid systems and solid-liquid systems.
32000	38000	In this lecture, we're going to explore one of the most powerful separation techniques ever developed,
38000	44000	one which, when properly applied, allows us to isolate almost anything we can imagine.
44000	49000	It's also a bit near and dear to my heart because I spent two and a half years of my life
49000	53000	chained to a lab bench analyzing pharmaceutical products with one of these techniques.
53000	59000	Now, you might say that in that way, it was chromatography which inspired me to return to school for my PhD.
62000	67000	Our brief look at chromatography starts with its inventor, Mikhail Tsvet.
67000	73000	Tsvet was educated in Switzerland, where he received his PhD in 1896.
75000	81000	Shortly after this, however, he found himself in Russia, facing a similar fate to that of Zitsev,
81000	85000	whose foreign credential had nearly marginalized him in the Russian system.
86000	90000	Tsvet's non-Russian credential was not recognized by the National Establishment,
90000	97000	prompting him to undertake a second PhD program to become a functional scientist in the Russian system.
100000	104000	I can only imagine the sinking feeling he must have had when he first realized
104000	107000	that he would have to earn his PhD all over again.
108000	113000	In retrospect, however, it may have been the single greatest thing that ever happened to him,
113000	119000	since it was the topic of his second PhD which earned him immortality in the science of separation.
122000	127000	You see, Tsvet became interested in self-physiology during his first PhD program,
127000	130000	and he wanted to continue working with natural plant products,
130000	134000	trying to understand the chemistry which drives their unique biology.
135000	139000	It was during experiments with the ubiquitous plant pigment chlorophyll
139000	145000	that he made the observation which would forever change his life and the science of separations.
147000	155000	Tsvet knew that isolated chlorophyll could be easily dissolved in an organic solvent known as petroleum ether.
156000	160000	Yet, when he attempted to extract the pigments from the leaves of plants,
160000	164000	he noted that it was very difficult to dissolve in the same solvent.
165000	170000	Even after grinding and tearing the leaves to expose more surface area and break open cells,
170000	174000	the distinctive dark green pigment simply wouldn't cooperate.
177000	183000	His conclusion was that the chlorophyll pigment must be adhered to the solid plant matter
183000	189000	through intermolecular forces, reducing its solubility in the petroleum ether solvent.
190000	193000	Using this idea as a springboard for his research,
193000	197000	Tsvet tried adhering chlorophyll to different solid surfaces
197000	200000	and then washing it away with various solvents
200000	206000	by allowing those solvents to flow through the solid matrix to which he had adhered the pigment.
208000	214000	He found that not only did chlorophyll migrate at different rates in different systems,
214000	219000	but also that mixtures of pigments would many times separate in space
219000	224000	because of the differing attractive forces at work between them and the two phases.
224000	228000	This created an array of colors on Tsvet's column,
228000	232000	prompting him to dub his new technique chromatography
232000	236000	from the Greek words meaning color and writing.
239000	244000	Where Tsvet's creation really differed from simple liquid-liquid or solid-liquid extraction
244000	247000	is that he added motion to the equation.
248000	251000	By allowing one of the phases to move across the other,
251000	255000	the partitioning of a solute between heterogeneous phases
255000	261000	can be used to move compounds across the stationary phase, but at varying rates.
263000	268000	Obviously, the more time a particular compound spends partitioned onto the mobile phase
268000	271000	or into the mobile phase, the faster it moves.
271000	275000	Indeed, the modern definition of chromatography is
275000	280000	a separation technique which relies on the differing affinity of a substance
280000	284000	for a stationary phase and a mobile phase.
287000	291000	We can very closely duplicate the results of some of Tsvet's experiments
291000	295000	using a simple piece of chalk, some markers,
295000	299000	and a solvent that's readily available to us, like ethanol.
299000	303000	So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take that piece of chalk
303000	306000	which I've applied a little bit of some pigments from a marker,
306000	309000	and I'm going to use ethanol as a mobile phase
309000	315000	to cause those dyes and pigments to migrate, but at different speeds.
317000	320000	So ahead of time, I've already prepared my column, if you will,
320000	325000	and as I promised, this is an experiment that's pretty easily done right in your own kitchen.
325000	329000	This is nothing more than a piece of common sidewalk chalk.
329000	333000	This is calcium carbonate, the exact same stationary phase
333000	336000	used by Tsvet in his original experiment.
336000	341000	Now on this piece of chalk, I placed bands of different colors
341000	346000	simply by touching the tip of a marker to the chalk.
346000	350000	So this chalk is now my stationary phase.
350000	354000	It's going to stand perfectly still throughout the experiment.
355000	360000	I have a beaker here with a little bit of the solvent ethanol in it.
360000	363000	Now I'm using ethanol instead of petroleum ether
363000	368000	because the pigments from the markers are actually much more polar molecules
368000	370000	than the pigments that Tsvet was separating.
370000	376000	So I need a little bit more polar solvent to encourage this ink to migrate.
376000	379000	What I'm going to do now is place my chalk into this beaker
379000	384000	containing a very shallow pool of my mobile phase ethanol
384000	389000	and allow it to migrate up through the chalk through essentially capillary action.
389000	394000	So my chalk will absorb the solvent and chromatography will take place.
394000	398000	So let's start that now.
398000	402000	I'm going to very carefully balance my chalk here
402000	405000	and place a piece of aluminum foil over the top
405000	409000	in an attempt to discourage evaporation of my mobile phase
409000	413000	while separation takes place.
413000	416000	So if we wait for just a moment, we should already be able to see the chalk
416000	420000	is becoming darker as the solvent moves up toward the ink.
420000	424000	So before long, it's going to pass over my bands of different colors
424000	429000	and begin to separate those molecules based upon chromatography.
435000	438000	So our chalk has been developing for a little while
438000	441000	and even though the solvent has only run a very small distance
441000	444000	it's already very easy to see what's been going on here.
444000	447000	So let's take a closer look.
447000	454000	I'm going to remove my stationary phase along with the adhered pigments.
454000	457000	I'll move my ethanol to the side.
457000	461000	Now if I turn this chalk you can see very clearly
461000	466000	that different colored markers contain different colored pigments
466000	472000	and not only that but those different colored pigments have traveled different distances.
472000	477000	Now since calcium carbonate is a particularly polar substance
477000	480000	and ethanol is an organic solvent, I can say with relative certainty
480000	484000	for example that the yellow dye to produce the color of the yellow marker
484000	487000	contains molecules which are less polar
487000	492000	than say the compounds used in this blue dye which were used to produce the green marker.
492000	498000	And I can make this sort of qualitative assessment of the polarity of the different dyes within
498000	505000	simply by looking at how they move during my chromatography experiment.
505000	510000	Of course chromatography has advanced considerably over the past century.
510000	515000	Stationary phases like calcium carbonate and sugar from Svets experiments
515000	519000	have been replaced by a number of superior options.
519000	522000	The first of these was actually paper.
522000	531000	You see paper consists of cellulose, a long polymer consisting mostly of interconnected glucose units.
531000	535000	And we already know that these glucose units have many, many hydroxyls
535000	543000	which are available to interact with polar or hydrogen bonding compounds.
543000	549000	Two English chemists by the name of Archer J.P. Martin and Richard Singh
549000	554000	developed a method of chromatography using paper and organic solvents
554000	558000	as stationery and mobile phases respectively.
558000	562000	In 1942 they published a paper outlining this technique
562000	566000	but more importantly it discussed the fundamentals of partitioning
566000	571000	as it applied to chromatographic systems.
571000	577000	This technique proved extremely useful in the identification of small organic molecules
577000	581000	including amino acids like glycine and alanine.
581000	590000	This method was so influential that Martin and Singh received the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this concept.
590000	593000	Not only did these two receive the prize for their work
593000	596000	but a further validation came just a year later
596000	600000	when a young scientist named Stanley Miller used this method
600000	608000	to verify the presence of amino acids in his now famous Primitive Earth experiment.
608000	611000	More recently, advances in material manufacturing
611000	617000	had made quick identifications like millers even easier and more accurate.
617000	622000	For example, microporosilica can now be manufactured.
622000	628000	Silica is a fantastic stationery phase because even though its formula is SiO2
628000	635000	at its surface are an array of silanol groups or SiOH motifs.
635000	641000	These groups will interact well with anything of high polarity or good hydrogen bonding ability
641000	647000	and because silica can be manufactured with a tremendous amount of surface area per volume ratio
647000	654000	more compound can be separated with greater efficiency or on larger scales.
654000	659000	For example, instead of the everyday paper used by Martin and Miller
659000	664000	modern organic chemistry researchers often use a thin layer chromatography plate
664000	671000	with a plastic backing and just a 200 micron thick layer of silica bound to it.
671000	675000	That's just about the width of a human hair.
675000	681000	But that small amount of silica has a surface area of literally hundreds of square meters
681000	685000	because the extremely small size and porosity of the silica particles
685000	690000	gives it this very, very large surface area to volume ratio.
690000	695000	In the technique of thin layer chromatography, a small amount of compound to be analyzed
695000	700000	is spotted onto the plate as a solution and it's allowed to dry.
700000	704000	So once that spot is dried, it's placed into a developing chamber
704000	708000	which contains a thin pool of the selected mobile phase
708000	715000	which will move up the plate in the very same way that our mobile phase moved up the chalk in our previous demonstration.
715000	718000	So let's take a look at a thin layer chromatography experiment
718000	723000	just like we did our chalk experiment which simulated the work of Svet.
723000	727000	Now this time I'm going to put on some gloves just because I'd like to hold up for you
727000	732000	and show you what a thin layer chromatography plate actually looks like.
732000	736000	Now they come in many sizes and they come with many different stationary phases
736000	742000	but by far the most common uses silica and it's backed in plastic
742000	747000	so the shiny side on the back here is actually plastic on which chromatography would never happen.
747000	755000	But this is the surface which contains the very, very thin layer of microscopic beads of silica.
755000	764000	In fact, this jar contains loose silica, the likes of which would be adhered to the backing of the plate.
764000	767000	So as you can see it's extremely fine particle size
767000	775000	and that gives it its extremely large surface area to volume ratio.
775000	780000	Now I have a small developing chamber here which has alcohol in it just as before
780000	788000	and I've created a plate which I've spotted with some of the markers that we used in the previous experiment as well
788000	792000	and you're probably going to notice a market difference in their chromatographic behavior
792000	797000	because even though I'm using the same mobile phase, we're changing our stationary phase now
797000	802000	from calcium carbonate to silica, both very polar but in their own way
802000	806000	so we're going to see a drastically different separation pattern taking place.
806000	810000	Nonetheless, the development process is essentially the same.
810000	817000	I'm going to take my plate onto which I placed three small spots, one of green, one of orange and one of the red marker
817000	822000	and I've spotted them just as I did in my bars on the chalk stick
822000	826000	in such a way that they don't submerge beneath the thin pool of mobile phase
826000	829000	because I don't want them to dissolve into all that mobile phase.
829000	836000	So I'm going to place that inside very carefully, going to cover that back up with my foil
836000	842000	to discourage any evaporation of my mobile phase
842000	850000	and fairly quickly, we should be able to see that the alcohol mobile phase is making its way up the plate once again
850000	855000	and just as before with the chalk, when it encounters the spots, they will begin to migrate at a rate
855000	860000	which is consistent with their relative affinity for the mobile and stationary phases.
860000	864000	So we'll come back to this and take a look at it in just a few minutes when it's done.
870000	875000	So the mobile phase has moved an appreciable distance up the plate
875000	880000	which is the stationary phase in my TLC experiment, so I'm ready to take a look now at the result.
880000	885000	I'm going to remove my plate. Now if I were in the lab, I would very quickly take a pencil and mark the lane
885000	893000	because as we'll see here briefly, over time I expect that that alcohol mobile phase will begin to evaporate
893000	897000	and it won't be quite so clear as it is now where it traveled to.
897000	902000	Now it's very important for me to know that because I can use the distances traveled by the spots
902000	907000	relative to that traveled by the mobile phase to get some numbers that we'll talk about in a moment.
907000	915000	But first let's just take a look at the plate. So it's very obvious that the green marker actually contains some blue dye.
915000	919000	Now we may not have guessed that originally simply from looking at the marker itself,
919000	923000	but the chromatography plate makes this fact essentially undisputable.
923000	928000	Not only that, I can say that some of that blue dye moved very well with the mobile phase
928000	932000	and therefore didn't have a terribly high affinity for the stationary phase.
932000	937000	In other words, it's moving that way because it's less polar than the others.
937000	943000	We can even see similar components in the red and orange markers but in slightly different proportions
943000	948000	and of course the orange having more yellow and the red having more of the darker pigments in it.
948000	955000	So this is how TLC can be used to very quickly get qualitative assessments of compounds polarities and solubilities
955000	961000	in different solvents but also to give us a very quick and easy way to compare one lane to the next
961000	966000	and identify common compounds in different samples.
966000	971000	Now since my solvents still evaporating, I'll show you another one which I prepared earlier
971000	974000	in which the solvent has all but evaporated completely.
974000	977000	And again you can see I've got basically the same result.
977000	983000	Yet another very important property of this chromatography technique is that it's reproducible.
983000	987000	So as long as I use the same stationary and mobile phases each time,
987000	994000	I can expect the same relative mobilities for all the spots within a given sample.
994000	998000	So as the mobile phase wicks up through the plate by capillary action,
998000	1002000	different compounds in our samples were moving at different rates.
1002000	1007000	Now compounds which interact more strongly with the polar silica move to shorter distance
1007000	1013000	while those which interacted better with the lower polarity mobile phase move to greater distance.
1013000	1018000	At the completion of the experiment we can measure those distances traveled by the sample spots
1018000	1022000	as a fraction of the distance traveled by the mobile phase.
1022000	1029000	And we report that number as the RF value for that sample in our particular chromatographic system.
1029000	1036000	RF stands for retention factor and it gives us a semi-quantitative way to describe simple chromatographic mobility,
1036000	1040000	like we just saw in our experiment.
1040000	1048000	Now thin layer chromatography may be a versatile, quick, low-cost way to observe the chromatographic mobility of a compound.
1048000	1055000	But working with such small quantities makes collection of a meaningful sample of the compound somewhat difficult.
1055000	1062000	In order to collect a sample which can be used as raw material, drug, an analytical sample, or a synthetic intermediate,
1062000	1067000	we need to increase the scale of the experiment.
1067000	1072000	This is frequently done in the lab using a technique known as column chromatography.
1072000	1080000	In column chromatography we abandon the thin layer of stationary phase on the backing in favor of a column.
1080000	1086000	Now this brings the third dimension into play and this means that a 2 centimeter wide column
1086000	1097000	can separate about 8,000 times as much sample as a TLC lane which is just 200 microns thick.
1097000	1100000	Now we accomplish this using a device like this.
1100000	1108000	It's a glass column which contains a Teflon stopcock at the base and a stem through which we can drain mobile phase.
1108000	1115000	I place a small bit of glass wool or some other obstruction in the neck to prevent solids from moving through,
1115000	1128000	then a nice even layered bed of sand onto which I would build a column of silica again using this finely, finely powdered silica material.
1128000	1133000	The key here is that because I'm using a column which has depth,
1133000	1138000	instead of that extremely thin layer of silica I'm using a very large bed of silica.
1138000	1147000	In fact the bed contains about 8,000 times the volume per unit length in a column this size compared to the kind of TLC plates that we saw previously.
1147000	1152000	So using a column I can get a larger quantity of material.
1152000	1156000	The only real catch here comes when we try to analyze the mobility.
1156000	1162000	We have to remember that in our previous examples the mobile phase migrated from the bottom of the column to the top.
1162000	1170000	But in this case once we packed a column and add sample we'd be adding mobile phase through the top and draining through the bottom,
1170000	1172000	meaning that all the motion is now downward.
1172000	1177000	So there's a common point of confusion is that even though the bands may appear to be reversed from a TLC experiment,
1177000	1181000	they're in fact, if they are reversed, exactly what we would expect.
1185000	1191000	Now the techniques that we've looked at in this lecture so far are just the very basic techniques taught at the introductory level,
1191000	1195000	though still used frequently in research labs today.
1195000	1200000	In recent decades though chromatography has undergone a virtual explosion of advancements
1200000	1206000	leading to techniques involving ultramicroscopic silica particles with such small pores
1206000	1212000	that powerful pumps have to be used to push solvent through them at high pressures.
1212000	1218000	We call this technique HPLC for high pressure liquid chromatography.
1219000	1227000	The extremely high surface area of the contents of an HPLC column allows very precise separations,
1227000	1233000	but it also requires a closed system consisting of a steel column to be used
1233000	1237000	so that it can resist the pressure applied by pumps which move the solvent.
1237000	1244000	So it's impossible to load compounds in the same way as traditional chromatography since the system is sealed.
1245000	1250000	Similarly, it's impossible to see even the brightest colored compounds as they move through the system
1250000	1253000	because the column is encased in steel.
1255000	1259000	Now the loading problem is solved with a device called an injection loop.
1259000	1265000	An injection loop consists of a manifold with two separate loops made of a pressure resistant tubing.
1265000	1269000	So when the valve handle is rotated, one loop is in line with the flowing mobile phase
1269000	1273000	and the other is in line with a special injection septum.
1273000	1277000	The sample is pushed into the open loop using a syringe
1277000	1282000	and when the handle is turned, places the injection loop in line with the mobile phase,
1282000	1288000	thereby introducing the sample to the chromatographic system without ever opening it and losing pressure.
1290000	1294000	Of course, since columns need to be packed into stainless steel cases,
1294000	1300000	it becomes impossible to monitor a run with my eyes even if my compounds are absorbing the visible light.
1300000	1309000	So HPLC systems also have a detecting system which is usually something like a simple spectrophotometer flow cell.
1309000	1313000	The simplest example of this is a UV visible detection system
1313000	1320000	in which a specific wavelength of light is aimed so that it passes through the exiting solvent, striking a detector.
1322000	1326000	As the sample molecules move out of the column and through the detector cell,
1326000	1330000	they absorb the light, leading to a reduced intensity at the detector.
1330000	1338000	So if we plot the observed absorbance as a function of time starting with the injection of the sample at zero minutes,
1338000	1345000	we can create what's called a chromatogram or a graphical representation of the separation taking place.
1347000	1351000	There are many more chromatographic methods available to the modern chemist.
1351000	1354000	Certainly many more than we can survey in a single lecture.
1354000	1362000	But no lecture on chromatography would be complete without the mention of gas chromatography, commonly referred to as GC.
1364000	1370000	Archer J.P. Martin is the name most commonly associated with the invention of gas chromatography.
1370000	1375000	Now, Martin is actually most famous for his invention of paper chromatography,
1375000	1382000	the technique used by Stanley Miller to detect the amino acids in his primordial concoction made in Harold Urie's lab.
1383000	1386000	Martin shared the 1952 Nobel Prize for that work,
1386000	1393000	but like most Nobel laureates, even the indisputable pinnacle of scientific honors was not enough to satisfy his curiosity.
1393000	1401000	Martin continued to explore ways in which partitioning could be exploited to separate organic compounds faster and even more efficiently.
1404000	1408000	It was around the time of his Nobel Prize award that he hit on another great concept.
1408000	1412000	Partitioning involves the motion of molecules from one phase to another.
1412000	1420000	So why confine this methodology to transitions between adhered solid states and dissolved liquid states?
1420000	1425000	After all, molecules move faster in gases and slowest of all in solids.
1425000	1433000	So it stands to reason that molecules could switch from phase to phase much more quickly if the gas phase were somehow included in the experiment.
1433000	1441000	So Martin wondered, could a form of chromatography be developed using liquid as the stationary phase and gas as the mobile phase?
1443000	1445000	Martin's idea proved viable.
1445000	1455000	He demonstrated that separation could be accomplished with extreme speed and precision using a dense liquid phase and a gas like helium as the mobile phase.
1456000	1464000	By slowly heating a column filled with a liquid stationary phase, through which a carrier gas like helium or nitrogen is flowing,
1464000	1469000	compounds are driven off one by one in order of decreasing volatility.
1469000	1479000	His new method allowed faster separation with far less material and has become a staple technique in forensic and analytical labs all around the world.
1479000	1486000	Using various detection methods, GC can be used to analyze practically anything that will vaporize.
1489000	1493000	In this lecture, we explored our last topics on the science of separations.
1493000	1497000	Specifically, we continued our investigation into partitioning,
1497000	1506000	which is the equilibrium that compounds naturally establish between two distinct phases upon or based upon their relative affinity for those phases.
1507000	1516000	We took a look at the work of Michael Svet, whose second PhD dissertation gave rise to the science of chromatography,
1516000	1523000	in which partitioning between a stationary and mobile phase leads to predictable rates of movement for compounds.
1523000	1528000	This movement is based upon their relative affinity for the two phases.
1528000	1535000	We saw how this very basic principle plays out on a piece of blackboard chalk, much like Svet's first experiment.
1535000	1542000	And then again on a TLC plate, which is designed for small-scale characterizations and method development.
1542000	1553000	And finally, we talked about columns, which could allow us to collect enough sample to carry our work forward and perform additional reactions or testing.
1553000	1562000	Finally, we briefly mentioned some of the more powerful techniques in use today for special applications from quality testing to medical research and beyond.
1562000	1570000	We looked at HPLC, which uses extremely fine silica with very small pores to generate a huge surface area,
1570000	1579000	giving us better separations but requiring powerful pumps operating at thousands of pounds per square inch to keep that mobile phase moving.
1579000	1585000	And we also saw how Archer J. P. Martin's second claim to fame, gas chromatography,
1585000	1591000	operates by partitioning between the liquid and gas phases rather than the traditional solid and liquid phases.
1591000	1601000	And we discussed how this gives more partitioning events in a given unit of time, creating a fantastic resolution in a very short experiment.
1601000	1607000	From recrystallization to distillation to liquid-liquid extractions and chromatography,
1607000	1614000	there is truly a solution for nearly any separation problem that could possibly come up in the lab.
1615000	1621000	We've come a long way, from atomic and molecular structure to the synthesis of organic compounds,
1621000	1626000	a host of identification techniques and methods used for purification.
1626000	1633000	In the last 35 lectures, we have managed to gather an understanding of some of the most basic tenets of organic chemistry.
1633000	1639000	But we spent most of our time looking back on the history of this complex and powerful science.
1639000	1643000	An absolute must, if one is to gain the perspective to meaningfully look forward,
1643000	1647000	at the possibilities that organic chemistry holds for the future.
1648000	1652000	So, the topic of our final lecture will be just that.
1652000	1657000	We'll experience the joy of taking some of what we've learned from the past 35 lectures,
1657000	1663000	adding a dash of imagination, and trying to gaze into the future through the eyes of an organic chemist.
1663000	1665000	I'll see you there.
