1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,360
In 1540, a German botanist by the name of Valerius Cordus isolated a substance produced

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,360
when ethanol was mixed with sulfuric acid.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,280
Uncertain of what he'd created, Cordus simply named his creation Sweet Oil of Vitriol after

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,360
the common name for sulfuric acid at the time, Oil of Vitriol.

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,640
In his time, Cordus had no way of knowing what a powerful and useful molecule he had

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
managed to create.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,240
Three centuries later, on March 30, 1842, American physician Crawford Williamson Long

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,720
demonstrated the anesthetic effects of the very same molecule that Cordus had created.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,600
In doing so, he effectively changed the practice of surgery forever.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,760
Of course, I'm talking about ether, a compound with such a huge impact on the practice of

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,800
modern medicine that National Doctors' Day is marked on March 30 in the United States.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,900
Today, ether has been replaced by safer alternatives in medicine, but it finds wide use as an industrial

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,680
solvent and in fuel blending.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,400
More than just a useful medicine, ether is also an example of one of today's star compounds,

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
those containing oxygen.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
We spend a great deal of time so far looking at the structures, properties and reactions

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,320
of just a small slice of the organic compound arsenal.

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,800
Specifically, we've investigated hydrocarbons, those compounds containing only hydrogen and

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,120
carbon, and alkyl halides, in which a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine heteroatom is

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,680
present in place of a hydrogen.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,080
Oxygen's made a cameo as nucleophiles and substitution and as bases in elimination,

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,680
but oxygen-containing species have a much greater utility and versatility in organic chemistry.

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,880
Today we're going to take a quantum leap forward, introducing this heteroatom to the

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,440
mix in earnest, looking at examples of oxygen-containing functional groups which find use as reagents,

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,160
solvents, catalysts and everyday commercial products.

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,760
This atom is present in acids, bases, explosives, medicines and countless other relevant organic

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
compounds.

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,280
It's in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the foods we eat and so much more.

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,080
Clearly, oxygen deserves some attention.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,760
So before we start to explore oxygen in the context of organic compounds, let's quickly

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,600
review its characteristics as an element.

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,640
Oxygen is element number 8 on the periodic table, so it has a ground state electron configuration

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,040
of 1s2, 2s2, 2p4.

34
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Now this of course means that oxygen has a strong tendency to form two covalent bonds

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,360
to complete its octet, either two bonds in an sp3 hybridized state with bond angles of

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,720
approximately 109.5 degrees, or as a double bond in an sp2 hybridized state.

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,080
In either case the oxygen atom will have two lone pairs of electrons to complete its octet.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,040
So far, the only heteroatoms that we've significantly explored are halogens, which tend to form

39
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640
only one bond to complete their octet.

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,760
This means that for halogens, reacting is almost always requiring that the halogen be

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,800
removed from or added to a chemical scaffold.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,920
But the two bonds that oxygen can form allow it to remain connected to an organic scaffold

43
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,400
by one bond as it reacts with the other, making its chemistry much richer and even more useful

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,240
than that of halogens.

45
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,920
So let's begin by considering compounds containing a single sp3 hybridized oxygen atom.

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,840
So what went on in that flask that fateful day in 1540 when Cordis mixed ethanol with

47
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,560
sulfuric acid?

48
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,160
Well, he converted one oxygen containing compound into another.

49
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,120
Specifically, he converted an alcohol into an ether.

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
So let's start our day off by considering alcohols.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm going to show you some common aliphatic alcohols, meaning those that only contain

52
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
saturated hydrocarbons as their scaffold.

53
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,240
We can start with the simplest of all, methanol, with the formula CH3OH.

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,440
One additional carbon gives us ethanol, with the formula C2H5OH.

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,480
And I can continue adding carbons to my scaffold, giving N-propanol and N-butanol as the next

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,800
two in line.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,120
Now, it probably won't surprise you to know that the boiling points of these compounds

58
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,640
increase as I increase the number of carbons in the chain.

59
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,880
This is analogous to what we would see for alkanes, for example.

60
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,360
So as I add additional carbons to my alcohol, I increase its boiling point and therefore

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,200
give it a greater tendency to be a liquid.

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,360
Just as with alkanes, when we reach a certain critical number of carbons, in this case three

63
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,600
We can form structural isomers.

64
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,960
Now there are only two structural isomers of three carbon-containing compounds.

65
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,560
Those would be propanol and isopropanol.

66
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,200
So I'm going to show you instead the structural isomers of four carbon alcohols, because they

67
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,280
get a little more interesting at that point.

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,680
We've already learned about N-butanol, which has a four-carbon, linear chain with a hydroxyl

69
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,920
group attached.

70
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,960
But I can arrange these carbons in a different type of way to create a new structural isomer.

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,440
For example, I can create isobutanol by placing a branch in the chain near the other side

72
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,360
of the molecule away from the functional group.

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,760
If I instead branch that chain at a location adjacent to the functional group, I create

74
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,320
something called sec-butanol, which is short for secondary.

75
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,160
I can branch it even further and create tert-butanol, which of course is short for tertiary.

76
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,840
So all of these alcohols have exactly the same molecular formula, but clearly have different

77
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,760
arrangements of atoms.

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,920
And this has an effect on their boiling points as well.

79
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,080
Again, N-butanol has a primary carbon and a straight chain.

80
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,280
Isobutanol has a primary carbon bearing its hydroxyl on a branched chain.

81
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,100
Sec-butanol with a secondary on an otherwise straight chain and tert-butanol, which is as

82
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,240
branched as I can possibly get.

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,480
So knowing what we do about how branching affects the volatility of organic compounds,

84
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,040
we can predict, and we would be right, that the boiling point trend of these four isomers

85
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,360
of isobutanol is as follows.

86
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,720
T-butanol is the lowest, followed by sec-butanol, isobutanol, and finally, N-butanol having

87
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,840
the highest boiling point of all.

88
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,720
The IUPAC nomenclature of alcohols follows the usual system, keeping in mind that the

89
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,040
alcohol is treated as a functional group.

90
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,460
So for example, if I were going to name this compound, by IUPAC, I would first have to

91
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,440
identify the parent compound.

92
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,600
The parent hydrocarbon is here.

93
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,840
One, two, three, four carbons bearing the functional group.

94
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,040
So this is going to be a butanol molecule.

95
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,960
I have a single substituent in the form of a methyl group.

96
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,560
So all that's left now is to number my parent chain in such a way that my functional group

97
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,200
gets the lowest possible number.

98
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,560
So I have this numbering scheme available, and I have this numbering scheme here.

99
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,680
Naturally I'm going to choose the scheme which gives my hydroxyl group an address of one.

100
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,200
So I construct my name using these elements, and I get three methyl, one butanol.

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,360
Let's do another one.

102
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,840
Here's an alcohol that has a halogen as a substituent.

103
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,480
Again, I need to find my parent carbon chain which contains the hydroxyl bond.

104
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,080
Here it is.

105
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,120
Five carbons containing the bond to the OH group.

106
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,280
So this is going to be a pentanol molecule.

107
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,120
My substituent is a chlorine, so this is a chloro group.

108
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,440
And again, I will address my carbon chain starting with one end and giving the lowest

109
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
number to the functional group.

110
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,480
In this case that means putting a two on my alcohol group and a four on my chloro group

111
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,760
which gives me the name four chloro, two pentanol.

112
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,960
So now that we've taken a look at alcohols, let's switch gears a little bit and look at

113
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,120
ethers so that we can try to understand their differences in their properties and how they

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,720
are interconverted.

115
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,420
The simplest possible ether is dimethyl ether, and you should immediately notice what makes

116
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,880
it different from the alcohol examples in the previous slides, that the oxygen does not

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,680
contain a bond directly to hydrogen.

118
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,840
Instead, it's bonded to two different R groups, in this case both methyl.

119
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,200
So this has a formula of CH3OCH3.

120
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,880
I can extend one of those R groups to a longer chain and get what we would call ethyl methyl

121
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,400
ether, which has this formula.

122
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:52,320
And I could extend the other chain even further to get diethyl ether, which has this formula.

123
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,840
But those common names of ethers get unwieldy just like any other organic compound as they

124
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
get larger and larger.

125
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,960
So as usual, the IUPAC has stepped in with some nomenclature rules.

126
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,680
But in the case of ether, since there's no hydrogen attached directly to the oxygen,

127
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,240
we don't treat it as a functional group.

128
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Instead, we treat the ether motif as what we would call an alkoxy group.

129
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,580
This is best shown by example.

130
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,160
So let's name this compound.

131
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,720
Remembering that I have an ether here because my oxygen is connected to two distinct R groups.

132
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,620
This is not going to be a functional group, but rather a substituent.

133
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,520
So the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule I have here is five carbons long.

134
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,440
And I have, in this case, a pentane, which contains two different substituents.

135
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Those substituents are the chloro, shown here, and the ethoxy substituent, which constitutes

136
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
my ether.

137
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,960
But because it is a substituent and not a functional group, it no longer gets that

138
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,560
special priority in numbering.

139
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,360
So I would number my chain from the left-hand side to give the lower number two to the alphabetically

140
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
first chloro group.

141
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:16,160
So in this case, I'm going to call my compound two chloro for ethoxypentane.

142
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,040
Just for fun, let's do the diethyl ether that Cortis created back in the 1500s.

143
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,360
In this case, it may seem funny, but my parent chain is going to be relatively small compared

144
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
to the rest of the molecule.

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Here it is.

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,480
Two carbons long is the longest possible continuous chain of carbon atoms that I can find.

147
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,800
And of course, the substituent would be the entire ethoxy group.

148
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,360
So we would name this, under IUPAC rules, ethoxyethane.

149
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,600
No address is needed in this case, because whether it's on one carbon of the ethane or

150
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,240
the other, that's always going to be my number one carbon.

151
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,080
And in cases like this, where there's no ambiguity, we frequently drop the address out of the

152
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,400
substituent's portion of the name.

153
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,440
Now another property that we should discuss is the hydrogen bonding characteristics of

154
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,480
alcohols and ethers.

155
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,600
Let's do this by looking first at the structure of alcohol.

156
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,760
Here's our molecule of ethanol, with which we're fairly familiar.

157
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,080
It has an OH bond, which should have a fairly strong dipole with a negative end near the

158
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,480
oxygen and a positive end near the hydrogen.

159
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,680
It also has a carbon-oxygen polar bond, which should have some positive charge density near

160
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,280
the carbon, which bears the hydroxyl, and again, some negative charge on the oxygen.

161
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,120
So overall, this particular molecule has a net molecular dipole.

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Furthermore, when it is near another molecule of ethanol, it can form an extra type of intermolecular

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,640
interaction known as a hydrogen bond.

164
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:54,880
Whenever I have an OH, NH, or FH bond in a functional group, there's a potential that

165
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,080
the electronegative oxygen, fluorine, or nitrogen atom can share its lone pairs for

166
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,200
just a split second with the hydrogen from another molecule of the same type.

167
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,880
When this interaction takes place, it's fairly strong compared to a lot of other intermolecular

168
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,280
forces and so we give it a special name.

169
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,800
We call it hydrogen bonding, or H bonding, and it is this hydrogen bonding that can occur

170
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,600
between two different molecules of ethanol that give it such a high boiling point.

171
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,600
If instead we compare how ethers look, we see that ethers have polar bonds in the form

172
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,360
of two different carbon-oxygen bonds, one here, one here.

173
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,080
So there is a little bit of polarity to this molecule.

174
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,880
Now those dipoles are almost pointed opposite to one another, so they cancel out a great

175
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,540
deal, but what's even more important here is that there's no potential for hydrogen

176
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,320
bonding in ether, and that's because the oxygen contains the lone pairs necessary, but there's

177
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,900
no polar hydrogen like there is here in my ethanol molecule.

178
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,360
So ethers make great solvents for dissolving compounds like ethanol, but they don't adhere

179
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,800
well to one another, and this translates to a lower boiling point.

180
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,720
So here we have an ethane compared to a methyl ether and an ethanol boiling point, and you

181
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,800
can see clearly that hydrogen bonding interaction is enough to make up almost a hundred degrees

182
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,000
difference worth of boiling point here.

183
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
So this is a very important, very fundamental intermolecular force that we always have to

184
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,760
be mindful of.

185
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:36,160
To last property, let's talk about the acidity of alcohols and ethers.

186
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,400
Now the alcohol has this OH, which is a polar bond containing a hydrogen, so we expect it

187
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,360
to act as an acid, albeit a weak one.

188
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,400
To form an alkoxide conjugate base, we have a pKa of about 16.

189
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,600
So on the grand scheme of things, alcohols aren't terribly acidic, but they're certainly

190
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,360
much more acidic than, for example, alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, all of which we've looked

191
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,040
at so far.

192
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,840
But alcohols can also act as a base.

193
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,000
When they accept a proton at that group, they form a species known as an oxonium ion.

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,320
Now, oxonium ions have a lot of positive charge density right near an electronegative element,

195
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,360
so they're not very stable, and they tend to give up that proton very rapidly, giving

196
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,000
them a pKa of about negative 2.

197
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,360
So in this case, alcohols can act either as very weak acids, releasing a proton, or very

198
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,800
weak bases, accepting a proton.

199
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,400
And we call this property amphoterism.

200
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,120
So ethanol, like all aliphatic alcohols, is amphoteric.

201
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,080
But what about ethers?

202
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,200
Let's look at the structure of ether.

203
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Remember, we have that electronegative oxygen there with lone pairs, so there's a potential

204
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,080
here for some acid-base chemistry.

205
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,640
But there's no acidic proton.

206
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,780
In fact, the most acidic proton on ether, in this case dimethyl ether, would be one

207
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,560
of the six protons that it has on the adjacent methyl groups, which would have a pKa of somewhere

208
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
around 50.

209
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:13,560
Now, from a practical perspective, when pKa's become this prohibitively large, we just say,

210
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,920
now this is not an acid at all.

211
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,960
But it can act as a base.

212
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,080
Just as the oxygen in alcohol can accept a proton, so can this oxygen in ether accept

213
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,700
a proton via one of the two lone pairs, creating a protonated ether which has a pKa of around

214
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,580
negative 3.5.

215
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,800
So in the case of ethers, we're not dealing with amphoterism, we're simply dealing with

216
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,440
a very weakly basic organic compound.

217
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,360
Organic chemicals are used widely in organic chemistry, as both reagents and solvents.

218
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,120
And I'm sure that most of us are familiar with the means by which most of the world's

219
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,760
ethanol is prepared, fermentation of sugars by the bacterium Saccharomyces.

220
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,160
This is just a fancy name for yeast.

221
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,960
These little organic chemists are without equal when it comes to creating ethanol.

222
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,640
But what about other, more complex alcohols?

223
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,480
When larger, more complex alcohols are needed, we must often turn to the tools of organic

224
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,720
chemistry to create them.

225
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,600
There are many ways in which to do this.

226
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,520
In fact, we already saw how they can be produced by nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides

227
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,160
using hydroxide ions.

228
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,120
There are many, many more, there are far too many in fact, to survey them all in this course.

229
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,080
In fact, we're now just going to focus on how alcohols are produced using starting materials

230
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,720
with which we're already familiar, alkenes, and a mechanism that we already understand,

231
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,080
addition.

232
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,120
To accomplish this, we'll discuss three types of reactions.

233
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,320
Hydration of alkenes, a technique called oxymercuration demercuration, and one known as hydroboration

234
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,480
and oxidation.

235
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
Each of these reactions has specific advantages and challenges associated with them, and in

236
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,080
many cases they will produce various structural isomers of the product alcohol.

237
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,280
So let's begin with a special kind of addition reaction.

238
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,160
This is a catalyzed hydration of a very simple alkene, like propene.

239
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:18,920
As the name implies, we'll need three ingredients, an alkene, a mineral acid, and water.

240
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,400
In order to complete our reaction, we'll need to acidify the sample using an aqueous solution

241
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,080
of that mineral acid, being sure that it has a non-nucleophilic conjugate base, so we'd

242
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,680
use something like phosphoric or sulfuric acid for this purpose.

243
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,560
A strong acid like sulfuric acid protonates the alkene, but there are two possible carbocation

244
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,760
which could form, primary and secondary.

245
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Of course, we know that hyperconjugation causes the secondary carbocation to be strongly

246
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,360
favored, and it's one of the driving forces behind Markov and Kov's rule, and this reaction

247
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,320
is no exception.

248
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,000
Now if we follow the reaction with the isopropyl cation to completion, we see that our acid

249
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,440
selection has produced a non-nucleophilic base, leaving only water to act as the nucleophile,

250
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,960
attacking the carbocation and forming a new bond.

251
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,120
So we've created that species known as an oxonium ion.

252
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,080
Remember oxonium ions are very acidic, so they quickly lose that acidic proton to a molecule

253
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,160
of solvent or to another alkene perpetuating the reaction.

254
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,960
And if we evaluate the product obtained, we see that the extension of Markov and Kov's

255
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,880
rule has held, with the added hydrogen on the less substituted carbon of the product

256
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,680
and the hydroxyl group on the more substituted carbon.

257
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,080
So if the goal of our synthesis is to convert an alkene into an alcohol without stereoselectivity

258
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,480
and with obeying Markov and Kov's rule, acid-catalyzed hydration seems to be the ticket.

259
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,120
But just as with all reactions involving carbocation, we have to be vigilant of the possibility

260
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
for rearrangements in the intermediate.

261
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
So how do we cope with this problem?

262
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,200
It's an interesting question and one which no doubt vexed Markov and Kov.

263
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,880
So this question was taken up by Carl Andreas Hoffman and Julius Sand in 1900.

264
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,280
Hoffman and Sand were part of a burgeoning subclass of chemists practicing what is known

265
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,720
as organometallic chemistry.

266
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
And metals, though they're rare in organic chemistry, are present and can form bonds

267
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
to carbon.

268
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,080
It was a very interesting phenomenon that they were investigating.

269
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,280
So the reaction that Hoffman and Sand developed involves the use of mercuric acetate, compound

270
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,000
consisting of one atom of mercury bonded to two acetate groups.

271
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,400
Hoffman and Sand realized that if this compound was used in place of a mineral acid to initiate

272
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,600
the hydration of an alkene, no rearrangement took place.

273
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,480
So as mercuric acetate is attacked by the alkene, the large mercury atom takes up residence

274
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,200
between the two carbons of the pi system, much like our cyclic halonium ion discussed

275
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
last time.

276
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,000
Because of this, it cannot rearrange, that cyclic structure locks it down.

277
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,240
Attack by the solvent takes place, and finally the organomercury group is reacted with an

278
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,000
agent called sodium borohydride.

279
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,880
The borohydride removes the mercuric group and replaces it with a hydrogen.

280
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,880
So the use of this reagent allowed Hoffman and Sand to create the Markovnikov product

281
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,360
in this hydration without suffering the effects of rearrangement.

282
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,720
So we've seen how acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes leads to Markovnikov products with

283
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,360
the potential for rearrangement, and we've seen how to produce the Markovnikov product

284
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:36,400
while avoiding rearrangement by use of oxymercuration and subsequent demercuration with borohydride.

285
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,600
But what if instead it were necessary to hydrate an alkene to produce the anti-Markovnikov

286
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
product?

287
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,360
Well, we can accomplish this using boron trihydride.

288
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,080
You see, what makes boron hydride so interesting is that boron has very low electronegativity,

289
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,600
so low in fact that the hydrogen atoms of borotrihydride are at the negative end of the

290
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,280
bond dipole.

291
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,120
Very unusual.

292
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,000
The unusual orientation of the bond dipole in boron trihydride causes it to interact with

293
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,680
the pi system of the alkene in such a way that the hydrogen preferentially positions

294
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,560
itself above the more substituted carbon.

295
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,000
This point, we produce what's called an alkyl borane.

296
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,160
And finally, the borane group is reacted with hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide to replace

297
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,980
the borane with a hydroxyl group.

298
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,400
This leads to the anti-Markovnikov hydration of an alkene, so this is an alcohol that's

299
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,800
made with syn-stereochemistry.

300
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,400
A final distinction between ethers and alcohols is the lack of an acidic hydrogen in ethers.

301
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,520
Now, because ethers don't act as acids under common laboratory conditions, they find use

302
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,400
much more frequently as solvents than as reagents, but they're critical materials nonetheless.

303
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,120
So after everything that we've been through so far today, you're probably stealing yourself

304
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,640
for a new round of complex mechanisms depicting synthesis of ethers.

305
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Well, I have some good news for you.

306
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,400
You can relax a little bit because ethers can be synthesized using analogs of two of the

307
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,760
three reactions that we just discussed, simply by substituting the desired alkyl group for

308
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,160
the appropriate hydrogen.

309
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,120
For example, instead of acid-catalyzed hydration to form 2-methyl-2-butanol, we can simply

310
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,120
replace water with an alcohol leading to the corresponding sec-butyl ether.

311
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,320
In a similar way, oxymercuration and demercuration in an alcohol solvent rather than water leads

312
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,120
to a Markovnikov ether product without the rearrangement.

313
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,680
Now, unfortunately, the complexities of the oxidation step in hydroboration and oxidation

314
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,320
make it impossible to produce ethers from alkenes using this method.

315
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,520
But there is a solution to this problem.

316
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,000
It's not only the last reaction in our synthesis segment of the lecture, but the first in our

317
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
reactions segment.

318
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,080
Although alcohols, and particularly ethers, are most frequently used as solvents in organic

319
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,360
chemistry, there are situations in which alcohols can be reactants.

320
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,680
The difference in the utility of these chemical cousins lies in their most obvious difference,

321
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,680
the presence of an acidic hydrogen.

322
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,640
Recall from earlier that I mentioned the most simple aliphatic alcohols have a pKa of about

323
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,880
16, which makes them very weakly acidic.

324
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,380
But acidic nonetheless.

325
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,060
So in the presence of a suitably basic environment, alcohols can be deprotonated to form their

326
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,940
conjugate bases, called alkoxides.

327
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,740
So let's look at an example of the formation of an alkoxide.

328
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,300
Here's an alcohol that we've already discussed, t-butanol.

329
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:44,940
Now this has a pKa of about 16, so when placed in the presence of a reagent like sodium hydride,

330
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,980
which presents or reacts as a hydride, we have a reaction take place.

331
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:56,900
It's a proton transfer, in which the hydride removes the proton from that t-butanol.

332
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,620
This produces t-butoxide ion, sodium ions, and a little bit of molecular hydrogen.

333
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,780
But the molecular hydrogen, remember, has a pKa of about 35 compared to 16 for my t-butyl

334
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,300
alcohol.

335
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,260
So this reaction is highly favored, and not only that, the hydrogen gas effervesces and

336
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,060
escapes into the atmosphere.

337
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,020
Once it's gone, clearly the reaction can never go back.

338
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:27,420
So this is a very effective way to make t-butoxide ions.

339
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,860
We can use these t-butoxide ions in something called a Williams and Ether synthesis, in

340
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,740
which the alkoxide is reacted with an alkyl halide of low substitution, something like

341
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,500
methyl chloride.

342
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,900
In this case we expect the alkoxide will attack the electrophilic carbon here of the methyl

343
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,340
chloride displacing the chloride leaving group.

344
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,660
So it proceeds through this intermediate state, where one bond is forming and the other breaking,

345
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:02,340
and concludes with the formation of t-butyl methyl ether and a halide ion byproduct.

346
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,540
Now Williams and Ether synthesis are very useful, but they're not always useful.

347
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,900
We have to consider the substitution of the R groups on the ether.

348
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,940
This is best shown by example.

349
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,180
So here are three different ethers that we might want to make, di-t-butyl ether, t-butyl

350
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,340
methyl ether, and ethyl methyl ether.

351
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,220
So let's ask ourselves if we could form each one of these using a Williams and Ether synthesis.

352
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,660
Let's start with di-t-butyl ether.

353
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,320
There's only one combination of alcohol and alkyl halide which would lead to this particular

354
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,740
ether, and because we're stuck using a tertiary substrate in what would be an SN2 reaction,

355
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,580
this can't be done.

356
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,620
So Williamson doesn't solve our problem of forming di-t-butyl ethers.

357
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
What about t-butyl methyl ethers?

358
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,860
Well, we can certainly accomplish it, and you know that I can because you've seen it

359
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,820
in the previous slide, using methyl chloride, because methyl chloride is completely unsubstituted

360
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:05,420
and therefore the back side of the carbon-chlorine bond is available for nucleophilic attack.

361
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,140
But what about turning the tables and trying to use methyl alcohol and t-butyl chloride?

362
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,060
Well, in theory this sounds good, but remember we have a tertiary substrate now in an SN2

363
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,020
reaction, so this is going to be more of an elimination reaction setup and is not likely

364
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,660
to form the ether that we want.

365
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:29,180
Similar analysis for ethyl methyl ether leads to the conclusion that we could use ethanol

366
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:36,940
and methyl chloride, which is a methyl substrate, or we could use methanol and ethyl chloride,

367
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,500
because this involves a primary substrate.

368
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,580
So as you can see, there are situations in which the Williamson ether synthesis is completely

369
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:50,340
useless to us, situations in which it's useful to us as long as synthetic design is properly

370
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,900
conducted, and others in which there are many different ways to make the same product using

371
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,140
different reagents.

372
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,340
But remember, alcohols are amphoteric, meaning they can also accept the proton to become their

373
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
conjugate acid.

374
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,660
So let's take a moment and think instead about that protonated oxonium ion.

375
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,420
Protonation of an alcohol under various acidic conditions changes what would be a poor hydroxide

376
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,300
leaving group into a much more stable water leaving group.

377
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,300
That's right, what was the nucleophile and basic solution is instead the electrophilic

378
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,380
substrate under acidic conditions.

379
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,820
This is, in fact, what Cordus had unwittingly accomplished.

380
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,900
By mixing ethanol with sulfuric acid, he created a situation in which a portion of the ethanol

381
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,100
was protonated, and the remaining neutral alcohol molecules then attacked the oxonium

382
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:47,060
ions, creating the diethyl ether he observed.

383
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,220
Now because this reaction wasn't really optimized for SN1 or SN2, it's likely that he unwittingly

384
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,060
produced a fair amount of ethylene as well, because this is the elimination product obtained

385
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,220
when the dehydration of ethanol takes place.

386
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,500
But in defensive Cordus, Christingold's work, which elucidated those mechanisms, was still

387
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,020
about four centuries away from being performed, so I think we can forgive him for his suboptimal

388
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,540
synthetic design.

389
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,940
Nonetheless, alcohols in acidic solution are prone to substitution and elimination because

390
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,460
of the stability of the water group which leaves oxonium ions.

391
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,540
So alcohol functional groups can be turned into good substrates for substitution by altering

392
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,660
the hydroxyl group to make it a better leaving group.

393
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,460
Cordus used sulfuric acid to produce oxonium in which water is a leaving group, but many

394
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,540
other strategies exist.

395
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,820
For example, alcohols can be converted into chlorides using a reagent called thionylchloride.

396
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,380
The thionylchloride is first attacked by the alcohol, producing an activated alcohol species

397
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,940
known as a sulfonate ester.

398
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,260
There's also a chloride ion made in this process.

399
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,420
Now, the new leaving group is more stable than chloride ion, which can now attack the

400
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:07,940
electrophilic center from the backside substituting it.

401
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,260
Similar strategy can be used to brominate alcohols using phosphorus tribromide.

402
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,220
This reagent produces a phosphonate ester and a bromide ion.

403
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,180
The combination of alcohols with a reagent called tosylchloride also produces a better

404
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,860
leaving group called a tosylate.

405
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,220
And this strategy is used frequently to activate primary and secondary alcohols for use in

406
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,180
SN2 reactions.

407
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,100
So let's finish up the day by taking a look at our sucralose synthesis again.

408
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,820
You'll recall that earlier we took a look at sucrose and asked ourselves how can we

409
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,300
convert this into sucralose.

410
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,220
And we concluded that we had to use an SN2 reaction and today we're going to finish

411
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:51,220
that discussion by choosing the SN2 reaction reagents to make it happen.

412
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,740
Now the way that this is done industrially is we first have to get rid of all these other

413
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:01,500
hydroxyl groups here that we don't want reacting when we introduce the substitution reaction.

414
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,700
This is done by placing something called an acetyl ester or an acetate group over the

415
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
alcohols.

416
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,620
We basically have masked them with a protecting group.

417
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,020
Next, we run our reaction.

418
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,620
In our case, we're going to use thionyl chloride followed by hydrochloric acid to quench the

419
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,620
reaction.

420
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,380
And when this is done, I'm going to substitute both of my primary alcohols for chlorines

421
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:29,900
and I'm also going to substitute my secondary with inversion because I'm running SN2.

422
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,940
The final step of my process, I'm going to remove the protecting groups that I placed

423
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,780
on to mask the other hydroxyls.

424
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,380
After doing that, I've arrived at the product.

425
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:45,740
And this is actually how sucralose is produced industrially today for consumption.

426
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,580
So let's take a few moments and summarize what we've covered today.

427
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,660
We took a look at the atomic structure and bonding behavior of oxygen, how its electron

428
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,140
configuration makes it most stable when it has two bonds, either as a pair of single

429
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,300
bonds or as a double bond.

430
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,580
We focused on the oxygen atom in sp3 hybridization states in which it has two lone pairs and

431
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,260
two sigma bonds and how it leads to three possibilities, either two bonded hydrogens

432
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:20,580
producing water, one alkyl group and one hydrogen producing an alcohol, or two bonded alkyl

433
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,120
groups creating an ether.

434
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,260
We discussed how alcohol groups have that special designation of functional group in

435
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,740
IUPAC nomenclature and how their less reactive ether cousins don't enjoy the same distinction,

436
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:40,820
instead being named as alkanes having alkoxy substituents.

437
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,100
We covered techniques for synthesizing alcohols and ethers, including acid-catalyzed addition

438
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,020
which results in Markovnikov products, but which are prone to rearrangement.

439
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,980
We looked at how Hoffman and Sands solved the rearrangement problem with oxymercuration

440
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,700
and demercuration.

441
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,500
We also considered how one might make an anti-Markovnikov alcohol or ether product from alkenes

442
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,860
using hydroboration and oxidation as the pathway.

443
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,220
We took a look at the reactivity of alcohols and how their amphoteric nature makes them

444
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:17,740
prone to act as electrophiles or substrates in acidic media, but as nucleophiles in extremely

445
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,420
basic environments.

446
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,180
Finally, we investigated a few methods of activating alcohols by converting their hydroxyl

447
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,260
groups into more reactive leaving groups.

448
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,380
Specifically, we looked at sulfonate esters, phosphonate esters, and tosylates.

449
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,220
We saw specifically how sulfonate esters are employed in the synthesis of the sugar

450
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,780
substitute sucralose.

451
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,300
So there's no denying that alcohols and ethers are versatile solvents and reagents, but there's

452
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,140
much more to the remarkable role of oxygen in organic synthesis.

453
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,460
We'll cover even more of it next time, including a look at the role of oxygen-containing compounds

454
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,940
and their chemistry in the aftermath of a night of enjoying a few cold beers.

455
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,100
I'll see you then.
