0	16980	So last time we took a look at how benzene rings were first discovered, the debate over
16980	22580	their structure, and exactly why they possessed such an unusual stability.
22580	27740	The benzene ring is a pervasive motif in organic chemistry, not only because of its stability,
27740	34520	but also for its complex, yet predictable and controllable reactivity.
34520	38500	As we discussed previously, benzene is an aromatic compound.
38500	43060	In fact, it's the structural basis for aromatic compounds, though how they got this name is
43060	47180	something of a mystery since only some of them have strong or pleasing odors.
47180	52260	Nonetheless, this moniker has stuck with benzene in its derivatives for nearly two centuries.
52260	57540	Now, as an aromatic, the pi electrons in a benzene ring are not nearly as susceptible
57540	62220	to undergoing addition reactions as their non-aromatic counterparts.
62220	66260	We discussed how heats of hydrogenation are evidence of just how stable benzene rings
66260	73020	really are in the face of addition reactions, which require them to sacrifice their aromaticity.
73020	75940	But what about substitution reactions?
75940	80540	Is it possible to entice benzene to react in such a way that one of its six-ring hydrogens
80540	85620	can be replaced with a more complex functional group of our choosing without sacrificing
85620	87820	its aromaticity?
87820	91940	The answer to this question is yes, and one of the most frequently employed pathways to
91940	98500	accomplish this is electrophilic aromatic substitution.
98500	102580	During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the science of organic chemistry was booming
102580	105060	in both Europe and America.
105060	109420	Many names with which we are familiar today were hard at work during this time period,
109420	114700	devising new ways to make and break chemical bonds in a useful fashion.
114700	120380	One such chemist was Adolf von Beyer, who in 1873 was working at the University of Strasbourg
120380	121380	in Germany.
121380	127180	Now, Beyer was supervising a graduate student by the name of Othmar Zeidler, whose graduate
127180	135100	project included the synthesis of a substituted benzene compound known as Dichlorodifenyltrichloroethane,
135100	138620	DDT for short.
138620	144340	Zeidler's synthesis of his compound was accomplished using chlorobenzene and chloral, under acidic
144340	146420	conditions.
146420	152260	Under these conditions, the two chlorobenzene rings are joined by substituting the chloral
152260	156500	for hydrogens in the parallel location on each ring.
156500	161860	Zeidler's synthesis in 1873 was largely viewed as an academic exercise.
161860	166740	Neither he nor his revered mentor, Beyer, had any idea that this compound would ultimately
166740	171380	alter the course of human history some seven decades later.
172380	177700	See, it was only during and after World War II that the insecticidal properties of DDT
177700	183860	were discovered and applied with breathtakingly effective results.
183860	188620	The Swiss chemist, Paul Mueller, is credited with later discovering and documenting, and
188620	194620	also obtaining Swiss patents for, the insecticidal use of this compound, after which the US government
194620	198580	tested and used the compound to combat infectious diseases abroad.
199300	205860	You see, DDT was such a powerful, broad spectrum and long-lasting insecticide that its use could
205860	211500	eradicate entire populations of disease-carrying insects, so efficiently that the disease they
211500	215900	carried was eliminated as well.
215900	220740	This includes a notable quelling of a typhus outbreak in Naples in the dead of winter.
220740	225140	Until that time, such insect-borne epidemics could only be combated by bearing down and
225140	226980	waiting for spring.
227540	232020	Additionally, there are many examples in which DDT was used to wipe out malaria completely
232020	235060	in confined populations.
235060	239780	Shortly after the conclusion of World War II, the US government began to allow commercial
239780	243620	use of DDT for pest control and domestic crop production.
243620	249220	Clearly, DDT had changed the world.
249220	254100	In the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony speech for Dr. Mueller, Professor G. Fisher noted of
254100	256740	Mueller's discovery, quoting here,
256740	262900	At requisite insecticidal dosages, it is practically non-toxic to humans and acts in very small
262900	267220	dosages on large number of various species of insects.
267220	273700	Furthermore, it's cheap, easily manufactured, and exceedingly stable, unquote.
273700	278740	Clearly, in 1948, the scientific community was riding high on the success of this newly
278740	282740	discovered use of DDT.
282740	289940	Unfortunately, the stability and long-lasting effects of DDT also proved to be its undoing.
289940	295620	DDT lasted so long in the environment that it could be transmitted from insects to fish,
295620	300660	and from fish to birds, where it had the unintended effect of inhibiting calcium production in
300660	302340	those birds.
302340	305700	This caused them to produce eggs with thinner shells than normal,
305700	309700	and many bird species, most notably birds of prey like eagles,
309700	315060	osprey and hawks, suffered tremendous population declines due to the presence of DDT in their
315060	318420	food sources.
318420	323620	In 1962, environmentalist and Johns Hopkins University-trained marine biologist,
323620	327860	Rachel Carson, published the book Silent Spring.
327860	331620	This book is considered one of the seminal works in modern environmentalism,
331620	336580	and it spends a great deal of its time on the U.S. agricultural industry's use of DDT
336580	344100	as a prime example of how rampant use of such compounds can lead to environmental disaster.
344100	351060	It was only in 1972, just shy of a century after its first synthesis, and three decades
351060	356420	since its implementation as an insecticide, that the U.S. banned the use of DDT in agricultural
356420	358100	applications.
358100	366020	Today, it only finds use in emergencies as a vector control agent to prevent the spread of disease.
366020	368260	So why am I telling you this story?
368260	372660	Well, because it's a shining example of how organic chemistry can change the world,
372660	375940	both for the better and for the worse.
375940	382420	The synthesis of DDT is also a shining example of an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction,
382420	386340	the topic of today's lesson.
386340	390420	Today, we will build on our understanding of the structure of benzene by investigating this
390420	392820	very useful class of reactions.
392820	396340	We'll investigate the general mechanism by which it takes place.
396340	400580	We'll discuss how other reagents often need to be activated to make them reactive enough
400580	405780	to entice the substantially stabilized benzene ring to react with them.
405780	410260	We'll learn about just a handful of the many modifications that we can make to benzene.
410260	414900	And finally, we'll consider how already modified benzene's can be further modified to produce
414900	420580	some of those orthometa and paraisomers that we talked about last time.
420660	426420	Electrophilic aromatic substitution is so named because the newly attached motif starts out as
426420	433140	an electrophile, unlike nucleophilic substitution in which the newly added group is nucleophilic.
433140	437540	So let's begin by looking at a reaction coordinate diagram for the reaction of benzene
437540	442580	and a generic electrophile. Here, I'm just going to use E plus to identify the electrophile,
442580	446740	but we'll soon look at some real examples.
446740	451700	Recall that even though they're in an aromatic system, the pi electrons of benzene are still
451700	457620	not held as tightly as most sigma bonding electrons. And although it takes an extraordinarily
457620	461220	electrophilic reagent to coax them into attacking, it can be done.
462740	467460	When an adequately electrophilic reagent is added to benzene, the pi electrons of benzene
467460	473380	simply can't resist attacking, and in doing so, they generate a tetrahedral center adjacent to
473380	479860	a resonance stabilized carbocation. We call this intermediate a sigma complex because we
479860	484740	have traded two of our pi electrons to make a new sigma bond to the electrophile.
487700	493460	Clearly, even with the newly formed more stable sigma bond, the sigma complex is a much higher
493460	498900	energy than the starting material. And this is mainly because the ring has lost its aromaticity
498900	501860	and the associated stability that comes from that aromaticity.
504420	508660	Under conditions like this, the intermediate will immediately begin to look for ways to dispense
508660	514740	with the positive charge of the carbocation and recover its aromaticity. Naturally, the simplest
514740	519220	way to remove the newly acquired positive charge is to lose a proton to the solvent,
520020	526180	but which proton exactly will be lost? We'll take a look at that tetrahedral center we generated
526180	532020	in the first step. If we remove one of the substituents about this center in a heterogenic bond
532020	537220	cleavage, we can repopulate the aromatic ring using the bonding electrons which were holding
537220	543060	that substituent in place. Removal of the electrophile would produce an uninteresting result
543060	548500	since we'd simply return to the starting materials. But what if instead we remove the proton on the
548500	554420	same tetrahedral center? A molecule of solvent or another weak base is usually all it takes
554420	559780	to abstract that proton, leading to a return to aromaticity and therefore stability,
559780	565220	while leaving the new benzene electrophile bond intact. Our substitution reactions complete.
567940	573540	Zeidler's synthesis of DDT relied on this mechanism to couple two molecules of chlorobenzene
573540	579540	to a compound known as chloral. He was able to substitute chloral for one of the ring hydrogens
579540	584580	of chlorobenzene, creating an intermediate which substituted for yet another ring hydrogen
584580	590580	on a second molecule of chlorobenzene. This somewhat complicated use of electrophilic
590580	594420	aromatic substitution will make more sense to us as we continue through the lecture.
596740	600420	As simple as our electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism seems,
601380	605780	getting such a reaction started can be complicated because it requires a species so
605780	610660	electronegative, so hungry for electrons that it can compensate for the temporary loss of
610660	616420	aromaticity during the reaction's first step. Indeed, the key to successful substitution
616420	621940	is to generate an adequately electrophilic substitution reagent. Now remember what makes
621940	627860	a good electrophile, high positive charge density, and the ability to accept electrons to form a new
627860	636660	bond. Back to Zeidler's synthesis of DDT, chloral itself is not electrophilic enough to react with
636660	642260	the aromatic electrons of chlorobenzene, and this is why he added a small amount of sulfuric acid to
642260	648740	his reaction. Sulfuric acid is strong enough to protonate a carbonyl group like that of chloral,
649460	654740	increasing the electrophilic character of its carbonyl carbon. It's this protonated carbonyl
654740	660420	species which is key to starting the reaction, which ultimately produced his history-changing compound.
663140	667380	Over the past two centuries, many researchers have devised ways to substitute benzene using
667380	673060	many familiar functional groups. Now three of these groups we'll discuss today. Those are
673060	682500	nitration, halogenation, and alkylation. In all three of these cases, simply mixing benzene with,
682500	688500	say, nitric acid, molecular bromine, or an alkyl halide will not achieve the desired reaction.
689540	693940	We need to find ways to make each of these three reagents even more electrophilic than they already
693940	698580	are. So let's look at how each of these three can be accomplished one by one.
701220	705620	Nitration of benzene is typically achieved by adding a bit of sulfuric acid to the mixture.
706820	711220	The purpose of the sulfuric acid is to protonate the nitric acid. That's right,
711300	717380	nitric acid is going to act as a base. And this may sound crazy, but sulfuric acid is extremely
717380	722580	strong, with a pKa of about negative two. Strong enough that it can protonate just a small amount
722580	730580	of nitric acid and get the process started. Once protonated, nitric acid can lose a water molecule
730580	736100	to form a species known as nitronium. The electron cloud around the nitronium is similar to that of
736180	742980	carbon dioxide, but it has a central nitrogen atom instead. Now, that extra proton in the nucleus
742980	749140	of nitrogen means that the nitrogen now has a plus one charge associated with it. And this dense
749140	753860	region of positive charge, complete with oxygen atoms ready to accept pi electrons as the attack
753860	758740	occurs, is all that it takes to make an effective electrophile for nitration.
758740	766740	This reaction can be used to produce nitrobenzene, which is frequently used as an organic solvent,
767300	773060	but it can also be used to create a number of very useful products. Let's take a look at one now.
774340	778660	Let's nitrate a compound called phenol using the same strategy that we just discussed.
780100	784420	This is the structure for phenol. It's benzene with a hydroxyl group attached
784420	789380	and is very easily obtained from coal tar extracts. So this compound was available to
789380	797700	chemists working in the early 1800s. If we add to that sulfuric acid H2SO4 with the sulfur atom
797700	804020	indicated here in yellow and nitric acid HNO3, the nitrogen atom in the center here in blue,
804900	810900	we can expect to generate a nitronium electrophile. Now, all of these materials have been readily
810900	815540	available for quite some time, so this was a very simple reaction to run very early in the
815540	821460	history of organic chemistry. Our sulfuric acid is going to transfer its proton to the nitric acid.
822260	825860	Even if only a small amount does this, it's enough to get the reaction started.
827060	832020	The product of this is our protonated nitric acid and a hydrogen sulfate anion,
832020	839940	the conjugate base of H2SO4. Now, once protonated, the nitric acid can lose this water functional
839940	847780	group, generating the nitronium ion and a water byproduct. As the reaction proceeds, the nitronium
847780	853940	ion is attacked by the phenol and forms that new sigma bond to create the sigma complex.
854980	858900	But we've lost our aromaticity now and we have a carbocation instead.
860180	864020	So to relieve this loss of aromaticity, in this case I'm going to show water
864580	868420	taking the proton from the tetrahedral center, which is in back here just behind the carbon,
869940	876580	and in doing so it will reestablish aromaticity, having left behind the newly attached nitro group.
877620	881620	So we've completed one round of nitration of phenol,
883940	887940	but it doesn't have to stop there. There are four more hydrogens on the ring,
888980	893780	and in the case of nitronium and the case of phenol, they react so well together that using a
893780	899380	little bit more nitric and sulfuric acid can result in this compound, a trinitro phenol
899380	907220	known as picric acid. Now picric acid is noteworthy because it's a chemical cousin of trinitrotoluene
907220	914340	or TNT, but it was easier to make, was discovered much earlier, and believe it or not, has an even
914340	920980	higher explosive yield. No community can attest better to the explosive power of picric acid
920980	926900	than the community of Halifax Nova Scotia, which was devastated by an immense blast from a French
926900	934340	cargo ship carrying this wartime munition in 1917. After colliding with another ship in the bay,
934340	938820	the French ship Mont Blanc caught fire, prompting the crew to evacuate the ship.
940340	945620	The resulting blast when the cargo detonated has been estimated at a force equivalent to about
945620	951940	three kilotons of TNT, creating a one mile wide swath of complete and utter destruction.
952900	957940	Now that yield is about one-fifth the explosive yield of the nuclear bomb which destroyed Hiroshima
957940	963060	nearly 30 years later at the end of World War II. This is a true testament to the
963060	967700	reactivity of nitro groups and what they can bring to organic compounds. As the aromatic
967700	972500	stabilization of benzene is clearly dramatically overwhelmed by the instability of the three
972500	978100	nitro groups which are introduced to it by this method. Halogenation of benzene is another useful
978180	983780	synthetic process, but again one which cannot be achieved simply by mixing benzene and molecular
983780	990500	halogens like chlorine. In this case inorganic complexes like aluminum-3 chloride or iron-3
990500	995860	chloride are used to induce a strong dipole in the molecular halogen bond.
998500	1004820	This method of chlorination is so effective that when taken to extremes all six hydrogens from a
1004820	1012980	benzene can be substituted with chlorine producing hexachlorobenzene. Now this halogenated hydrocarbon
1012980	1019620	is a powerful antifungal agent which was used in the 1940s 50s and 60s to protect wheat crops
1019620	1024260	before its use was discontinued over, you guessed it, environmental concerns.
1026020	1031620	The same type of catalyst can be used to enhance the dipole of an alkyl halide to produce an alkylation.
1032500	1037620	Now alkylated benzene compounds produced in this way can be used to make such useful products as
1037620	1044740	synthetic detergents. And there's a long library of catalysts and tricks to attach a wide variety
1044740	1050020	of functional groups to benzene, but we're going to conclude our discussion with these three examples
1050020	1053780	and as I continue through the remainder of the lecture I'll try to use these three for
1053780	1058740	demonstration purposes, but keep in mind that the huge range of modifications are possible.
1061940	1071060	So we've taken a look at what happens when we substitute just one hydrogen on a benzene ring,
1071060	1076500	like its nitration, and when we substitute all of its protons like we did using chlorine and
1076500	1082660	aluminum-3 chloride catalyst. In cases like these only one possible isomer of the intended product
1082660	1088980	exists, but we also took a look at picric acid which has some but not all of the hydrogens
1088980	1095300	around its aromatic ring substituted, and this presents a new consideration. The isomer that
1095300	1103140	I showed you in the slide has three nitrates at the two, four, and six positions, but why not this
1103140	1111460	isomer, right, two, three, four, or maybe this isomer, three, four, five. Now you can see the
1111460	1117060	issue that we're facing here. Once a substituent has been placed on the ring the remaining hydrogens
1117060	1123540	are no longer equivalent. We have two ortho, two meta, and one para positions around the ring.
1124980	1129060	So we must now ask ourselves if the second substitution will take place preferentially
1129060	1134180	at one of these positions, or will we get a statistical mixture of all three possibilities.
1135940	1142260	This consideration is well illustrated by Zeidler's successful DDT synthesis. I say successful in the
1142260	1149380	sense that he was able to modify two chlorobenzines only at their para positions. If his electrophilic
1149380	1155860	aromatic substitution methodology caused substitutions at random locations around the ring we would
1155860	1160820	expect that any given sample of chlorobenzine molecules should produce a mixture of products
1160820	1171540	which are 40% ortho, 40% meta, and only 20% para. Moreover, the chances of a second substitution
1171540	1177860	occurring at the para position are again 20%, leaving a paltry 4% of the final product in the
1177860	1185060	preferred configuration. Yet when Zeidler's synthesis is performed the desired regioisomer
1185060	1191300	is the major product that's obtained. So how did it come to be that chlorobenzine selectively
1191300	1198900	undergoes electrophilic substitution at its para position? We call this tendency for a reaction
1198900	1204740	to occur at one particular position among several similar positions, regiospecificity.
1206180	1210500	Functional groups attached to benzene rings alter not only the reactivity of the ring,
1211060	1217540	but the regiospecificity of subsequent additions as well. Now recall we noted earlier that there
1217540	1223620	are three different positions available to react in a substituted benzene ring, two ortho, two meta,
1223700	1229060	and one para. So based on this distribution one might expect that, for example,
1229060	1234900	brominating in nitrobenzene molecule would yield a mixture of products which is 40% ortho,
1234900	1242740	40% meta, and 20% para substituted. Yet when we conduct this reaction we find that this
1242740	1248500	distribution of products is rarely the case. In fact, we usually find a preponderance of one
1248500	1254500	product with just a small amount of the others. So how does this preference to substitute at a
1254500	1261300	particular location on the ring happen? Well the answer lies in the stability of the sigma complex
1261300	1267620	intermediates of all three reaction pathways. So let's start by analyzing the three possible
1267620	1272740	pathways for the electrophilic aromatic substitution of a chlorobenzene molecule.
1273700	1279300	Notice that when an electrophile finds itself at the meta position we see an intermediate form
1279300	1284740	in which re-resonance contributors can form, all of which look very similar to those in a simple
1284740	1291940	benzene ring undergoing substitution. However, when an electrophile attaches to the para position
1291940	1297140	or the ortho position of the ring something interesting happens. We can draw a fourth resonance
1297140	1302180	contributor and you may recall from our earlier discussions on resonance that more resonance
1302420	1308740	contributors means a more stable species. And we can rely on something called Hammond's Postulate
1308740	1314180	which tells us that a more stable intermediate and a rate limiting step leads to a faster reaction.
1316820	1322260	So plotting reaction coordinate diagrams for the three possible products of any electrophilic
1322260	1328740	substitution of chlorobenzene might look something like this. With the meta intermediate being similar
1328740	1334420	in energy to the substitution of benzene but the ortho and para intermediates being lower in energy
1335300	1339060	thus lowering the activation energies of the pathways for those two products.
1341380	1346260	So we have successfully demonstrated why the meta position of chlorobenzene is less reactive than
1346260	1352100	the ortho in the para positions. In fact, chlorine is part of a class of substituents which we call
1352100	1358580	ortho-paradirectors. However, we've not yet explained exactly why the para position is
1358580	1365380	substituted more than the ortho in this case. This requires that we look to our second consideration,
1365380	1367140	ring activation and deactivation.
1369540	1374100	See the second consideration here is that the already attached group may withdraw or
1374100	1379780	donate electron density to the ring. Reducing electron density within the ring makes it less
1379780	1384980	likely to attack. Since doing so would only increase the magnitude of the charge generated on the
1384980	1391060	intermediate. Conversely, donating additional electron density to the ring would be expected
1391060	1398340	to activate the ring and make it even more reactive. One of the traits which makes chlorine and
1398340	1402740	bromine so interesting in this reaction type is that they withdraw electrons from the ring
1402740	1408900	inductively. This means that the electronegativity of chlorine causes it to pull electrons out of
1408900	1415460	the ring through bonds like current through a wire. And unlike resonance which has the effect
1415460	1420500	of causing charges to jump every other atom, inductive effects attenuate with distance.
1421700	1426580	So this gives us an explanation for the strong preference for the para substitution over ortho.
1427460	1431940	The higher positive charge on the ortho atoms of chlorobenzene simply makes them less likely
1431940	1435220	to attack an electrophile and take on even more positive charge.
1435860	1441540	If we turn our attention to the synthesis of DDT one more time, we now understand how Zyla was able
1441540	1447300	to produce the specific isomer he wanted. The chlorine substituent on his starting material
1447300	1452420	directed the chloral substitution to the para position, ensuring that the proper structural
1452420	1459220	isomer was obtained. Not only that, but the newly attached chloral group quickly dehydrates under
1460180	1467620	acidic conditions to produce a new electrophile. This deactivates the already attached ring,
1467620	1472980	discouraging additional substitutions, while simultaneously encouraging a second chlorobenzene
1472980	1481380	to attack, leading to the product DDT. The final product of Zydler's synthesis can be
1481380	1487140	thought of as two disubstituted rings bearing deactivating substituents. So the desired product
1487140	1494500	forms in great abundance with very limited byproduct formation. So now that we understand
1494500	1499140	how substituents can affect the sites on which substituted benzenes are modified in electrophilic
1499140	1504740	aromatic substitutions, let's take a quick look at some common motifs and how they affect reactivity.
1507780	1512100	Activating ortho-para directors include groups such as the amine group of aniline,
1512660	1516500	the hydroxyl group of phenol, and the methoxy group of anisol.
1518020	1522100	Groups like these have the ability to donate electrons to the ring by resonance.
1525220	1531300	Deactivating ortho-para directors include halogens like fluorine, chlorine and bromine.
1532500	1537700	These groups direct by donating electrons in resonance, but deactivate because of the strong
1537700	1545140	dipole they create in the carbon halogen bond. Finally, we have deactivating metadirectors,
1545140	1552020	such as nitrates, carboxylic acids and aldehydes, which all draw electrons strongly by resonance.
1553220	1556740	Now notice that all of these groups contain a heteroatom two bonds away from the ring,
1557380	1562900	while all of our activators contain the heteroatom adjacent to the ring. That's not a coincidence.
1563060	1569620	Now the true utility and importance of directing effects on synthesis can be seen in this simple
1569620	1576660	illustration. The bromination of nitrobenzene produces mainly meta-bromonitrobenzene,
1576660	1583460	owing to the metadirecting nitro group. Yet the nitration of bromobenzene produces mainly
1583460	1590660	para-bromonitrobenzene, owing to the ortho-paradirecting bromogroup. So in this case, the order in
1590660	1595860	which I carry out my substitutions on the benzene has a direct effect on the product that I obtain.
1597540	1601700	Now let's consider the activating effects of substituents and how they can affect a synthetic
1601700	1608900	outcome as well. A one-to-one mixture of benzene and chlorine with a small amount of aluminum
1608900	1615540	chloride catalysts should produce a quantitative or complete conversion to chlorobenzene, owing
1615540	1621300	to the deactivating nature of the chloro groups. Since chlorobenzene itself is less reactive than
1621300	1626100	benzene, we don't expect much of the chlorinated product or rather we don't expect much of the
1626100	1632980	dichlorinated product to form. Yet a one-to-one mixture of benzene with ethyl chloride and
1632980	1640260	catalytic aluminum chloride produces a mixture of benzene, ethyl benzene, diethyl benzene isomers,
1640260	1646420	and even some triethylbenzene. Now the reason for this is that the alkyl groups are activating,
1646420	1651620	so as a small amount of ethyl benzene forms in the reaction mixture, its increased reactivity
1651620	1656820	means that its conversion to diethylbenzene will outpace alkylation of the remaining starting
1656820	1662580	material. In situations like this, we have to turn to some tricks to achieve a single alkylation.
1663220	1667700	For example, using a huge excess of benzene in order to dilute the electrophile to the point
1667700	1671220	at which two alkylations on a single molecule becomes very unlikely.
1677940	1682420	Today we have investigated the ability of electrophiles to substitute themselves for ring
1682420	1688020	hydrogens of benzene molecules. We've discussed how the resonance stabilization of the resulting
1688020	1693700	transition state makes it possible to entice a ring to give up its aromaticity, even if only for
1693700	1699540	an instant while the modification is occurring. We've looked at ways to generate electrophiles,
1699540	1704820	including acidification of substrates like nitric acid and chloral, as well as the use of a Lewis
1704820	1709860	acid catalyst like aluminum III chloride to activate halogens and alkyl halides.
1712260	1717220	And finally, we considered the effect of having a substituent already attached to the ring.
1717940	1723140	We saw how substituents like amine, hydroxyl, and methoxy groups, which donate electrons to the
1723140	1729300	ring, activate an ortho-paradirect. How substituents like aldehydes and nitrates,
1729300	1733540	which withdraw electrons from the ring by resonance, deactivate and metadirect.
1734740	1739300	And we also considered how the high electronegativity of halogens gives them the very unusual
1739300	1747300	property of deactivating while ortho-paradirecting. And of course, along the way, we considered how
1747300	1752820	all of these factors combined in a simple, highly efficient synthesis of a remarkably stable
1752820	1759060	molecule. A molecule with such powerful biological activity that it not only changed the world,
1759060	1762340	but ultimately the way that humans think about how we interact with the world.
1763300	1769700	Powerful chemistry indeed. Speaking of biological systems, in the next few lectures,
1769700	1773860	we're going to take our organic chemistry knowledge to the interface between chemistry
1773860	1780660	and biology. As we investigate the large, complex molecules of life, including carbohydrates,
1780660	1786820	nucleic acids, proteins, through the eyes of an organic chemist. I'll see you then.
