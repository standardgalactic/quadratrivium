0	17500	In our journey through introductory organic chemistry, we've spent a great deal of time
17500	23240	looking at ways to prepare organic compounds from one another, as well as ways to characterize
23240	29200	the starting materials and products of the reactions that we have undertaken.
29200	33560	So we've left one very important question yet unanswered.
33560	40240	You see, it's very rare that any organic synthesis runs cleanly to absolute completion,
40240	46720	producing no byproducts and leaving no starting materials behind.
46720	54040	It's even rarer that we find organic materials in highly purified forms in natural sources.
54040	59720	So knowing this, we have to ask ourselves the question, how do we purify organic materials
59720	64780	sufficiently to study the molecules which make it up, or for that matter to use as food
64780	73000	additives, medicines, or other applications which require very high levels of purity?
73000	77920	In this segment of the course, we will investigate a few staple techniques used for isolation
77920	82680	of organics in modern laboratory and manufacturing settings.
82680	86720	Today in particular, we'll be interested in taking a look at two very important and
86720	93680	widely used techniques, one for purification and the other to determine purities.
93680	101800	And both of them rely on the tendency of organic molecules to form highly-ordered crystals.
101800	107200	To find one of the first examples of mass-scale organic purification will take us to India
107200	110400	in the 5th century BC.
110400	115720	Now evidence shows that it was just around this time that the people of India began harvesting
115720	123720	a wild reed which, when they chewed on it, became sweet-tasting and pleasant.
123720	128080	This commodity quickly caught on in other regions of Asia and Europe.
128080	133960	The Greek physician Diascorides wrote of it in the 1st century AD and records from the
133960	140560	Tang dynasty confirmed that it was being cultivated in China as early as 600 AD.
140560	145480	But the real turning point in the global spread of this product took place in the 3rd century
145480	147200	AD.
147200	153040	During this time, most of what is now Northern India was ruled by the Gupta dynasty.
153040	159560	The Gupta dynasty is famous for its deep and altruistic value of cultural development.
159560	166280	And economically beneficial cultural benefit, well, that was that much better.
166280	170680	So it was during this golden age of Indian culture that techniques were developed to
170680	176840	extract the juice from these reeds, then allow it to form crystals by drying it slowly in
176840	178940	the sun.
178940	184800	These crystals, it turns out, retained the sweet flavor of the reeds, yet spoiled far
184800	188320	more slowly in their new crystalline form.
188320	194560	Okay, by now you probably have put two and two together and figured out that I'm talking
194560	197920	about crystalline sugar sucrose.
197920	203360	It's extracted from sugarcane as a solution and then crystallized to create a more viable
203360	205360	product.
205360	210080	Now what you may not have known, though, is that by developing this process, the people
210080	216440	of the Gupta kingdom were unwittingly performing what may have been mankind's first ever
216440	222280	recrystallization experiment.
222280	228920	So how is it that crystalline sucrose was stumbled onto so early in human history?
228920	234760	After all, when most of us think about crystals, we think about very rare, expensive, and difficult
234760	237200	to acquire materials.
237400	248040	Well, it turns out that it is really not so surprising at all that crystalline organics
248040	253080	might be some of the very first organic compounds isolated by man.
253080	257320	The reason for this is hidden in the Gibbs free energy of crystals.
257320	263200	Now, crystals are highly ordered, they're very ordered repeating arrangements of atoms
263200	265240	or molecules.
265240	271560	But organic molecules can also achieve this highly repeating patterns in the solid state.
271560	278720	When they do so, the intermolecular attractions between and among the molecules become stronger
278720	283280	and the free energy of the system naturally decreases.
283280	289240	Since lower energy states are favored in nature, it stands to reason that highly ordered materials
289240	295560	can form if the energetic benefit of their interactions exceeds the entropic penalty
295560	301600	of assuming a highly ordered state.
301600	306520	So let's take a look at a crystal structure forming and see if we can get our heads wrapped
306520	312080	around this idea a little bit more of what makes pure crystalline materials relatively
312080	316280	easy to come by.
316280	319000	Let's start with a compound called benzomide.
319000	323840	Now, benzomide has a fairly simple crystalline structure.
323840	328000	It starts off with a pattern of repeating molecules in one of two orientations as I've
328000	329440	shown them here.
329440	333640	You notice the benzene ring and the amide groups pointing either one way or the other
333640	340040	in each of the molecules within what would be the surface of a growing crystal.
340040	341040	So here's my surface.
341040	345120	Now, as a cartoon, I'm going to just grow my crystal by dropping in the molecules.
345120	349080	We'll be talking very soon about how to practically accomplish this.
349080	352280	But for now, let's just put our crystal together.
352280	358000	So let me drop in a few more benzomide molecules in the proper orientation.
358000	363600	Okay, now that repeating structure should be even more clear to you.
363600	368000	It's very obvious that there are certain regions of the crystal where molecules are oriented
368000	374440	in specific directions in an array that arranges them relative to one another in a very, very
374440	378040	tight repeating pattern.
378040	383280	This pattern creates a network of intermolecular attractions, including hydrogen bonds.
383280	387880	Now, if I highlight them in the crystal here that I've created, it's very easy to see the
387880	391040	repeating patterns.
391040	395680	In addition to the stabilizing hydrogen bonds, there are dispersion forces, which we would
395680	400600	also call London dispersion forces or van der Waals attractions.
400600	406400	And this takes place where the pi systems of the benzene rings stack against one another,
406400	412240	very similarly to the way that purine and pyrimidine bases do in DNA in the double helix.
412240	418800	So there's an array of very carefully crafted intermolecular forces holding this crystal
418800	420760	together.
420760	426760	So this optimized set of intermolecular attractions leads to a very strongly held together, very
426760	433280	stable crystal of this particular organic material.
433280	435040	But what if I introduce something else?
435040	438680	What if my sample is not absolutely pure?
438680	442760	What kind of effect will that have on the energy of this crystal?
442760	446480	Let's do that experiment right now.
446480	452240	Let's rebuild our crystal of Benzemeib first.
452240	455560	But this time I'm going to insert a few impurities.
455560	460880	So again, here's my beautiful repeating pattern of my organic compounds aligned perfectly,
460880	465120	so I have beautiful set of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces all holding that
465120	467440	crystal together.
467440	473320	Now I'm going to take these four molecules and make one very subtle change to them.
473320	481360	I'm going to change them from Benzemeib to Benzaldehyde, taking away the NH2 group.
481360	483400	Now look what happens when I do that.
483400	488600	I have removed the ability of these molecules to form the hydrogen bonds which stabilize
488600	493640	the crystal in this very specific localized position.
493640	499680	So all of these hydrogen bonds that I've colored in red no longer can be formed.
499680	506360	So by including just a few molecules of Benzaldehyde in my pure crystal or otherwise pure crystal
506360	512680	of Benzemeib, I have decreased the overall strength of the intermolecular forces holding
512680	514400	them together.
514400	518680	So the fact that I'm missing these intermolecular attractions means that the free energy of
518680	520160	my crystal is higher.
520160	526240	In other words, it's less stable, it's a weaker crystal, and it's easier to disassemble.
526240	532080	So if we can make crystals grow very slowly, under conditions favoring the most stable crystal
532080	537240	formation with all the strongest intermolecular attractions possible, we should be able to
537240	540600	produce crystals of very high purity.
540600	545720	And this is a good thing because we rarely find compounds like sucrose all alone in nature.
545720	550760	In biologically sourced solutions like cane juice, they can be up to 20% sucrose, but
550760	555640	we find smaller concentrations of all of its subunits like glucose and fructose, as well
555640	560560	as small amounts of many other biological molecules.
560560	565760	In the days of the Gupta dynasty, this was not likely to be a concern to them.
565760	570800	Good solidified or crystallized sugar was enough to get the job done.
570800	576520	But today's chemists and chefs for that matter find need for highly purified sucrose so that
576520	584040	we can use it under more controlled conditions demanded by the state of the art.
584040	589000	So early sugar was most likely produced by evaporating water from cane juice as rapidly
589000	591520	as possible.
591520	596960	If however, the solution expelled from sugar cane is slowly allowed to concentrate past
596960	601660	the point of saturation, meaning the sugars contained therein will be compelled to take
601660	604600	on a solid form or precipitate from the solution.
604600	610800	Well, if we produce a concentrated solution of organic molecules like sucrose, then somehow
610800	615880	induce that system to become super saturated, meaning that it has more dissolved sucrose
615880	618040	than it normally could hold.
618040	623280	We expect the growing crystals of sucrose to exclude the other contaminant solutes
623280	630120	in order to achieve optimal intermolecular attractions.
630120	635280	To better understand the process of crystallization, let's take a look at a compound called phthalic
635280	636280	acid.
636280	639400	I have a sample of phthalic acid here on the bench.
639400	644440	I also have a beaker of water, which I can use to dissolve the phthalic acid.
645280	650560	Now phthalic acid has a solubility of about 18 grams per milliliter in boiling water,
650560	652640	extremely high.
652640	657580	But it's only about 0.6 per milliliter in cold water.
657580	662560	So if my phthalic acid isn't quite pure, its crystals aren't as stable as they could
662560	665080	possibly be.
665080	669080	But how are they going to get to that more purified, more stable state?
669080	673360	Clearly, the molecules in my crystals are not going to spontaneously rearrange in the
673360	678880	solid phase, expelling any contaminants that might be in them, at least not in my lifetime.
678880	681360	And this camera crew, they're paid by the hour.
681360	686480	So let's see if we can speed it up a little bit, okay?
686480	690960	So what we need to do is disassemble these crystals at the molecular level, separating
690960	695520	them all in such a way that the phthalic acid molecules get a second chance to order
695520	697960	themselves in a more stable state.
697960	702680	And of course, one way to accomplish this separation is to dissolve the crystals, separating
702680	705660	them all within a solvent.
705660	708920	So I've set myself up to do this task right here.
708920	713440	What I have is a beaker containing phthalic acid that's been purchased, which is about
713440	717920	98% pure, a smaller beaker, which I'm not going to touch.
717920	722440	This is phthalic acid, which I have contaminated with a red organic molecule, so that we can
722440	727360	see that contaminant as it behaves in the system that we're about to subject it to.
727360	731880	And the larger beaker here is what I'm actually going to be purifying.
731880	737080	And in order to purify this, I'm going to use nothing more than water and some heat.
737080	743520	Now this water is already hot, so let me get my safety glasses on just in case.
743520	748560	I'm going to turn my hot plate back on, which is also a magnetic stir plate.
748560	753200	It contains a magnetic element underneath of the surface of the ceramic hot plate, which
753200	758440	I can use to articulate this little magnetic spin bar inside.
758480	762920	So this allows me to more thoroughly heat my solvent more rapidly.
762920	766320	So while that's going, I'm going to put on some gloves.
766320	776640	And hopefully, they'll stay in one piece while I put them on.
776640	781080	So these are disposable latex gloves, they're really just designed to protect my hands from
781080	786520	the chemicals I'm dealing with, even though they're fairly safe as organic compounds go.
786520	788280	So very soon my water will be boiling.
788280	792360	I've preheated it to accelerate this process so that we can see what goes on.
792360	798000	But what I'm going to do as soon as this gets warm enough is add my water to this beaker
798000	803040	containing phthalic acid and a little bit of the red organic contaminant to see if we
803040	807680	can get rid of it by disassembling it at the molecular level through dissolution and then
807680	812720	encouraging it to crystallize, but very slowly.
812720	817200	And since this is a very hot flask of water, I'm going to put a glove over my hand to protect
817200	821400	it from the heat as well as the chemicals.
821400	825520	And let's get started with the dissolution process.
825520	834960	Again, this is fairly hot water, but you could clearly see that it wasn't completely boiling.
834960	840760	So it's going to require a little bit more help to get it to thoroughly dissolve.
840760	846080	And in order to do this, I've given myself an extra spin bar, which I'll add to the beaker
846080	847080	now.
847080	853000	And I'm going to return everything to my hot plate.
853000	856840	So we can see that the spin bar is moving because the powder is flowing, and now we need
856840	860160	to give it some time to heat up.
860160	864440	Now in this case I'm heating my recrystallization solution on a hot plate.
864440	868720	Now the surface of the hot plate can reach temperatures well in excess of 300 degrees
868720	873680	centigrade, which is hot enough to cause many organic solvents to catch fire spontaneously
873680	875080	in air.
875080	879680	So the only reason that I'm heating this particular solution the way that I am now is because
879680	883340	the solvent that I'm using is water, which is not flammable.
883340	887040	Water is essentially hydrogen that's already been burned, so it's not possible to burn
887040	890000	it any further.
890000	893640	In a future lecture, we'll actually take a look at some ways that we do heat organic
893640	898560	solvents in safer ways than what I'm doing here, again if this were in fact an organic
898560	900480	material.
900480	904200	So we've finished boiling our solution of phthalic acid.
904200	908580	Now as you can see, I'm so saturated that I'm already starting to get a little bit forming
908580	910400	on the top of my solution.
910400	913880	And also you can see that I've had to add a little bit more water as the boiling process
913880	918720	went on to be sure that I got the vast majority of my compound dissolved.
918720	922880	So now we have to wait and allow slow cooling to take hold.
922880	927620	The reason that slow cooling needs to take place is that we want to give all of the phthalic
927620	933040	acid molecules in solution ample time to find those perfect orientations as they come in
933040	936080	and become part of the growing crystal.
936080	940280	If we do this, any other molecule that tries to get involved with that crystal will not
940280	946720	adhere as strongly as phthalic acid and can simply be excluded as the crystal grows.
946720	953440	So if my original solution was made correctly and I have thoroughly separated molecules
953440	958800	of phthalic acid and impurity, I should have only phthalic acid growing back in its crystals
958800	961480	leaving the impurity behind in solution.
961480	965880	But that's going to take a little bit of time because this has to cool all the way from
965880	971480	100 degrees centigrade down to around room temperature where the solubility of phthalic
971480	976600	acid is somewhere around one-thirtieth that of the total solubility of phthalic acid in
976600	984440	boiling water.
984440	990680	So as my solution cooled slowly, the solubility of the phthalic acid drops dramatically.
990680	996360	So that particular compound now has nowhere else to go but out of solution.
996360	1000640	The key here is that I allow the process to happen very slowly.
1000640	1003120	So I guess it's a good thing I like to talk.
1003120	1008720	Now by cooling slowly, I've avoided trapping of impurity molecules in those growing crystals
1008720	1014960	and at the completion of my recrystallization, I have very large, well-formed, pure phthalic
1014960	1020400	acid crystals that can simply be removed from solution by a technique like filtration.
1020400	1024840	So if I light my sample a little bit, you can probably see in the front and the bottom
1024840	1029400	there, I've got some very large, very well-formed crystals and I'm going to try to retrieve
1029400	1035080	those now, not using filtration but instead using a simpler technique to separate liquids
1035080	1038320	from solids known as decanting.
1038320	1040400	Decanting is actually quite simple.
1040400	1044000	I'm just going to try to pour the liquid out from this beaker while leaving as much
1044000	1046200	of the solid behind as possible.
1046200	1051360	It just takes a steady hand and a little bit of patience to remove that liquid.
1060360	1061360	There we go.
1061360	1064920	And as I begin to remove the liquid, it should become clear how pure these crystals really
1064920	1065920	are.
1065920	1074200	They're not only large and well-formed but safe for just a little bit of the solution
1074200	1079080	that they crystallized from, which is sometimes called the mother liqueur, there's really
1079080	1081320	not a lot of red to speak of.
1081320	1086720	So the impurity is now in solution, which I have separated from the majority of my crystals,
1086720	1090680	few of which I'm going to dig out now, so that we can take a look at the difference
1090680	1098000	in size and shape in comparison to what we started with.
1098000	1101560	So here are just a few of the crystals that formed.
1101560	1108440	And when we compare them to not only the sample that we started with that was impure, we can
1108440	1113720	clearly see that the color is a lot more white, but the crystals are even larger than the
1113720	1118680	material that I started with before it was even fouled by this red compound.
1118680	1124280	So large crystals of the proper color tell me that I have at least in part successfully
1124280	1127160	purified what was an otherwise impure sample.
1127160	1130800	So washing these with a little bit of cold water will probably get a crystal that's almost
1130800	1134680	as white and pure as the one that we started with before we ever added any dye at all.
1134680	1138560	This is the power of recrystallization.
1138560	1143480	So pure crystals tend to be more stable than their impure counterparts.
1143480	1147200	Now we've already looked at how this can be used to purify a compound by crystallizing
1147200	1152800	it from a solution, but we can exploit this phenomenon in a completely different way by
1152800	1159480	observing the melting behavior of a sample to help us identify it and also assess its
1159480	1160480	purity.
1160480	1162200	So let's take a look at that right now.
1162200	1165880	I'm going to bring back a crystal that we've looked at once already.
1165880	1169200	That's the Benzamine crystal.
1169200	1173600	And again I'm going to build this beautiful network of intermolecular attractive forces
1173600	1178040	holding it all together, the hydrogen bonds, the van der Waals forces.
1178040	1182960	Now because there's so many forces holding it together, it's very difficult to take
1182960	1189000	the crystal apart, not only by dissolution, but also by melting, which involves heating.
1189000	1196280	So if I give these molecules a little bit of kinetic energy by adding some heat, let's
1196280	1197840	take a look at what happens.
1198480	1201880	Well they have a little bit of kinetic energy now, they want to be free to move, but they
1201880	1207160	don't want to move badly enough because there are too many forces holding them all together.
1207160	1211540	But if I continue to add energy in the form of heat, I eventually reach a point at which
1211540	1215800	there's enough kinetic energy contained in those molecules that they no longer can be
1215800	1223040	held together by those forces within the crystal, and melting takes place.
1223040	1226920	But if there's an impurity present, just as there was last time in our example, where
1226920	1233320	we had Benzamide with a little bit of Benzaldehyde contained inside, well remember, we had to
1233320	1238400	sacrifice these specific intermolecular forces, meaning that overall there's less holding
1238400	1240680	that crystal together.
1240680	1245240	What this means from a bulk perspective is, as I heat up a crystal that has impurities
1245240	1251400	and imperfections, like those missing intermolecular attractions, my weaker crystal should melt
1251400	1252760	more easily.
1252760	1256960	And indeed, in my example here, I add a little bit of heat, and that's all the kinetic energy
1256960	1262360	it takes to get my molecules moving enough to overcome whatever forces are remaining
1262360	1264280	holding it together.
1264280	1268480	So just as dissolution involves liberating individual molecules from one another by
1268480	1274680	salvation, so melting liberates them by heating them until they have sufficient kinetic energy
1274680	1278380	to overcome those forces holding them together.
1278380	1284060	With this in mind, the logic behind using melting to assess purity should become clear,
1284060	1289000	that more purified crystals have greater forces holding them together, meaning they require
1289000	1291580	more energy to melt.
1291580	1297900	In other words, as purity increases, so does the melting point.
1297900	1304340	This concept is clearly illustrated using a hypothetical phase diagram for a binary system.
1304340	1308580	Now in order to construct this kind of phase diagram, we first take the phase diagram for
1308580	1312460	a pure substance, which we could just call substance A.
1312460	1316500	So here I've drawn one for you with all the phase transitions that we recognize from an
1316500	1322740	introductory chemistry course, including boundaries for melting and freezing, boiling and condensing,
1322740	1326940	and of course sublimation and deposition.
1326940	1330660	But this diagram only applies to a pure substance.
1330660	1336900	So to create a binary phase diagram, we settle on a constant pressure, like one atmosphere,
1336900	1339380	the pressure in most laboratories.
1339380	1346140	And at that pressure, we project the diagram along a third axis of composition.
1346140	1350020	When we do this for two hypothetical solids, which in this example we could call A and
1350020	1357180	B, focusing on that melting transition, the result looks something like this.
1357180	1362660	So here's my phase diagram for a binary system at a given pressure.
1362660	1367940	Notice that my horizontal axis is now mole percentage, meaning that on the left-hand
1367940	1373020	side I'm dealing with pure, in this case green squares, and on the right-hand side pure,
1373020	1378700	whatever this molecule may be, we've called it red triangles for illustration purposes.
1378700	1382740	But there's some very interesting features to this phase diagram that you don't see in
1382740	1385140	the phase diagram for a pure substance.
1385140	1390660	So let's wipe this clean and rebuild the phase diagram piece by piece, investigating the
1390660	1396260	effects of mixing one compound into another.
1396260	1402100	Let's start with this compound over here, my green squares, when it's absolutely pure.
1402100	1407420	Now I know that when it's absolutely pure, its melting point should be a single temperature.
1407420	1412580	There is only one temperature at which a pure substance can coexist with itself in liquid
1412580	1414780	and solid forms.
1414820	1420700	So if I were to heat a sample of this compound, I expect it to be solid up to its melting
1420700	1428380	point, after which I expect it to transition into a liquid and I can continue heating.
1428380	1432620	But look what happens as I introduce a little bit of my other compound, in this case as
1432620	1434700	an impurity.
1434700	1438660	Well, two very interesting things happen.
1438660	1444500	First is that the phase boundaries move downward, and the second is that there are actually
1444500	1448340	two of them, not a single phase boundary anymore.
1448340	1453220	So what this means is that if I were to heat up a solid of a composition, let's say somewhere
1453220	1458740	in this region where I have mostly my green squares, but a little bit of my red triangles,
1458740	1459900	take a look at what happens.
1459900	1462700	I pass through another range of my diagram.
1462700	1467780	It actually takes a range of temperatures to melt, not only that, but both of them are
1467780	1472580	lower than the original melting point of my green square compound.
1472580	1478180	We call this phenomenon melting point depression, and it occurs because one compound is acting
1478180	1483940	as an impurity in the other, disrupting the forces holding the crystal lattice together.
1483940	1488060	And the broadening that takes place in the melting transition is known as incongruent
1488060	1493300	melting, which is an effect of having one compound moving into the liquid phase faster
1493300	1498980	than the other as melting takes place, thereby changing the composition of the solid as well.
1498980	1505820	So there's a range of compositions which can coexist and liquid solid forms for mixtures.
1505820	1508980	But then we reach an interesting point in the diagram.
1508980	1513700	It comes back to a confluence at a point somewhere in the middle of the phase diagram, though
1513700	1518060	not necessarily directly in the middle of the way I've drawn it here.
1518060	1524500	This is known as the eutectic point, eutectic meaning easy melting essentially.
1524500	1528700	And once we cross that eutectic point, which by the way is the only composition at which
1528700	1534900	a single melting temperature exists, we start to see the transition temperatures go back
1534900	1542540	up, until eventually they reach a confluence again at pure compound B, or in my case red
1542540	1544740	triangles.
1544740	1546020	So what's going on here?
1546020	1549300	Well, what's going on here is we've reached a point where we can start to think of it
1549300	1553340	as green squares are now the impurity in my red triangles.
1553340	1559460	And so my melting point goes back upward as my sample becomes purer and purer in the
1559460	1561900	other compound.
1561900	1566460	So I simply create a sort of a reflection, although the absolute temperatures and widths
1566460	1569940	of these transitions are not necessarily the same on both sides.
1569940	1573780	But these features are very consistent in well-behaved binary systems.
1573780	1578100	Finally, of course, we reach the point where we have our melting point for our pure red
1578100	1582340	compound, and again we have a single transition temperature.
1582340	1586420	So why do we need to understand that kind of complex phase behavior?
1586420	1592700	Well, because it gives us a useful tool to confirm the identity and purity of a compound.
1592700	1597400	We use a device commonly referred to as a melt-temp apparatus, which consists of a heating
1597400	1600980	block with a temperature control and a viewing window.
1600980	1605300	Now if I load a sample of my original crude sathalic acid in one of my recrystallized
1605300	1612260	material, I can confirm that the melting point of the purified material should be higher.
1612260	1617300	Not only that, but if I were to make a third sample consisting of my purified thalic acid
1617300	1622180	ground thoroughly with a small amount of a standard, that would allow me to confirm its
1622180	1627700	identity since adding anything but the same compound to itself should reduce the sample's
1627700	1629900	melting point.
1629900	1634660	If my sample were anything but thalic acid, the melting point of the mixture with standardized
1634660	1638180	thalic acid should be depressed.
1638180	1643220	We call this simple technique a mixed melting point analysis, and it's a very commonly used
1643220	1649020	quick check for purity and identity when synthesizing compounds in a lab.
1649020	1653260	So today we started to think beyond simply making and characterizing a product to the
1653260	1656860	question of how we might purify one.
1656860	1661180	We discussed the effect of the presence of impurities on organic crystalline solids and
1661180	1666300	how they tend to reduce the favorable intermolecular forces holding the crystal together, creating
1666300	1669540	a crystal which is less stable.
1669540	1674700	We took a look at how this observation can be used to devise a way to purify such materials
1674700	1680380	by dissolving a sample to solve and separate all the constituent molecules, then cooling
1680380	1686380	or concentrating the solution very slowly to promote formation of the most stable, pure
1686380	1689660	crystal.
1689660	1694460	We discussed the process of melting an organic crystalline solid and how the inclusion of
1694460	1699940	different molecules usually results in not only a depressive melting point, but also in
1699940	1705620	a broadening of the melting transition resulting from a phenomenon called incongruent melting.
1705620	1711020	Finally, we talked a bit about how we can use the phase behavior of such solids as a
1711020	1718060	means of probing their purity and identity using a mixed melting point analysis.
1718060	1723620	Next time, we're going to turn our attention to another familiar phase transition, boiling.
1723620	1729100	We'll explore how phase behavior of more volatile organics can also be used to purify
1729100	1730100	and identify them.
1730100	1732140	I'll see you for that discussion next time.
