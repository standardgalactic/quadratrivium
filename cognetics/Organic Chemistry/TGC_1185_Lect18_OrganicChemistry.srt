1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Last time, we discussed Fritz Haber's quest to find a way to turn essentially unreactive

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,800
nitrogen from the air into ammonia.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,760
But because our discussion was limited only to compounds of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen,

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,160
I stopped sort of explaining exactly what it was that Haber intended to do with this

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
ammonia.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,560
You see, it wasn't simply ammonia that Haber was ultimately after.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,160
He was trying to fuel a war machine, and a war machine needs artillery.

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,600
Now, you've probably heard of gun-cotton, nitroglycerin, dynamite, and TNT.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,640
But what you may not have been aware of is that they all contain very similar organic

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,960
motifs, which combine both nitrogen and oxygen with organics to form compounds of extremely

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,160
high reactivity.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,680
Today, we will take a look at these and other materials which contain both nitrogen and

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
oxygen.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,560
Now, long before Haber's day, it was known that a material commonly called saltpeter,

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,480
known by chemists as potassium nitrate, was a naturally occurring mineral resource and

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,160
a crucial ingredient in the manufacture of gunpowder.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,760
As early as the first century AD, the Chinese had discovered that saltpeter had medicinal

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,280
properties, and that it could be used to treat heart and circulatory ailments.

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,880
It was much later discovered that saltpeter decomposes in the body to form a substance

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,200
known as nitric oxide, which is the source of this therapeutic value.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,520
Evidence from the 8th century AD indicates that by then, far eastern cultures had repurposed

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,880
saltpeter, using it in combination with sulfur and charcoal to create what is known today

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,760
as gunpowder.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,400
Other civilizations independently made this discovery at different times in history,

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,680
and the exact year of its introduction to Europe is unclear.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,960
But what is clear, however, is that by the 17th century, saltpeter was so valued for

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,520
this application that in England there existed a government post known as saltpeter.

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,440
Those charged with this post were given carte blanche authority to dig anywhere in the kingdom,

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,000
even through the floors of homes in search of this commodity.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,200
All they needed was a shovel and a hunch.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,160
By the 20th century, the ridiculous degree of authority given to these pedermen had long

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,160
faded in England, but usable nitrogen was still being dug up elsewhere by ambitious

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,880
European and American entrepreneurs.

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,440
Saltpeter from as far away as the Atacama Desert of South America was being mined and

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,880
shipped back to Europe and the Americas as a source of fixed nitrogen.

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,000
But in the early 1900s, Haber's process made ammonia abundant, low-cost, and best of all

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,920
prepared on-site in a factory from readily available materials and catalysts.

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,280
All that needed to be done was to convert the ammonia into its oxidized form, like that

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
found in saltpeter.

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,560
All we had to do to do this was burn it in oxygen.

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,480
So the nitrogen oxides produced from this can be hydrated to form nitric acid, the crucial

42
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,520
ingredient in the formation of many modern explosives.

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,400
So today we'll discuss a few functional groups which contain both nitrogen and oxygen.

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
We'll see how different combinations of these elements lead to some of the most reactive

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,360
substances known to man, and also to some of the motifs essential to the function of

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
life as we know it.

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:48,600
So let's get started.

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,840
So Haber's contribution was the starting material for the synthesis of, among other

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,640
things, nitric acid.

50
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,840
This is accomplished with relative ease.

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,640
Oxidation of the ammonia to nitrogen oxides like NO2 is carried out, and after this, bubbling

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,120
the nitric oxide gases through water produces nitric acid.

53
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,720
The importance of nitric acid in the field of explosives was realized much earlier than

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,760
Haber's time.

55
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,080
One day in 1846, according to legend, German Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schoenbein

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,840
spilled a bit of nitric acid on a table where he was working.

57
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,800
After wiping up the spill with a cotton apron, he hung the apron on a stove door to dry.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,980
After drying, the apron suddenly and vigorously burst into flames.

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,560
One can only imagine what went through Schoenbein's head at that exact moment.

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,600
But after extinguishing the fire and carefully considering what had happened, Schoenbein

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,160
realized that it was the combination of nitric acid and the carbohydrate fibers in his apron

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,600
which had led to the formation of the explosive material.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,640
We'll closely look at the structure of carbohydrates in a few lectures, but for now I want you

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,680
to focus on this.

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,040
These very interesting functional groups decorating this long polymer, it's the colorful nitrogen

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,520
and oxygen containing groups there.

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,880
They're quite different than anything we've seen so far, aren't they?

68
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,040
Now, these functional groups are called nitrate esters, and they aren't present in the naturally

69
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,800
occurring plant fibers.

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,280
You may notice that the arrangement of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the nitrate ester groups

71
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,520
makes it impossible to draw a resonance contributor in which all atoms have zero charge.

72
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,880
This makes these groups very unstable.

73
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,160
Add the fact that all the oxygen needed for combustion is already present in the nitrate

74
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,160
ester group, and you have one very explosive substance.

75
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Now, this is a very exciting time for me in the course.

76
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,160
We've already discussed the accomplishments and stories of about a half-dozen Nobel laureates,

77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,160
and before we're done, we're going to meet many more.

78
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,160
In this lecture, however, the nitrate ester gives me the perfect segue into the story

79
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,160
of the man who founded the prize himself, Alfred Nobel.

80
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,160
You see, Nobel's story is one of a very explosive compound called nitroglycerin.

81
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,160
It can be made from glycerin, which is easily obtained from the soap-making process.

82
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Now, it was originally synthesized by a man named Ascanio Sobrero, and Sobrero realized

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,160
that he could take glycerin and react it with nitric acid, three equivalents to be exact,

84
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,160
and that when he did this, the OH groups of the glycerin would be replaced by a new functional group,

85
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
these nitrate esters.

86
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,160
So our nitrates come in, displacing water, and creating nitroglycerin.

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Now, Sobrero realized immediately how dangerous nitroglycerin could be,

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
and in fact, even after he created it and had published about it,

89
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,160
he continued to lobby against its use in mining and war applications.

90
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,160
And Sobrero's unwillingness to advance this particular compound in those applications

91
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,160
left an opening for another very opportunistic individual, Alfred Nobel.

92
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Nobel was a contemporary of Sobrero who took up the mantle of finding a way to stabilize nitroglycerin enough

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,160
to use it as an explosive for those applications.

94
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,160
He discovered that by adding a little bit of sawdust that he could stabilize the nitroglycerin long enough

95
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,160
and well enough to form it into sticks, he could then develop blasting caps

96
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
and other methods of detonating these sticks of dynamite.

97
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,160
And of course, this made him a great deal of money.

98
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,160
See, Nobel realized the addition of that adsorbent like sawdust had a stabilizing effect,

99
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
and the adsorbent nitroglycerin could be wrapped in paper,

100
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,160
formed into sticks, and triggered with some of Nobel's other inventions.

101
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,160
So his invention made the packaging and transport of this high explosive simple and safer,

102
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,160
leading to its rapid adoption worldwide in mining and military applications.

103
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,160
So the invention of dynamite seemed to be Nobel's inevitable legacy.

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Having secured the U.S. patent for his dynamite invention,

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Nobel had become extremely wealthy as a result of this product.

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
And in 1895, Nobel officially changed the name of the company

107
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,160
and in 1895, Nobel officially changed his will for the last time,

108
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,160
designating nearly all of his massive estate to establish a prize

109
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,160
to be conferred upon those who, as Nobel himself put it,

110
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,160
during the preceding year shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.

111
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Nobel's endowment hasn't only survived but thrived for over the past century.

112
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,160
This come to represent the pinnacle of human achievement in not only the sciences,

113
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
but in medicine, literature, and economics as well.

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,160
A somewhat more stable functional group containing both nitrogen and oxygen

115
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,160
is the nitrate functional group.

116
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Compounds containing this group are collectively referred to as nitro compounds.

117
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Probably the most famous nitro compound is TNT, or Trinitrotoluene.

118
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
And we will take a look at this and how its compounds like it

119
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,160
are made in our electrophilic aromatic substitution lecture.

120
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
But for today, we'll concern ourselves with some simpler aliphatic nitrates

121
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
and how they react.

122
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Most commercially relevant nitro compounds are synthesized

123
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,160
by reacting small hydrocarbons with nitric acid at very high temperatures.

124
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,160
This reaction is complex, proceeding through radicals

125
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,160
and usually producing mixtures of nitrated compounds.

126
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,160
But these compounds are of such great value that we frequently overlook this inefficiency.

127
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,160
One particularly useful application of the nitro group in synthesis

128
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,160
is that it can be used as a sort of non-nucleophilic placeholder

129
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,160
for the nucleophilic amine functional group.

130
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
This can significantly uncomplicate a synthesis.

131
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Now, at the end of a synthesis, the nitro group can be converted into an amine

132
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
simply using familiar hydrogen and metal catalyst chemistry

133
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,160
that was developed by Sabatier.

134
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,160
A classic example of this technique is in the synthesis of Novocaine.

135
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
So let's start with the molecule Novocaine

136
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
and apply a retro-synthetic analysis to it

137
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,160
and see if we can design a technique for synthesizing it.

138
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Now, I can make Novocaine using a compound called aminobenzoyl chloride

139
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
and the appropriate nucleophile.

140
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Now, the aminobenzoyl chloride I've shown here

141
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,160
can be prepared from a compound called aminobenzoyl acid

142
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
which is readily available commercially

143
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
and is probably on the shelf in the laboratory right now.

144
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,160
So my retro-synthetic analysis looks pretty good so far,

145
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
but let's run our analysis forward

146
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
and see if it really gives us what we think we're going to get.

147
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,160
The first step of my proposed synthesis involves the nucleophilic attack

148
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,160
of the OH from aminobenzoyl acid on vinyl chloride.

149
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,160
This reaction should lead to my intermediate

150
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,160
which I can then expose to another nucleophile to diethyl-aminoethanol

151
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,160
which will give me my product, right?

152
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Well, not quite.

153
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
There's an unfortunate caveat here

154
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
and that is that the amine that I'm hoping will tag along

155
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
is actually potentially reactive as well.

156
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Remember, NH2 can be a nucleophile.

157
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
It has a lone pair of electrons.

158
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,160
So this step of my synthetic analysis was faulty.

159
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,160
But I have the tool I need to get around this problem now.

160
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I can take my proposed synthesis and modify it in one very simple way.

161
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Instead of using the NH2 or amine group,

162
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm going to use an O2 or nitrate

163
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,160
which is completely non-nucleophilic.

164
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,160
So having replaced those with my nitrates,

165
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160
I can now rest assured that that promiscuous reaction will not occur.

166
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
And at the end of my synthesis,

167
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
I can simply use rainy nickel to conduct a reduction

168
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,160
thereby changing that nitrate into the amine group I originally wanted.

169
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,160
So it's acted as a placeholder through the entire synthesis

170
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
at the end of which I finally make my modification,

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
giving me the desired product.

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
So this would be a successful synthesis of Novocaine.

173
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Now, so far today we've looked at nitrate esters and nitrates,

174
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
both of which contain nitrogen-oxygen bonds,

175
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,160
and not so coincidentally both of which can be used to make high explosives.

176
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
But there are other organics which contain both of these elements joined,

177
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
not directly to one another, but through one or more carbons.

178
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,160
And when we make this very subtle structural change,

179
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,160
we find ourselves making molecules which have a very different

180
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
but equally versatile chemistry

181
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,160
and can be used safely and reliably in organic synthesis.

182
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
When a carboxylic acid motif is connected to an amine group

183
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
via at least one intervening carbon,

184
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,160
we call the resulting molecule an amino acid.

185
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Amino acids will be the star of the show in our lecture on proteins,

186
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
where we will consider their biological role.

187
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
But since they meet the criterion for this lecture as well,

188
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
having both oxygen and nitrogen,

189
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I thought we would give them a little bit of attention here.

190
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Amino acids combine an acidic carboxylic acid group with a basic amine group.

191
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,160
And so they're often found in a state in which the acid is deprotonated,

192
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
but the amine is protonated.

193
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
We call species like this,

194
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,160
ones with a positive and negative charge in separate regions,

195
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
zwitter ions.

196
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,160
The most famous group of amino acids are, of course,

197
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,160
the 20 amino acids used by your body and all other living systems

198
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
to produce proteins and enzymes which moderate our biochemistry.

199
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Notice that all of them share a common amino acid motif,

200
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
one in which the two groups are separated by one carbon,

201
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
and we call these alpha-amino acids.

202
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,160
But amino acids can have more than one carbon separating their acid-base groups.

203
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Two carbons in between produces a beta-amino acid,

204
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
and three carbons leads to a gamma-amino acid,

205
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,160
the simplest of which is gamma-amino-butyric acid.

206
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Now, this is a powerful neurotransmitter

207
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,160
and an integral part of your central nervous system.

208
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Gamma-amino-butyric acid often abbreviated GABA plays a role in neurotransmission

209
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,160
by activating a very large protein complex

210
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,160
which allows chloride ions to cross neuronal cell walls.

211
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
So when GABA binds to this protein complex,

212
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,160
it allows the flow of chloride ions which reduces the chance of neurons firing,

213
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,160
and so it has a sedative effect.

214
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,160
This natural biological effect is also part of the mechanism of action

215
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
of a number of sedatives and hallucinogens,

216
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,160
like the muskimol found in certain types of wild mushrooms.

217
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,160
See, muskimol imitates GABA in the brain,

218
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,160
over-activating the GABA receptor proteins, causing an exaggerated state of sedation.

219
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,160
So in this case, the extract of your mushroom is acting just like the neurotransmitter

220
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
that you naturally produce.

221
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Yet another pervasive motif in organic chemistry containing oxygen and nitrogen

222
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
is the amide functional group.

223
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,160
And you may think of an amide as a carboxylic acid or ester with an sp3 nitrogen

224
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
rather than an sp3 oxygen.

225
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,160
The lower electronegativity of the amide nitrogen

226
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,160
means that they're significantly less acidic than organic acids,

227
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,160
having a pKa somewhere around 25 compared to 5 for a typical organic acid.

228
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Primary amides have an NH2 group

229
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,160
and can be synthesized from carboxylic acids by reaction with ammonia gas.

230
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,160
In this case, a favorable proton transfer forms carboxylate and ammonium,

231
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,160
which are heated to drive off water as a byproduct of the amide bond formation.

232
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,160
It's this condensation reaction which forms our primary amide.

233
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Primary amides are named using the R group prefix,

234
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,160
followed by an amide suffix.

235
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,160
For example, this two-carbon primary amide is called ethanamine.

236
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Just as carboxylic acids are similar to esters,

237
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,160
varying only by replacement of the acidic hydrogen with an R group.

238
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,160
So primary amides can be changed into secondary and tertiary amides,

239
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,160
in which one or both hydrogens are substituted with an R group as well.

240
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
When there are R groups present,

241
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
we name them as substituents of the parent primary amide.

242
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,160
For example, this is N-methylethanamine,

243
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,160
and this is NN-dimethylethanamine.

244
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,160
You may see these names shortened by dropping the N designation

245
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,160
and simply calling them methylethanamide and dimethylethanamide.

246
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Amides are a very interesting motif in and of themselves,

247
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,160
as we'll see when we cover proteins and peptides in a few lectures.

248
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
But for now, let's take a look at a few reactions

249
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
in which amides can be converted into some other familiar functional groups.

250
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
In addition to being a biologically relevant structural motif,

251
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,160
amides give us a useful alternative to the direct amination route to create amines.

252
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
You'll recall that amines can be synthesized easily

253
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,160
in the R groups of alkyl chloride substrate, our primary or secondary.

254
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,160
But an SN2 reaction is essentially impossible

255
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
when the alkyl halide substrate is tertiary.

256
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,160
So we're left wondering how we might create something like t-butylamine,

257
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
in which the amine nitrogen is attached to a tertiary carbon.

258
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,160
If we were to try to do a direct amination of t-butyl bromide or t-butyl chloride,

259
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
we expect a preponderance of the elimination product to form

260
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
if anything forms at all.

261
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160
One solution to this problem is the Hoffman rearrangement

262
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,160
named for German chemist August Wilhelm von Hoffman.

263
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Now Hoffman discovered that primary amides could be converted into amines

264
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,160
by reaction with a molecular halogen like chlorine or bromine

265
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
and an aqueous base like sodium hydroxide solution.

266
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,160
This reaction works even if the adjacent carbon is tertiary.

267
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,160
So let's go through this reaction using t-butyl amide, molecular bromine,

268
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,160
and aqueous sodium hydroxide.

269
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Under these conditions, just a small amount of the amide is deprotonated,

270
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,160
forming a nucleophilic species which attacks the bromine molecule.

271
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,160
So you can already see the important difference here.

272
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,160
The R groups are already attached to the nucleophile,

273
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
not the substrate, in the initiating event of the reaction.

274
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,160
This process forms an N-bromo amide, which is deprotonated a second time.

275
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Now this is where the magic happens.

276
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,160
The bromide group is displaced from the amide nitrogen in an alkyl shift.

277
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,160
This effectively reverses the carbon and nitrogen ordering in the chain,

278
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,160
creating what we call an isocyanate.

279
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Hydroxide ion then catalyzes the conversion of isocyanate

280
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,160
to a motif known as a carbamic acid.

281
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Carbamic acid is essentially just a carboxylic acid bonded directly to a nitrogen rather than a carbon.

282
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,160
And carbamic acids have a strong tendency to decarboxylate under basic conditions,

283
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
leading to an amine.

284
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:16,160
So we've used the Hoffman rearrangement starting with t-butyl amide to produce t-butyl amine.

285
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Perhaps the most interesting chemistry involving amides is they're used to link together dimers

286
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,160
and short oligomers, meaning a short chain of a few subunits,

287
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,160
of amino acids to form some consumer goods with which you might be very familiar.

288
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Let's look at one right now.

289
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,160
This is a molecule of the artificial sweetener aspartame.

290
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Aspartame consists of essentially three subunits linked by hydrolyzable bonds.

291
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,160
One of them is an amide bond indicated here.

292
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,160
The other linkage is actually an ester bond formed here.

293
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,160
So if we take a look at the aspartame molecule as a whole and then break it down into these three subunits,

294
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,160
we see that we have essentially what is a condensed methanol,

295
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,160
a condensed amino acid phenylalanine,

296
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
and aspartic acid, another amino acid.

297
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,160
So what this means is that when you ingest or consume aspartame,

298
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
this is the molecule that gives you the sweet taste.

299
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,160
But what happens to it once it's past your lips and tongue and into your digestive system?

300
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Well, when it reaches your digestive system, and particularly your bloodstream,

301
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:40,160
it's exposed to a great deal of water and enzymes from your liver which break it down.

302
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Your body recognizes that this molecule isn't natural,

303
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
that it's a foreign compound that needs to be removed.

304
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,160
And it does this using water to hydrolyze the two connective bonds.

305
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,160
When it does this, we get three different species.

306
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,160
An aspartic acid, a phenylalanine, and a methanol.

307
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Now there's always some discussion about that methanol

308
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
because there's always a few folks who wonder,

309
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,160
does that methanol constitute a danger to my health?

310
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,160
After all, if I eat our drink aspartame,

311
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,160
and it hydrolyzes and becomes, at least in part, methanol,

312
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,160
am I not leaving myself open to potentially developing blindness?

313
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Well, the answer lies in quantity.

314
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,160
So let's look at an aspartame molecule one more time.

315
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than sugar.

316
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Now that means that in order to make a soda, that's a diet soda,

317
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,160
as sweet as its non-diet alternative,

318
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,160
we've got to use only about 200 milligrams of aspartame.

319
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,160
That's enough to make your soda as sweet as 40 grams of sugar.

320
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
That's about 10 teaspoons.

321
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,160
So let's take some water and hydrolyze 200 milligrams of aspartame

322
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
and see if the content of your diet soda

323
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,160
is enough to generate a worrisome amount of methanol.

324
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,160
All right, our hydrolysis reaction takes place.

325
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
And when we run our calculation,

326
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
what we find is that 200 milligrams of aspartame

327
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,160
is only enough to make about 90 milligrams of aspartic acid,

328
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
112 milligrams of phenylalanine,

329
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,160
and 22 milligrams of methanol.

330
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Now if you're one of just a few percent of the population

331
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,160
who has a condition which allows you or doesn't allow you

332
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,160
to metabolize phenylalanine properly, you may have an issue.

333
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,160
We call this condition phenylketonuria.

334
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,160
But if you're like everyone else and can actually metabolize this,

335
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
then your only real health concern is the methanol,

336
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,160
and you get 22 milligrams per soda.

337
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,160
So to put that much methanol into perspective,

338
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,160
let's take a look at some other stuff that we might put into our bodies.

339
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,160
It turns out that your diet soda actually has less methanol,

340
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
or produces less methanol in your bloodstream,

341
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,160
than grape juice, wine, or tomato juice.

342
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Depending on storage conditions, it can be considerably more.

343
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,160
And yet, those of us who love to eat tomatoes

344
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
don't seem to have any problems with our vision.

345
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,160
So the diet soda being bad for your vision is actually a myth.

346
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,160
It simply doesn't produce enough methanol to be toxic.

347
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
So let's review today's lecture.

348
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Today we took a look at some slightly more complex functional groups,

349
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,160
involving both nitrogen and oxygen.

350
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,160
We started with nitrate esters, a very unstable functional group

351
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,160
which can be produced by reacting nitric acid with alcohols.

352
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,160
We saw how materials from cotton fibers to glycerin,

353
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
collected during soap making,

354
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,160
can be turned into highly flammable and even explosive material by this reaction.

355
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
We also explored nitro compounds,

356
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
most notably trinitrotoluene,

357
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,160
which is another widely used explosive material.

358
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,160
But nitro groups themselves are not nearly as unstable

359
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
as their nitroester counterparts,

360
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,160
and so many stable examples of these compounds can be prepared

361
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,160
and reduced to amines using hydrogen gas and metal catalysts.

362
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
We took a quick look at amino acids,

363
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,160
in which amine and carboxyl functionalities are on the same molecule

364
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
but are isolated from one another,

365
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,160
producing molecules which can undergo an intramolecular proton transfer

366
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,160
to form what's known as a zwitterion.

367
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
We saw how the amide functional group can be prepared

368
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,160
by heating a carboxylic acid in the presence of ammonia,

369
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,160
driving off water to push the reaction forward.

370
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Starting from this structural motif,

371
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Hoffman was able to devise a strategy to form primary amines with substantial branching,

372
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,160
a feat which cannot be accomplished by the direct amination of alkyl halides.

373
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Finally, we saw how amino acids can be joined together through an amide bond,

374
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,160
like that in the popular artificial sweetener aspartame,

375
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,160
and how the acid hydrolysis of this amide bond can spell trouble

376
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,160
for phenyl ketoneurics who can't properly metabolize and remove the resulting phenylalanine,

377
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,160
but is highly unlikely to cause vision problems in the general population.

378
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,160
We've reached the end of our five lecture series on functional groups containing nitrogen and oxygen,

379
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,160
but our study of molecular structure isn't yet over.

380
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Over the next three lectures, we're going to bring back an old friend, alkenes.

381
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,160
But this time, we'll be considering what happens when entire systems of double bonds

382
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,160
are linked together to form some very special molecules.

383
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
I'll see you then.
