0	20000	Previously, we discussed the method of recrystallization as a means of purifying non-volatile, organic crystalline solids.
20000	28000	Recrystallization is a powerful technique for the isolation of products when they have melting points well in excess of a solvent's boiling points,
28000	39000	and of course when the desired compound is present in great abundance, ensuring that it will become saturated in the cooling solution long before any impurities will.
39000	48000	But what can be done when a compound does not have the necessary physical properties for recrystallization, or if it's not the dominant material in a mixture?
48000	55000	Well, we really can't turn to recrystallization to obtain an effective separation.
55000	63000	But there are other ways to isolate organic compounds from one another based on a phenomenon known as partitioning.
63000	70000	Today we will talk about one of the most common classes of techniques used in this principle, extraction.
70000	77000	But first, let's just think about partitioning itself in terms of something most of us can relate to, salad dressing.
77000	86000	Now, the contents of this bottle include water and olive oil, and we can clearly see the two ingredients because they create two distinct phases.
86000	92000	Since the oil and water are immiscible, or don't dissolve in one another, one simply floats on the other.
92000	97000	In this case, the oil is above the water because the oil is less dense.
97000	103000	Now, also in this bottle are some other ingredients, including salt and some herbs and herb oils.
103000	111000	Now, to simplify, let's just say the recipe contains water and oil as solvents and salt and oregano, or the oil of oregano, as a solute.
111000	123000	So, the water and oil provide two different chemical environments in which the sodium and chloride ions from the salt and the organic carvacrol oil from oregano can dissolve.
123000	128000	Now, knowing what we know about intermolecular forces and the role they play in solubility,
128000	134000	we expect to find the ions of the salt, preferentially dissolved in the high polarity water,
134000	140000	which can orient its bondi poles to create favorable interactions with the dissolved ions.
140000	147000	And of course, the low polarity carvacrol from the herb oils dissolves in the low polarity oil layer on top,
147000	156000	because the larger oil molecules are more polarizable and can form dispersion forces which solvate the carvacrol.
156000	165000	It's exactly because of this separation that the proper blend of flavors is only obtained when we vigorously shake the bottle just before use.
165000	176000	So, to pour just the top layer would be to put only the herb oils onto my salad, while to pour just the lower layer would only add the salt, acid and water.
176000	180000	So, when we shake the dressing, we're getting ready for lunch.
180000	188000	But when we don't shake the dressing, but rather deliberately allow the two phases to stay separate, dispensing each individually,
188000	195000	we're doing a very simple form of liquid-liquid extraction.
195000	205000	Now, in our first example in this lecture, I used a system in which we assumed that all the particular solute accumulated in one of the two phases available to it.
205000	217000	In part, I was able to make this assumption because of how drastically different sodium chloride and carvacrol are being ionic and organic compounds respectively.
217000	222000	But the truth for most organic molecules in a system like this isn't so simple.
222000	227000	Many of them have an appreciable solubility in both water and a certain organic solvent.
227000	239000	And when this is the case, we can expect a solute to establish a set of equilibrium concentrations in both solvents based upon its relative solubility in each of them.
239000	247000	We call this effect partitioning, and the equilibrium constant which governs it is a partitioning coefficient.
247000	255000	Partitioning coefficients are easily calculated from the maximum solubility of the solute in each of the two solvents.
255000	267000	They give a numerical value which allows us to predict how much of each solute will be in each layer at equilibrium.
267000	271000	So let's take a look at a partitioning event as it happens.
271000	278000	In this case, I'm going to use one butanol and water as solvents and some blue-colored food dye as a solute.
278000	286000	Now we can be pretty sure that this fairly polar food dye would rather be dissolved in the water layer which is on the bottom of these two funnels.
286000	293000	And yet, it's dissolved in the top layer right now which is an butanol, a less polar solvent.
293000	299000	It's up there now because I very carefully and very deliberately added it to the top without disturbing the lower layer
299000	305000	so that we could see the conditions before I actually perform a liquid-liquid extraction.
305000	312000	Now the glassware that I'm using today are called separatory funnels and their design is very specific for this purpose.
312000	320000	They contain a ground glass stopper which leads to a port on top so that I can add my liquids to the separatory funnel itself
320000	327000	which is a sort of a pear-shaped funnel which leads to a Teflon stopcock.
327000	332000	And that Teflon stopcock can be used to open the bottom of the funnel draining the liquid through the stem.
332000	337000	So I can add liquid to the top but I can remove liquids from the bottom.
337000	342000	Now you can see I've already charged them very carefully with my two different solutions.
342000	350000	So at the moment my food dye dissolved in an butanol is on top because the density of an butanol is about 80% out of water
350000	354000	and I have some pure water underneath.
354000	362000	But that food dye is very polar organic molecule and it really would much rather be in the water than in the butanol.
362000	365000	So why isn't it there already?
365000	368000	Well it's not there already because it needs a little bit of assistance.
368000	376000	You see partitioning takes place very very slowly when we rely on nothing more than random molecular motion
376000	382000	and a very narrow interface between the two solvents to allow them to jump from one side to the other.
382000	386000	They need a little bit of assistance from me in the form of agitation.
386000	395000	So what I'm going to do next is take one of my two separatory funnels and agitate the mixture creating many inclusions of one solvent in the other
395000	400000	thereby drastically increasing the surface area contact.
400000	407000	Now when I do this it's going to take about a moment for everything to come back to equilibrium and for my two phases to separate again.
407000	413000	But when they do I think we'll see something very different than what we have now.
413000	424000	So let's take this separatory funnel and again agitate a bit to create some inclusions of one solvent in the other.
424000	427000	Creatically venting to make sure there's no pressure building up.
427000	431000	We don't want that to happen.
431000	440000	And then I'm going to return it to the stand.
440000	444000	Now if we look closely we can already start to see the two phases separating.
444000	449000	And that's not too surprising because enbutinol and water are immiscible in one another.
449000	453000	But what is surprising is notice the different colors of the layers.
453000	457000	Clearly the food dye is accumulating in the lower layer.
457000	462000	That's because it's more soluble overall in water than it is in enbutinol.
462000	466000	So I have affected a liquid-liquid extraction here.
466000	472000	I've removed some but not quite all of the dye molecules from my enbutinol.
472000	481000	Now at this point if it were my goal to retrieve those molecules all I need is a beaker.
481000	485000	I can remove my stopper so that I don't have a reduction in pressure in the headspace.
485000	498000	And I can simply drain my aqueous layer through the stem and isolate the dye molecules in aqueous solution from my enbutinol.
498000	503000	Alright and I think that's probably about enough we can stop that.
503000	506000	Now this is where the conical shape of the flask comes into play.
506000	511000	If I watch my interface as I drain this, let's go for a little bit more here.
511000	521000	If you watch the interface as I drain it, as it reaches the narrow portion of the stem I can very carefully and very precisely cut the flow
521000	528000	just as that reaches the stopcock thereby collecting the maximum amount of my aqueous solution.
528000	533000	So the dye that was in the enbutinol is now in water.
533000	539000	So you probably noticed there that even though most of that dye made its way into the aqueous layer,
539000	543000	that a little bit of it remained in the organic enbutinol layer.
543000	546000	So there was an equilibrium of concentrations there.
546000	553000	And this equilibrium is governed by a constant which is equal to the maximum solubility of that dye in the aqueous solvent
553000	556000	divided by the maximum solubility in the organic solvent.
556000	559000	So that's what we call the partitioning coefficient.
559000	567000	So in this case, my dye had a very large partitioning coefficient, so I managed to extract most of it into the aqueous layer.
567000	570000	But this isn't always the case for organic compounds.
570000	573000	Sometimes they're pretty fussy about going into aqueous solutions.
573000	579000	So if I want to extract an organic compound from an organic solution into water,
579000	581000	I'm going to have to play some tricks.
581000	588000	And one of the best tricks we have is altering the pH of the aqueous layer.
588000	595000	So let's look at a representative organic molecule and start to think about the factors that affected solubility in aqueous solution.
595000	598000	For my demonstration, I'm going to use two naphthol.
598000	602000	This is an aromatic alcohol with a pKa of about 10.
602000	613000	So this hydroxyl group here is slightly acidic because of the resonance stabilization afforded by the benzene or the aromatic ring that it's attached to.
613000	618000	So we have to think back to our lecture on acids and bases and the Henderson-Husselbach equation,
618000	631000	which gives us a way to relate the amount of a weak acid which is deprotonated with that which is protonated as a function of pH and the pKa of that compound.
631000	639000	If we do a little bit of rearranging and use the Henderson-Husselbach equation to create a plot of the percent ionized an aqueous solution
639000	642000	as a function of the pH of that aqueous solution,
642000	648000	we get a trace that looks something like this.
648000	655000	Notice the very steep transition that takes place right around the pKa of the compound.
655000	664000	So in this case, if I were to attempt to dissolve naphthol in water at a pH of about, let's say, 6,
664000	667000	it's not going to dissolve as well as it could.
667000	676000	And the reason for this is that at a pH of about 6, none of the dissolved naphthol is going to be ionized or practically none of it will be ionized.
676000	682000	So if I were to pour some liquid into a beaker, adjust that liquid to pH 6 and attempt to dissolve naphthol,
682000	686000	only a very small amount will actually go into solution.
686000	689000	Remember, partitioning coefficients are dictated by solubility.
689000	694000	So if I can change its solubility, I can change its partitioning coefficient.
694000	703000	Now to do that, all I have to do is adjust the pH of my aqueous solution so that I'm on the other side of the pKa.
703000	704000	So let's do that now.
704000	713000	If I move over to a pH that's greater than 12, let's say 14, four pH units above the pKa, well in excess of what I would need,
713000	715000	I'm not dissolving naphthol anymore.
715000	718000	I'm dissolving naphthalate.
718000	721000	I'm dissolving the ionized version of my weak acid.
721000	726000	Now, polar water interacts much better with ions than it does with neutral organics.
726000	731000	And that means that these naphthalate ions have a much higher solubility.
731000	743000	So by altering its solubility in water, by adjusting the pH, I'm changing its partitioning behavior when I try to run a liquid-liquid extraction.
743000	745000	So let's do that now.
745000	749000	Here is my naphthol, but I've drawn two different equilibria.
749000	755000	And the reason I've done this is that we now know that depending upon the pH of an aqueous layer,
755000	762000	I'll either be dealing with the equilibrium between two naphthol in the organic and two naphthol in the aqueous layer
762000	768000	or between two naphthol in the organic and two naphthalate in the aqueous layer.
768000	775000	Let's see how that affects the extraction properties by looking at a Mach extraction funnel here.
775000	779000	I've got my Henderson-Hasselbach plot with my transition at the pKa of my compound.
779000	788000	And as long as I'm two pH units above or below that position, I'm in a situation where I can consider it to be either all ionized or all unionized.
788000	794000	So let's zoom in on this extraction funnel and see what happens.
794000	803000	So here I am at the interface with an organic layer, let's say ether, and an aqueous layer, which I've adjusted to a low pH, less than 8.
803000	811000	That means that I'm dealing with an equilibrium between two naphthol in the organic layer and two naphthol in the aqueous layer.
811000	816000	So at this point I'm dealing with these neutral organic compounds and they're not terribly soluble.
816000	822000	So at best I can hope that a small fraction of them is going to move down here into the aqueous layer.
822000	830000	I'm not going to be able to wash very much of it away in this fashion, so my extraction is suboptimal at this point.
830000	833000	But what happens if I change the pH of that aqueous layer?
833000	842000	Let's move to the other side of the Henderson-Hasselbach plot to where our pH is greater than 12, more than two units above the pKa.
842000	848000	Well now I'm dealing with naphtholate and its solubility is higher, so its partitioning coefficient is greater.
848000	857000	So simply by carefully choosing the pH of my aqueous layer, I can make my extraction work better or worse depending on my goals.
858000	867000	So I can affect a different partitioning coefficient on a compound, at least if it's titratable, simply by adjusting the pH of the aqueous layer that I use.
867000	873000	So how can I use that to my advantage when I'm trying to extract one organic compound from another?
873000	881000	And the answer to this lies in the fact that most organic compounds have slightly different pKa values from one another and slightly different acid-base properties.
881000	888000	For example, we've already considered naphthol and naphthalate, but take a look at naphthoic acid.
888000	894000	Now this is a compound that's very similar to naphthol, yet its pKa is about four rather than ten.
894000	901000	So if I were to plot its Henderson-Hasselbach equation, I'd get a plot that looks something like this,
901000	907000	in which I have a similar shape, but the transition is taking place at a much lower pH.
907000	916000	So I can solubilize naphtholic acid in water much more easily. I only have to have a pH of around six or higher.
916000	922000	Now compare that to the equilibrium we just looked at, naphthol and naphthalate, where the pKa is ten.
922000	927000	Its Henderson-Hasselbach plot has a transition at a much higher pH.
927000	930000	So that's a difference that I can use.
930000	935000	If we take it one step further and consider a compound which is not acidic but is basic.
936000	944000	For example, naphthylamine. Now naphthylamine actually picks up a proton and becomes charged to form naphthylammonium ion,
944000	947000	which has a pKa of around 4.6.
947000	954000	But because naphthylammonium, the conjugate acid, is charged, not only will my Henderson-Hasselbach plot shift,
954000	960000	but it will reverse on the vertical axis. And I'll have more ionized at a lower pH.
960000	967000	Again, something I can exploit, difference in how they behave based upon the pH of the extraction solution.
968000	976000	So again, our acidic compounds are charged when they're at high pH, but our basic compound is charged at low pH.
980000	984000	So now that we've laid this groundwork, we're ready to actually perform an extraction.
984000	994000	Let's assume that we needed to separate this naphthoic acid from two naphthol, two compounds whose pKa and acid-base behavior we've already characterized pretty well.
995000	1001000	Their two Henderson-Hasselbach plots are kind of similar in shape, but they have a different transitional pH.
1001000	1008000	So you can already begin to see, if you look carefully here, there is a region of the plot where they're behaving very differently from one another,
1008000	1012000	but there are also regions of the plot where they behave very similarly to one another.
1012000	1016000	And if we're going to separate them, our goal is to be in that zone where they're different.
1017000	1024000	So if we were to take a look at an extraction taking place with an organic layer on top and a very acidic aqueous layer on the bottom, what would we see?
1025000	1034000	Well, we would see a situation where neither of them is particularly ionized in the aqueous layer, and therefore their solubilities are much greater up here in the organics.
1034000	1039000	I've color-coded them a little bit. I've shaded them in green and orange, so they're a bit easier to tell apart from one another.
1039000	1044000	You'll see that the orange is my naphthoic acid and that the greens are my naphthol.
1045000	1050000	So let's move along our Henderson-Hasselbach plot to a different pH and see if we can do better.
1054000	1058000	If we move up to about neutral pH, around pH 7, take a look at what's happened here.
1059000	1067000	I have reached a point on my Henderson-Hasselbach plot where there is a huge difference in the amount present as ions in the aqueous solution.
1067000	1073000	My naphthoic acid is completely deprotonated when in water, but my naphthol is completely neutral.
1074000	1080000	So their solubilities are very different, which leads to a situation where one partitions into the water as its conjugate base,
1080000	1084000	the other remains up here in the organic layer as its conjugate acid.
1085000	1092000	So if I were to attempt an extraction with an aqueous layer of this pH, separating the two is as simple as opening the stopcock at the bottom of the funnel.
1093000	1099000	But if I go too far and I raise my pH all the way to say 12 or higher,
1099000	1105000	I reach a point at which not only is my naphthoic acid going to be very water soluble,
1105000	1108000	but so is my naphthol because now it can dissolve as naphtholate.
1109000	1114000	So at this point I will have a preponderance of both compounds accumulating in the aqueous layer.
1114000	1116000	My extraction will have been compromised.
1117000	1125000	And as a final example, let's take a look at the difference between weak acids and weak bases.
1125000	1129000	For example, the extraction of naphthol and naphthylamine.
1130000	1135000	So if I had a physical mixture of these two and wanted to separate them using this technique,
1135000	1140000	how would that be different from the extraction of two weak acids, one from the other, like we just looked at?
1141000	1147000	Well, remember the Henderson-Husselbach plot for my naphtholamine is reversed.
1147000	1149000	It's flipped over on the vertical axis.
1149000	1154000	So it's more ionized at low pHs and less ionized at high pHs.
1154000	1156000	So what does that mean for my extraction?
1160000	1164000	Well, what that means is that if I start my extraction with a very acidic aqueous layer,
1165000	1172000	I expect that my naphthylamine will actually be naphthylamonium ion and therefore very soluble in the water.
1172000	1175000	So I'll start at a very low pH with an effective extraction,
1175000	1181000	which places the naphthylamine in the aqueous layer and places the naphthol in the organic layer.
1183000	1186000	But as I raise my pH, I run into a problem again.
1186000	1189000	If I try this extraction with neutral water,
1190000	1197000	I have a situation where my naphthylamonium is not soluble in water because it's now naphthylamine,
1197000	1202000	and it's going to migrate preferentially into the organic layer where the naphthol already is.
1202000	1207000	So by using a neutral aqueous solution, I'm not going to extract anything,
1207000	1209000	at least not to any appreciable extent.
1210000	1213000	Finally, if I continue, raise the pH even farther,
1214000	1220000	I reach a situation where now my naphthol can become deprotonated in the aqueous layer,
1220000	1223000	leaving behind the naphthylamine.
1225000	1227000	I have a good extraction once again,
1227000	1232000	but this time I've got my naphthol accumulating in the aqueous layer
1232000	1235000	as opposed to the naphthylamine that I had at the beginning.
1236000	1240000	So one of the benefits of trying to extract an acid from a base
1240000	1244000	is that we can choose which layer each will move into.
1244000	1249000	I could put my basic compound in the aqueous layer by using an acidic aqueous solution,
1249000	1253000	or I can put my acidic compound in by using a basic.
1253000	1257000	And of course the drawback is I have to use a lot of acid or base to get it done.
1259000	1265000	Now so far in this lecture we've thought of partitioning in terms of two immiscible liquid phases.
1266000	1270000	But partitioning can also take place between any two distinct phases.
1270000	1274000	Some other examples are solid liquid or liquid gas systems.
1274000	1280000	So naturally it should be possible to conduct extractions using these kinds of systems as well.
1281000	1286000	Now probably the most obvious example of an extraction using solid liquid partitioning
1286000	1289000	is the process of brewing a cup of tea.
1290000	1297000	As you add hot water to a tea leaf, certain compounds are going to dissolve in water better than others.
1299000	1304000	Now in this case the large and insoluble material making up the tea leaves
1304000	1311000	can interact with say caffeine, polyphenols, and other compounds which would otherwise be soluble in cold water.
1312000	1317000	But we all know from experience that steeping tea in cold water leads to a very weak beverage.
1318000	1324000	So just as we can manipulate the partitioning coefficient in a liquid-liquid extraction with pH,
1324000	1331000	so we can manipulate the partitioning coefficients of compounds in solid liquid systems using temperature.
1331000	1334000	And tea connoisseurs will understand this well.
1336000	1346000	Green tea. It's famous for its delicate flavors and aromas, but green tea also contains particularly high levels, tannins,
1346000	1352000	a polyphenolic class of compounds with a bitter taste and a very dry mouthfeel.
1352000	1357000	So the goal in preparing this delightful beverage is temperature control.
1360000	1363000	Fine green teas require careful attention to brewing temperature,
1363000	1372000	as water just below its boiling point partitions the pleasant and aroma-granting compounds into that water effectively.
1373000	1378000	But water too close to boiling will separate the polyphenolic compounds which have a more bitter taste,
1378000	1383000	ruining the otherwise enjoyable experience of a well-crafted green tea.
1384000	1387000	Just take a look at the pleasant tasting amino acid, theanine,
1387000	1391000	which makes up a sizable portion of the amino acid content of green tea.
1392000	1398000	Now take a look at tannic acid, a common polyphenol with a bitter dry taste.
1398000	1405000	Is it any wonder why theanine can be liberated from the hydroxyl-rich cellulose fibers of tea leaves more easily?
1405000	1410000	With all those hydrogen bonders, it's obvious it simply clings on tighter.
1412000	1418000	So a well-made green tea is a textbook example of a solid liquid chemical extraction,
1418000	1425000	selectively partitioning one type of compound into the liquid while leaving the other behind adhered to the solid matrix.
1426000	1431000	So if you're a green tea drinker, I congratulate you on being a great bench chemist as well.
1434000	1437000	So let's review what we've covered in this lecture.
1437000	1445000	We discussed the concept of immiscible liquids and how solvents of very low polarity tend to be immiscible in higher polarity solvents like water.
1446000	1451000	We talked about how organic solutes have a finite solubility in each solvent,
1451000	1457000	and how we can use this finite solubility to calculate what's known as a partitioning coefficient.
1458000	1467000	We then saw how the partitioning coefficient can be used to predict the relative amount of a given compound which will be found in each solvent at equilibrium.
1469000	1477000	Next, we took a look at how the pH of water can affect the total solubility of titratable organic compounds in that solvent,
1477000	1483000	and how that can drastically change partitioning coefficients predictably and often usefully.
1484000	1491000	Finally, we took a look at solid liquid extractions in which partitioning occurs not between two immiscible liquid phases,
1491000	1497000	but between being dissolved in solvent and being adhered to an insoluble solid.
1498000	1503000	And we saw how this technique is no different than the quest for the perfect cup of green tea.
1504000	1511000	But our discussion of partitioning is only half over. We still need to consider one last caveat.
1512000	1517000	See, this lecture's discussion focused on partitioning between two phases, which are at rest.
1518000	1529000	Next time, we're going to set one of those phases in motion, opening up the discussion to one of the most powerful separation techniques ever invented, chromatography.
1530000	1532000	I'll see you then.
1533000	1535000	Thank you.
