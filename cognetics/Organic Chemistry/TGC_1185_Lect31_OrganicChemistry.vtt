00:00.000 --> 00:16.600
Over our last few lectures, we've considered some of the techniques that organic chemists

00:16.600 --> 00:21.000
use to characterize organic compounds in their structures.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.200
Specifically, we've looked at UV-visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, polarimetry, and continuous

00:28.200 --> 00:31.120
wave NMR spectroscopy.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.640
Now all of these techniques were developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have

00:35.640 --> 00:40.100
no doubt contributed significantly to developing the basis for our understanding of organic

00:40.100 --> 00:43.000
chemistry.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.600
But in many cases, most notably the case of NMR, these techniques are not locked in time.

00:48.600 --> 00:54.600
They've been relentlessly expanded, improved upon, and even supplemented with newer techniques

00:54.600 --> 01:00.600
for identifications, just a few of which we're going to explore today.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.680
Now last time we explored the technique pioneered by Isidore Rebe and his contemporaries in the

01:05.680 --> 01:08.520
middle of the 20th century.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.840
Specifically we discussed the phenomenon of resonance and how factors like shielding

01:12.840 --> 01:20.760
and magnetic coupling can all affect the resonance behavior of specific protons within a sample.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.920
Today we will apply all of these principles and more as we investigate modern NMR spectrometers,

01:25.920 --> 01:30.840
which cannot only collect these spectra faster and more precisely, but are fundamentally

01:30.840 --> 01:34.400
different in the way which they do so.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.400
Several advances in technology have led to the development of what's called the pulsed

01:38.400 --> 01:40.880
NMR technique.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.240
First and foremost is the development of superconductors.

01:44.240 --> 01:49.520
See all modern high-field spectrometers use a superconducting magnet to generate an extremely

01:49.520 --> 01:56.840
high applied field, which helps us to achieve better resolution in the spectrum.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.680
Keeping these superconducting magnets cold is critical to their function, so spectrometers

02:01.680 --> 02:07.720
contain a series of concentric vacuum-walled compartments called duers.

02:07.720 --> 02:13.080
There's an exterior duer filled with liquid nitrogen and an interior duer containing liquid

02:13.080 --> 02:17.240
helium and the superconducting magnet itself.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.600
The liquid helium keeps the magnet itself at four kelvins, that's colder than the dark

02:22.600 --> 02:24.400
side of the moon.

02:24.400 --> 02:31.960
Meanwhile, just inches away from it is the organic sample at room temperature.

02:31.960 --> 02:37.920
The second advancement which opened the door to the pulsed NMR method is computer technology.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.600
The detector in NMR is more often called a receiver, because the response it creates

02:42.600 --> 02:48.280
is not a spectrum, but rather a raw data set which has to be manipulated by a computer

02:48.280 --> 02:50.720
before it can be used.

02:50.720 --> 02:57.000
So these two technologies, the superconducting material development and computing power advancement,

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
have allowed us to use this very effective technique to do so much more with NMR than

03:02.000 --> 03:07.240
could ever have been done in rabies day.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.600
As we try to explain the pulsed NMR method, we're going to rely on all the knowledge that

03:11.600 --> 03:13.880
we've gained in the previous lecture.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.320
That in the presence of a magnetic field, protons align their dipoles in the parallel

03:18.320 --> 03:24.200
alpha spin state or the anti-parallel beta spin state, and that the populations of these

03:24.200 --> 03:29.600
two states is governed by the Zeeman splitting.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.400
Zeeman splitting is the energy difference between the alpha and beta states and can

03:33.400 --> 03:39.280
be calculated using the field strength at the nucleus and the gyromagnetic ratio.

03:39.280 --> 03:44.960
But to really understand pulsed NMR will require us to acknowledge two additional principles.

03:44.960 --> 03:52.080
First, when an individual atomic dipole aligns itself with external magnetic field lines,

03:52.080 --> 03:57.680
the two are not actually perfectly parallel.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.440
You see the dipole processes about the applied field, much like this gyroscope, which I'm

04:02.440 --> 04:18.280
about to wind up so that we can see this for ourselves.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.520
So you can clearly see what's going on here.

04:20.520 --> 04:25.300
Let me quiet it down a bit for you so we can discuss.

04:25.300 --> 04:31.240
So the axis of that gyroscope was processing about the axis of the Earth's gravitational

04:31.240 --> 04:34.400
field, which is oriented straight up and down.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.920
Now just as that gyroscope would process, say, slower in the reduced gravity of the

04:38.920 --> 04:44.880
moon but faster in the higher gravity of Jupiter, so will the magnetic dipole of a nucleus

04:44.880 --> 04:51.400
process slower in a weaker field and faster in a stronger one.

04:51.400 --> 04:56.560
The frequency of this procession is known as the Larmore frequency, which is exactly

04:56.560 --> 05:00.320
the same as the resonance frequency for a given nucleus.

05:00.320 --> 05:05.080
So we can calculate the Larmore frequency for a given proton using the same equation

05:05.080 --> 05:10.400
relating it to the gyromagnetic ratio and effective field.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.000
Our second consideration.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.400
In a large collection of similar nuclei, the vector sum of all dipoles within the system

05:18.400 --> 05:24.280
will in fact be aligned with the applied field because of the dispersion of the rotating dipoles

05:24.280 --> 05:28.680
and the slight excess of the alpha spin state in the group.

05:28.680 --> 05:37.400
And it's the net magnetization, which is the source of the pulsed NMR signal.

05:37.400 --> 05:41.800
So let's set the stage for our first pulsed NMR experiment.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.560
First we need to get our bearings.

05:43.560 --> 05:50.240
So let's define a coordinate system such that three axes, x, y, and z, are present.

05:50.240 --> 05:55.200
The z-axis will be aligned with the applied magnetic field lines and therefore also with

05:55.200 --> 05:58.880
the net magnetization of the sample.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.480
Now what makes pulsed NMR so fundamentally different from the continuous wave experiment

06:03.480 --> 06:04.480
is this.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.960
There's no continuous wave.

06:06.960 --> 06:12.840
There is simply the magnetization generated by the protons within the sample.

06:12.840 --> 06:19.160
So they rely on a hard pulse of radio energy containing a very broad range of frequencies.

06:19.160 --> 06:24.680
This type of pulse electromagnetically pushes the net magnetization downward into the x,

06:24.680 --> 06:26.440
y plane.

06:26.440 --> 06:31.520
Now in my example, I've placed the magnetization along the x-axis.

06:31.520 --> 06:36.800
But just as soon as that hard radio frequency pulse is removed, the magnetization wants

06:36.800 --> 06:40.120
to return back to its original orientation.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.120
But here's the catch, its path is not straight.

06:43.120 --> 06:51.160
Instead, it processes about that z-axis at its Larmore frequency as it relaxes.

06:51.160 --> 06:57.440
It's this procession which is the basis for the raw data collected in a pulsed NMR experiment.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.680
But just how is this frequency measured?

07:00.680 --> 07:07.280
Well, consider first the analogy of a lighthouse with the beacon of light rotating at a given

07:07.280 --> 07:08.840
rate.

07:08.840 --> 07:13.440
If an observer stands at a fixed location and watches that lighthouse beacon rotate

07:13.440 --> 07:16.840
over a given period of time, what will they observe?

07:16.840 --> 07:21.400
Well, they'll observe the intensity of the beam first diminishing as the source rotates

07:21.400 --> 07:26.960
away, and then intensifying as it sweeps back in the observer's direction.

07:26.960 --> 07:32.520
And this process will continue for as long as that beam rotates.

07:32.520 --> 07:38.400
If we were to plot this intensity as a function of time, we would expect to observe a trigonometric

07:38.400 --> 07:43.040
function, specifically a cosine wave.

07:43.040 --> 07:48.520
So a Fourier transform of this function should transform my cosine function into the time

07:48.520 --> 07:51.640
domain into a single peak in the frequency domain.

07:51.640 --> 07:56.840
Now, a modern NMR spectrometer works on a similar principle, listening with the radio

07:56.840 --> 08:02.400
antenna which produces an alternating current in response to the rotation of the magnetic

08:02.400 --> 08:04.680
vectors in the sample.

08:05.680 --> 08:09.360
Now, where this analogy breaks down is the fact that the magnetization of our sample

08:09.360 --> 08:14.240
not only rotates, but also relaxes back to its original orientation.

08:14.240 --> 08:20.480
So the x, y vector component of this magnetization is not only rotating, but also weakening as

08:20.480 --> 08:22.840
the experiment progresses.

08:22.840 --> 08:27.280
And this produces a decaying AC current at the detector.

08:27.280 --> 08:33.360
It's a plot of that decaying AC current intensity versus time, which is the raw data produced

08:33.360 --> 08:35.400
by the spectrometer.

08:35.400 --> 08:43.320
And we call this the free induction decay, or FID for short.

08:43.320 --> 08:47.680
So now that we understand how a spectrometer collects information about the Larmore frequency

08:47.680 --> 08:52.280
of a collection of protons, I want to show you how we convert this information into something

08:52.280 --> 08:57.760
more useful to us, like a completed NMR spectrum, the likes of which we saw last time in the

08:57.760 --> 09:00.680
continuous wave experiment.

09:00.680 --> 09:06.240
So let's begin by looking at a raw data set for a pulsed NMR experiment known as a free

09:06.240 --> 09:08.560
induction decay.

09:08.560 --> 09:13.900
On my horizontal axis will be time, because I'm in the time domain, and my vertical axis

09:13.900 --> 09:17.800
will be the intensity of the AC current.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.600
So I expect to see something like this.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.120
Now what's interesting about this particular data set is that it's so simple that I can

09:25.120 --> 09:27.040
interpret it without transforming it.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.920
So let's do that first.

09:28.920 --> 09:33.840
There are really only two different frequencies embedded within this particular free induction

09:33.840 --> 09:35.800
decay.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.720
One frequency, which is rather fast, frequency A, so the amount of time for one oscillation

09:40.720 --> 09:43.960
to take place here is very short.

09:43.960 --> 09:49.040
But if you look carefully, frequency A is embedded on top of a larger, longer frequency

09:49.040 --> 09:50.400
here.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.760
This would be frequency B.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.720
So my data set contained two frequencies.

09:56.720 --> 10:01.280
Now NMR data sets for actual samples can contain dozens or even hundreds of different

10:01.280 --> 10:06.640
frequencies all superimposed on one another, so it's not always quite this easy.

10:06.640 --> 10:12.600
And to solve that problem, we use a mathematical operator known as the Fourier transform.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.960
The Fourier transform is very complex, and we won't cover in detail today exactly how

10:16.960 --> 10:21.120
it's done, but what's important here is the outcome.

10:21.120 --> 10:27.040
If I Fourier transform my data set, I alter the time domain and start looking at my data

10:27.040 --> 10:29.880
instead in the frequency domain.

10:29.880 --> 10:36.320
So my higher frequency, frequency A, is somewhere down here in the downfield region of my continuous

10:36.320 --> 10:43.160
wave experiment, whereas a longer frequency or a lower frequency like frequency B would

10:43.160 --> 10:46.760
be somewhere up here in my upfield region of the spectrum.

10:46.760 --> 10:52.160
So we actually plot our data with higher longer frequencies at the left-hand side of

10:52.160 --> 10:58.200
our plot, which might seem a little bit counterintuitive, but remember, this is the same type of information

10:58.200 --> 11:01.720
that's included in a continuous wave experiment.

11:01.720 --> 11:07.280
So to be sure that we can compare spectra collected in, say, the year 2014 with spectra

11:07.280 --> 11:13.120
collected in the 1950s, we alter the axis in such a way that our frequencies are sort

11:13.120 --> 11:16.740
of reversed from what we would expect.

11:16.740 --> 11:19.620
So let's move on to another technique.

11:19.620 --> 11:26.020
In 1895, a new class of electromagnetic radiation was discovered by German physicist

11:26.020 --> 11:28.780
Wilhelm Rundgen.

11:28.780 --> 11:33.140
Rundgen immediately realized the significance of his discovery and published his findings

11:33.140 --> 11:39.540
the same year, referring to the uncharacterized radiation only as x-rays.

11:39.540 --> 11:43.700
Rundgen was not the only one who saw potential in his new discovery, either.

11:43.700 --> 11:49.820
He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics, in fact, the first one ever in 1901, just six

11:49.820 --> 11:54.340
years after his discovery.

11:54.340 --> 11:59.420
But it would be a decade after Rundgen's Nobel Prize award that one of the most impactful

11:59.420 --> 12:02.820
applications of x-rays would be developed.

12:02.820 --> 12:08.740
English physicist William Lawrence Bragg, working in collaboration with his father, opened

12:08.740 --> 12:13.220
up this entirely new part of the electromagnetic spectrum to the art of identifying organic

12:13.220 --> 12:19.420
molecules when he developed a technique to elucidate the structure of crystalline materials

12:19.420 --> 12:23.340
using x-rays.

12:23.340 --> 12:28.020
Bragg and his father had recognized that crystalline materials had a peculiar effect on x-rays as

12:28.020 --> 12:30.020
they interacted.

12:30.020 --> 12:35.620
There's a scattering effect caused by the electron cloud of each atom in the solid substance,

12:35.620 --> 12:40.240
producing a spherical, diffracted wave of the same wavelength as the one which first came

12:40.240 --> 12:43.060
into the crystal.

12:43.060 --> 12:48.580
Now in a crystalline material, the atoms or ions are spaced regularly and evenly, creating

12:48.580 --> 12:54.100
planes of evenly spaced positions capable of creating these spherical waves which propagate

12:54.100 --> 12:55.100
out.

12:55.100 --> 12:59.700
Now to give you an idea of how we can use this to get information about structure, I'm

12:59.700 --> 13:04.280
going to show you a very simple relationship between just two atoms.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.820
Each atom is represented here by one of my blue spheres.

13:07.820 --> 13:12.460
So in the left case example, my two atoms are closer together in space than are the two

13:12.540 --> 13:14.340
on the right side.

13:14.340 --> 13:19.420
So how can I use x-rays to get information about the distances between these two?

13:19.420 --> 13:21.980
Well, the key is in the scattering.

13:21.980 --> 13:25.780
So if I have a coherent x-ray beam which in this case is going to be coming in from the

13:25.780 --> 13:31.460
left hand side of my monitor and striking these atoms, their electron clouds respond

13:31.460 --> 13:33.660
by emitting a spherical wave.

13:33.660 --> 13:37.700
And that spherical wave has a very well-defined wavelength, exactly the same as the incident

13:37.700 --> 13:38.940
light.

13:38.940 --> 13:43.500
So let's create, in this case since it's on a two-dimensional surface, circles but

13:43.500 --> 13:47.180
they'll represent the spherical waves that are created during diffraction.

13:47.180 --> 13:52.740
Now the pattern looks pretty complicated, doesn't it?

13:52.740 --> 13:56.100
But it's actually not as complicated as you may think.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.660
Now x-rays have the ability to expose photographic film.

13:59.660 --> 14:05.460
So if I place a photographic plate in a certain proximity to my crystal, only those locations

14:05.500 --> 14:10.660
where the propagating spherical waves interfere with one another constructively, should I

14:10.660 --> 14:12.820
see exposure?

14:12.820 --> 14:17.540
So in this case, I expect to see a pattern of spots developing along my film where there

14:17.540 --> 14:21.780
is constructive interference causing those spherical waves to continue propagating through

14:21.780 --> 14:24.540
space.

14:24.540 --> 14:29.540
Now let's do the same experiment but on my atoms that are spaced farther apart.

14:29.540 --> 14:35.020
Again, my spherical waves propagate and in some places interfere constructively and in

14:35.020 --> 14:37.020
others destructively.

14:37.020 --> 14:43.180
But if I place my photographic plate at the same distance and do the same analysis, look

14:43.180 --> 14:44.260
what's happened.

14:44.260 --> 14:48.620
The spatial relationships of the exposures on my film have changed.

14:48.620 --> 14:54.380
So by analyzing the patterns that result from this diffraction phenomenon, we can back-calculate

14:54.380 --> 14:57.940
the spatial arrangement of atoms within a crystal and structure.

14:57.940 --> 15:02.060
This is the principle on which x-ray diffraction works.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.740
Now understanding how the diffraction patterns develop and actually observing them is always

15:05.740 --> 15:11.620
challenging for students, in part because our eyes can't see x-rays, but our eyes can

15:11.620 --> 15:13.380
see visible light.

15:13.380 --> 15:19.100
And while the distances between atoms are so small that they require x-rays to resolve,

15:19.100 --> 15:24.540
we can create little gadgets that we use in the classroom, in the laboratories, to show

15:24.540 --> 15:26.820
a diffraction pattern using visible light.

15:26.820 --> 15:30.620
I'm going to do that for you right now, so to help you out, I need to dim the lights.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.140
Alright, I'm going to begin by showing you a dot from my laser pointer.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.540
Not very exciting, is it?

15:36.540 --> 15:37.660
But it's coherent light.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.620
It's light of a single wavelength.

15:40.620 --> 15:45.020
And when that light interacts with a grating, which is spaced somewhere around the wavelength

15:45.020 --> 15:49.980
of that light, I can cause that light to diffract just like the x-rays do within a crystal.

15:49.980 --> 15:55.380
For example, this is a diffraction pattern for a relatively simple grating.

15:55.380 --> 15:59.820
And depending upon the spacing and the geometry of the separations, the striations and the

15:59.820 --> 16:06.500
slides I'm using, I can create different patterns using just one laser pointer.

16:06.500 --> 16:10.780
And encoded within these patterns is all the information about the geometry within the

16:10.780 --> 16:13.500
striations in the slides.

16:13.500 --> 16:19.140
In fact, with a little bit of practice and the right kit, I can show you the exact structure

16:19.140 --> 16:23.300
that Rosalind Franklin and Watson and Crick saw when they characterized the structure

16:23.300 --> 16:25.500
of DNA for the very first time.

16:25.500 --> 16:30.380
This in fact contains all the symmetry elements of a DNA double helix.

16:30.380 --> 16:33.540
It's a pretty amazing trick, isn't it?

16:33.540 --> 16:39.140
All of those different patterns created using just a single beam of coherent red light and

16:39.140 --> 16:43.660
some special slides, which you can't quite tell by looking at them, but they contain

16:43.660 --> 16:48.980
striations that are just a few hundred nanometers wide and therefore interact with that visible

16:48.980 --> 16:54.060
light in a very similar fashion to the way that the atoms within a crystal interact with

16:54.060 --> 16:57.460
X-rays.

16:57.460 --> 17:02.380
So by shining a beam of X-rays on a crystal, then exposing a photographic film to the diffracted

17:02.380 --> 17:08.700
waves, a circular pattern like those we just saw with visible light can be obtained.

17:08.700 --> 17:12.860
Encoded within this image are all the angles of these symmetry planes within the crystal

17:12.860 --> 17:14.860
that produce them.

17:14.860 --> 17:21.300
Now, in 1913, Bragg and his father famously published a paper detailing the crystal structure

17:21.300 --> 17:24.340
of diamond by X-ray diffraction.

17:24.340 --> 17:28.620
This structure is special because it proved for the first time that carbon was in fact

17:28.620 --> 17:35.380
a tetrahedral atom in its SP3 hybridized state, just as chemists had suspected for decades.

17:35.380 --> 17:44.220
And for that contribution, Bragg and his father shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915.

17:44.220 --> 17:48.180
X-ray diffraction has since been used to validate many structural theories, including some of

17:48.180 --> 17:51.500
those offered by chemists long before its creation.

17:51.500 --> 17:56.180
A great example of this is the concept of aromaticity and anti-aromaticity.

17:56.180 --> 18:01.460
It validated Kikuli's benzene ring with Robert Robinson's six evenly spaced carbon atoms

18:01.460 --> 18:05.780
about a symmetrical six-membered ring.

18:05.780 --> 18:09.540
It also has been used to test Huckel's rule for aromaticity and anti-aromaticity using

18:09.540 --> 18:15.900
cyclo-octotetraene, which clearly has a puckert to the ring and also clearly has two different

18:15.900 --> 18:23.020
carbon-carbon bond lengths within the ring because of its anti-aromaticity.

18:23.020 --> 18:27.220
In recent years, it has helped to produce many of the amazing protein and DNA models

18:27.220 --> 18:31.600
which we used in the associated units of this course, including the remarkable potassium

18:31.600 --> 18:36.260
channel protein structures which won Roderick McKinnon and his Nobel Prize.

18:36.260 --> 18:41.820
In short, X-ray crystallography may be the most powerful structural determination tool

18:41.820 --> 18:45.660
ever invented.

18:45.660 --> 18:49.500
Our final technique in this lecture will be mass spectrometry.

18:49.500 --> 18:55.220
Now we call this technique spectrometry rather than spectroscopy because unlike the other

18:55.220 --> 19:00.300
techniques that we've discussed so far, in mass spectrometry we're not measuring the

19:00.300 --> 19:02.940
direct interaction of light with matter.

19:02.940 --> 19:07.820
See, mass spectrometers were first developed to help us better characterize the structure

19:07.820 --> 19:14.260
of atoms, but modern mass spectrometers are used more commonly in a variety of applications.

19:14.260 --> 19:18.100
They find use in criminal forensics labs, searching for the residue of gunpowder or

19:18.100 --> 19:22.060
the metabolites of illegal drugs.

19:22.060 --> 19:25.100
Anyone who's traveled through the American airport system in recent decades has almost

19:25.100 --> 19:29.700
certainly seen a security agent swab the baggage or clothing of a traveler inserting that swab

19:29.700 --> 19:33.820
into a small device and then waiting for a result before allowing that passenger to pass

19:33.820 --> 19:34.820
on.

19:34.820 --> 19:39.820
Well, the device that they're using is a mass spectrometer, searching for trace amounts

19:39.820 --> 19:44.460
of chemicals used in the creation of explosives.

19:44.460 --> 19:49.740
Modern mass spectrometers even have the ability to help us sequence sophisticated proteins,

19:49.740 --> 19:56.680
characterize DNA and learn more about complex biomolecular systems too.

19:56.680 --> 20:01.300
The influential analytical technique was first developed by British scientist Sir Joseph

20:01.300 --> 20:05.340
John Thompson in the first decade of the 20th century.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.700
Thompson was already a prolific physics researcher, having won the 1906 Nobel Prize

20:09.700 --> 20:13.420
for his discovery of the electron a decade earlier.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.980
Now you might think that reaching such a pinnacle of scientific achievement would mean that

20:16.980 --> 20:22.780
Thompson would relax and enjoy his acclaim, but most researchers with the passion, talent

20:22.780 --> 20:27.980
and determination required to win the Nobel Prize are not the kind to rest on even such

20:27.980 --> 20:32.940
a high laurel, and Thompson was no exception.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.700
As he continued his research into subatomic particles, Thompson turned his attention to

20:36.700 --> 20:43.060
the nucleus of the atom, seeking any clue of the existence of subatomic particles there.

20:43.060 --> 20:47.220
He found what he was looking for when he was able to create a beam of ionized neon gas

20:47.220 --> 20:49.260
in his lab.

20:49.260 --> 20:53.620
He aimed that beam at a piece of photographic paper, passing it through a magnetic field

20:53.620 --> 20:55.060
to get it there.

20:55.060 --> 21:00.100
And Thompson knew that when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences

21:00.100 --> 21:05.900
a force which is dependent on its charge and velocity, but not on its mass.

21:05.900 --> 21:10.460
So basically the field pushes all ions moving through it with equal force.

21:10.460 --> 21:15.980
So naturally he expected to see all of his neon ions being deflected to the same extent,

21:15.980 --> 21:21.340
striking the photographic paper in the same exact spot.

21:21.340 --> 21:24.740
But what he saw was different and remarkable.

21:24.740 --> 21:27.980
Two different spots formed on the developed paper.

21:27.980 --> 21:32.900
So Thompson had observed neon atoms behaving as if they had two different masses.

21:32.900 --> 21:36.300
He had proven the existence of elemental isotopes.

21:36.300 --> 21:41.060
Atoms of the same element, different atomic masses.

21:41.060 --> 21:45.820
The only logical explanation for his observation was that atomic nuclei must be made up of

21:45.820 --> 21:50.380
something smaller than themselves.

21:50.380 --> 21:54.780
But mass spectrometry is useful for much more than the study of atomic structure.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.500
In the past half century it has become a favorite technique of chemical researchers

21:58.500 --> 22:03.100
and forensics laboratories because of its amazing ability to identify unknown compounds

22:03.100 --> 22:06.860
quickly and efficiently.

22:06.860 --> 22:10.900
So let's get busy exploring a simple mass spectrometry experiment using an organic

22:10.900 --> 22:12.660
compound.

22:12.660 --> 22:16.460
For this discussion I'll be using a rather simple molecule, pentane, and describing

22:16.460 --> 22:20.220
the most basic of mass spectrometry techniques.

22:20.220 --> 22:24.540
The mass spectrometry experiment is extremely sensitive and requires that we generate a

22:24.540 --> 22:27.740
high energy, very reactive species.

22:27.740 --> 22:32.380
So the experiment has to take place in a really high vacuum.

22:32.380 --> 22:36.620
This basically ensures that frequent collisions of our analyte ions with others or with atmospheric

22:36.620 --> 22:39.380
gases are avoided.

22:39.380 --> 22:43.740
Now inside of a typical mass spectrometer, the pressure is about the same as it is on

22:43.740 --> 22:48.260
the outside of the International Space Station.

22:48.260 --> 22:55.100
There are three main components to a mass spectrometer, an ionizer, a mass analyzer,

22:55.100 --> 22:57.220
and a detector.

22:57.220 --> 23:03.780
As the name implies, the ionizer is responsible for creating a beam of gas phase ions.

23:03.780 --> 23:08.700
These ions then pass through a mass analyzer, which modifies their motion using an applied

23:08.700 --> 23:10.580
magnetic field.

23:10.580 --> 23:16.780
Finally, the ions collide with the detector placed such that only ions taking a specific

23:16.780 --> 23:21.340
trajectory will strike it.

23:21.340 --> 23:25.260
So step one for our pentane molecule is the ionization process.

23:25.260 --> 23:31.300
In our example, we're going to use electron impact ionization as the ionization technique.

23:31.300 --> 23:35.100
This method involves passing the gas phase pentane molecules through a beam of high

23:35.100 --> 23:37.140
energy electrons.

23:37.140 --> 23:41.980
And as this happens, occasionally an electron strikes a pentane molecule, knocking an electron

23:41.980 --> 23:45.540
out of its cloud.

23:45.540 --> 23:49.820
This process generates a radical cation of pentane.

23:49.820 --> 23:54.820
Something like this would most likely never form in a lab bench, but in a high vacuum

23:54.820 --> 24:01.220
being bombarded with electrons, we can expect to see some pretty strange things.

24:01.220 --> 24:05.720
If the pentane survives the ionization process, it moves to a magnetic field which is carefully

24:05.720 --> 24:10.500
shaped to deflect ions in a known direction.

24:10.500 --> 24:17.020
Singly charged ions like ours moving through a field will experience a force.

24:17.020 --> 24:22.340
Since force equals mass times acceleration, the acceleration or curvature of the ions

24:22.340 --> 24:26.580
path is inversely proportional to its mass.

24:26.580 --> 24:32.420
And because all moving singly charged positive ions experience the same force in our field,

24:32.420 --> 24:38.060
we can say that more massive ions are deflected to lesser extents.

24:38.060 --> 24:43.220
So knowing the mathematics governing the physics of deflection, we simply increase or decrease

24:43.220 --> 24:48.740
the strength of the magnetic field until the detector indicates a hit.

24:48.740 --> 24:53.960
So when using only monovalent ions, meaning ions with a single charge, we expect to see

24:53.960 --> 24:59.820
just one peak for pentane at a charge to mass ratio of 72.

24:59.820 --> 25:03.580
There will also be a few smaller peaks produced by the natural abundance of deuterium and

25:03.580 --> 25:10.740
carbon-13 in our sample, so those will weigh 73, maybe even 74.

25:10.740 --> 25:15.180
But this mass spectrum wouldn't be as useful as I led you to believe, would it?

25:15.180 --> 25:18.900
After all, how many different organic compounds are there with a mass of 72?

25:18.900 --> 25:19.900
There's plenty.

25:19.900 --> 25:27.180
Just for a start, how about the three geometric isomers of n-pentane, isopentane and neopentane?

25:27.180 --> 25:31.860
So how is it that mass spectrometry is so useful for identification when so many molecules

25:31.860 --> 25:34.900
share the same molecular mass?

25:34.900 --> 25:39.380
The answer lies in a phenomenon we initially neglected, which takes place during the ionization

25:39.380 --> 25:40.780
process.

25:40.780 --> 25:46.060
So let's rewind and look at our experiment one more time.

25:46.060 --> 25:50.220
So let's set a few tenets before we continue our discussion here.

25:50.220 --> 25:53.980
All mass spectrometry experiments require some kind of ionization.

25:53.980 --> 25:58.180
Now the type that I'll talk about today isn't the only kind, but it's called electron impact

25:58.180 --> 26:03.020
ionization, and it's very popular for use in small organic molecules.

26:03.020 --> 26:07.780
And in this technique, a high-energy electron is going to impact a molecule and knock another

26:07.780 --> 26:13.180
electron out of the cloud in a sort of game of molecular billiards.

26:13.180 --> 26:20.820
So as a cartoon representation, here I have a gas-phase molecule, and my gas-phase molecule

26:20.820 --> 26:22.700
has an electron cloud.

26:22.700 --> 26:26.420
And I'm going to strike one of the electrons from that cloud with a high-energy electron

26:26.420 --> 26:30.660
from outside the molecule.

26:30.660 --> 26:33.460
Not pleasant for the molecule.

26:33.460 --> 26:40.380
But what it does is relieve it of one electron, generating a cation with an unpaired electron,

26:40.380 --> 26:42.380
which is a very unstable species.

26:42.380 --> 26:43.900
So they don't always survive.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.500
In fact, they rarely survive.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.100
In many cases, they break apart.

26:48.100 --> 26:53.020
And when they do so, most often, the charge and the radical or the unpaired electron

26:53.020 --> 26:57.820
go the separate ways.

26:57.820 --> 27:03.020
OK, so let's get out of the cartoon world here and look at a real molecule, pentane.

27:03.020 --> 27:04.020
One more time.

27:04.020 --> 27:07.620
We're going to ionize this with electron impact.

27:07.620 --> 27:11.540
So my pentane has an electron cloud, which is depicted here in motion, and I have an

27:11.540 --> 27:17.740
incoming high-energy electron, which strikes one and then ejects it from the electron cloud.

27:17.740 --> 27:21.540
I've created a radical cation.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.260
But remember, radical cations are very unstable.

27:24.260 --> 27:26.380
And in the case of pentane, there can be a fragmentation.

27:26.380 --> 27:30.220
I'm going to draw my fragmentation occurring here at one of the terminal carbon-carbon

27:30.220 --> 27:32.980
bonds.

27:32.980 --> 27:38.100
What takes place most often is a homolytic bond cleavage, which means the two electrons

27:38.100 --> 27:41.940
go in different directions.

27:41.940 --> 27:44.780
And when this happens, the bond breaks.

27:44.780 --> 27:50.140
But not only that, but my radical and my positive charge go to separate sides of that broken

27:50.140 --> 27:55.220
molecule or that broken ion.

27:55.220 --> 28:02.300
So in this example, I've created a methyl radical and a butyl cation.

28:02.300 --> 28:06.180
And the relative stabilities of these ions and radicals is what's going to dictate how

28:06.180 --> 28:10.620
many of them form in my experiment.

28:10.620 --> 28:14.420
So let's take a quick moment here and finish out our day by looking at what we expect to

28:14.420 --> 28:17.900
be the mass spectrum of pentane.

28:17.900 --> 28:23.460
The mass of pentane, or m over z as we report it, because z is a factor of charge, but remember,

28:23.460 --> 28:25.620
our process only creates charges of 1.

28:25.620 --> 28:29.380
So my m over z can be thought of as a mass.

28:29.380 --> 28:32.380
I have my molecular ion with a mass of 72.

28:32.380 --> 28:35.820
But I also can expect there to potentially be fragments involved in the breaking of the

28:35.820 --> 28:37.940
terminal bond.

28:37.940 --> 28:45.980
When this happens, I can get two possible pairs, a methyl radical and primary cation or a primary

28:45.980 --> 28:48.020
radical and a methyl cation.

28:48.020 --> 28:53.340
In these cases, the masses of the ions generated are 57 and 15 respectively.

28:53.340 --> 29:00.820
Similarly, I could have the internal carbon-carbon bond break, generating another two pairs.

29:00.820 --> 29:05.460
But notice that this time, the two pairs that are generated are both primary, so a primary

29:05.460 --> 29:10.140
radical and a primary cation, slightly more stable than the others.

29:10.140 --> 29:14.820
So my peaks at m over z of 43 and 29 are expected to be a little bit larger.

29:14.820 --> 29:20.780
In fact, that's exactly what we see in the mass spectrum of pentane using this method.

29:20.780 --> 29:25.980
We see a mass spectrum in which the peaks at 29 and 43 are larger than those at 15,

29:25.980 --> 29:30.220
57, and even at 72.

29:30.220 --> 29:33.580
We also see a little bit of those isotope peaks in there.

29:33.580 --> 29:39.100
So here we have smaller peaks for the ions that are generated along with radicals that

29:39.100 --> 29:41.460
are of lower substitution.

29:41.460 --> 29:44.860
We see larger peaks when there's greater substitution.

29:44.860 --> 29:47.860
And again, in this case, the molecular ion itself is one of the smallest peaks in the

29:47.860 --> 29:49.620
spectrum.

29:49.620 --> 29:54.380
So if we continue thinking about our simple example of pentane, by comparing its fragments

29:54.380 --> 29:59.700
and their abundance with those produced in isopentane and neopentane, we can find clear

29:59.700 --> 30:06.260
and predictable differences which enable us to discriminate between their mass spectrum.

30:06.260 --> 30:10.780
Of course, hydrocarbons are not the only compounds with this molecular mass.

30:10.780 --> 30:15.100
Consider acrylic acid, also 72 atomic mass units.

30:15.100 --> 30:18.540
Its molecular ion is the same mass as that of pentane.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.340
But look at its fragmentation pattern.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.780
It's quite different, isn't it?

30:22.780 --> 30:28.460
So it's clear from the masses of the fragments that ions created by loss of a hydroxyl group,

30:28.460 --> 30:35.300
loss of a carboxylic acid group, and also by loss of a vinyl group are all present.

30:35.300 --> 30:41.220
So this example shows very clearly how not the molecular mass but the fragmentation pattern

30:41.220 --> 30:46.860
is the key to much of the utility of this technique.

30:46.860 --> 30:50.220
We've all probably heard the amusing story of a person making the unfortunate decision

30:50.220 --> 30:55.020
to eat a poppy seed bagel before a urinalysis drug screening, only to be told afterward

30:55.020 --> 30:58.380
that they've tested positive for heroin use.

30:58.380 --> 31:03.140
The situation has been explored by such popular programs as mythbusters and parodied on popular

31:03.140 --> 31:06.140
comedy programs like Seinfeld.

31:06.140 --> 31:11.900
If the MS used in the urinalysis is so powerful and accurate, how then can it be defeated

31:11.900 --> 31:15.700
by something as simple as a poppy seed?

31:15.700 --> 31:17.740
The answer is actually quite simple.

31:17.740 --> 31:23.580
And it's a perfect illustration of the limitation of spectroscopy and spectrometry in general.

31:23.580 --> 31:29.980
You see, morphine and heroin only differ in structure by the presence of two acetyl groups.

31:29.980 --> 31:35.100
Now these acetyl groups are added to the naturally occurring morphine from poppy seeds by a

31:35.100 --> 31:41.500
sterification with acetic and hydride, a technique which we explored in our estrus module.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.620
Now of course the seed from mature flowers is needed, and I'm leaving out a few important

31:45.620 --> 31:50.100
details from the process in the hopes of avoiding a visit from the United States DEA after this

31:50.100 --> 31:52.220
taping.

31:52.220 --> 31:56.660
But where the story comes to bear on the limitations of spectrometry is this.

31:56.660 --> 32:02.100
Once injected a fraction of the heroin molecules are slowly hydrolyzed back into morphine by

32:02.100 --> 32:04.820
enzymes in the user's blood.

32:04.820 --> 32:09.060
The resulting morphine is modified and further broken down in the liver.

32:09.060 --> 32:13.380
And finally these metabolites are eliminated from the user's system winding up in their

32:13.380 --> 32:16.180
urine.

32:16.180 --> 32:21.700
Many drug urinalysis techniques use mass spectrometry to search for the metabolic byproducts of heroin

32:21.700 --> 32:26.860
which are practically identical to those of morphine which is present naturally in poppy

32:26.860 --> 32:32.100
seeds used in the food industry.

32:32.100 --> 32:36.380
This is a fantastic example of the utility of even the most powerful instruments can

32:36.380 --> 32:41.260
be not only a function of the technology, but of the human element as well.

32:41.260 --> 32:46.300
In short, no spectral analysis is ever complete without careful contemplation on the part

32:46.300 --> 32:49.740
of the researcher.

32:49.740 --> 32:54.140
So let's summarize the last of our spectroscopic techniques.

32:54.140 --> 32:58.980
Today we looked at pulsed NMR and how modern technology allows us to use superconducting

32:58.980 --> 33:05.220
magnets and radio receivers to measure the larmor frequency of spin one half nuclei.

33:05.220 --> 33:10.020
This reproduces the information from a continuous wave experiment, but in a miniscule fraction

33:10.020 --> 33:13.340
of the time.

33:13.340 --> 33:17.740
We touched on x-ray crystallography and how scattering of these high energy rays by the

33:17.740 --> 33:22.780
electron clouds of highly ordered atoms leads to a pattern of interference in the scattered

33:22.780 --> 33:28.980
light and this pattern can be used to back calculate that regular arrangement.

33:28.980 --> 33:33.500
We viewed a few of these structures and discussed how this technique has been used to validate

33:33.500 --> 33:37.420
many of the structural theories which preceded it.

33:37.420 --> 33:42.100
Then we took a look at mass spectrometry and we saw how ionization, mass analysis and

33:42.100 --> 33:47.300
detection systems work and specifically how electron impact generates the molecular

33:47.340 --> 33:53.700
ions and fragment ions, how a magnetic field is used to deflect each ion to a detector

33:53.700 --> 33:59.420
which generates an electrical current when struck by ions.

33:59.420 --> 34:03.980
We discussed how the identity and abundance of fragments in the spectrum can be used to

34:03.980 --> 34:08.740
deduce the structure of compounds analyzed even when multiple candidates have the same

34:08.740 --> 34:11.100
molecular mass.

34:11.100 --> 34:15.020
And finally we had an object lesson in the human element of identifications and how we

34:15.020 --> 34:20.220
must always remember that these techniques have their limitations.

34:20.220 --> 34:24.660
So we finished our short survey of techniques used for identifying organic compounds once

34:24.660 --> 34:27.620
they've been made or extracted in the labs.

34:27.620 --> 34:32.020
But we have yet to really discuss how we can achieve high levels of purity, the levels

34:32.020 --> 34:35.540
of which are necessary to use some of these spectroscopic techniques.

34:35.540 --> 34:40.260
We're going to broach this subject in our next lecture when we start by discussing how

34:40.340 --> 34:45.380
to get the purest possible sample using a technique known as recrystallization.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.900
I'll see you for that talk next time.
