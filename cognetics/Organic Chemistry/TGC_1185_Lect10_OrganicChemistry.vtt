00:00.000 --> 00:17.280
The field of industrial refrigeration has had obvious impacts on global economies, health,

00:17.280 --> 00:19.200
and so much more.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.680
Just think about how many times in the past week you've reached for a medicine or a meal

00:22.680 --> 00:26.240
which was not freshly prepared for you.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.800
The need to cool materials as a means of preserving them has been commonplace since

00:29.800 --> 00:32.760
the beginning of recorded history.

00:32.760 --> 00:37.320
But for most of that recorded history, the cooling of foodstuffs was accomplished by transporting

00:37.320 --> 00:44.980
ice and snow from higher elevations or by digging of cellars or other rudimentary methods.

00:44.980 --> 00:50.360
In 1826, American Frederick Tudor founded a company shipping ice from the cold pond

00:50.360 --> 00:57.160
waters of Massachusetts to regions as far away as the Caribbean, Europe, and even India.

00:57.160 --> 01:02.720
So high was the demand for this product in the 1800s and so lucrative was Tudor's enterprise

01:02.720 --> 01:07.000
that he was famously able to ride out one additional business failure after another,

01:07.000 --> 01:15.160
relying on his sole thriving company to become the world's first and probably only ice magnate.

01:15.160 --> 01:20.200
But transportation of ice isn't the oldest recorded method of cooling foodstuffs.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.560
The people of India had discovered centuries before Tudor that the contents of clay pots

01:24.560 --> 01:30.080
could be cooled by allowing the water to permeate into the clay of the containers and then placing

01:30.080 --> 01:35.760
those containers outside to allow the water to evaporate from their surfaces.

01:35.760 --> 01:40.160
You see, evaporation of a liquid means its conversion from the liquid state to the vapor

01:40.160 --> 01:47.160
state and this process requires that heat be absorbed by that evaporating material.

01:47.160 --> 01:51.960
And the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, leads us to the conclusion that

01:51.960 --> 01:58.760
any heat absorbed by evaporating material must be removed from the solid material left behind.

01:58.760 --> 02:03.440
So as water evaporates from the pots, the pots themselves are cooled.

02:03.440 --> 02:08.680
This method of refrigeration is known as evaporative cooling.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.240
As you might expect, effective evaporative cooling requires that quite a bit of material

02:13.240 --> 02:15.840
be converted from the liquid to the vapor state.

02:15.840 --> 02:21.240
And in the technique I just described to you, the coolant, which is water, vaporizes and

02:21.240 --> 02:23.240
then is lost to the atmosphere.

02:23.240 --> 02:27.240
If you want to cool again or any further, you have to get more liquid water and repeat

02:27.240 --> 02:29.560
the process.

02:29.560 --> 02:34.880
But in 1835, an American inventor named Jacob Perkins patented a system in which vaporized

02:34.880 --> 02:40.400
refrigerant was not allowed to escape, but was piped into a different region of an apparatus

02:40.400 --> 02:46.600
where it was recondensed, allowing it to be pumped back into the cooling chamber and revaporized.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.560
The vapor compression refrigeration system had been born.

02:50.560 --> 02:57.440
Now, in 1835, Perkin had to use what was available to him as a refrigerant, highly flammable,

02:57.440 --> 03:01.000
somewhat toxic, and rather expensive ether.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.920
Naturally, his invention was not viable competition for the ice shipping industry for these reasons.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.160
Paying extra money for a refrigerator, which was somewhat likely to blow up, didn't seem

03:11.160 --> 03:14.000
like a good investment to most people.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.800
But the engineers of this era didn't give up.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.440
And over the next century, experimentation with different refrigerants and compression

03:20.440 --> 03:22.120
systems continued.

03:22.120 --> 03:27.920
Still, none could provide safe, cost-effective, reliable cooling the way that imported ice

03:27.920 --> 03:30.320
could.

03:30.320 --> 03:34.680
But near the end of the 19th century, this changed with the introduction of a new class

03:34.680 --> 03:39.800
of refrigerants called alkylhalides.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.960
As the name implies, alkylhalides can be thought of as alkanes, in which one or more of the

03:44.960 --> 03:48.400
hydrogen atoms has been replaced with a halogen.

03:48.400 --> 03:54.040
This is from column 7 of the periodic table containing fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
iodine.

03:55.040 --> 03:59.400
Now, we've already seen ways in which a halogen can be introduced to a carbon-containing

03:59.400 --> 04:03.000
scaffold via radical halogenation.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.880
And we've even performed an analysis on the chiral center of one of these compounds in

04:06.880 --> 04:09.240
the form of Freon 151.

04:09.240 --> 04:18.800
Today, we're going to see exactly why anyone would want to create such a compound.

04:18.800 --> 04:24.640
As you just saw, we commonly refer to simple alkylhalides as alkylfluorides, chlorides,

04:24.640 --> 04:29.040
bromides, or iodides, depending on which halogen is attached.

04:29.040 --> 04:33.280
Do not, however, let this fool you into thinking that the halogens are ionized as they are

04:33.280 --> 04:38.560
in inorganic materials, like sodium chloride, for example, and table salt.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.440
These are, in fact, covalently bonded to the carbon atom.

04:42.440 --> 04:48.680
Now, in addition to classifying alkylhalides by which halogen is attached, organic chemists

04:48.680 --> 04:53.200
frequently classify alkylhalides based upon the substitution of the carbon bearing the

04:53.200 --> 04:54.440
halogen.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.520
We call this atom the alpha carbon.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.960
Now, if there are no other carbons attached to this alpha carbon, we call the compound

05:01.960 --> 05:04.240
a methylhalide.

05:04.240 --> 05:09.280
One alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon is a primary alkylhalide.

05:09.280 --> 05:14.120
Two attached groups is a secondary, and three would be called a tertiary alkylhalide.

05:14.120 --> 05:19.920
Now, when the exact identity of an alkyl group is not of consequence, we sometimes simply

05:19.920 --> 05:24.880
use the abbreviation R to indicate a generic alkyl group is present.

05:24.880 --> 05:31.240
So, the molecule commonly called propylchloride would be considered a primary alkylhalide

05:31.440 --> 05:33.400
because of its single R group.

05:33.400 --> 05:39.080
Next is isopropylchloride, which has two R groups attached to the carbon bearing the

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
chlorine.

05:40.080 --> 05:44.360
So, this would be an example of a secondary alkylhalide.

05:44.360 --> 05:49.480
And finally, here's a structure of the simplest tertiary alkylhalide, t-butylchloride.

05:49.480 --> 05:56.000
Now, from an IUPAC naming perspective, halogens are treated exactly as any alkyl substituent

05:56.000 --> 06:04.000
would be, using the prefixes fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo to define them.

06:04.000 --> 06:13.000
So, using the IUPAC naming convention, propylchloride becomes one chloropropane.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.520
Isopropylchloride becomes two chloropropane.

06:18.520 --> 06:25.680
Antibutylchloride will be two chloro, two methylpropane.

06:25.680 --> 06:30.360
Now halogens are much larger and more electronegative than hydrogen, and their presence on the molecule

06:30.360 --> 06:33.400
has two important effects.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.040
The first is related to the size of the halogen atoms.

06:37.040 --> 06:42.560
The size of the halogen atoms has a profound effect on the boiling point of whichever methylhalide

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
I'm dealing with.

06:43.560 --> 06:48.640
So, here I've drawn for you some structures for all of the common methylhalides that we'll

06:48.640 --> 06:50.440
encounter in this course.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.480
I've also used methane here as a reference.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.040
So, this is CH4.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.640
But we can attach a fluorine in place of one hydrogen to create methylfluoride, a chlorine

06:59.640 --> 07:02.720
to create methylchloride, etc.

07:02.720 --> 07:07.280
And when we take a look at the boiling points of these compounds, there's a very clear and

07:07.280 --> 07:08.920
obvious trend.

07:08.920 --> 07:13.720
And that is that the larger the attached halogen atom is, the higher the boiling point of the

07:13.720 --> 07:16.960
associated methylhalide will be.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.760
And the reason for this is easier to see if I change these models from this ball and stick

07:20.760 --> 07:24.040
format to what we call a space-filling model.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.760
And the space-filling model is fairly clear to see that the electron cloud around methyliodide

07:29.760 --> 07:35.160
is much larger than that around methylbromide, which is larger than chloride, etc., all the

07:35.160 --> 07:36.960
way down to methane.

07:36.960 --> 07:42.520
So, we're dealing with a situation where the polarizability increases as we add larger

07:42.520 --> 07:47.960
and larger halides, causing their boiling points to increase as well as a result of stronger

07:47.960 --> 07:49.480
dispersion forces.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.520
Now let's take a look at another property of these alkylhalides, and that is the polarity

07:54.520 --> 07:56.800
of the bond.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.840
Now we know that halogens are more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen, so we expect that

08:00.840 --> 08:05.840
a bond dipole will exist with some negative charge over here near the halogen and a bit

08:05.840 --> 08:10.160
of positive charge on the associated alpha carbon.

08:10.160 --> 08:16.320
But when we survey the bond dipoles of these common methylhalides, what we notice is that

08:16.320 --> 08:21.520
fluorine actually has a slightly less polar bond with carbon than does chlorine.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.640
Now, what's the reason for this?

08:23.640 --> 08:24.640
Right?

08:24.640 --> 08:27.960
Didn't I just tell you not too long ago that fluorine is the most electronegative element

08:27.960 --> 08:28.960
of all?

08:28.960 --> 08:35.600
Well, the reason that the bond polarities are so similar among these alkylhalides is because

08:35.600 --> 08:39.840
bond dipoles are also a function of the distance between the two atoms.

08:39.840 --> 08:44.080
So I've got to consider the length of these bonds, which is easier to see in the ball-and-stick

08:44.080 --> 08:45.080
model.

08:45.600 --> 08:50.880
So even though fluorine is my most electronegative element of the bunch, it actually has the

08:50.880 --> 08:53.840
shortest bond of any of the methylhalides.

08:53.840 --> 08:58.000
And the consequence of these bond lengths is that they counteract that electronegativity

08:58.000 --> 09:03.480
difference just a bit, and it's a fairly happy coincidence actually that most of these carbon-halogen

09:03.480 --> 09:07.900
bonds have similar bond polarity, makes them a little bit more predictable from a reactivity

09:07.900 --> 09:08.900
standpoint.

09:08.900 --> 09:13.640
Okay, so we've already seen this slide in which we've compared the boiling points of

09:13.640 --> 09:18.060
methylhalides as a function of how large the attached halogen is.

09:18.060 --> 09:22.080
But it also stands to reason that with three additional positions on the alpha carbon,

09:22.080 --> 09:27.080
that we should consider what happens when we add more than one halogen to our alkylhalide.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.640
So let's do this using chlorine as an example.

09:31.640 --> 09:35.840
Instead of just one chlorine as on methyl chloride, I can have two chlorines attached

09:35.840 --> 09:40.200
to the alpha carbon in a compound called methylene chloride.

09:40.200 --> 09:46.440
Three attached chlorines creates chloroform, and four creates a compound commonly known

09:46.440 --> 09:49.000
as carbon tetrachloride.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.960
So if I look at the effect of adding additional chlorine atoms to my molecule as a function

09:53.960 --> 09:57.240
of boiling points, it's very clear what's going on here.

09:57.240 --> 10:02.240
Methane itself has a very low boiling point of negative 161 degrees centigrade.

10:02.240 --> 10:07.760
Adding a chlorine gives me methyl chloride rather with a boiling point of negative 24.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.600
I get to methylene chloride with a boiling point of 40, and adding additional chlorines

10:11.600 --> 10:18.480
continues to cause an increase in the boiling point to 61 and 77 degrees centigrade respectively,

10:18.480 --> 10:23.520
all because of that extra electron cloud that's brought to each of these compounds by adding

10:23.520 --> 10:27.040
additional chlorine atoms.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.960
Now carbon tetrachloride is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure, and it was a popular

10:31.960 --> 10:36.760
garment dry cleaning solvent in the late 1900s, but it's fallen out of favor recently

10:36.760 --> 10:40.200
due to environmental and health concerns.

10:40.200 --> 10:45.880
Perhaps ironically, its popular replacement, perchloroethylene, certainly does look very

10:45.880 --> 10:47.400
similar, doesn't it?

10:47.400 --> 10:52.320
Indeed, perchloroethylene is used in dry cleaning now, but it's currently under scrutiny for

10:52.320 --> 10:57.080
its potential health and environmental impacts.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.680
The first occurrence of alkyl halides in refrigeration was methyl chloride.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.960
It was put into use near the beginning of the 20th century.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.760
But methyl chloride's toxicity and flammability meant that a leaking refrigerator compressor

11:09.760 --> 11:12.480
could easily spell disaster.

11:12.480 --> 11:17.720
So methyl chloride shares many of the dangers that Perkins' original ether coolant did.

11:17.720 --> 11:23.720
It would appear that alkyl halides just weren't destined for this application.

11:23.720 --> 11:28.760
But near the end of the 1920s, a researcher by the name of Thomas Midgley Jr., working

11:28.760 --> 11:34.440
for the Frigidaire Division of General Motors, devised a new alkyl halide compound.

11:34.440 --> 11:40.960
Midgley's contribution was a method used to synthesize dichloro-difluoromethane.

11:40.960 --> 11:46.280
And in doing so, he managed to create a compound with the useful physical properties he wanted,

11:46.280 --> 11:52.240
but which was also not flammable or appreciably toxic.

11:52.240 --> 11:57.560
Midgley and his contemporaries dubbed this class of refrigerants CFCs.

11:57.560 --> 12:02.480
Lauded as a revolution in refrigeration technology, Midgley's creation became the gold standard

12:02.480 --> 12:04.200
of refrigerants.

12:04.200 --> 12:09.280
And before long, the era of mass-scale ice shipping was over, as thousands of refrigerators

12:09.280 --> 12:15.360
worldwide were using and leaking these compounds into the atmosphere.

12:15.360 --> 12:20.480
Now, we're all probably familiar with CFCs and the potentially calamitous environmental

12:20.480 --> 12:23.480
effect they have in the upper atmosphere.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.200
This may be one of chemistry's greatest ironies.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.160
These compounds were designed to make life on the ground safer in the form of refrigerators

12:30.160 --> 12:32.840
which won't poison or incinerate us.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.280
But they ultimately began to produce a hole in the most vital protective layer of the

12:36.280 --> 12:40.640
upper atmosphere, the Earth's ozone layer.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.480
You see, Midgley's invention may have been much safer near the surface of the Earth,

12:44.480 --> 12:48.880
but as those dense vapors from this propellant and refrigerant slowly migrate into the upper

12:48.880 --> 12:54.560
atmosphere, they mingle with solar radiation and a naturally occurring layer of gas known

12:54.560 --> 12:57.040
as ozone.

12:57.040 --> 13:02.560
In the upper atmosphere, ozone forms and decomposes naturally in an equilibrium process,

13:02.760 --> 13:08.400
absorbing dangerous UVC light from the sun as it does so.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.520
What Midgley and his contemporaries couldn't possibly have predicted is that when freon

13:12.520 --> 13:18.000
reaches this layer of the atmosphere and is exposed to high-energy UV radiation, one

13:18.000 --> 13:22.160
of the carbon-chlorine bonds breaks.

13:22.160 --> 13:26.920
This bond cleavage takes place in a homolytic process which is reminiscent of our radical

13:26.920 --> 13:30.600
halogenation reaction like we might use to create freon.

13:31.400 --> 13:36.320
But it divides the bonding electron pair between departing chlorine atoms and the carbon atoms

13:36.320 --> 13:38.680
to which they're bonded.

13:38.680 --> 13:43.760
Now the distinction here is that carbon-chlorine bonds are stronger than chlorine-chlorine

13:43.760 --> 13:48.520
bonds, so higher-energy UV light is required.

13:48.520 --> 13:53.360
So carbon-chlorine bonds which are regarded as generally stable at the Earth's surface

13:53.360 --> 14:00.720
are anything but stable in the upper atmosphere where those high-energy photons are available.

14:00.720 --> 14:05.680
And just like the photolysis of chlorine, this bond-breaking mechanism in freon creates

14:05.680 --> 14:11.560
a very reactive radical chlorine atom with only seven valence electrons.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.080
Now we see where we get into environmental trouble with CFCs.

14:15.080 --> 14:19.000
We know from our free radical halogenation discussion just how reactive these chlorine

14:19.000 --> 14:22.640
radicals can be.

14:22.640 --> 14:27.560
But today it has a new partner to react with, ozone gas.

14:27.560 --> 14:33.480
And chlorine radicals participate in the breaking down of ozone into molecular oxygen, producing

14:33.480 --> 14:36.480
a molecule of chlorine monoxide.

14:36.480 --> 14:41.920
And this chlorine monoxide then reacts with atomic oxygen which is also naturally present

14:41.920 --> 14:44.240
in the stratosphere.

14:44.240 --> 14:49.720
This produces another molecule of oxygen and very unfortunately regenerates that chlorine

14:49.720 --> 14:52.480
atom.

14:52.480 --> 14:58.680
So the chlorine radical generated by light-activated homolytic bond cleavage in the upper atmosphere

14:58.680 --> 15:02.120
catalyzes the decomposition of protective ozone.

15:02.120 --> 15:07.160
At the end of the process, the radical catalyst is reproduced and can move on to decompose

15:07.160 --> 15:10.400
yet another molecule of ozone.

15:10.400 --> 15:16.640
And in this way, a single chlorine radical can break down about 100,000 ozone molecules

15:16.640 --> 15:21.400
before it's naturally consumed in a reaction with other atmospheric gases which are naturally

15:21.400 --> 15:24.720
present.

15:24.720 --> 15:31.240
This non-natural acceleration of ozone decomposition causes a decrease in overall ozone levels,

15:31.240 --> 15:36.000
which allows potentially unsafe radiation to pass through the upper atmosphere reaching

15:36.000 --> 15:38.240
the Earth's surface.

15:38.240 --> 15:43.960
So the bad news here is that CFCs have disturbed the natural equilibrium between ozone production

15:43.960 --> 15:47.420
and depletion in the stratosphere.

15:47.420 --> 15:54.500
The good news is that equilibrium is a dynamic process and as those CFCs are naturally consumed,

15:54.500 --> 15:58.980
the original equilibrium should re-establish itself, replenishing the ozone layer over

15:58.980 --> 16:02.100
time.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.580
Now there's little that we can do about the CFCs which have already been released into

16:05.580 --> 16:09.900
the environment, but in order to avoid the negative effect of these chlorine radicals

16:09.900 --> 16:16.220
on ozone, modern refrigerants have been designed without the use of carbon-chlorine bonds.

16:16.220 --> 16:20.900
These new refrigerants are commonly called hydrofluorocarbons.

16:20.900 --> 16:25.620
Now in a twist of fate, which we should probably expect by now, there are mounting concerns

16:25.620 --> 16:30.540
today regarding the use of hydrofluorocarbons because of their ability to act as a greenhouse

16:30.540 --> 16:36.860
gas, trapping reflected infrared light and contributing to global warming.

16:36.860 --> 16:42.980
So after carcinogenic carbon tetrachloride, flammable and toxic methyl chloride, ozone

16:42.980 --> 16:49.700
depleting CFCs and supergreen house hydrofluorocarbons, why do we keep turning to compounds like

16:49.700 --> 16:53.460
alkyl halides for these applications?

16:53.460 --> 16:58.060
The answer is, tune ability of alkyl halide volatility.

16:58.060 --> 17:03.420
Their relative stability and our ability to methodically and predictably modify the boiling

17:03.420 --> 17:08.100
points of these organic compounds has made them a very difficult option to abandon in

17:08.100 --> 17:13.100
a number of applications, not the least of which is refrigeration.

17:13.100 --> 17:19.820
Now, alkyl halides are also valued in synthetic organic chemistry for their balance of stability

17:19.820 --> 17:22.180
and reactivity.

17:22.180 --> 17:26.480
Many alkyl halides will keep in a bottle on a shelf for years, but can be converted into

17:26.480 --> 17:31.800
other useful reagents in a matter of minutes or hours in the laboratory.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.860
The key to this balance of stability and reactivity lies in the fact that carbon halogen bonds

17:36.860 --> 17:42.380
are inherently fairly strong but polarized.

17:42.380 --> 17:47.140
Average carbon fluorine and carbon chlorine bond enthalpies are actually similar to that

17:47.140 --> 17:49.220
of carbon-carbon bonds.

17:49.220 --> 17:52.340
Even carbon bromine bonds are quite strong.

17:52.340 --> 17:59.260
This means that in the absence of other reagents, most alkyl halides have a long shelf life.

17:59.260 --> 18:04.680
But unlike carbon-carbon bonds, carbon halogen bonds are polar.

18:04.680 --> 18:09.200
The more electronegative halogen pulls those bonding electrons closer to itself, creating

18:09.200 --> 18:13.320
that mild permanent charge separation across the bond.

18:13.320 --> 18:18.240
And as you can see from our table, carbon fluorine, carbon chlorine, and carbon bromine

18:18.240 --> 18:23.280
bonds are all very similar in polarity, since that less electronegative bromine has a longer

18:23.280 --> 18:27.940
bond length, for example, and iodine's monstrous size isn't really enough to make up for its

18:27.940 --> 18:33.320
lower electronegativity, making its bond just a little bit less polar than the others.

18:33.960 --> 18:38.720
Now, more often than not, we find that chlorine and bromine strike just the right mix of bond

18:38.720 --> 18:44.600
strength and polarity, so they're usually the go-to alkyl halides for the types of reactions

18:44.600 --> 18:48.720
we'll soon consider.

18:48.720 --> 18:53.140
Although so far we've examined some alkyl halides which contain many bonded halogen atoms,

18:53.140 --> 18:57.720
exploited for their physical properties, synthetic organic chemists more frequently

18:57.720 --> 19:03.280
like to use alkyl halides containing only one or just a few halogens so that subsequent

19:03.280 --> 19:06.480
chemical reactions are more site-directed.

19:06.480 --> 19:11.680
Furthermore, in the low pressure, high energy environment of the troposphere, radicals can

19:11.680 --> 19:16.520
easily form, but they're far less common in the lab.

19:16.520 --> 19:20.200
Organic chemists much more frequently rely on the tendency of halogens to accept the

19:20.200 --> 19:25.360
full bonding pair in a process known as heterolytic bond cleavage.

19:25.360 --> 19:30.280
Accepting both electrons from the bond produces a halide ion, which is more stable than a

19:30.280 --> 19:35.620
halogen radical, and a positively charged hydrocarbon species also, which we call a

19:35.620 --> 19:38.640
carbocation.

19:38.640 --> 19:45.180
The tendency of this process to happen spontaneously in an alkyl halide is a result of two factors.

19:45.180 --> 19:51.480
One is the stability of the halide ion, and the other the stability of the resulting carbocation.

19:51.480 --> 19:56.100
So the key to predicting how a particular alkyl halide will react lies in being able

19:56.100 --> 20:02.200
to understand the factors contributing to the stability of those two products.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.720
Let's start by focusing on the halide ion.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.640
Fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide.

20:07.640 --> 20:13.140
They all have a single charge and a complete octet in their outermost energy level.

20:13.140 --> 20:16.480
So they're all fairly stable from an octet rule perspective.

20:16.480 --> 20:20.160
Yet there's a steady trend of increasing stability in this set of ions as we go from

20:20.160 --> 20:23.080
smaller to larger.

20:23.100 --> 20:28.980
So what's giving the iodide ion more stability than bromide, and bromide more than chloride?

20:28.980 --> 20:34.540
The answer to the question comes in the form of a familiar topic, polarizability.

20:34.540 --> 20:37.700
You'll recall that we discussed this concept when we talked about the volatility of these

20:37.700 --> 20:41.180
compounds.

20:41.180 --> 20:45.260
Iodine with five valence shells has a large electron cloud, which gives its electrons a

20:45.260 --> 20:48.380
lot of freedom to move within that cloud.

20:48.380 --> 20:52.700
This means that at any instant in time I might find a small region of greater electron density

20:52.720 --> 20:57.680
here, and then later here, and then later yet over here.

20:57.680 --> 21:02.280
So the negative charge of an iodide ion is distributed over a very large volume of its

21:02.280 --> 21:03.920
electron cloud.

21:03.920 --> 21:10.800
And remember that as a general rule, distributing charge means more stability.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.040
Now let's take a look at bromide.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.080
Bromide has a smaller cloud, but it still carries the same negative charge compared

21:17.080 --> 21:18.720
to iodine.

21:18.740 --> 21:23.420
So the negative charge of bromide is less distributed in a smaller volume of space,

21:23.420 --> 21:25.620
making it less stable.

21:25.620 --> 21:30.460
And this trend continues to chloride and ultimately fluoride, with negative charge density becoming

21:30.460 --> 21:37.180
progressively more and more intense, resulting in less and less stable ions.

21:37.180 --> 21:43.820
So in general, t-butyl iodide, more rapidly dissociates into a halide and carbocation,

21:43.820 --> 21:49.280
and does t-butyl bromide, which does so faster than t-butyl chloride, which outpaces t-butyl

21:49.280 --> 21:53.080
fluoride.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.880
Next we have to take a look at the resulting carbocation and its substitution.

21:56.880 --> 22:02.080
You see, carbocations contain a positively charged carbon atom, with only three bonds

22:02.080 --> 22:04.040
to itself.

22:04.040 --> 22:08.800
So the charged carbon has only six valence electrons, therefore it doesn't have a complete

22:08.800 --> 22:10.800
octet.

22:10.820 --> 22:17.620
Instead it has three coplanar sp2 hybridized orbitals bonded to either hydrogens or r-groups,

22:17.620 --> 22:20.300
and a vacant p-orbital.

22:20.300 --> 22:26.660
Now we observe in the lab that just like radicals and alkenes, the carbocations of higher substitution

22:26.660 --> 22:29.980
are also more stable.

22:29.980 --> 22:35.980
In other words, tertiary carbocations, having three r-groups like this t-butyl cation, form

22:36.000 --> 22:41.040
more readily than do secondary carbocations like this isopropyl cation.

22:41.040 --> 22:48.040
Similarly, primary carbocations like ethyl cation are rarely ever seen in the laboratory.

22:48.040 --> 22:55.360
And finally, methyl cations, which have no r-groups, are the least stable of all.

22:55.360 --> 22:59.560
So what's the reason for this trend in carbocation stability?

22:59.560 --> 23:03.480
Well the answer is a very familiar topic, hyperconjugation.

23:03.480 --> 23:08.180
So to explain this, let me bring up the structure of a carbocation.

23:08.180 --> 23:13.340
Remember carbocations have the three r-groups or hydrogens attached to them at 120 degree

23:13.340 --> 23:18.500
angles within the plane, and the vacant p-orbital is oriented straight up and down.

23:18.500 --> 23:23.300
So if one of the adjacent r-groups is in fact an alkyl group, there should be a carbon with

23:23.300 --> 23:27.580
another bonding orbital adjacent to my empty p-orbital.

23:27.580 --> 23:33.340
And it's the electron density from this bond to the adjacent carbon that can hop or slightly

23:33.340 --> 23:36.200
share with that empty p-orbital.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.960
And it's this crosstalk that distributes that charge and attenuates a little bit of

23:39.960 --> 23:44.080
that positive charge right in the middle of the carbocation.

23:44.080 --> 23:51.080
So if we enhance this effect by going from one to two to ultimately three r-groups,

23:51.080 --> 23:55.760
we continually stabilize the charge as we add each group.

23:55.760 --> 24:01.200
So the rate of formation of a carbocation by an alkyl halide has two important influencing

24:01.200 --> 24:02.200
factors.

24:02.940 --> 24:08.500
First it gets faster as the halogen gets larger, and second it gets faster as the carbocation

24:08.500 --> 24:11.460
gets more substituted.

24:11.460 --> 24:15.940
Now it should be emphasized here that this is a general rule and that there will be exceptions,

24:15.940 --> 24:20.380
particularly when we start to consider the effect that solvents can have on reactions.

24:20.380 --> 24:25.780
But for now this is a good general rule to get us started.

24:25.780 --> 24:30.340
Now carbocations and species like them make regular appearances in many common reaction

24:30.340 --> 24:31.620
mechanisms.

24:31.620 --> 24:35.280
So it's worth shining the spotlight on them for a bit longer and showing you at least

24:35.280 --> 24:38.480
one very unusual property of these species.

24:38.480 --> 24:43.880
Their ability to rearrange one or more of their bonds to increase their stability.

24:43.880 --> 24:48.480
Now we just finished discussing what a profound effect the substitution of a carbocation

24:48.480 --> 24:54.480
can have on its stability, with tertiary cations being more stable than secondary and so on.

24:54.480 --> 24:59.440
Now we're already gaining an understanding of molecules natural tendency to take on lower

24:59.460 --> 25:06.460
energy forms through chemical processes, and carbocations are no exception to this rule.

25:07.220 --> 25:14.220
Carbocations sometimes can alter their own structure through a process known as rearrangement.

25:14.420 --> 25:19.700
These rearrangements can take place in two ways, secondary meaning that they take place

25:19.700 --> 25:25.540
after the formation of the carbocation, or concerted meaning that it takes place at the

25:25.540 --> 25:28.140
same time that the carbocation forms.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.960
They can take place by those two mechanisms, and they can also take place in two different

25:32.960 --> 25:38.080
ways, one known as hydride shifts, and one known as alkyl shifts.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.400
So let's take a look at some of those now.

25:40.400 --> 25:44.680
The first type of shifts I'd like to show you is a secondary hydride shift.

25:44.680 --> 25:49.520
So this will take place after the formation of a carbocation, and will involve, as you

25:49.520 --> 25:53.120
can probably figure out, the movement of a hydrogen.

25:53.120 --> 25:57.720
So I've drawn for you here a secondary carbocation, secondary because the carbon which holds

25:57.800 --> 26:02.540
the charge is bonded to two R-groups, one I've actually designated as an R-group, and

26:02.540 --> 26:07.460
the other I've expanded a bit so that you can see what's about to happen.

26:07.460 --> 26:10.380
Now let's make a duplicate of this molecule here.

26:10.380 --> 26:15.500
So I have a secondary carbocation, which is adjacent to a tertiary carbon, right?

26:15.500 --> 26:20.140
One, two, and then three R-groups attached to the adjacent carbon.

26:20.140 --> 26:25.380
So knowing that this is a tertiary carbon and this is a secondary carbon, this carbocation

26:25.400 --> 26:30.720
would much rather have its charge on the adjacent carbon, and it's able to get it there using

26:30.720 --> 26:33.360
something called a hydride shift.

26:33.360 --> 26:40.120
Now in a hydride shift, this attached hydrogen and its bonding electrons will both migrate

26:40.120 --> 26:45.160
to the adjacent carbon, and in doing so, it will relocate the positive charge to the

26:45.160 --> 26:46.800
more substituted carbon.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.640
So let's watch that happen.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.040
The consequence of my hydride shift should be obvious.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.900
I've made a tertiary carbocation.

26:55.900 --> 27:01.580
So when we draw reactions as line angle structures, we might see a carbocation like this, but

27:01.580 --> 27:05.620
when we continue to analyze the reaction, discover that the product seems to have formed

27:05.620 --> 27:08.460
from a carbocation that looks like this.

27:08.460 --> 27:12.540
And the reason for that is that a hydride shift has occurred to change my secondary

27:12.540 --> 27:16.780
carbocation into a tertiary carbocation.

27:16.780 --> 27:21.620
Another very commonly encountered carbocation rearrangement is known as a secondary alkyl

27:21.620 --> 27:22.740
shift.

27:22.840 --> 27:27.680
This has a tendency to occur in a secondary carbocation which has an adjacent quaternary

27:27.680 --> 27:28.680
carbon.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.960
You see now my adjacent carbon doesn't have a hydrogen at all, but rather has only r-groups

27:32.960 --> 27:34.760
attached.

27:34.760 --> 27:40.240
So this secondary carbocation, which would like to be tertiary, can't achieve that by

27:40.240 --> 27:44.200
a hydride shift because there's just no hydrogen to shift.

27:44.200 --> 27:49.320
And when this is the case, there's one other mechanism which can take place, and that is

27:49.340 --> 27:54.860
that the entire alkyl group can shift, including its bonding electrons to the associated quaternary

27:54.860 --> 27:56.460
carbon.

27:56.460 --> 28:01.780
And when this process takes place, not only do I alter the location of the positive charge,

28:01.780 --> 28:06.780
but I've actually retooled the entire carbon framework of this molecule.

28:06.780 --> 28:11.460
Well, in this case a carbocation, but the resulting molecule.

28:11.460 --> 28:15.860
So what this will look like in a line angle formula is if I have a carbocation which appears

28:15.880 --> 28:22.400
to have a secondary carbocation adjacent to a quaternary carbon, I'll actually, usually,

28:22.400 --> 28:27.040
see a product that looks as though it formed from this tertiary carbocation, and it's

28:27.040 --> 28:30.440
the consequence of this alkyl shift.

28:30.440 --> 28:35.080
The third type of secondary rearrangement that I'd like to talk about is called a ring

28:35.080 --> 28:36.720
expansion.

28:36.720 --> 28:40.400
And in a ring expansion, it's very similar to an alkyl shift.

28:40.400 --> 28:45.440
The difference being that my carbocation is now adjacent to a strained ring in the form

28:45.460 --> 28:47.620
of a cyclobutane.

28:47.620 --> 28:52.940
And we know that cyclobutane contains a great deal of ring strain, or buyer strain.

28:52.940 --> 28:56.980
And that it would rather be a five-membered ring than a four-membered ring.

28:56.980 --> 29:02.180
And the presence of an adjacent carbocation gives it just that opportunity.

29:02.180 --> 29:07.540
All we have to do is complete an alkyl shift, which sort of drags the rest of the ring along

29:07.540 --> 29:08.620
with it.

29:08.620 --> 29:13.740
And when that occurs, not only do I relocate the positive charge, but I also expand the

29:13.740 --> 29:15.720
ring.

29:15.720 --> 29:21.280
So I've turned my cyclobutane ring into a cyclopentane ring.

29:21.280 --> 29:25.940
So again, when I'm working out a reaction and I see a carbocation which looks like this,

29:25.940 --> 29:30.400
I should be thinking about products which might form from a carbocation which instead

29:30.400 --> 29:32.480
looks like this.

29:32.480 --> 29:38.520
Now, both hydride and alkyl shifts are not limited to secondary carbocations.

29:38.520 --> 29:42.080
There's another class of these rearrangements, which we call concerted rearrangements, or

29:42.080 --> 29:43.860
primary alkyl shifts.

29:43.860 --> 29:47.980
And these take place in the example of isobutyl chloride.

29:47.980 --> 29:51.780
If I were to suggest that the chloride ion can be formed from this molecule producing

29:51.780 --> 29:57.860
a carbocation, you should be suspicious, because simply breaking the carbon-chlorine bond produces

29:57.860 --> 30:00.060
a primary carbocation.

30:00.060 --> 30:03.740
And we know that primary carbocation is almost never formed, because they're just not stable

30:03.740 --> 30:06.100
enough.

30:06.100 --> 30:11.500
But what if the adjacent hydrogen could shift not after the carbon-chlorine bond had broken,

30:11.500 --> 30:13.440
but in concert with it?

30:13.440 --> 30:19.200
We could bypass the primary carbocation completely, forming a tertiary carbocation through that

30:19.200 --> 30:21.880
concerted rearrangement.

30:21.880 --> 30:25.240
Of course, we can make the natural extension of this and suggest that a concerted alkyl

30:25.240 --> 30:32.000
shift is possible, and molecules like 2, 2-dimethyl-1-chlorobutane as well.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.240
All of these carbocation rearrangements can be either a supreme annoyance against which

30:36.240 --> 30:43.980
we have to guard, or a clever trick used to devise ingenious pathways to desired products.

30:43.980 --> 30:47.900
In either case, when they're possible, they have to be accounted for during synthetic

30:47.900 --> 30:50.060
design.

30:50.060 --> 30:53.900
Whether these processes are friend or foe, we'll see very soon that they can have a profound

30:53.900 --> 30:58.460
impact on the outcome of a synthesis.

30:58.460 --> 31:01.060
So let's review what we've discussed today.

31:01.060 --> 31:04.820
We've defined alkyl halides, which can be thought of as hydrocarbons in which one or

31:04.840 --> 31:10.760
more hydrogen atoms are replaced by a halogen substituent.

31:10.760 --> 31:15.000
We examine both common and IUPAC systems for naming these compounds, and how halogens are

31:15.000 --> 31:20.360
treated just like any other alkyl substituents in systematic nomenclature.

31:20.360 --> 31:24.800
We talked about how the presence of larger, more polarizable halogen atoms decreases the

31:24.800 --> 31:29.960
volatility of alkyl halides, allowing chemists like Midgeley to tune the physical properties

31:29.960 --> 31:34.720
of refrigerants and advance the science of refrigeration, ultimately all but ending the

31:34.720 --> 31:38.740
global ice shipping industry.

31:38.740 --> 31:43.060
Finally we discussed a bit about the reactivity of alkyl halides, and we investigated how the

31:43.060 --> 31:47.980
homolytic cleavage of carbon chlorine bonds adds a catalyst to the upper atmosphere of

31:47.980 --> 31:52.980
the Earth, accelerating ozone depletion and threatening the environment.

31:52.980 --> 31:57.500
And we also took a look at how carbon halogen bonds behave in solution in the lab, rather

31:57.500 --> 31:59.660
than in the upper atmosphere.

31:59.660 --> 32:04.620
How these alkyl halides are set up to undergo a heterolytic bond cleavage to produce halide

32:04.620 --> 32:09.840
ions, and carbocation of varying stabilities depending on the size of the halide ion and

32:09.840 --> 32:15.080
the substitution of the carbocation.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.720
Finally we tackled the phenomenon of carbocation rearrangements.

32:18.720 --> 32:23.520
We saw how these commonly formed reaction intermediates are most stable when their charged carbon

32:23.520 --> 32:25.440
is more substituted.

32:25.440 --> 32:29.800
And we even saw how they can alter their structures through hydride and alkyl shifts

32:29.800 --> 32:35.100
and ring expansions in search of more stable states.

32:35.100 --> 32:39.940
So now that we have a basic understanding of why and how alkyl halides can react, we're

32:39.940 --> 32:44.140
ready to take it to the next level and start considering exactly what we can make from

32:44.140 --> 32:48.540
this versatile class of starting materials by combining them with other reagents.

32:48.540 --> 32:53.180
In the next few lectures we'll see how the breaking of a carbon halogen bond can be a

32:53.180 --> 32:57.980
part of many different chemical reaction mechanisms, all of which can be used to produce a host

32:57.980 --> 32:59.360
of useful compounds.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.640
It's finally time to start designing a synthesis.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.400
I'll see you next time.
