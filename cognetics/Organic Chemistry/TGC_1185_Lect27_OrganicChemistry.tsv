0	20340	In 1666, a young Isaac Newton first documented the separation of white light into its constituent
20340	23400	visible colors using a prism.
23400	28320	And in his notes on this now famous experiment, he described the rainbow of colors he saw
28320	32920	as a spectrum from the Latin word meaning apparition.
32920	40040	But what we didn't know at that time was that what he saw was only part of the story.
40040	46000	It was another hundred years, more than that, in 1801 when a young self-taught scientist
46000	51840	by the name of Wilhelm Ritter acted on a hunch that maybe there was more to the spectrum
51840	57040	than what Newton had seen with his own eyes more than a hundred years earlier.
57040	61560	The problem is that Wilhelm is a human and his eyes couldn't see any further along the
61560	64400	spectrum than Newton's could.
64400	72360	So Ritter needed a different kind of eye and he had just the tool for the job, silver chloride.
72360	77200	Now silver chloride is an inorganic compound which is most famous for its use in photographic
77200	79360	films.
79360	83480	Solutions of silver chloride undergo a chemical reaction in the presence of visible light
83600	89000	which causes them to dissociate into a suspension of silver metal and chlorine gas.
89000	95640	In other words, the solution turns dark when exposed to light.
95640	100160	It was known even before Ritter that this reaction did not proceed at the same speed
100160	102440	in different colors of light.
102440	107440	He could disperse light with a prism, then place vials of silver chloride solution in
107440	112800	different parts of the resulting spectrum, and clearly see that the reaction was fastest
112800	122040	in blue, slower in green, and slower still in the red portions of the spectrum.
122040	127440	Ritter's real contribution was that he decided to place a vial of silver chloride solution
127440	131360	outside of the blue colored light from the prism.
131360	133020	His hunch paid off.
133020	137820	The solution outside of the blue end of the spectrum reacted even faster than any of the
137820	140720	samples in the visible area.
140720	145880	This experiment is remarkable because it clearly demonstrated the existence of light
145880	151040	with a frequency even higher than the violet light at the edge of the visible spectrum,
151040	156440	one which was not detectable to the human eye but had even more energy than visible light.
156440	160080	Ritter had discovered ultraviolet light.
160080	165360	If you're watching these lectures in order, I'd like to congratulate you on completing
165360	169000	the structures and reactions segment of the course.
169000	173400	You now have the basic knowledge and skills needed to understand and predict the reactivity
173400	177160	of organic compounds on paper.
177160	180800	But you must have asked yourself more than once during these lectures.
180800	185160	How do we know how these molecules are reacting and behaving?
185160	190640	How can these structures and the changes we make to them be confirmed experimentally?
190640	196600	After all, organic chemistry is about science, and science is about what we can prove.
196600	198400	So where's the proof?
198400	204760	Well, today we begin answering these very fair and very crucial questions by discussing
204760	209640	the techniques which organic chemists and many others use to identify the products of
209640	211800	their work.
211800	215760	Today we begin to explore the science of spectroscopy.
215760	223280	Now most simply put, spectroscopy is the observation of the interaction of light with matter.
224280	228840	Now before we can dive into spectroscopic techniques, we need to take a step back and
228840	233520	characterize what we generally refer to as light.
233520	239560	Light is in fact electromagnetic radiation, a form of self-propagating energy composed
239560	243680	of perpendicularly oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
243680	250920	It exhibits both wave and particle-like properties, and it carries energy and momentum.
250920	255560	Now it's the wave properties of light and the energy it carries, which are most interesting
255560	262360	to spectroscopists, and we're going to tend to classify light based on those properties.
262360	267960	Now one of these properties associated with waves is the wavelength, or the distance from
267960	272440	one point on the wave to the next analogous point.
272440	276240	For example, the distance from the top of the peak on this end to the top of the next
276240	280600	peak here on my wave, this is defined as the wavelength.
280600	285000	Now another property of light which interests us is its velocity.
285000	290760	See light has a fixed speed at which it travels in a given medium, regardless of its wavelength.
290760	295920	Light in a vacuum always travels at 3 times 10 to the 8th meters per second.
295920	298600	Now I'm going to start my wave in motion, but I'm not going to start it at the speed
298600	299600	of light.
299600	304360	So let's just move our wave now and pretend that this is the speed of light.
304360	309360	Now the frequency of light is the number of equivalent points along that wave, which pass
309360	313520	by a given location in a specified time.
313520	321240	For example, my wave here has a frequency of about one oscillation per second.
321240	326320	Now since the maxima pass designated points in one second intervals, that's my frequency.
326320	331680	Now it sounds a little bit awkward to say this wave has a frequency of one per second,
331680	334280	so we instead use a unit called Hertz.
334280	340480	This is a unit named in honor of German physicist Heinrich Hertz, who first characterized electromagnetic
340480	344480	radiation in 1887.
344480	351480	So the constant speed of light becomes a proportionality constant for the relationship between wavelength
351480	353640	and the reciprocal of frequency.
353640	359720	For example, if I were to decrease my wavelength by a factor of two, I'd just increase the
359720	366120	frequency by a factor of two.
366120	370120	Now one last property of light, which is going to be of crucial importance to understanding
370120	372720	spectroscopy, is this.
372720	376920	Light does still have some particle character.
376920	380680	We call these particles of light photons.
380680	385400	A single photon of light contains an amount of energy, which is directly related to its
385400	390640	frequency by a factor called Planck's constant, sometimes shown in mathematical equations
390640	393200	as the letter H.
393200	400080	So a single photon of light has an associated wavelength, frequency, and energy, all of
400080	405400	which are related to one another mathematically.
405400	410120	So we classify light according to its frequency or wavelength, which are related to the amount
410120	414400	of energy carried by a single photon of that light.
414400	419200	We call this range of wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum.
419200	425920	The spectrum includes, in order of increasing frequency and therefore energy, radio waves,
425920	438240	microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma rays.
438240	443320	Radio waves can have wavelengths kilometers wide, and as we reduce the wavelength to about
443320	448280	the diameter of a baseball, we cross into the microwave region.
448280	455320	Continuing to reduce the wavelength to about the size of a human cell gets us to the infrared.
455320	459600	The visible has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers or about the size of a typical
459600	464880	virus, and the ultraviolet begins to approach the size of some of the larger molecules that
464880	468000	we've studied in the course, like proteins.
469000	474480	Finally, from about ten nanometers on down, x-rays constitute the smaller extremes of
474480	479440	wavelengths, including the very high energy gamma rays that have wavelengths smaller than
479440	482920	the diameter of a single atom.
482920	488020	So the electromagnetic spectrum spans a dramatic scale of wavelengths, and therefore a dramatic
488020	491800	range of energies per photon.
491800	496400	Because of this, each class of radiation tends to interact with molecules in its own unique
496400	503080	way, and scientists have devised a way to exploit all of them.
503080	505520	So let's try a spectroscopy experiment.
505520	507720	You ready?
507720	510480	Here I have two glasses of water and a flashlight.
510480	514760	I'm going to shine my flashlight through the water.
514760	518680	Now you can see that both glasses of water basically allow all of the visible light to
518680	520200	transmit through them.
520200	521200	Simple enough, right?
522000	527000	Now I'm going to add just a small bit of red food coloring to one of the two glasses of
527000	528000	water.
531000	536360	And I'll use my highly specialized scientific tool to stir that.
536360	539120	Be sure it's well mixed.
539120	545320	Now I'll pass my white light back through the same two glasses, the original and the
545320	547720	one with the added food coloring.
547720	548720	You notice a difference?
548720	550920	You see something different, don't you?
550920	555880	Of course, the light reaching your eyes appeared white when it went through the first glass
555880	560200	because it contained only water, which didn't absorb anything, and you were able to see
560200	564320	all the wavelengths of light which were generated by the flashlight.
564320	570240	But in the second glass, you saw the light that was passing through appeared to be red.
570240	574720	And that's because the contents of the solution were absorbing the complementary color of
574720	577280	red or green.
577280	582560	So you know that something in that dye has to have the ability to absorb light of about
582560	585600	520 nanometer wavelengths.
585600	589040	Congratulations, you are now a spectrophotometer.
589040	592560	You just observed the interaction of light with matter.
592560	596520	And measurement of the interaction of light with matter is the function of all optical
596520	600240	spectroscopy instruments.
600240	606480	Now what distinguishes optical spectrophotometers in a lab from your eyes and mine is their increased
606480	612840	sensitivity and the ability to see the electromagnetic spectrum with far greater precision over a
612840	618080	far wider range of wavelengths than the human eye ever could.
618080	623040	Instead of seeing a combination of all visible wavelengths simultaneously, spectrophotometers
623040	628840	can give us information about each wavelength individually, telling us exactly which photons
628840	635240	are absorbed by our sample and which photons are not absorbed.
635240	639920	For the next few lectures, we will take a look at some of the ways scientists coax structural
639920	645040	information from molecules using spectrophotometers to sense how they interact with different
645040	646840	forms of light.
646840	652440	And we'll begin in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum today.
652440	657680	Of course, since Ritter's Day, the science of spectroscopy has come a long way.
657680	662000	We no longer have to move a sample from one band of light to the next to observe how a
662000	664480	sample is interacting with light.
664600	671560	Instead, we rely on sophisticated instruments called spectrophotometers to get this job done.
671560	676040	Now all spectrophotometers have the same basic functional parts.
676040	680120	How each part functions can be very different depending on the design and the technique
680120	682960	needed to solve a particular problem.
682960	688240	But all spectrometers or spectrophotometers consist of several crucial parts.
688240	692880	First, there's a light source, which generates a broad spectrum of light.
692880	698160	Now this can be as simple as an ordinary incandescent light bulb or a much more advanced lamp
698160	701200	capable of producing ultraviolet.
701200	705160	The light from this source is sent to a device called a monochromator.
705160	711840	The simplest example of this would be one of Newton's prisms in between two slits.
711840	715840	The purpose of the first slit is to ensure that all the light from the source reaches
715840	720280	the monochromator in a parallel pathway.
720280	725120	Once it gets into the center of the monochromator, we will see this beam being fanned out into
725120	729360	its spectrum just as Newton did in the 1600s.
729360	734600	The final slit is there to allow only one very small region of that spectrum to pass
734600	737600	on through.
737600	743000	The next element of our spectrophotometer is a beam splitter, which is really just a fancy
743000	749080	array of mirrors which accomplishes the task of dividing our monochromatic light beam into
749080	754800	two different beams which pass through two different regions of space.
754800	759400	These different regions of space are our sample and reference compartments.
759400	764320	So the beam which passes through my reference compartment will encounter really nothing,
764320	765320	just the reference.
765320	770360	So this would be like our glass of water in the original experiment today.
770360	776720	But the other beam passes through a sample cell and that sample cell contains not just
776720	780440	say water but water with dye in it, as in our example before.
780440	784120	So the difference between these two cells is the presence of the sample that we want
784120	786120	to study.
786120	790360	Finally, the exiting light beams encounter detectors.
790360	793360	And detectors have many different designs as well.
793360	798400	But essentially what a detector does is it turns the impact of photons into some kind
798400	804040	of an electrical signal which can be sent off to a computer which monitors the experiment.
804040	809480	And it's the differences in those signals between the light exiting the reference cell
809480	817040	and the light exiting the sample cell which are interpreted as the result of our experiment.
817040	822600	So the advent of the modern spectrophotometer allows me to not only say that my sample appears
822600	828360	red and therefore is absorbing green light, I can go much farther and determine exactly
828360	833920	how much of every wavelength in the visible spectrum is being absorbed to create the color
833920	837280	that I see.
837280	840400	But there's even more information available from this kind of experiment.
840400	844900	See, one of the very first of these devices was built by a German physicist by the name
844900	846400	of August Bier.
846400	852680	Now Bier is most well known for his law of absorbance which he proposed in 1852.
852680	856840	His law is concerned not with the maximum wavelength of absorption but with just how
856840	861540	strongly a given compound or sample absorbs.
861540	865980	What Bier observed is that incrementally increasing the concentration of a chromophore
865980	872740	or light absorbing molecule cut the transmittance of a sample by one half each time he increased
872740	873740	it.
873740	879660	Now similarly, for a given concentration of a sample the transmittance was cut in half
879660	884780	when the length of the cell was increased incrementally.
884780	889180	This relationship produces an exponential relationship like the one I'm showing you
889180	891060	here.
891060	895800	But scientists prefer to work with linear relationships whenever possible because they're much easier
895800	897620	to predict.
897620	904220	So Bier converted transmittance into a new unit called absorbance.
904220	909980	The absorbance is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of a sample's transmittance.
909980	915460	And when this is done the resulting plot is a very simple and useful relationship in which
915460	921020	incremental concentration or path length increase leads to incremental absorbance values
921020	924620	as well.
924620	929300	So Bier's equation relates absorption to three important factors.
929300	934100	A property of a given molecule called its molar absorptivity, which is essentially a
934100	939900	measure of how well it absorbs at a given wavelength, the concentration of the sample,
939900	943740	and the path length of the cell used in the experiment.
943740	949380	So if you know two of these three parameters for a given sample, measuring the absorbance
949380	953740	would allow you to calculate the third variable using Bier's law.
953740	958940	So this gives us a simple way to determine the concentration of solutions of known compounds
958940	966660	or to help identify compounds in solutions of known concentrations.
966660	971100	Now we saw in our discussion of conjugated alkenes how the frontier molecular orbital
971100	978300	energy of conjugated compounds decreases as additional p-atomic orbitals join the system.
978300	982300	So let's begin by restating a crucial proviso here.
982300	987980	That a single photon of light carries a specific packet of energy with it and that this energy
987980	992620	can be calculated from its wavelength and from Planck's constant using a relationship
992620	1000580	of energy is equal to Planck's constant times the speed of light divided by the wavelength
1000580	1004540	of that particular photon.
1004540	1009300	So for example, using this equation I can determine that a photon with a 520 nanometer
1009300	1016860	wavelength carries with it exactly 3.82 times 10 to the minus 19th joules of energy.
1016860	1019940	No more, no less.
1019940	1024940	We sometimes convert these energies from joules per photon into kilojoules per molar photons
1024940	1027860	to make the numbers a little more manageable.
1027860	1035300	So in our example, 3.82 times 10 to the negative 19th joules per photon becomes 230 kilojoules
1035300	1038620	per mole of photons.
1038620	1044140	Second, let's set the rule that this photon will only be absorbed by a molecule when it
1044140	1047820	can promote an electron to a higher energy state.
1047820	1053620	In other words, when the orbital energy gap between occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals
1053620	1059780	are exactly equal to the energy packet of the photon.
1059780	1064380	Now let's take a look at a few molecules with distinctive UV spectra, compounds with
1064380	1069660	which we're pretty familiar by now, the conjugated alkenes.
1069660	1074860	Simple conjugated alkenes have pi systems which overlap very well with one another,
1074860	1079460	creating a virtual superhighway for electrons to move from one orbital to the next.
1080260	1085660	And when electrons move from the highest occupied pi molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied
1085660	1092140	pi molecular orbital, we call the transition a pi to pi star transition.
1092140	1096900	Now because of the fantastic geometric overlap of the associated orbitals, this absorption
1096900	1101740	occurs nearly every time an electron of sufficient energy strikes that molecule.
1101740	1110100	In other words, the extinction coefficient for the absorption can be very, very large.
1110100	1114820	Now recall from our lecture on conjugated alkenes that I can construct an energy diagram
1114820	1118100	for the molecular orbitals of a conjugated system.
1118100	1124620	And that when we did this for 1,3-butadiene and 1,35-hexatriene, we discovered that the
1124620	1131060	frontier molecular orbitals are closer in energy in the more conjugated compound.
1131060	1135620	Now if we were to carefully calculate the energies of the frontier molecular orbital
1135620	1141380	gaps, we would see the following trend for the first three alkenes in the series.
1141380	1149020	686 kilojoules for ethene, 540 kilojoules for 1,3-butadiene, and 452 kilojoules for
1149020	1153420	1,35-hexatriene.
1153420	1158220	Assuming that our earlier rules hold, this means that promoting one electron from the
1158220	1164820	homo of each compound to the lumo should require a photon with the exact same energy.
1164820	1174140	So ethene should require a photon of 686 kilojoules per mole or one with a wavelength of 171 nanometers.
1174140	1181820	1,3-butadiene requires a photon of 217 nanometers and 1,35-hexatriene requires a photon of 258
1181820	1185580	nanometers.
1185580	1189940	So there is a distinct correlation between the wavelength of maximum absorption and the
1189940	1193380	extent of conjugation in organic compounds.
1193380	1197980	And this trend continues into the visible spectrum as well, where compounds like beta-carotene
1197980	1206300	with its 11 conjugated double bonds has a maximum absorption at 454 nanometers.
1206300	1210780	So let's take a look at another example in the form of a compound so well understood
1210780	1214820	that it's frequently used as a reference standard for experiments like these.
1214820	1218140	I'm talking about our old friend benzene.
1218140	1224580	Now benzene has a maximum absorption at 255 nanometers, lower than 1,35-hexatriene because
1224580	1229460	promoting electrons causes benzene to lose some of its aromaticity.
1229460	1235620	But let's take a look at the maximum absorption of benzene's cousins, naphthalene and anthracene.
1235620	1241860	Now see when we do, we notice that the overall trend of increasing lambda max or maximum wavelength
1241860	1250260	of absorption with increasing pi system size holds for our aromatics as well.
1250260	1254220	Of course, no discussion of the ultraviolet region of the spectrum is ever complete without
1254220	1260660	the mention of the single most well-known source of electromagnetic radiation, the sun.
1260660	1265540	In addition to the intense visible light emitted by the sun, it also constantly bathes the
1265540	1272980	planet in strong ultraviolet radiation which is capable of causing damage to cellular DNA.
1272980	1277580	The overall ultraviolet region of the spectrum is defined as the region between 100 and 400
1277580	1280140	nanometers in wavelength.
1280140	1285620	But spectroscopists and other scientists break the UV spectrum down into three general regions
1285620	1290820	which are commonly called UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.
1290820	1293340	So let's look at those one by one.
1294020	1299540	UV-C radiation spans 100 nanometers to 280 nanometers in wavelength.
1299540	1304780	UV-C is that portion of the UV spectrum which isn't normally found at the surface of the
1304780	1310380	Earth because it's naturally absorbed by the gases in the Earth's atmosphere.
1310380	1315860	This high energy, potentially damaging radiation, is absorbed by two naturally occurring atmospheric
1315860	1322980	gases in particular, oxygen which absorbs between 100 and 200 nanometers and ozone which
1323020	1327860	absorbs between about 200 and 280 nanometers.
1327860	1332900	So these two gases work in concert to protect us from all of the most dangerous UV light
1332900	1335180	reaching the planet.
1335180	1342420	UV-B radiation spans 280 to 315 nanometer wavelengths.
1342420	1347700	Now, it's that portion of the UV spectrum which reaches the surface and causes reddening
1347700	1352180	of the skin which we commonly refer to as sunburn.
1352180	1355900	Because of this, it was long thought that UV-B rays were the only dangerous form of
1355900	1360500	UV radiation reaching the planet's surface, leading companies to produce sunblock formulations
1360500	1367900	containing compounds like para-amino-benzoic acid or PHABA, which absorbs very well right
1367900	1370820	up to the edge of the UV-B.
1373820	1379820	UV-A radiation spans the 315 to 400 nanometer region of the spectrum.
1379860	1384580	And for a long time, it was thought that this lower energy UV light wasn't harmful to humans
1384580	1389140	because it didn't cause sunburn the way that UV-B does.
1389140	1393540	In the later decades of the 1900s, though, medical researchers began to recognize that
1393540	1398540	UV-A light can in fact cause cellular damage even though it doesn't cause a reddening
1398540	1401660	of the skin.
1401660	1407780	So modern sunblock formulations have abandoned PHABA in favor of compounds like octocrylene
1407780	1412780	and avalbenzone, shown here as its enol-tautomer.
1412780	1417220	So when we take a look at the UV spectrum as a whole and all those materials which we
1417220	1422380	use to protect ourselves from it, both man-made and naturally occurring, we should start to
1422380	1426060	notice a distinct trend.
1426060	1431420	Increasing the size of the conjugated pi system in the compound correlates directly with their
1431420	1434860	wavelength of maximum absorption.
1434860	1442780	From oxygen to ozone to PHABA, octocrylene and avalbenzone, each larger and more conjugated
1442780	1445020	than the next.
1445020	1449660	So using this predictive tool of extended conjugation, these products have been carefully
1449660	1455780	engineered to have very large extinction coefficients at very specific wavelengths to fill in the
1455780	1459780	gaps that Mother Nature left behind.
1459780	1464580	Some aromatic and conjugated compounds are also titratable, meaning that they can accept
1464580	1468660	and release protons, which can change their absorptive properties.
1468660	1471000	So let's belly up to the bar here.
1471000	1476500	Take for example, the anthocyanins in this red wine, well, blush wine.
1476500	1482100	Now anthocyanins are polyphenols, and that means that not only are they highly conjugated,
1482100	1485860	which gives them beautiful colors, but they also have hydroxyl groups on them which can
1485860	1488860	be protonated and deprotonated.
1488860	1492700	Now if you're an enophile, you might want to look away for this demonstration, because
1492700	1496700	I'm going to take this wine, which is currently at a pH of about five, and I'm going to bring
1496700	1501580	it up, and we're going to watch the effect it has on the color.
1501580	1507500	Now to do this, I'm going to use a solution of sodium hydroxide, which is caustic, so
1507500	1515820	I'm going to find a glove that isn't destroyed, and I'm going to cover up my hands just for
1515820	1518060	safety's sake.
1518060	1521420	Of course what I'm about to do is also going to render the wine undrinkable.
1521420	1525620	So I'm probably going to make a few enemies, or at least not make any new friends by doing
1525620	1527780	this today.
1527780	1528980	So here we have the original wine.
1528980	1531100	You can see it's clearly red in color.
1531100	1539380	This is because of a compound called malvadenglucoside, and I have here a small Erlenmeyer flask
1539380	1545300	with an aqueous solution, that's water-based, of sodium hydroxide.
1545300	1548220	Now as a control, just to prove to you that there's nothing magical about what I'll be
1548220	1552260	adding to these wines, I'm going to put a few drops of my solution into a glass full
1552260	1559260	of water, and of course we see no color change or reaction of any kind taking place.
1559260	1566020	So clearly if we see any changes in these wines as a result of adding my hydroxide to
1566020	1571700	it, it has to be coming from something already in the wine.
1571700	1577940	I'll leave my second glass unaltered as our control, so we have a reference.
1577940	1584020	Now I'm going to add a little bit of my aqueous sodium hydroxide to my first victim today.
1608860	1614620	Did you see a change?
1614620	1615940	I know I certainly do.
1615940	1621100	Now the change that's taking place here is a result of deprotonating some of those phenolic
1621100	1626560	compounds, most notably the malvadenglucoside in the red wine.
1626560	1631220	But I can go even farther than that, and add a very large amount of my sodium hydroxide
1631220	1638220	to my third glass.
1654060	1661060	Let's give it a little bit more just for good measure.
1662220	1668500	I'll cap my sodium hydroxide solution and give my wines one last swirl to be sure that
1668500	1672420	they're thoroughly mixed.
1672420	1678420	Now what should be very apparent here is that something has changed.
1678420	1685420	Clearly changing the pH conditions of the wine has altered the structure of these compounds.
1686420	1688500	Quite an impressive color change, isn't it?
1688500	1691340	So let's recap what just happened here.
1691340	1696900	The compounds which impart the color to the wine like malvadenglucoside have become deprotonated,
1696900	1702780	and removal of one or more hydroxyl protons allows the newly deprotonated oxygen atoms
1702780	1708060	to partake in resonance with the rest of the aromatic system, thereby extending the conjugation
1708060	1712980	and changing the frontier molecular orbital energies of the color-giving organic species
1712980	1714860	in the wine.
1714860	1718820	I've actually prepared some more samples here of the same wine that had been altered
1718820	1723140	with sodium hydroxide as well in varying proportions, and you can see that there's
1723140	1728540	actually a broad range of colors that can be achieved in this way.
1728540	1733900	Now as the conjugated pi systems here grew in energy, the pigments absorbed first in
1733900	1740900	the green, then in the orange, which resulted in a blue color, and finally in the red portion
1740900	1746700	of the spectrum, which your eyes detect as green.
1746700	1752260	And that is the chemistry of destroying a perfectly good rosé.
1752260	1757580	So today we started on our journey through the task of probing molecular structures.
1757580	1762420	We talked a little bit about light and the electromagnetic spectrum which comprises it.
1762420	1768100	We explored the relationships among wavelength, frequency, and energy in any given photon.
1768100	1773200	And we noted that a single photon carries a packet of energy which can only be absorbed
1773200	1777660	in a transition of equal energy.
1777660	1782940	We talked about UV light in particular, how Wilhelm Ritter discovered this type of electromagnetic
1782940	1790180	radiation using decomposition of silver chloride solutions with light separated by a prism.
1790180	1795100	We examined the general structure of a UV visible spectrophotometer from light source
1795100	1801260	to monochromator to beam splitter, sample and reference compartments, and finally detectors,
1801260	1807220	and how these units all work in concert to produce a UV visible spectrum.
1807220	1813180	Next, we discussed how extending conjugation in a compound leads to lower energy homo-lumo
1813180	1818300	transitions within the pi system of molecules lengthening the wavelengths of the associated
1818300	1822900	molecules' maximum absorption.
1822900	1826780	We saw how this concept can be used to explain how the Earth's atmosphere protects us from
1826780	1832700	UVC radiation, but we need to devise our own methods to protect ourselves from UVB and
1832700	1835980	UVA radiation.
1835980	1841340	And finally, you witnessed me doing the unthinkable and rendering a perfectly good wine undrinkable
1841340	1843820	by altering its pH.
1843820	1848620	In doing so, however, I demonstrated that the protonation state of many organic compounds
1848740	1854780	can profoundly affect their absorption characteristics as well.
1854780	1858260	Next time, we're going to turn our attention to the other side of the visible spectrum
1858260	1863460	and explore its other neighbor, infrared light, and how it interacts with molecules by a completely
1863460	1867660	different mechanism, yielding completely different information about structures.
1867660	1872700	And I promise, I won't destroy one single beverage during the entire lecture.
1872700	1873780	I'll see you then.
