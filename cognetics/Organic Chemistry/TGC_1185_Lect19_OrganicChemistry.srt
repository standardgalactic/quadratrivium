1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Steroid hormones are remarkably powerful organic molecules.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,460
They can go far beyond simply determining the gender of a developing fetus.

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,280
Just consider the market for the two most commonly known of these compounds, estrogen

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,520
and testosterone.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,440
Both are produced and marketed as pharmaceutical products to fight medical conditions associated

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,040
with aging.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,280
testosterone's ability to promote a process known as anabolism or the building up of complex

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,960
organs and tissues in the body has made it a useful substance in both the legitimate medical

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,320
treatment of wasting diseases and also as a performance enhancing drug of abuse in athletics.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Estrogen and its derivatives are used as contraceptive medications and they also sometimes are

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,240
prescribed to postmenopausal women to help fight osteoporosis.

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,440
But it might surprise you to find out that both of these hormones with their drastically

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,920
differing metabolic effects are made up from the same starting materials in the body.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,800
The common starting material in biological synthesis of these compounds is cholesterol

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,520
and in the early part of the 1900s a race was brewing to find a way to make this central

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,000
compound in vitro.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,200
But one of the major challenges was finding ways to make new carbon-carbon bonds from

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,080
smaller molecules.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,160
Now, during this period in time, dividing a new method to make this critical connection,

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,000
it was practically a guaranteed Nobel Prize.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,040
In 1928, Otto Deals, a former student of the legendary Hermann M. L. Fisher and his own

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,880
protégé, Kurt Alder, published an article outlining a strategy then only called the

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,320
Dying Synthesis.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,200
By the late 1940s, it was clear to all that this synthetic strategy was one of the keys

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,120
which would ultimately unlock the total synthesis of cholesterol.

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,200
In those days, a sort of holy grail of steroid chemistry.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,360
In 1950, with the research groups of chemists Robert Robinson at Oxford and Robert Burns

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,520
Woodward at Harvard independently closing in on this goal, Deals and Alder received

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,120
their Nobel Prize for the Dying Synthesis.

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,740
In honor of the tremendous impact their development has had on organic chemistry, we now call

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,880
this reaction the Deals-Alder Reaction.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,600
Hopefully by the end of the day, you will see exactly how they did it and why they

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,800
so richly deserve this honor.

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,880
But before we can begin to fully understand the Deals-Alder reaction, we need to take

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,440
a step back and analyze a little bit simpler compound than these large hormone compounds.

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,360
We need to take a look at compounds called conjugated diene.

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,840
The very simplest conjugated compound possible in organic chemistry is this hydrocarbon called

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
1-3-butadiene.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,840
You may notice that the two double bonds of the compound appear to be separated by a carbon-carbon

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,320
single bond as I've drawn them here.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,120
We recall that compounds with pi bonds, or the potential to have them, tend to have resonance

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,000
contributors which can stabilize those compounds.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And 1-3-butadiene is no different, having resonance contributors which contain pi electron

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,520
density in the intervening carbon-carbon bond.

45
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,360
Now, when this resonance involves the commingling of multiple pi bonds, as it does in our example

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,360
here, we refer to this special type of resonance as conjugation.

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,800
And then a compound comes with some important structural, physical, and chemical properties

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
as well.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:55,120
You see, this is only achieved when all four of the pi atomic orbitals align with one another.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,080
So for example, if I try to rotate the central carbon-carbon bond here by about 90 degrees,

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,840
I have a problem, right?

52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,760
Because our two pi bonds will be oriented perpendicularly to one another.

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,720
And because of that, they can't have pi electrons move from one to the other.

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,480
In other words, I can't establish the resonance that I could previously.

55
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,200
Now, as you might suspect from this observation, conjugated dienes like ours have a strong

56
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,120
tendency to take on that planar conformation, which aligns P orbitals of all the sp2 carbon

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,000
atoms in the compound.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
Now, all of this leads to a potential pair of stereo isomers in our example.

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,400
See, the partial pi bond character of that central carbon atom creates a restricted rotation,

60
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,960
producing two different isomers.

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, we call these S-cis, or cisoid, which looks like this, or I can flip the central

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,240
pi bond and make it an S-trans, or transoid, conformation.

63
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,460
So the cisoid and transoid isomers, they tend to interconvert more quickly because there's

64
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,760
actually only a pi bond that needs to break.

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,760
So a bona fide cis and trans alkene, while they can't interconvert well at all, would

66
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,400
be interconverting much more slowly than this.

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,840
Nonetheless, the two different states, cisoid and transoid, can exist as individuals.

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,440
Now, you can see from this that the requirement for conjugation is that the double bonds are

69
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
alternating.

70
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,760
If the double bonds are more than one carbon-carbon bond apart, let's try that.

71
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,720
Let's put the double bonds more than one carbon-carbon bond apart.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
Well, now there's an intervening sp3 carbon.

73
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,800
And because the intervening sp3 carbon has no available p orbitals, the electrons from

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
the two pi bonds cannot exchange by resonance.

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,720
And alternately, let's bring up a compound where the double bonds are not spaced at all.

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,480
They're right next to one another in what we call accumulated dyne.

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,360
Now, in this case, notice that the central carbon has to have two different p orbitals

78
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,040
participating in this bonding arrangement, and that means that it has to have two pi

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,600
bonds which are not parallel, but rather are normal to one another.

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,200
So in neither of these two cases, could we possibly make a compound that's conjugated?

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,000
It's only when we have that very special arrangement of alternating pi bonds that we see this very

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,440
special effect.

83
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,360
Now, in spite of what we know now about the remarkable mobility of pi bonds in conjugated

84
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,660
compounds, when we try to name them, we revert to the most stable resonance contributor as

85
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,160
our reference.

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Of course, this is always a contributor with all-neutral atoms and alternating pi bonds.

87
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
The name is constructed in much the same way as simple alkenes, but with the alteration

88
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,200
that before the ene suffix, we insert the prefix die, try, tetra, etc. based upon the

89
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,560
number of double bonds present.

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,760
For example, what's commonly called vinyl ethylene would be named 1-3 butadiene.

91
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:06,920
Now, creating ever larger linear conjugated alkenes produces 1-3-5 hexatriene, then 1-3-5-7

92
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,760
octatetraene, and so on.

93
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,440
Now, you may be wondering at this point if the analogy extends to cyclic conjugated compounds,

94
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,920
and the answer to this question is yes.

95
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,480
For example, 1-3 cyclohexadiene would be considered a conjugated compound as well.

96
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,040
Yet again, you may wonder if conjugation in cyclic compounds can run the full circumference

97
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,120
of the ring, like in this putative 1-3-5 cyclohexatriene molecule.

98
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,880
The answer to that question spawns such a rich chemistry that we're going to give it

99
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,800
a lecture all its own next time.

100
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,200
So for now, let's keep our focus on acyclic conjugated compounds and leave the more complex

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,360
cyclics for another day.

102
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,800
Just as we did with isolated alkenes, we can also survey the effective conjugation on stability

103
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,560
using heats of hydrogenation.

104
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,080
So let's do this using a simple system with only a few isomers, like pentadines.

105
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,720
As a reference, the heat of hydrogenation of one pentene is 125 kilojoules per mole.

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,280
Now if we add a second double bond, which is isolated from the other by multiple carbon-carbon bonds,

107
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,400
we create 1-4 pentadiene, which contains two isolated double bonds.

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,800
Not surprisingly, the heat of hydrogenation doubles, because we've essentially added a second bond

109
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,720
of exactly the same type.

110
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:44,800
But hydrogenation of its regioisomer, 1-3 pentadiene, shown here in the transconfirmation,

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,320
releases less energy than the sum of that of two isolated double bonds.

112
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,240
It's this observation which first led to our understanding of the stabilizing effect of resonance.

113
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,680
This stabilizing effect extends far beyond simple diene hydrocarbons.

114
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,600
Resonance has similar effects on the stability of compounds containing heteroatoms,

115
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:13,120
like our familiar friend's enols, carbocation like allyl cation, and many others.

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,960
So let's take a closer look at our simple conjugated diene from earlier,

117
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,160
and see if we can explain this remarkable increase in stability.

118
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,720
We're going to begin by drawing it as what is clearly its most stable resonance contributor.

119
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,960
Then we're going to turn it on its side so that we can easily view the piatomic orbitals,

120
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,160
which are overlapping in space, to produce the new conjugated pi system.

121
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,200
Now if we try to create a representation of the resonance hybrid in this orientation,

122
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,600
it becomes clear that something very special is happening in our conjugated system.

123
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,000
The four pi electrons are not actually confined to those isolated pi bonds,

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,080
but rather have free run of the entire system.

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,600
So let's take a look at the molecular orbitals first of a simple isolated alkene

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,760
and analyze their energetics so that we can better understand the stabilizing effect one more time.

127
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,640
We want to start by showing you a very simple piatomic orbital.

128
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,360
And so far in the course I've shown you these orbitals as simply having two lobes,

129
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,360
one up, one down, one left, or one right, but always in opposition to one another.

130
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,680
But the truth is that piatomic orbitals have a characteristic called phase.

131
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,240
And we tend to show this phase as being plus and minus.

132
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,480
This is a rather unfortunate choice of terminology because it really has nothing to do with charge

133
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,200
or anything else that's up or down.

134
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,320
It could just as easily be bitter or sweet, beautiful and ugly.

135
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,240
They're just opposing phases, which means that I can draw my pi orbital like this

136
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,840
or I can just as easily turn the phase the other way.

137
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,520
So all pi orbitals have two potential states that they can be in,

138
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,360
that with their phases either up down or down up, plus minus or minus plus,

139
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,800
choose your language, but realize that they have two opposing phases.

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,280
Now what this means is that if I put another P orbital next to it in an attempt to create a pi system,

141
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,120
there are actually our two different potential arrangements.

142
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,320
An out-of-phase overlap, see, we have red-blue, blue-red, or an in-phase overlap,

143
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,920
where similar phases, red-red, blue-blue, are overlapping.

144
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,680
Now only orbital lobes that are in phase with one another can combine.

145
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,520
So we get what's called a node in the out-of-phase overlap situation.

146
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,960
This is a higher energy state and so the orbital formed by this will be higher in energy.

147
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,720
Whereas the in-phase overlap creates no node and in fact creates a larger space for the electrons to move

148
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,640
and this creates our pi bond.

149
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,000
Now these are atomic orbitals and the new orbitals that they form have shapes that look more like this,

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,640
which traverse larger regions of space.

151
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
But for today's discussion to keep things simple,

152
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,640
we're going to look more at the actual P atomic orbitals before they've actually been combined.

153
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:01,040
So we'll be using this representation, but we'll still be thinking about the large molecular orbitals as well.

154
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,680
So let's calculate now the energetics of the molecular orbitals in one three-butadiene.

155
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,200
So we know that our ethene had two different molecular orbitals, but what about one three-butadiene?

156
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,440
Well, its pi system has two pi bonds and therefore four electrons and four participating P orbitals.

157
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,720
So I'm going to turn the molecule on its side here and place the P system on top.

158
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
And then what we're going to do is we're going to analyze all the potential orientations,

159
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,920
every permutations of phase up and phase down for these four orbitals combined.

160
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,040
So let's start with the simplest.

161
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,680
When all the orbitals are in phase, there are zero nodes,

162
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,760
which means I've created a very stable region of space for the electrons to move in.

163
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,360
So I'm going to put this at the bottom of my energy axis and label it pi one.

164
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,800
So this is the orientation for my lowest energy molecular orbital.

165
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,960
The next best arrangement has a single node right through the middle of the pi system.

166
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,720
So this will be higher in energy than the previous orbital.

167
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,640
We're going to call that pi two.

168
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,640
We can continue this exercise creating a new overlap that has two nodes,

169
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,280
we're going to move that over and label it pi three.

170
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,080
And of course, the last potential permutation has three nodes

171
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,760
and we're going to move that to the highest energy position and call it pi four.

172
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,800
So what you might notice here is that if I put all these orbitals on an energy axis

173
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,640
and I put the non-bonding energy here, which means basically the energy of a vacant P orbital,

174
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,320
that some of the molecular orbitals are more stable and others are less.

175
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
So only when electrons move into these regions of space

176
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,360
will they be happier than if they're not in a bond at all.

177
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,440
To move into these orbitals would be energetically unfavorable.

178
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,960
Now fortunately, in the case of one-three-butadiene,

179
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,160
we have four total pi electrons,

180
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,560
which means they can all find a home in a lower energy orbital.

181
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,000
This is the source of the stability of conjugated compounds.

182
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,880
They offer a more stable lower energy orbital for the electrons to move into

183
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,800
when those P orbitals combine.

184
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
Now when they're down here in this region beneath, we call them bonding orbitals

185
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,840
for obvious reasons because they create a chemical bond.

186
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,240
But when we talk about orbitals up here above that non-bonding energy threshold,

187
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,760
we refer to them as anti-bonding orbitals because they're very high in energy.

188
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,640
But the effect is even more predictable and goes even further than that.

189
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,280
We can look at it by comparing one-three-butadiene, which we just looked at,

190
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,160
with a slightly larger conjugated alkene, one-three-five hexatriene.

191
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,640
So if we do the same exercise for these two compounds that we just did,

192
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,560
we'll find that when we turn them on their side and analyze their pi atomic orbital overlaps,

193
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,960
there are four molecular orbitals available for the butadiene.

194
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:56,600
And in this case, there will actually be six different orbitals possible for the hexatriene.

195
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,760
But there's something important you have to notice here beyond just the number of orbitals.

196
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,600
And that is that the distance between them in energy is changing.

197
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,440
Here the orbitals are closer together in energy than the others.

198
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,280
So if I take a look at these systems when populated,

199
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,120
both of them create more stable compounds than they would be if they didn't have conjugation.

200
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
So that's a good thing.

201
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,240
But the other important effect that we can see here is that the frontier molecular orbitals,

202
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,960
called the HOMO and LUMO for highest occupied molecular orbital

203
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,520
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, are different.

204
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,880
Not only different, predictably so.

205
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,640
Extending conjugation decreases the frontier molecular orbital energy gap.

206
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,320
Now, in the meantime, nature has exploited this property of conjugated compounds

207
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,320
in the development of a rainbow of pigments used by plants to gather energy for photosynthesis,

208
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,800
attracts symbiotic animals, and even to protect themselves from light,

209
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,440
which could otherwise damage their cellular structure.

210
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,640
Now, one of the most familiar examples of this from our everyday lives is the pigment beta-carotene.

211
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,920
Now, this is an example of the structure of beta-carotene using chemdra.

212
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,680
Now, just like our much smaller examples, beta-carotene can absorb a very specific wavelength of light

213
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,760
to promote electrons in its pi system from the HOMO to the LUMO.

214
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,400
In this case, however, you can see that we have 22 p orbitals participating

215
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,200
in its frontier molecular orbital energy gap.

216
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,920
So that makes that gap so very small that it doesn't absorb ultraviolet light,

217
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,240
but rather low energy, visible light.

218
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,680
Now, if a specific color of light is absorbed when passing through or reflecting off of an object,

219
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,560
even when as small as a molecule, our eye detects all of the remaining wavelengths

220
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,280
in the transmitted or reflected light, causing us to see the complementary color of that which is being absorbed.

221
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:56,760
In this case, orange is the complementary color to the absorbed blue light, so that's the color that we see.

222
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,200
Now, beta-carotene, which is right here, is responsible in part for the color of fresh carrots,

223
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,520
for which it was named, as well as certain color changes in the leaves of trees in autumn.

224
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,000
See, as fall comes, deciduous trees undergo a process called senescence,

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,080
during which they break down and reabsorb the valuable chlorophyll,

226
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,520
which helps them to produce food through photosynthesis.

227
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,120
Now, as the chlorophyll is removed from the doomed leaves, the other pigments, like this beta-carotene,

228
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,920
which were overwhelmed by its strong coloration, are given their chance to shine,

229
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,600
even if only for a few weeks, as the leaf dies and detaches from the now dormant tree.

230
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,240
And it's these 22 participating p orbitals in the resonance of beta-carotene

231
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,360
that are responsible for much of the orange color that you see.

232
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,360
So this year, when the fall foliage begins to burst with color, think about this.

233
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:55,480
What you're really observing is the result of a complex dance of pie electrons within the pigments of the leaves.

234
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,640
Now, you might also recognize that beta-carotene bears a striking similarity to another compound we've already looked at, retinol.

235
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,600
And that's not a coincidence.

236
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,520
Beta-carotene is one of a group of compounds commonly referred to as vitamin A.

237
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,720
And when ingested, some animal species, including humans, can convert beta-carotene into retinol.

238
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,520
But humans aren't very good at this.

239
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
Our bodies make our own retinol in other ways as well.

240
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,680
So we don't really have a need to convert large quantities of beta-carotene into this critical chromophore, or molecule which absorbs light.

241
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,080
So what happens when a carrot lover just can't say no to that 20th or 30th carrot stick?

242
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,640
Well, his or her body is unable to convert all the beta-carotene into retinol.

243
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,920
So instead, it stores the useful vitamin for a rainy day.

244
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,480
Now, beta-carotene, you probably noticed, is a hydrocarbon.

245
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,000
So it's naturally stored in the lowest polarity environment that your body can find.

246
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,960
Fat tissue just beneath your skin.

247
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,920
So if enough beta-carotene is consumed, and therefore stored in this way, it can lead to a yellowing of the skin.

248
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,240
Or even the appearance that the skin has turned orange.

249
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:16,480
This condition, called caroteneemia, is actually pretty harmless and will resolve itself over time with a minor dietary modification.

250
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,520
Although conjugated systems are somewhat more stable than similar but isolated pie systems,

251
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,720
they can and do undergo many of the addition reactions that we discussed previously.

252
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,320
For simple isolated alkenes, the same kind of reactions will apply to conjugated alkenes.

253
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,760
But with a few important caveats.

254
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,560
For example, the highly connected pie systems of conjugated compounds, like alkenes,

255
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,640
means that they can often undergo more complex addition reactions with unexpected regioisomers forming.

256
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,360
And the classic example of this is in the addition of a hydrogen halide to 1,3-butadiene.

257
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,000
So let's take a look at the addition of this hydrogen halide to 1,3-butadiene.

258
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,280
We're all familiar with hydrochloric acid and its properties and how it tends to react with alkenes.

259
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,320
So I'm going to put a 1,3-butadiene here in place of where we've already seen some isolated alkenes in earlier lessons in the course.

260
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:17,000
And your instinct is probably right here, to have your alkene attack the hydrogen of the HCl.

261
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,680
But in this case, you get more than one potential intermediate.

262
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,840
Notice that I could draw a carbocation with the positive charge on the secondary carbon here,

263
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,720
or I could draw it on the primary carbon here.

264
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,680
Now, of course, the truth about this is that it's really all the same intermediate.

265
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,280
And that what we're really looking at in this slide is two different resonance contributors

266
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,000
to what is actually a resonance hybrid with positive charges in two different locations.

267
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,800
Nonetheless, this means that attack can occur by the chloride on one of two different spots on the intermediate.

268
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,040
The chloride attacks the secondary carbon.

269
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:59,480
We get the product that one would probably anticipate based upon our earlier lectures on isolated alkenes.

270
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:06,040
If instead it attacks the primary carbon, we expect a product in which the chlorine has added actually four atoms away,

271
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,000
instead of two atoms away, from where we place the hydrogen.

272
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,720
So you can imagine in your mind that Z7 or Kovnikov would probably have a pretty good argument over this one, wouldn't they?

273
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,240
Because Z7 would clearly say the more substituted alkene is what you're going to make,

274
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,120
whereas Kovnikov is more likely to argue that the more stable carbocation will dictate the product of your reaction.

275
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,240
Now, although they didn't actually argue over this one, one can imagine it would be a pretty epic battle, wouldn't it?

276
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,280
And the real catch here, the real clincher is they would both be right. It just depends on the conditions.

277
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,880
We call the first situation here a 1-2 addition. This product tends to form very rapidly.

278
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:53,120
We call the lower example a 1-4 addition, and this product is actually more stable, but it also tends to form more slowly.

279
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,360
So we call these kinds of competitions between two different products which form under two different sets of conditions,

280
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,160
at least in this case, a thermodynamically or kinetically controlled reaction.

281
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,960
So let me explain a little bit more. Here's our reaction again, 1-3 butadiene with HCl.

282
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:14,400
But this time, let's consider the vertical here as being an energy axis and track the reaction as it goes.

283
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,400
So in the first step of my reaction, I'm going to form my intermediate where I have positive charge in two different regions.

284
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,040
Now, this is the same for either pathway, so I only have to draw one.

285
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,440
But at this point, the pathway splits and we go through two separate transition states,

286
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,800
one with the chlorine attacking at the primary and one with it attacking at the secondary.

287
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,680
But notice that the intermediate which results in the attack on the secondary carbon is actually lower in energy.

288
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:49,740
If we complete the reaction, though, what we find is that the higher energy transition state has led us to a lower energy product.

289
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,980
So the question here is, which is driving the major product of this reaction?

290
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,680
Is it the stability of the transition states, meaning the rate of the reaction, or the stability of the products,

291
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,140
meaning the thermodynamics or the free energy of the reaction?

292
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,580
So if we simplify this, it's a bit easier to see.

293
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,720
We have a fast pathway to an unstable product and a slow pathway to a more stable product.

294
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:23,720
So we call these kinetic products for that one which forms quickly and a thermodynamic product for one which takes longer to form but is more stable.

295
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,520
So in the earlier decades of the 1900s, synthetic organic chemistry was earning recognition as a powerful field of study,

296
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,160
tremendous potential for useful application in medicine, industry, and beyond.

297
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:44,360
But as the 20th century dawned, the library of synthetic techniques available to organic chemists was still somewhat lacking.

298
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,060
A particular challenge facing chemists was that need for techniques to create new carbon-carbon bonds.

299
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:57,220
You may notice as you review the previous lectures that examples of techniques which can accomplish this critical task are scarce.

300
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,180
In short, if you were a chemist in the early 1900s who could devise a new method for creating carbon-carbon bonds,

301
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:08,420
you might as well start writing your Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

302
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:15,520
One proof of this proviso is the Diels-Alder reaction, named for Otto Diels and Kurt Alder who we met earlier.

303
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:25,720
In 1928, they devised a reaction scheme which exploited the geometry of conjugated dienes and molecular orbitals to produce not just one new carbon-carbon bond,

304
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,820
but two new carbon-carbon bonds in a single step.

305
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:38,060
The Diels-Alder reaction is actually one of a class of reactions known as pericyclic reactions.

306
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:48,920
Pericyclic reactions consist of the exchange of multiple pi electrons simultaneously between two molecules to create two new sigma bonds between them.

307
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:59,460
The Diels-Alder is designated a 4 plus 2 pericyclic reaction because it involves this kind of a reaction between a conjugated diene having four pi electrons

308
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:06,720
and one pi bond from another reagent known as dienophile, which would have two pi electrons.

309
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:14,560
The simplest example which meets these criteria is the reaction between the cisoid isomer of 1,3-butadiene and ethene.

310
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,860
So let's start there.

311
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,700
To envision exactly how this reaction takes place, let's recreate the molecular orbitals of both molecules.

312
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:36,060
Recall from our earlier discussion in this lecture, 1,3-butadiene has four molecular orbitals of which the pi-2 is the highest occupied molecular orbital, or the HOMO.

313
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:42,360
And the pi-3 is the lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital, or the LUMO.

314
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:53,400
Now we collectively refer to the HOMO and LUMO as frontier molecular orbitals because they present the orbitals which can be vacated and occupied respectively when a reaction takes place.

315
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Ethene is, of course, a bit simpler since it only has two p orbitals in its pi system, so pi-1 is the HOMO and pi-2 is the LUMO.

316
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,660
Now this is the exciting part where the elegant simplicity of this reaction shines through.

317
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:24,400
As the two reagents approach one another, we can see that the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile are in phase with one another on both sides, and that the same is actually true for the dien-LUMO and the dienophile HOMO.

318
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Now here we can see why the diene has to be cisoid as well.

319
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,100
Transoid-butadiene has the ends of its pi system too far apart to achieve the needed overlap on both sides simultaneously.

320
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:50,640
What this means is that the two reagents are perfectly configured to exchange electrons on both sides in a concerted process, and this produces two new sigma bonds from four pi electrons.

321
00:26:50,640 --> 00:27:01,240
The entropic penalty of making one molecule from two is very easily balanced and in fact overwhelmed by the enthalpy benefit of trading those two pi bonds for the two sigmas.

322
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,240
The new carbon-carbon bond creation is complete.

323
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,240
What a rush, right?

324
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:14,680
So what makes the four plus two reaction so easy to complete is this in-phase alignment of frontier molecular orbitals.

325
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:24,180
Because the molecular orbital geometries are perfectly set up for a reaction to take place, all we need to do is mix the reagents and wait for the molecules to collide.

326
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,180
So we call this a thermally activated reaction.

327
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:47,320
But if we try to conduct an analogous reaction, for example, in a two plus two cyclization, making cyclobutane from two molecules of ethylene, we see that the frontier molecular orbitals are not properly aligned when the compounds are in their lowest energy states.

328
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,820
We're not completely out of luck though.

329
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:58,820
We can resort to a trick called photoactivation, promoting electrons into higher molecular orbitals by shining light of just the right wavelength on them.

330
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:08,820
This essentially changes the identity of the frontier molecular orbitals, artificially creating the overlap that we can get for free in a four plus two.

331
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Now, it's this detail that the Diels Alder reactions are thermally activated, that makes them so useful, and also the reason that I'm going to stick to the four plus two reaction as we go forward.

332
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:28,820
It also doesn't hurt that a number of biologically and commercially relevant compounds, such as cyclic terpenes, contain a cyclohexene motif.

333
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:40,820
Of course, the Diels Alder reaction can be performed with more complex dienes and dienophiles, leading to products with more robust stereochemistry than our cyclohexene products from the previous example.

334
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Notice that in the addition of a dienophile to the diene, both of the new carbon-carbon bonds form on the same side of the newly created ring.

335
00:28:49,820 --> 00:29:00,820
In the case of cyclohexene formation, this is purely an academic observation, since all substituents of the newly joined carbons are hydrogen atoms. But what if they're not?

336
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:08,820
To find a situation in which this applies, we need to look no further than the very first step of the Woodward synthesis of cholesterol.

337
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:21,820
Woodward knew that he was trying to make a compound with four fused carbon rings on it from much simpler starting materials, so why not consider the Diels Alder to start building his scaffold?

338
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Why not indeed? Woodward began his synthesis using 1,3-butadiene to create his first fused ring. The Diels Alder process ensured that the desired six-membered ring would form.

339
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:46,820
But Woodward had a new problem in his synthesis. The newly fused rings had the proper connectivity, but were in the cis-confirmation, and clearly his final product had to be in the trans-confirmation.

340
00:29:46,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Today, though, we've covered a great deal, so let's sum up. We discussed the phenomenon of conjugation, in which multiple pi bonds in resonance with one another lend extra stability to a compound or ion.

341
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:15,820
We made a few structural arguments for why this added stability exists, and we learned a new way of modeling the energies of conjugated pi systems in alkenes, backing up our predictions of stability with observed heat of hydrogenation.

342
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:36,820
We scratched the surface of conjugated diene reactivity by exploring two reactions. First, the hydrohalogenation of 1,3-butadiene, and how addition of the second double bond leads to two possible products, a kinetic one, the 1,2 product, and a thermodynamic one in the 1,4 product.

343
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:48,820
Then, we examined a Nobel Prize-winning reaction conceived by Otto Deals and Kurt Alder, a reaction which allows us to quickly and easily form not one, but two carbon-carbon bonds.

344
00:30:49,820 --> 00:31:03,820
We discussed how the frontier molecular orbitals of reagents in the 4 plus 2 pericyclic reaction are perfectly suited for a thermally activated reaction, which can easily produce a motif which got Woodward started on his way to the total synthesis of cholesterol.

345
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:17,820
Next time, we're going to take a look at what happens when we take these linear conjugated systems to the next level by cyclizing them to produce a very special carbon scaffold. I'll see you then.
