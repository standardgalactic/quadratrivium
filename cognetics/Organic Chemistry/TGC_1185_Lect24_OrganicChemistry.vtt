00:00.000 --> 00:18.440
So, we've seen how Friedrich Voller's synthesis of urea, from non-biological starting materials

00:18.440 --> 00:25.600
in 1828, toppled the long-standing dogma known as vitalism, which stated that only organisms

00:25.600 --> 00:28.400
could produce the molecules of life.

00:29.360 --> 00:35.240
Now, as the 1800s pressed on, other notable chemists advanced this idea by putting it

00:35.240 --> 00:36.920
into practice.

00:36.920 --> 00:42.560
Justice von Liebig demonstrated the role of abiological nitrogen in plant fertilization,

00:42.560 --> 00:47.920
and he also extracted and manipulated carbohydrates under controlled laboratory conditions.

00:47.920 --> 00:53.480
Miescher had isolated DNA from the nuclei of cells, and as a century drew to a close,

00:53.480 --> 00:59.080
Alexander Butlerov and Hermann Emile Fischer both managed to synthesize carbohydrates and

00:59.080 --> 01:03.520
other biologically relevant compounds in their laboratories, also without the help of living

01:03.520 --> 01:05.020
organisms.

01:06.360 --> 01:11.800
So, by the end of the 1800s, organic chemists were beginning to get a hold on exactly how

01:11.800 --> 01:19.200
to produce, characterize, and even manipulate the chemicals of life abiologically.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.200
One could argue that today we have successfully, if not yet completely, dissected life all

01:24.200 --> 01:27.520
the way down to the molecular level.

01:27.520 --> 01:32.560
We can take molecules out of living systems and use them in vitro.

01:32.560 --> 01:38.680
We can synthesize compounds like carbohydrates, RNA, and DNA in labs, and insert them back

01:38.680 --> 01:44.120
into living systems to show that they function exactly as one would predict for their biologically

01:44.120 --> 01:48.120
synthesized equivalents.

01:48.120 --> 01:53.960
But there remains one great burning question, which is unanswered to this day.

01:53.960 --> 01:59.160
If all of these molecules of life are truly devoid of any vital essence, shouldn't we

01:59.160 --> 02:05.720
be able to use those synthetic compounds not just to sustain or manipulate existing life,

02:05.720 --> 02:08.360
but to create life itself?

02:08.360 --> 02:14.760
Now, life on Earth must have originated by some accidental, abiological synthesis of

02:14.760 --> 02:18.480
some of the compounds necessary to achieve life.

02:18.480 --> 02:22.920
But what were those compounds, and how did they come to be with no living organism or

02:22.920 --> 02:27.520
human scientist around to create them?

02:27.520 --> 02:31.680
It's an intriguing question, and one which is difficult to answer considering that it

02:31.680 --> 02:38.320
took place at least 2.7 billion years ago, and nobody was around to see it happen.

02:38.320 --> 02:44.280
Was it DNA, RNA, maybe carbohydrates, or amino acids?

02:44.280 --> 02:49.360
And whatever these seminal biomolecules were, how did they come together in a way which

02:49.360 --> 02:55.840
allowed them to cross that critical barrier of simply existing to self-replication, allowing

02:55.840 --> 03:03.440
them to reproduce, grow, and eventually evolve?

03:03.440 --> 03:08.480
So scientists started on a new quest, not one to learn how biomolecules function, per

03:08.480 --> 03:13.560
say, but rather how they came to be in the first place.

03:13.560 --> 03:19.320
And two of these researchers were Harold Urie and Stanley Miller.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.080
Miller was a student of Urie in the 1950s.

03:22.080 --> 03:27.440
Now, already a Nobel laureate at the time, Urie had developed an interest in the origin

03:27.440 --> 03:32.760
of life and had asked if it were possible for simple, vital organic compounds to form

03:32.760 --> 03:40.160
under the reducing, stormy conditions of the Earth's early atmosphere.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.440
Miller had just arrived at the University of Chicago as a graduate student and was slated

03:45.440 --> 03:49.440
to work on a project aimed at understanding the synthesis of elements in the furnaces

03:49.440 --> 03:51.800
of stars.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.400
But Miller found himself inspired by Urie's interest in the origin of life and asked for

03:56.400 --> 03:59.240
permission to try a different experiment.

03:59.240 --> 04:05.160
Come to imitate the conditions of the primordial Earth and probe the resulting material for

04:05.160 --> 04:10.160
signs of biologically relevant molecules.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.880
Urie agreed, and Miller went straight to work, designing a system which simulated the early

04:14.880 --> 04:19.480
Earth's atmosphere and closed conditions on a lab bench.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.520
The conditions on the Earth some three billion years ago were very different from those today.

04:24.520 --> 04:30.840
Balkanism was rampant, oxygen was scarce, and electrical storms were commonplace.

04:30.840 --> 04:37.320
So to model this, Miller devised an apparatus which enclosed water, methane, ammonia and

04:37.320 --> 04:41.040
hydrogen in a sealed vessel.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.720
Now he allowed an electrical current to arc through that mixture for an extended period

04:45.720 --> 04:51.280
of time as the water was boiled.

04:51.280 --> 04:56.120
After running his apparatus for a week, Miller tapped the circulating solution and analyzed

04:56.120 --> 04:57.120
it.

04:57.120 --> 05:03.360
And sure enough, when he did, he found evidence of several amino acids.

05:03.360 --> 05:08.960
Now Miller published the results in the prestigious journal Science in 1953 under the title, A

05:08.960 --> 05:14.200
Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions.

05:14.200 --> 05:20.160
And remarkably, the paper is published citing Miller as the lone author.

05:20.160 --> 05:25.000
This was done at Urie's insistence lest he received the credit for Miller's ingenious

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
experiment.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.160
So perhaps it was amino acids which were the very first biological molecules to participate

05:34.160 --> 05:36.520
in life on Earth.

05:36.520 --> 05:41.200
But if they were, these are some pretty small molecules, and life would need something larger,

05:41.200 --> 05:46.240
more complex, to really generate diversity and get a foothold.

05:46.240 --> 05:51.060
But amino acids are able to create these kinds of molecules by joining together into long

05:51.060 --> 05:58.600
strands through a special linkage known as an amide bond.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.560
During this lecture, we're going to talk about a class of materials which not only

06:01.560 --> 06:08.000
make up 20% of the mass of your body, but which find use in medicine, materials, detergents

06:08.000 --> 06:10.600
and many other functions.

06:10.600 --> 06:15.480
Today we're going to talk about proteins, usually associated with skin, hair and muscle

06:15.480 --> 06:16.880
fibers.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.480
Proteins are really much more than that.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.760
They also make up a class of catalysts which mediate every chemical reaction that your

06:23.760 --> 06:26.220
body carries out.

06:26.220 --> 06:32.080
But before we can develop an appreciation for these large, complex kings of catalysis,

06:32.080 --> 06:38.140
we have to review their building blocks, amino acids.

06:38.140 --> 06:42.800
Amino acids are so named because this class of compound always has two distinct functional

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
groups.

06:43.800 --> 06:50.200
Amine and an organic acid, joined together by one or more carbons.

06:50.200 --> 06:55.360
The simplest possible example is an amino acid in which the amine and acid groups are

06:55.360 --> 07:00.400
joined by a single CH2 group, also called a methylene group.

07:00.400 --> 07:07.920
When only one carbon separates the functional groups, we call these alpha amino acids.

07:07.920 --> 07:12.360
You can imagine that extending the chain by one more methylene creates a beta amino acid

07:12.360 --> 07:16.520
and yet another insertion creates a gamma amino acid and so on.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.600
Of course, I've drawn these compounds as completely neutral species, but each contains

07:21.600 --> 07:27.840
a carboxylic acid with a pKa of about 5 and an amine whose conjugate base has a pKa of

07:27.840 --> 07:30.920
about 11.

07:30.920 --> 07:35.800
So a more proper way to draw these compounds might be like this, with an intramolecular

07:35.800 --> 07:40.680
proton transfer reaction creating two regions of charge.

07:40.680 --> 07:45.200
We call these species zwitterions.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.320
The charged regions of these species don't interact favorably with most low polarity

07:49.320 --> 07:54.620
organic solvents, so they can make dissolution in organic solvents a painful process for

07:54.620 --> 07:55.620
amino acids.

07:55.620 --> 08:00.160
It's a good thing that you're made mostly of the very polar solvent water, so they

08:00.160 --> 08:04.320
dissolve in you quite readily.

08:04.320 --> 08:10.000
Although there are many other ways to connect an amine group and a carboxylic acid, in today's

08:10.000 --> 08:15.560
lecture we will keep our attention squarely focused on alpha amino acids, because this

08:15.560 --> 08:21.480
class of amino acids was chosen by nature as the basis for proteins, a very special

08:21.480 --> 08:27.040
set of compounds which carry out the chemistry of life.

08:27.040 --> 08:31.120
So getting back to our simple alpha amino acid.

08:31.120 --> 08:36.680
We commonly call this little guy glycine, it's one of the first amino acids detected

08:36.680 --> 08:39.360
by Stanley Miller.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.560
Now notice that glycine has two hydrogens on the alpha carbon.

08:43.560 --> 08:50.520
It's this position which is modified to create a short library of 20 alpha amino acid compounds

08:50.520 --> 08:55.000
which are used to produce nearly all of the proteins and enzymes that drive the chemistry

08:55.000 --> 08:57.480
of life.

08:57.480 --> 09:01.880
When something other than a hydrogen is present in one of those two positions, we refer to

09:01.880 --> 09:08.240
the group replacing that hydrogen as a side chain.

09:08.240 --> 09:14.320
Now there is really no side, front, back, top or bottom to a molecule of course, but

09:14.320 --> 09:18.720
when we align various amino acids for the purpose of comparison, we usually line the

09:18.720 --> 09:24.400
amino acid portions of the molecules up and treat the side chain as a motif branching off

09:24.400 --> 09:27.920
in the same direction, hence the name.

09:27.920 --> 09:33.120
Even so, we know that these bonds can twist and rotate and do not necessarily exist locked

09:33.120 --> 09:37.160
in the configurations that I'm going to show you.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.560
Side chains can be broken down into several classes.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.400
Okay, let's take a look at a few of these amino acids now.

09:43.400 --> 09:47.040
We've already discussed a little bit about the simplest of all amino acids, which would

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
be glycine.

09:49.040 --> 09:54.240
Glycine is unusual among the amino acids because it has two of the same groups attached to

09:54.240 --> 09:57.240
its central carbon or its alpha carbon.

09:57.240 --> 10:04.040
So in this case, glycine is unusual because it's really unmodified, but as we begin modifying

10:04.040 --> 10:07.240
one of those groups, we start to create our library.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.840
Adding a methyl group creates alanine, another one of the amino acids, which was detected

10:11.840 --> 10:14.080
by Stanley Miller.

10:14.080 --> 10:21.080
If I continue to increase the complexity of that side chain, I can create valine, leucine

10:21.080 --> 10:23.040
and isoleucine.

10:23.040 --> 10:30.240
As you can see here, I've highlighted all of their side chains by sort of a grayish glow.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.680
The reason I've grouped these five together is that their side chains are hydrophobic.

10:34.680 --> 10:39.360
In other words, they're all made strictly of carbon and hydrogen, and so they behave as

10:39.360 --> 10:43.720
though they were very low polarity arms on the molecule.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.760
But that's only true for these five.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.200
Let's take a look at some others.

10:50.200 --> 10:56.640
Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are acidic side chains, meaning that in most physiological

10:56.640 --> 11:01.920
environments, you actually see them as their conjugate bases, so they have a tendency to

11:01.920 --> 11:04.600
carry negative charges.

11:04.600 --> 11:11.200
Asparagine and glutamine are two amino acids which have amide functional groups at the

11:11.200 --> 11:17.000
ends of their chains, so these are specialists at hydrogen bonding to other side chains and

11:17.000 --> 11:20.880
other molecules.

11:20.880 --> 11:28.800
The amino acids lysine, histidine and arginine all contain slightly basic amine groups, or

11:28.800 --> 11:31.840
in this case, histidine has a cyclic side chain.

11:31.840 --> 11:37.200
Nonetheless, it has a nitrogen which is basic, and so all three of these can become fairly

11:37.200 --> 11:41.520
easily protonated and therefore carry a positive charge.

11:41.520 --> 11:47.840
So these are the basic side chains of the amino acid library.

11:47.840 --> 11:56.360
Moving on, we have serine, threonine, cysteine and methionine, all of which contain either

11:56.360 --> 12:03.700
an OH, an SH group known as a thiol, or a group known as a thioether, where the sulfur is

12:03.700 --> 12:07.160
contained in between two carbons.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.960
The reason I placed all of these together is that they all contain fairly good nucleophiles.

12:11.960 --> 12:18.120
So these four are particularly good at creating covalent bonds between other molecules and

12:18.120 --> 12:22.760
their own side chains.

12:22.760 --> 12:29.720
Moving on, we have aromatic side chains as well, in the form of phenylalanine, tyrosine

12:29.720 --> 12:32.400
and tryptophen.

12:32.400 --> 12:39.000
All of these amino acids contain large conjugated or more accurately aromatic pi systems, which

12:39.000 --> 12:43.200
can be used to create all sorts of different interactions that you wouldn't get otherwise

12:43.200 --> 12:50.060
using, say, hydrophobics or any other amino acid for that matter.

12:50.060 --> 12:55.320
And finally, we have proline, which stands alone among amino acids because of a very

12:55.320 --> 12:57.440
special feature.

12:57.440 --> 13:04.200
Proline's side chain actually wraps around and bonds back to the nitrogen of the amino

13:04.200 --> 13:05.640
acid.

13:05.640 --> 13:10.640
So proline is unusual in the sense that its side chain is locked in a cyclic conformation

13:10.640 --> 13:16.260
rather than being free to move attached to an sp3 carbon.

13:16.260 --> 13:21.200
So proline is going to have some very special roles in biochemistry.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.400
But we're still not done characterizing these amino acids.

13:24.400 --> 13:31.360
Now you probably noticed that all but glycine contained a chiral center at the alpha carbon,

13:31.360 --> 13:36.520
meaning that there are two possible enantiomers of each compound.

13:36.520 --> 13:42.400
Now what's remarkable is that all 19 amino acids with a chiral alpha carbon take on the

13:42.400 --> 13:46.480
same stereochemistry in living systems.

13:46.480 --> 13:53.080
So only one enantiomer of each amino acid is useful biologically.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.280
The reason for this is twofold.

13:55.280 --> 14:01.320
First, chiral RNA is responsible for sequestering and using these amino acids to build proteins.

14:01.320 --> 14:08.360
So, only one handed form interacts properly with the ribosomal RNA.

14:08.360 --> 14:12.880
The other reason is that many amino acids are manufactured from one another in the body.

14:12.880 --> 14:19.560
In fact, only 8 of the 20 that I just showed you are absolutely essential in your diet.

14:19.560 --> 14:24.320
All the others can be made in your body from other starting materials, sometimes by chemically

14:24.320 --> 14:30.880
modifying some of the eight essential amino acids.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.560
So why was Miller's discovery so sensational?

14:34.560 --> 14:41.240
What is it about amino acids which make their presence in his primordial concoction so newsworthy?

14:41.240 --> 14:47.120
Well, now that we have a firm grasp on the structure of amino acids, let's consider

14:47.120 --> 14:52.760
what happens when we start putting them together via a series of condensation reactions which

14:52.760 --> 14:56.040
form chains of amide bonds.

14:56.040 --> 15:02.480
We call these polyamides peptides or proteins, and the distinction between the two is one

15:02.480 --> 15:07.960
of size, with the former generally referring to polymers of less than a hundred condensed

15:07.960 --> 15:13.720
amino acids and the latter encompassing larger molecules.

15:13.720 --> 15:17.160
So let's begin with just glycine.

15:17.160 --> 15:23.320
If I could condense two glycine amino acids together in an end-to-end relationship, I

15:23.320 --> 15:28.400
would find that I have created a very short chain, consisting of two glycines, minus a

15:28.400 --> 15:31.520
water molecule of course.

15:31.520 --> 15:36.600
Now I can continue the process condensing another to make a triglycine, then another,

15:36.600 --> 15:39.920
and so on for as long as I like.

15:39.920 --> 15:45.480
The result will be a chain of glycine residues, and we call them residues instead of amino

15:45.480 --> 15:52.400
acids since they've lost one equivalent of water when they are placed into the chain.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.640
Polymers like to arrange their polyamides so that the nitrogen-containing terminus is

15:56.640 --> 16:01.160
at the left, and the sequence can be read like a sentence from left to right, from end

16:01.160 --> 16:04.000
terminus to C terminus.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.680
Now our polyglycine peptide is pretty boring as peptides go, but remember that nature has

16:09.680 --> 16:17.440
provided us with 19 more options for each position in that peptide.

16:17.440 --> 16:22.280
It's this variety which leads to the stunning complexity in the possible number of sequences

16:22.280 --> 16:24.880
for peptides.

16:24.880 --> 16:31.680
Let's consider a protein of 100 residues, fairly short by biological standards.

16:31.680 --> 16:39.980
This sequence has 100 positions, with 20 possibilities in each position, for 20 to the 100th power

16:39.980 --> 16:42.600
number of possibilities.

16:42.600 --> 16:48.840
That's roughly 10 to the 130th power, far more possibilities than there are atoms in

16:48.840 --> 16:51.280
the known universe.

16:51.280 --> 16:57.320
So clearly, variety is not a problem when it comes to proteins and peptides.

16:57.320 --> 17:06.400
Now we call each unique sequence of condensed amino acids a primary structure, but the rabbit

17:06.400 --> 17:10.080
hole goes much, much deeper than that.

17:10.080 --> 17:15.440
You see, when amino acids condense to form an amide bond, the amine nitrogen from one

17:15.440 --> 17:21.240
residue and the carbonyl from the preceding residue participate in a resonance which locks

17:21.240 --> 17:27.400
a plane defined by the N, H, C, and O of the amide bond.

17:27.400 --> 17:33.360
We call this small collection of atoms the amide plane.

17:33.360 --> 17:38.760
But that leaves the alpha-carbon bonds free to rotate, and this gives proteins a tendency

17:38.760 --> 17:45.080
to twist and collapse on themselves in very specific arrangements which maximize intramolecular

17:45.080 --> 17:51.640
attractions created by backbone atoms and those side chains as well.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.480
We call this process protein folding.

17:55.480 --> 18:00.320
Now not only do alpha-carbon backbone bonds and side chain bonds rotate, but they tend

18:00.320 --> 18:07.800
to do so in ways which form just a few specific geometries called secondary structures.

18:07.800 --> 18:14.560
These structures include many different versions of essentially three basic motifs, helices,

18:14.560 --> 18:17.680
strands, and turns.

18:17.680 --> 18:27.800
So let's take a look at the most common versions of each of these now.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.680
Let's start with a short polyalanine molecule.

18:31.680 --> 18:37.840
Now polyalanine tends to form a secondary structure known as an alpha helix.

18:37.840 --> 18:44.360
Now in this example I've created an idealized helix which is perfect in all angles and interactions.

18:45.360 --> 18:53.000
The alpha helix is characterized by a helical pitch of 3.6 residues, meaning that one full

18:53.000 --> 18:58.640
turn is completed for every 3.6 residues I move along the chain.

18:58.640 --> 19:04.120
What this pitch accomplishes is to bring the amide NH of one residue into proper alignment

19:04.120 --> 19:09.360
to hydrogen bond with the carbonyl four residues down the chain.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.000
We can see the alpha helices in the structure of myoglobin for example.

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
If we include all of the atoms in a molecule of myoglobin, it's very difficult to see.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.520
But if instead we remove the side chains while leaving their effects on the structure in

19:24.520 --> 19:30.960
place, we can begin to see repeating turns of quite a few helices in the protein.

19:30.960 --> 19:35.320
But biochemists like to make things even prettier than organic chemists, so they like to show

19:35.320 --> 19:40.320
colorful 3D ribbons to map out the backbone of a peptide or protein, making it look more

19:40.320 --> 19:42.000
like this.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.280
Now the secondary structural elements of this protein are unmistakable and they're beautiful.

19:49.280 --> 19:55.880
Another common structure is the beta strand in which a peptide chain is fully extended.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.960
Now causing a chain to take on an extended geometry like this might seem a bit implausible

19:59.960 --> 20:05.480
at first because the driving force for the substructure only becomes clear when we align

20:05.480 --> 20:09.600
two or more of them anti-parallel to one another.

20:09.720 --> 20:16.360
This creates a network of NH to carbonyl hydrogen bonds in between two strands and the resulting

20:16.360 --> 20:20.000
network is referred to as a beta sheet.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.760
And this appears in many well characterized proteins as well.

20:24.760 --> 20:30.080
A third type of motif, and incidentally one which is all but essential to make a beta sheet,

20:30.080 --> 20:32.080
is the turn.

20:32.080 --> 20:37.400
There are many potential angles which can accomplish turns in proteins and certain amino acid residues

20:37.400 --> 20:40.520
seem better suited to inducing them.

20:40.520 --> 20:45.920
Among others, glycine and proline are very common turn residues, but for very different

20:45.920 --> 20:47.680
reasons.

20:47.680 --> 20:52.120
Glycine because the lack of a side chain allows it a greater range of angles.

20:52.120 --> 20:58.760
And proline because the cyclic nature of its chain restricts it to just a few angles which

20:58.760 --> 21:00.560
are consistent with turns.

21:00.560 --> 21:07.360
So it has the tendency to disrupt other patterns in chains and sheets allowing turns to begin.

21:08.320 --> 21:12.360
But the structural complexity doesn't even end there.

21:12.360 --> 21:18.000
Notice that each element of secondary structure in our protein packs against other secondary

21:18.000 --> 21:20.080
structures in that protein.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.720
And the interactions between the faces of these two structural elements is a stabilizing

21:24.720 --> 21:30.360
factor as well and brings different portions of the sequence into proper proximity and

21:30.360 --> 21:34.320
orientation for proper function.

21:34.320 --> 21:38.600
We call the arrangement of secondary structural elements in space relative to one another

21:38.600 --> 21:41.600
a protein's tertiary structure.

21:41.600 --> 21:47.960
Now additionally, entire proteins can act as subunits of a single large complex such

21:47.960 --> 21:54.720
as this, a voltage gated potassium ion channel characterized by Rod McKinnon in 1998.

21:54.720 --> 21:59.200
This conduit is designed to span the cell membrane and create a channel through which

21:59.200 --> 22:04.640
ions can flow, but it only functions when all four of its subunits are mated together

22:04.640 --> 22:11.520
creating a superstructure which forms a tunnel traversing the membrane of the cell.

22:11.520 --> 22:17.200
And this tunnel is lined with oxygen atoms of MI bonds from the protein's backbone.

22:17.200 --> 22:22.120
This creates a negatively charged conduit which is exactly the width of a potassium

22:22.120 --> 22:23.120
ion.

22:23.120 --> 22:29.920
And these very specific primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures combine

22:29.920 --> 22:39.000
to form a molecular device with powerful selectivity for potassium ion transport.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.880
So all of these higher order elements of structure, quaternary, tertiary and secondary, are in

22:44.880 --> 22:51.600
theory dictated simply by the sequence or the primary structure of a protein.

22:51.600 --> 22:56.880
If we simply construct an unfolded protein for nearly any naturally occurring enzyme,

22:56.880 --> 23:02.920
we often find that protein will most likely fold right back into its functional form,

23:02.920 --> 23:08.000
usually with startling speed.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.640
In rare instances however, the functional form of the protein is actually not the most

23:12.640 --> 23:15.200
stable fold.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.040
Proteins can become misfolded and trapped in an arrangement which will not allow them

23:19.040 --> 23:22.120
to fold properly.

23:22.120 --> 23:27.320
Now ordinarily it wouldn't be too alarming if a single protein in your body were to misfold.

23:27.320 --> 23:33.320
After all, you have millions and millions more to help get the job done.

23:33.320 --> 23:38.800
But it does get disconcerting when one misfolded protein encourages the misfolding of others,

23:38.800 --> 23:44.640
producing plaques of proteins which potentially can have devastating health effects.

23:44.640 --> 23:50.160
And this situation most notably happens when amyloid plaque builds in the brain of an Alzheimer's

23:50.160 --> 23:53.320
disease victim.

23:53.320 --> 24:01.560
Ok, so we clearly can benefit from understanding how protein sequence affects protein folding.

24:01.560 --> 24:06.880
The next order of business is to figure out how to make samples for study.

24:06.880 --> 24:12.080
Of course, biologically synthesized proteins can be produced using complex RNA machinery

24:12.080 --> 24:17.840
within cells, but what do chemists do when they want to make highly purified peptides

24:17.840 --> 24:23.120
and proteins in the laboratory for study?

24:23.120 --> 24:28.040
Several techniques are available, including the use of special strains of E. coli bacteria

24:28.040 --> 24:33.920
as manufacturing plants for proteins, as we saw in the manufacture of human insulin.

24:33.920 --> 24:38.680
We saw in our DNA lecture how that genome of that very special, already genetically

24:38.680 --> 24:43.800
modified E. coli was altered to encourage the bacteria to produce massive quantities

24:43.800 --> 24:48.880
of that one desired protein.

24:48.880 --> 24:53.400
Now this technique is startlingly effective when large proteins containing naturally

24:53.400 --> 24:56.440
occurring amino acids are the target.

24:56.440 --> 25:01.080
But this isn't a microbiology course, it's a chemistry course.

25:01.080 --> 25:06.200
So there's a method for synthesizing even peptides and proteins with exotic side chains

25:06.200 --> 25:11.320
and very interesting organic chemistry, absolutely.

25:11.320 --> 25:16.680
And its developer, Bruce Merrifield, won the 1984 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his development

25:16.680 --> 25:25.600
called Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, sometimes also called the Merrifield Synthesis.

25:25.600 --> 25:30.800
Merrifield's technique starts with an insoluble polymer resin, to which is attached a single

25:30.800 --> 25:33.000
amino acid.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.360
The connection to the resin is made through the C-terminus and the N-terminus is available

25:37.360 --> 25:39.880
for reaction.

25:39.880 --> 25:45.000
Now Merrifield then turned to a classic technique for making amide bonds, called an active ester

25:45.000 --> 25:47.080
coupling.

25:47.080 --> 25:53.040
By mixing amino acids with a special reagent, which turns them into very electrophilic esters,

25:53.040 --> 25:58.320
the exposed amine of the growing chain can be enticed to attack the carbonyl of an amino

25:58.320 --> 26:02.440
acid in solution.

26:02.440 --> 26:06.560
Of course, this is a problem when the amino acids in solution have amine groups of their

26:06.560 --> 26:08.160
own.

26:08.160 --> 26:13.320
If unchecked, the growing peptides will extend in an uncontrolled fashion.

26:13.320 --> 26:18.320
So Merrifield applied a special protecting group to the N-terminus of the amino acids

26:18.320 --> 26:21.920
prior to reacting them with the growing peptide on the resin.

26:21.920 --> 26:29.880
Now Merrifield used a group called a T-butoxy carbonyl motif.

26:29.880 --> 26:35.360
When attached to an amide, this N-terminal protecting group prevents more than one amino

26:35.360 --> 26:42.200
acid from attaching to any given growing peptide in a single reaction step.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.760
The excess reagent could then be washed away from the resin, and the N-terminal protecting

26:46.760 --> 26:53.440
groups removed from the on-resin peptide before introducing the next coupling reagent.

26:53.440 --> 26:58.520
In this way, Merrifield was able to produce peptides in sufficient yield and purity to

26:58.520 --> 27:03.680
be used in lab experimentation.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.080
So let's review what we've covered.

27:06.080 --> 27:11.600
We've discussed amino acids, most extensively alpha amino acids.

27:11.600 --> 27:16.040
We looked at the structural features which define them, and we identified the side chains

27:16.040 --> 27:22.000
of the 20 amino acids which are necessary to maintain life.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.080
We talked about the Miller experiment, and how it can be used to create amino acids,

27:27.080 --> 27:34.480
a biologically, though at best it can produce racemic mixtures or achiral amino acids.

27:34.480 --> 27:39.200
We also covered how amino acids can be condensed together into chains of varying length joined

27:39.200 --> 27:41.360
by amide bonds.

27:41.360 --> 27:46.840
We defined the amide plane and the backbone dihedral angles, phi and psi, associated with

27:46.840 --> 27:52.440
rotation of the carbon-carbon bond at the alpha carbon.

27:52.440 --> 27:57.000
We looked at how different phi and psi angles produce backbones leading to different secondary

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
structures.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
Specifically, we looked at alpha helices and beta sheets and the network of hydrogen bonds

28:04.000 --> 28:06.200
which hold them together.

28:06.200 --> 28:10.480
We also talked about turns and how proline and glycine tend to concentrate themselves

28:10.480 --> 28:13.280
in those areas.

28:13.280 --> 28:17.600
We talked about tertiary and quaternary structures in proteins as well, and we looked at very

28:17.600 --> 28:23.320
large complexes consisting of multiple protein subunits, like the one characterized by Rod

28:23.320 --> 28:25.320
McKinnon.

28:26.320 --> 28:31.640
Finally, we addressed the issue of creating proteins in the lab, so that we can continue

28:31.640 --> 28:36.000
to study the structure and interaction of these compounds on a lab bench, with the hope

28:36.000 --> 28:43.120
that we can someday relate what we have learned to how they behave in organisms.

28:43.120 --> 28:49.240
So we finished our quick three lecture survey of large biological molecules, most of which

28:49.240 --> 28:55.160
can simply be thought of as very large organic compounds, consisting mostly of the same elements

28:55.160 --> 29:02.120
as the smaller molecules making up those classic small molecules of our science.

29:02.120 --> 29:07.800
The time has come for us to consider some new additions to organic chemistry, metals.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.720
In our next lecture, we'll move slightly away from organic chemistry's interface with

29:11.720 --> 29:17.600
molecular biology, and focus more on its connections with the chemistry of metals.

29:17.600 --> 29:22.920
We'll tackle this special class of compounds called organometallics next time, and I'll

29:22.920 --> 29:23.440
see you then.
