1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,440
So, we've seen how Friedrich Voller's synthesis of urea, from non-biological starting materials

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,600
in 1828, toppled the long-standing dogma known as vitalism, which stated that only organisms

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,400
could produce the molecules of life.

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,240
Now, as the 1800s pressed on, other notable chemists advanced this idea by putting it

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,920
into practice.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,560
Justice von Liebig demonstrated the role of abiological nitrogen in plant fertilization,

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,920
and he also extracted and manipulated carbohydrates under controlled laboratory conditions.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,480
Miescher had isolated DNA from the nuclei of cells, and as a century drew to a close,

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,080
Alexander Butlerov and Hermann Emile Fischer both managed to synthesize carbohydrates and

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,520
other biologically relevant compounds in their laboratories, also without the help of living

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,020
organisms.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,800
So, by the end of the 1800s, organic chemists were beginning to get a hold on exactly how

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,200
to produce, characterize, and even manipulate the chemicals of life abiologically.

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
One could argue that today we have successfully, if not yet completely, dissected life all

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,520
the way down to the molecular level.

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,560
We can take molecules out of living systems and use them in vitro.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,680
We can synthesize compounds like carbohydrates, RNA, and DNA in labs, and insert them back

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,120
into living systems to show that they function exactly as one would predict for their biologically

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,120
synthesized equivalents.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,960
But there remains one great burning question, which is unanswered to this day.

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,160
If all of these molecules of life are truly devoid of any vital essence, shouldn't we

22
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,720
be able to use those synthetic compounds not just to sustain or manipulate existing life,

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,360
but to create life itself?

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,760
Now, life on Earth must have originated by some accidental, abiological synthesis of

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,480
some of the compounds necessary to achieve life.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,920
But what were those compounds, and how did they come to be with no living organism or

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,520
human scientist around to create them?

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,680
It's an intriguing question, and one which is difficult to answer considering that it

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,320
took place at least 2.7 billion years ago, and nobody was around to see it happen.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,280
Was it DNA, RNA, maybe carbohydrates, or amino acids?

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,360
And whatever these seminal biomolecules were, how did they come together in a way which

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,840
allowed them to cross that critical barrier of simply existing to self-replication, allowing

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,440
them to reproduce, grow, and eventually evolve?

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,480
So scientists started on a new quest, not one to learn how biomolecules function, per

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,560
say, but rather how they came to be in the first place.

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,320
And two of these researchers were Harold Urie and Stanley Miller.

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,080
Miller was a student of Urie in the 1950s.

38
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,440
Now, already a Nobel laureate at the time, Urie had developed an interest in the origin

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,760
of life and had asked if it were possible for simple, vital organic compounds to form

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,160
under the reducing, stormy conditions of the Earth's early atmosphere.

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,440
Miller had just arrived at the University of Chicago as a graduate student and was slated

42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
to work on a project aimed at understanding the synthesis of elements in the furnaces

43
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,800
of stars.

44
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,400
But Miller found himself inspired by Urie's interest in the origin of life and asked for

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,240
permission to try a different experiment.

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,160
Come to imitate the conditions of the primordial Earth and probe the resulting material for

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,160
signs of biologically relevant molecules.

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,880
Urie agreed, and Miller went straight to work, designing a system which simulated the early

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,480
Earth's atmosphere and closed conditions on a lab bench.

50
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,520
The conditions on the Earth some three billion years ago were very different from those today.

51
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,840
Balkanism was rampant, oxygen was scarce, and electrical storms were commonplace.

52
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,320
So to model this, Miller devised an apparatus which enclosed water, methane, ammonia and

53
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,040
hydrogen in a sealed vessel.

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Now he allowed an electrical current to arc through that mixture for an extended period

55
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,280
of time as the water was boiled.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,120
After running his apparatus for a week, Miller tapped the circulating solution and analyzed

57
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
it.

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,360
And sure enough, when he did, he found evidence of several amino acids.

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,960
Now Miller published the results in the prestigious journal Science in 1953 under the title, A

60
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,200
Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions.

61
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,160
And remarkably, the paper is published citing Miller as the lone author.

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,000
This was done at Urie's insistence lest he received the credit for Miller's ingenious

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
experiment.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,160
So perhaps it was amino acids which were the very first biological molecules to participate

65
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,520
in life on Earth.

66
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,200
But if they were, these are some pretty small molecules, and life would need something larger,

67
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,240
more complex, to really generate diversity and get a foothold.

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,060
But amino acids are able to create these kinds of molecules by joining together into long

69
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:58,600
strands through a special linkage known as an amide bond.

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,560
During this lecture, we're going to talk about a class of materials which not only

71
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,000
make up 20% of the mass of your body, but which find use in medicine, materials, detergents

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,600
and many other functions.

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,480
Today we're going to talk about proteins, usually associated with skin, hair and muscle

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,880
fibers.

75
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,480
Proteins are really much more than that.

76
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,760
They also make up a class of catalysts which mediate every chemical reaction that your

77
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,220
body carries out.

78
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,080
But before we can develop an appreciation for these large, complex kings of catalysis,

79
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,140
we have to review their building blocks, amino acids.

80
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,800
Amino acids are so named because this class of compound always has two distinct functional

81
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
groups.

82
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Amine and an organic acid, joined together by one or more carbons.

83
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,360
The simplest possible example is an amino acid in which the amine and acid groups are

84
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,400
joined by a single CH2 group, also called a methylene group.

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,920
When only one carbon separates the functional groups, we call these alpha amino acids.

86
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,360
You can imagine that extending the chain by one more methylene creates a beta amino acid

87
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,520
and yet another insertion creates a gamma amino acid and so on.

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,600
Of course, I've drawn these compounds as completely neutral species, but each contains

89
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,840
a carboxylic acid with a pKa of about 5 and an amine whose conjugate base has a pKa of

90
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,920
about 11.

91
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,800
So a more proper way to draw these compounds might be like this, with an intramolecular

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,680
proton transfer reaction creating two regions of charge.

93
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,200
We call these species zwitterions.

94
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,320
The charged regions of these species don't interact favorably with most low polarity

95
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,620
organic solvents, so they can make dissolution in organic solvents a painful process for

96
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,620
amino acids.

97
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,160
It's a good thing that you're made mostly of the very polar solvent water, so they

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,320
dissolve in you quite readily.

99
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,000
Although there are many other ways to connect an amine group and a carboxylic acid, in today's

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,560
lecture we will keep our attention squarely focused on alpha amino acids, because this

101
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,480
class of amino acids was chosen by nature as the basis for proteins, a very special

102
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,040
set of compounds which carry out the chemistry of life.

103
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,120
So getting back to our simple alpha amino acid.

104
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,680
We commonly call this little guy glycine, it's one of the first amino acids detected

105
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,360
by Stanley Miller.

106
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,560
Now notice that glycine has two hydrogens on the alpha carbon.

107
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,520
It's this position which is modified to create a short library of 20 alpha amino acid compounds

108
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,000
which are used to produce nearly all of the proteins and enzymes that drive the chemistry

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,480
of life.

110
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,880
When something other than a hydrogen is present in one of those two positions, we refer to

111
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,240
the group replacing that hydrogen as a side chain.

112
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,320
Now there is really no side, front, back, top or bottom to a molecule of course, but

113
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,720
when we align various amino acids for the purpose of comparison, we usually line the

114
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,400
amino acid portions of the molecules up and treat the side chain as a motif branching off

115
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,920
in the same direction, hence the name.

116
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,120
Even so, we know that these bonds can twist and rotate and do not necessarily exist locked

117
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,160
in the configurations that I'm going to show you.

118
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,560
Side chains can be broken down into several classes.

119
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay, let's take a look at a few of these amino acids now.

120
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,040
We've already discussed a little bit about the simplest of all amino acids, which would

121
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
be glycine.

122
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Glycine is unusual among the amino acids because it has two of the same groups attached to

123
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,240
its central carbon or its alpha carbon.

124
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,040
So in this case, glycine is unusual because it's really unmodified, but as we begin modifying

125
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,240
one of those groups, we start to create our library.

126
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,840
Adding a methyl group creates alanine, another one of the amino acids, which was detected

127
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,080
by Stanley Miller.

128
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,080
If I continue to increase the complexity of that side chain, I can create valine, leucine

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,040
and isoleucine.

130
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:30,240
As you can see here, I've highlighted all of their side chains by sort of a grayish glow.

131
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,680
The reason I've grouped these five together is that their side chains are hydrophobic.

132
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,360
In other words, they're all made strictly of carbon and hydrogen, and so they behave as

133
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,720
though they were very low polarity arms on the molecule.

134
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,760
But that's only true for these five.

135
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,200
Let's take a look at some others.

136
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,640
Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are acidic side chains, meaning that in most physiological

137
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,920
environments, you actually see them as their conjugate bases, so they have a tendency to

138
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,600
carry negative charges.

139
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Asparagine and glutamine are two amino acids which have amide functional groups at the

140
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,000
ends of their chains, so these are specialists at hydrogen bonding to other side chains and

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,880
other molecules.

142
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:28,800
The amino acids lysine, histidine and arginine all contain slightly basic amine groups, or

143
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,840
in this case, histidine has a cyclic side chain.

144
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,200
Nonetheless, it has a nitrogen which is basic, and so all three of these can become fairly

145
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,520
easily protonated and therefore carry a positive charge.

146
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,840
So these are the basic side chains of the amino acid library.

147
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:56,360
Moving on, we have serine, threonine, cysteine and methionine, all of which contain either

148
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:03,700
an OH, an SH group known as a thiol, or a group known as a thioether, where the sulfur is

149
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,160
contained in between two carbons.

150
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,960
The reason I placed all of these together is that they all contain fairly good nucleophiles.

151
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,120
So these four are particularly good at creating covalent bonds between other molecules and

152
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,760
their own side chains.

153
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,720
Moving on, we have aromatic side chains as well, in the form of phenylalanine, tyrosine

154
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,400
and tryptophen.

155
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:39,000
All of these amino acids contain large conjugated or more accurately aromatic pi systems, which

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,200
can be used to create all sorts of different interactions that you wouldn't get otherwise

157
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,060
using, say, hydrophobics or any other amino acid for that matter.

158
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,320
And finally, we have proline, which stands alone among amino acids because of a very

159
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,440
special feature.

160
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,200
Proline's side chain actually wraps around and bonds back to the nitrogen of the amino

161
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,640
acid.

162
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,640
So proline is unusual in the sense that its side chain is locked in a cyclic conformation

163
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,260
rather than being free to move attached to an sp3 carbon.

164
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,200
So proline is going to have some very special roles in biochemistry.

165
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,400
But we're still not done characterizing these amino acids.

166
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,360
Now you probably noticed that all but glycine contained a chiral center at the alpha carbon,

167
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,520
meaning that there are two possible enantiomers of each compound.

168
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,400
Now what's remarkable is that all 19 amino acids with a chiral alpha carbon take on the

169
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,480
same stereochemistry in living systems.

170
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,080
So only one enantiomer of each amino acid is useful biologically.

171
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,280
The reason for this is twofold.

172
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,320
First, chiral RNA is responsible for sequestering and using these amino acids to build proteins.

173
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,360
So, only one handed form interacts properly with the ribosomal RNA.

174
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,880
The other reason is that many amino acids are manufactured from one another in the body.

175
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,560
In fact, only 8 of the 20 that I just showed you are absolutely essential in your diet.

176
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,320
All the others can be made in your body from other starting materials, sometimes by chemically

177
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,880
modifying some of the eight essential amino acids.

178
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,560
So why was Miller's discovery so sensational?

179
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,240
What is it about amino acids which make their presence in his primordial concoction so newsworthy?

180
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,120
Well, now that we have a firm grasp on the structure of amino acids, let's consider

181
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,760
what happens when we start putting them together via a series of condensation reactions which

182
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,040
form chains of amide bonds.

183
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,480
We call these polyamides peptides or proteins, and the distinction between the two is one

184
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,960
of size, with the former generally referring to polymers of less than a hundred condensed

185
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,720
amino acids and the latter encompassing larger molecules.

186
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,160
So let's begin with just glycine.

187
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,320
If I could condense two glycine amino acids together in an end-to-end relationship, I

188
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,400
would find that I have created a very short chain, consisting of two glycines, minus a

189
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,520
water molecule of course.

190
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,600
Now I can continue the process condensing another to make a triglycine, then another,

191
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,920
and so on for as long as I like.

192
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,480
The result will be a chain of glycine residues, and we call them residues instead of amino

193
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,400
acids since they've lost one equivalent of water when they are placed into the chain.

194
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,640
Polymers like to arrange their polyamides so that the nitrogen-containing terminus is

195
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,160
at the left, and the sequence can be read like a sentence from left to right, from end

196
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,000
terminus to C terminus.

197
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,680
Now our polyglycine peptide is pretty boring as peptides go, but remember that nature has

198
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,440
provided us with 19 more options for each position in that peptide.

199
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,280
It's this variety which leads to the stunning complexity in the possible number of sequences

200
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,880
for peptides.

201
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,680
Let's consider a protein of 100 residues, fairly short by biological standards.

202
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:39,980
This sequence has 100 positions, with 20 possibilities in each position, for 20 to the 100th power

203
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,600
number of possibilities.

204
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,840
That's roughly 10 to the 130th power, far more possibilities than there are atoms in

205
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,280
the known universe.

206
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,320
So clearly, variety is not a problem when it comes to proteins and peptides.

207
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:06,400
Now we call each unique sequence of condensed amino acids a primary structure, but the rabbit

208
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,080
hole goes much, much deeper than that.

209
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,440
You see, when amino acids condense to form an amide bond, the amine nitrogen from one

210
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,240
residue and the carbonyl from the preceding residue participate in a resonance which locks

211
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,400
a plane defined by the N, H, C, and O of the amide bond.

212
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,360
We call this small collection of atoms the amide plane.

213
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,760
But that leaves the alpha-carbon bonds free to rotate, and this gives proteins a tendency

214
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,080
to twist and collapse on themselves in very specific arrangements which maximize intramolecular

215
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,640
attractions created by backbone atoms and those side chains as well.

216
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,480
We call this process protein folding.

217
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,320
Now not only do alpha-carbon backbone bonds and side chain bonds rotate, but they tend

218
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,800
to do so in ways which form just a few specific geometries called secondary structures.

219
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,560
These structures include many different versions of essentially three basic motifs, helices,

220
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,680
strands, and turns.

221
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:27,800
So let's take a look at the most common versions of each of these now.

222
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,680
Let's start with a short polyalanine molecule.

223
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,840
Now polyalanine tends to form a secondary structure known as an alpha helix.

224
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,360
Now in this example I've created an idealized helix which is perfect in all angles and interactions.

225
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:53,000
The alpha helix is characterized by a helical pitch of 3.6 residues, meaning that one full

226
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,640
turn is completed for every 3.6 residues I move along the chain.

227
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,120
What this pitch accomplishes is to bring the amide NH of one residue into proper alignment

228
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,360
to hydrogen bond with the carbonyl four residues down the chain.

229
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,000
We can see the alpha helices in the structure of myoglobin for example.

230
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If we include all of the atoms in a molecule of myoglobin, it's very difficult to see.

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,520
But if instead we remove the side chains while leaving their effects on the structure in

232
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,960
place, we can begin to see repeating turns of quite a few helices in the protein.

233
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,320
But biochemists like to make things even prettier than organic chemists, so they like to show

234
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,320
colorful 3D ribbons to map out the backbone of a peptide or protein, making it look more

235
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
like this.

236
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,280
Now the secondary structural elements of this protein are unmistakable and they're beautiful.

237
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,880
Another common structure is the beta strand in which a peptide chain is fully extended.

238
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,960
Now causing a chain to take on an extended geometry like this might seem a bit implausible

239
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,480
at first because the driving force for the substructure only becomes clear when we align

240
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,600
two or more of them anti-parallel to one another.

241
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,360
This creates a network of NH to carbonyl hydrogen bonds in between two strands and the resulting

242
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,000
network is referred to as a beta sheet.

243
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,760
And this appears in many well characterized proteins as well.

244
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,080
A third type of motif, and incidentally one which is all but essential to make a beta sheet,

245
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
is the turn.

246
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,400
There are many potential angles which can accomplish turns in proteins and certain amino acid residues

247
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,520
seem better suited to inducing them.

248
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,920
Among others, glycine and proline are very common turn residues, but for very different

249
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,680
reasons.

250
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,120
Glycine because the lack of a side chain allows it a greater range of angles.

251
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,760
And proline because the cyclic nature of its chain restricts it to just a few angles which

252
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,560
are consistent with turns.

253
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:07,360
So it has the tendency to disrupt other patterns in chains and sheets allowing turns to begin.

254
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,360
But the structural complexity doesn't even end there.

255
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,000
Notice that each element of secondary structure in our protein packs against other secondary

256
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
structures in that protein.

257
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,720
And the interactions between the faces of these two structural elements is a stabilizing

258
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,360
factor as well and brings different portions of the sequence into proper proximity and

259
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,320
orientation for proper function.

260
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,600
We call the arrangement of secondary structural elements in space relative to one another

261
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
a protein's tertiary structure.

262
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,960
Now additionally, entire proteins can act as subunits of a single large complex such

263
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,720
as this, a voltage gated potassium ion channel characterized by Rod McKinnon in 1998.

264
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,200
This conduit is designed to span the cell membrane and create a channel through which

265
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,640
ions can flow, but it only functions when all four of its subunits are mated together

266
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,520
creating a superstructure which forms a tunnel traversing the membrane of the cell.

267
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,200
And this tunnel is lined with oxygen atoms of MI bonds from the protein's backbone.

268
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,120
This creates a negatively charged conduit which is exactly the width of a potassium

269
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
ion.

270
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,920
And these very specific primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures combine

271
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:39,000
to form a molecular device with powerful selectivity for potassium ion transport.

272
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,880
So all of these higher order elements of structure, quaternary, tertiary and secondary, are in

273
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,600
theory dictated simply by the sequence or the primary structure of a protein.

274
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,880
If we simply construct an unfolded protein for nearly any naturally occurring enzyme,

275
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,920
we often find that protein will most likely fold right back into its functional form,

276
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,000
usually with startling speed.

277
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,640
In rare instances however, the functional form of the protein is actually not the most

278
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
stable fold.

279
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,040
Proteins can become misfolded and trapped in an arrangement which will not allow them

280
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,120
to fold properly.

281
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,320
Now ordinarily it wouldn't be too alarming if a single protein in your body were to misfold.

282
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,320
After all, you have millions and millions more to help get the job done.

283
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,800
But it does get disconcerting when one misfolded protein encourages the misfolding of others,

284
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,640
producing plaques of proteins which potentially can have devastating health effects.

285
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,160
And this situation most notably happens when amyloid plaque builds in the brain of an Alzheimer's

286
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,320
disease victim.

287
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:01,560
Ok, so we clearly can benefit from understanding how protein sequence affects protein folding.

288
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,880
The next order of business is to figure out how to make samples for study.

289
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,080
Of course, biologically synthesized proteins can be produced using complex RNA machinery

290
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,840
within cells, but what do chemists do when they want to make highly purified peptides

291
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,120
and proteins in the laboratory for study?

292
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,040
Several techniques are available, including the use of special strains of E. coli bacteria

293
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,920
as manufacturing plants for proteins, as we saw in the manufacture of human insulin.

294
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,680
We saw in our DNA lecture how that genome of that very special, already genetically

295
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,800
modified E. coli was altered to encourage the bacteria to produce massive quantities

296
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,880
of that one desired protein.

297
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,400
Now this technique is startlingly effective when large proteins containing naturally

298
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,440
occurring amino acids are the target.

299
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,080
But this isn't a microbiology course, it's a chemistry course.

300
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,200
So there's a method for synthesizing even peptides and proteins with exotic side chains

301
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,320
and very interesting organic chemistry, absolutely.

302
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,680
And its developer, Bruce Merrifield, won the 1984 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his development

303
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:25,600
called Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, sometimes also called the Merrifield Synthesis.

304
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,800
Merrifield's technique starts with an insoluble polymer resin, to which is attached a single

305
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,000
amino acid.

306
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,360
The connection to the resin is made through the C-terminus and the N-terminus is available

307
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,880
for reaction.

308
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,000
Now Merrifield then turned to a classic technique for making amide bonds, called an active ester

309
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,080
coupling.

310
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:53,040
By mixing amino acids with a special reagent, which turns them into very electrophilic esters,

311
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,320
the exposed amine of the growing chain can be enticed to attack the carbonyl of an amino

312
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,440
acid in solution.

313
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,560
Of course, this is a problem when the amino acids in solution have amine groups of their

314
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,160
own.

315
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,320
If unchecked, the growing peptides will extend in an uncontrolled fashion.

316
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,320
So Merrifield applied a special protecting group to the N-terminus of the amino acids

317
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,920
prior to reacting them with the growing peptide on the resin.

318
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:29,880
Now Merrifield used a group called a T-butoxy carbonyl motif.

319
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,360
When attached to an amide, this N-terminal protecting group prevents more than one amino

320
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,200
acid from attaching to any given growing peptide in a single reaction step.

321
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,760
The excess reagent could then be washed away from the resin, and the N-terminal protecting

322
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,440
groups removed from the on-resin peptide before introducing the next coupling reagent.

323
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,520
In this way, Merrifield was able to produce peptides in sufficient yield and purity to

324
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,680
be used in lab experimentation.

325
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,080
So let's review what we've covered.

326
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,600
We've discussed amino acids, most extensively alpha amino acids.

327
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,040
We looked at the structural features which define them, and we identified the side chains

328
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,000
of the 20 amino acids which are necessary to maintain life.

329
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,080
We talked about the Miller experiment, and how it can be used to create amino acids,

330
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:34,480
a biologically, though at best it can produce racemic mixtures or achiral amino acids.

331
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,200
We also covered how amino acids can be condensed together into chains of varying length joined

332
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
by amide bonds.

333
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,840
We defined the amide plane and the backbone dihedral angles, phi and psi, associated with

334
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,440
rotation of the carbon-carbon bond at the alpha carbon.

335
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,000
We looked at how different phi and psi angles produce backbones leading to different secondary

336
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
structures.

337
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Specifically, we looked at alpha helices and beta sheets and the network of hydrogen bonds

338
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,200
which hold them together.

339
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,480
We also talked about turns and how proline and glycine tend to concentrate themselves

340
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,280
in those areas.

341
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,600
We talked about tertiary and quaternary structures in proteins as well, and we looked at very

342
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,320
large complexes consisting of multiple protein subunits, like the one characterized by Rod

343
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
McKinnon.

344
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,640
Finally, we addressed the issue of creating proteins in the lab, so that we can continue

345
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,000
to study the structure and interaction of these compounds on a lab bench, with the hope

346
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,120
that we can someday relate what we have learned to how they behave in organisms.

347
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,240
So we finished our quick three lecture survey of large biological molecules, most of which

348
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,160
can simply be thought of as very large organic compounds, consisting mostly of the same elements

349
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:02,120
as the smaller molecules making up those classic small molecules of our science.

350
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,800
The time has come for us to consider some new additions to organic chemistry, metals.

351
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,720
In our next lecture, we'll move slightly away from organic chemistry's interface with

352
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,600
molecular biology, and focus more on its connections with the chemistry of metals.

353
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,920
We'll tackle this special class of compounds called organometallics next time, and I'll

354
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,440
see you then.
