1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,520
In today's health-conscious world, we often see the terms saturated and unsaturated used

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,120
in reference to fats, which are part of our diets.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,400
Most of us are familiar with the general idea that saturated fats tend to be solid at room

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,520
temperature, compared to unsaturated fats, which commonly exist in the liquid form.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,440
In our lecture on alkenes and alkynes, we discussed how these terms are used by chemists

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,440
to describe the presence and number of pi bonds in hydrocarbons.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,360
Saturated hydrocarbons contain no pi bonds at all, while unsaturated hydrocarbons do,

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,120
sometimes one, sometimes more.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,120
In the case of fats, we're using these terms in exactly the same way.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,560
They also refer to the presence and number of pi bonds, but this time they're on the

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,680
hydrocarbon tails of fat molecules.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,720
The kind of fat molecules I'm referring to look something like this.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,120
Now this would be an example of a triacylglyceride, or a fat consisting of three long hydrocarbon

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,480
tails, which are coming off of a motif that we call glycerol motif, or a triacyl motif.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,240
But we don't really want to look at that right now, so we're more interested in the

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,880
chains on the fats.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,240
Now in this animal fat product here, you'll notice that all of the hydrocarbons within

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,280
the tail, all three of them, consist entirely of sp3 carbons.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,200
But if I bring up a similar triacylglyceride, or fat, but one that you might find in a plant

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,280
product, what you should immediately notice is that the tails in the hydrocarbons are

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,400
no longer saturated.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,620
They contain pi bonds, and those pi bonds cause the chains to kink and move outward in

23
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,160
different directions instead of packing together nicely as they do in the saturated version.

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,340
So this is our explanation of how and why vegetable oils tend to be liquids, whereas

25
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,620
animal products tend to be solids.

26
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,900
So most of us know that medical science has determined that saturated fats are far less

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,740
healthy for human consumption than their unsaturated counterparts.

28
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,180
But what you may not know is that the scientific world's very first foray into the chemistry

29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,380
of this type of compound was actually a crusade to find ways to convert unsaturated fats into

30
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,940
their saturated counterparts.

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,620
Yeah, that's right.

32
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,060
In the early decades of the 1900s, a great deal of chemistry was developed, and even

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,260
a Nobel Prize awarded for techniques which are used to turn healthy plant oils into artery-clogging

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,060
saturated fats by removing the double bonds in favor of additional bonded hydrogens.

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,400
In short, any reaction which converts unsaturated carbons, or those in SP, or SP2 hybridization

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,780
states, into saturated carbons, or those in SP3 hybridization states, is referred to

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,640
as an addition reaction.

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,260
This class of reaction represents the third permutation in our trifecta of simple organic

39
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,900
reactions.

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,180
And today we're going to take a look at several examples of this class of reactions, including

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,980
the now infamous, but often necessary, process of hydrogenating oils to change their chemical

42
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,220
properties.

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,940
So far we've covered substitution and elimination.

44
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,260
Substitutions can be simply described as molecules exchanging groups, like the exchange

45
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,060
of chloride for a hydroxyl group.

46
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,820
Elimination can be described as a decomposition in which a molecule loses some attached groups

47
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,620
to become less saturated, like the conversion of ethyl chloride into ethylene.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,820
Today, we're going to complete that trifecta of fundamental organic reactions by discussing

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:58,980
that third possibility, adding new groups to unsaturated molecules by sacrificing pi bonds.

50
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,420
This is what we call addition.

51
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,420
So addition reactions involve the replacement of a pi bond with new sigma bonds to new substrates.

52
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,060
And this means that these reactions tend to be entropically disfavored.

53
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,380
They create fewer molecules than they consume.

54
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,100
But from an enthalpy standpoint, they're usually favored, since the newly created sigma bonds

55
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,980
are lower in energy and therefore more stable than the pi bonds in the starting materials.

56
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,780
So let's begin by considering the reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons, those alkenes

57
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,420
and alkynes that we looked at earlier in the course.

58
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,620
The presence of a pi bond gives them an ability, unique among those compounds we've investigated

59
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,060
so far, to act as nucleophiles themselves instead of as a substrate.

60
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,180
They use their pi electrons to attack electrophilic species.

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,260
So let's consider what happens when an alkene, like propene, attacks a generic electrophile.

62
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,820
Since we're concerned with the behavior of the alkene itself, for now I'm just going

63
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,780
to use a letter E to represent that electrophile.

64
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,860
Now our propene molecule sees an opportunity to convert its pi bond electrons into more

65
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,300
stable sigma bonding electrons by attacking that electrophile.

66
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,740
But doing so means that the resulting species must take on a positive charge and become

67
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,420
a carbocation.

68
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,220
So the tables have turned now.

69
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,500
The original nucleophile is now an electrophile.

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,900
The adjacent carbon is electron deficient, positively charged and ready to be attacked

71
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,300
itself by anything nucleophilic enough to do so.

72
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,900
So you may notice I've been deliberately vague about exactly what this electrophilic

73
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,060
intermediate looks like.

74
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,860
And this is because unlike substitution and elimination reactions, even some of the most

75
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,380
elementary addition reactions can proceed through a wide variety of transition states

76
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,820
and intermediates owing to the complex structure of that transition state that's produced

77
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,580
during the process.

78
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,020
Today we're going to be investigating a few of these mechanisms in an attempt to understand

79
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,700
some of the more fundamental addition reactions of organic chemistry.

80
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,980
Now before his epic clash with Zetsev over the regiochemistry of elimination reactions,

81
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,140
Markovnikov had already made a name for himself by publishing his famous rule governing the

82
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,260
regiochemistry of addition reactions.

83
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,820
These addition reactions can be used to produce alkyl halides from alkenes.

84
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,580
And we call this class of reactions hydrohalogenation because the reaction involves adding a molecule

85
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,020
of HCl or HBr across a double bond.

86
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,780
You see, even though he was never quite certain exactly how it happened, Markovnikov was able

87
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,460
to demonstrate that any time an alkene with sp2 carbons of differing substitution, like

88
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,660
our propene, was reacted with a hydrogen halide, like this hydrochloric acid.

89
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:10,460
The newly added halogen is always added preferentially to the more substituted carbon of the alkene,

90
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,700
and consequently the hydrogen would end up on the less substituted carbon.

91
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,180
So let's take a look at Markovnikov's rule in action and see if we can mechanistically

92
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,820
explain exactly how and why this happens.

93
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,300
It took about 30 years and the proposal of the carbocation structure to finally bring

94
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,740
it all into focus.

95
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,620
So here's the reaction that we've been discussing so far today.

96
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,820
We have a molecule of propene with a double bond, and it's going to react with a molecule

97
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,740
of hydrochloric acid.

98
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,700
I've highlighted the hydrogen from the hydrochloric acid, so it's easy to follow it through the

99
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,500
reaction and not confuse it with the other hydrogens from the propene molecule.

100
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,060
So we have this set of pi electrons that's willing to act as a nucleophile, and it's

101
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:01,580
going to attack, obviously, the most electrophilic site on our acid, the proton.

102
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,860
When this happens, there are actually two different ways that this proton can attach

103
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,900
itself to the propene molecule.

104
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,280
In the first, we have the proton from the hydrochloric acid attaching itself at the end

105
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,500
of the molecule, creating our secondary carbocation, and in the other possibility, it attaches itself

106
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,740
here to the secondary carbon, creating a primary carbocation.

107
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,340
So we've got two potential intermediate states here, in which our hydrogen from the hydrochloric

108
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,180
acid is in a different position on the carbocation.

109
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,940
Now in the top example, my carbocation is attacked by the resulting chloride from the

110
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:47,100
initial process, creating a molecule of 2-chloropropane.

111
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,820
But in my second example, the reactive site is now on the primary carbon, and that would

112
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,820
generate 1-chloropropane.

113
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,420
And we already know from our discussions about alkyl halides in the carbocation they can

114
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,100
produce that the secondary carbocation is far more stable than the primary carbocation.

115
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,860
Markovnikov simply made this observation that the products are consistent with this.

116
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,540
So when we have a more substituted alkyl halide forming, as is the case here with our secondary

117
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,900
product, we call it the Markovnikov addition product.

118
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Whereas if it ends up at the less substituted carbon of the original double bond, we call

119
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,020
this an anti-Markovnikov.

120
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,420
And Markovnikov's rule simply states that the major product will be the one of greater

121
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,660
substitution.

122
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,180
So there's some evidence for this that we've managed to collect over the years as organic

123
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,780
chemists, not the least of which is the fact that we can't make a chiral product using

124
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,620
this type of reaction.

125
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,580
And the reason is, as follows.

126
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,780
I have my attack on my hydrogen from my hydrochloric acid just as before.

127
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,980
But in this case, the substrate I've used has a more substituted carbon, which contains

128
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:07,100
three different groups, a methyl group represented by Me, an ethyl group represented by Et, and

129
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,540
what would be over here a three-carbon group, which is eventually going to be propyl.

130
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,620
So when my addition reaction takes place, I produce my carbocation intermediate, which

131
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,220
is planar at this location.

132
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,340
And that means that the chloride nucleophile can attack either from the top of my molecule

133
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,060
or from the bottom.

134
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,700
And there's nothing in particular stopping it from coming in from either direction.

135
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,340
The result of this is that we make a perfectly equal mixture of the R and S enantiomers of

136
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
the products.

137
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,300
We call this a racemic mixture.

138
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,380
And it's the presence of these racemic products in reactions like this that gives us some

139
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,740
evidence for carbocation formation.

140
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,860
Now additionally, this mechanism is supported by the fact that we see rearrangements in

141
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,380
hydrohalogenations of alkenes.

142
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,060
Now an example of a reaction in which this might happen is the reaction of 3-methyl-1

143
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,140
butene with hydrochloric acid.

144
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,180
So again, I'm going to conduct my reaction just as we discussed previously.

145
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,420
My alkene will attack the hydrogen from the HCl, creating my new nucleophile in the form

146
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,020
of chloride ion.

147
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:28,500
Now when this happens, I have that magic recipe of a secondary carbocation adjacent to a tertiary

148
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,860
center on the molecule.

149
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,700
So this is a perfectly primed carbocation to undergo what we would call a hydride shift.

150
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,900
So I've labeled the shifting hydride here in orange and I've introduced it into my line

151
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,900
angle formula below so that we can track it through the shift.

152
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,100
So as the shift takes place, my carbocation increases in substitution from secondary to

153
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,540
now tertiary and that tertiary carbocation is what's attacked by the chloride ion to

154
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,020
complete the reaction.

155
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,180
So the fact that I generate a tertiary alkyl halide here in this reaction, instead of the

156
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,300
expected secondary alkyl halide, tells me that I'm probably going through a carbocation

157
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,860
since they're so, so very prone to rearranging like this.

158
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,820
So one might wonder how a rule governing such a small subset of reactions led to such great

159
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,380
fame for Markovnikov.

160
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,580
But the truth is that although his rules originally were focused on the addition of hydrogen halides

161
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,180
like hydrochloric acid, they're remarkably consistent when applied to many, many more

162
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,860
reactions, some of which we'll investigate in future lectures.

163
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,140
So from time to time, you'll hear me refer to addition reactions as being Markovnikov

164
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:50,180
or Antimarkovnikov, just as I'll be referring to eliminations as Zetsev or Antizetsev, sometimes

165
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,460
called Hoffman.

166
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,860
Now very similar chemistry takes place in the case of hydrohalogenation of alkynes.

167
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,540
They can be hydrohalogenated either once or twice.

168
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,600
The major difference here is that to complete the first addition requires the formation

169
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,100
of a vinyl cation.

170
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,140
Now the word vinyl actually comes from the Latin for wine and it's sort of a tie to

171
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,460
the ethanol molecule because they both have two carbons.

172
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,340
Now it's difficult to say if this is really how the reaction proceeds, but what's undeniable

173
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:28,460
is that it proceeds much more slowly than does the hydrohalogenation of an alkene.

174
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,540
Nonetheless, it can be achieved, creating what we call a vinyl halide in accordance with

175
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,420
Markovnikov's rule.

176
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,900
Of course, in the presence of excess hydrogen halide, this is a little consequence to us

177
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,460
because any stereochemistry that's introduced in the form of ENZ isomers will be wiped out

178
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,700
when the carbocation forms in the second hydrohalogenation step.

179
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,620
When this takes place, Markovnikov's rule holds yet again.

180
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,500
But even in situations involving equally substituted sp2 carbons, the halogen will end up on the

181
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,140
same carbon atom as its predecessor.

182
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,100
This is because the attached halogen atom stabilizes the carbocation by resonance on

183
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,700
its way to becoming what we call a geminal dihalide.

184
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,940
Now geminal is a word meaning twins and it implies that those two halogens are on the

185
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,540
same carbon.

186
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:30,100
The alternate possibility would be called a visceral dihalide from the word for neighbor.

187
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,300
That indicates the halogen atoms are on adjacent carbons, but this doesn't happen in this type

188
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,420
of reaction.

189
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,460
So how might one go about making that visceral dihalide?

190
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,580
Well, another commonly used addition reaction is the addition of molecular chlorine or bromine

191
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,380
to alkenes.

192
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,140
Unlike radical halogenation of alkenes, we don't have to resort to extremes like photoactivated

193
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,620
radical chemistry to halogenate these alkenes and alkynes.

194
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,380
This reaction is typically accomplished simply using molecular halogens like chlorine or

195
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,540
bromine.

196
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,260
And we do this in a non-nucleophilic solvent like dichloromethane to try to discourage

197
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,420
any outside or unexpected reactions from taking place.

198
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:21,420
In the case of a halogenation of an alkene, we actually have a very unusual intermediate

199
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,700
which forms.

200
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,820
So in order to show you this first, I'm going to run a reaction between chlorine gas depicted

201
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:34,620
here as my green diatomic molecule and a very familiar molecule from class ethene.

202
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,580
It's going to proceed through something called a chloronium intermediate and a chloride ion

203
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,380
will attack my chloronium intermediate to complete the reaction.

204
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,620
So let's watch this reaction take place.

205
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,220
Now we're used to seeing ethene drawn like this in sort of a plan view where I'm looking

206
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,180
down on all of the atoms in the plane of the page.

207
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,780
But to show you this reaction properly, I'm going to have to turn that molecule 90 degrees

208
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,540
and look at it end on.

209
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,340
When I do this, the reactive position of a chlorine might be something like this.

210
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,420
So remember, there's a double bond here.

211
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,260
The second bond is sort of obscured by the rotation, but it's still there.

212
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,460
And that means that it can attack my chlorine gas molecule.

213
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,420
And you probably are already ready to stop me here and say, wait a minute, Professor Davis,

214
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,020
you just told me that this is a nucleophile attacking an electrophile, but I don't see

215
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,340
any dipole here.

216
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,860
I see two equal atoms of equal electronegativity.

217
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,380
You'd be right about that.

218
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,540
But you've got to remember that halogens have very large electron clouds and are very polarizable.

219
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,900
So as the alkene attacks one of these two chlorine atoms, the electrons can run away

220
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:47,620
to the other side, inducing a dipole and ultimately breaking the bond between the two chlorine

221
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,820
atoms.

222
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,780
When this takes place, I create something called a chloronium ion.

223
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:00,180
Now unlike a carbocation, a chloronium ion has a cyclic structure consisting of three

224
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,260
atoms, the two original carbons from the alkene and one of the chlorines from the original

225
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,660
chlorine molecule.

226
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,700
And the bonds I've shown you here are sort of partially formed.

227
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,940
They're not really a very excellent representation of how it looks, but it's the best that we

228
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,740
can do while drawing these on a page.

229
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,980
But what is true is that the chlorine that's part of the chloronium ion is sitting on top

230
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,220
of what used to be the double bond.

231
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,500
It's not really, hasn't been claimed really by either one of these two carbons.

232
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,780
And because it sits directly in the middle and because it's so large, it sterically

233
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,580
obstructs the nucleuride ion from attacking from the same side.

234
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,140
So the only way that this chloride ion can get around and reach these electrophilic carbons

235
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,380
is to move to the other side of the molecule.

236
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,740
At this point, attack can occur and one of those bonds holding the cyclic chloronium

237
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,780
ion together will break.

238
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,940
So I'll end up with a visceral dihalide in this case.

239
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,300
Not only that, but my visceral dihalide is the product of what we call an anti-addition,

240
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,980
meaning that the two new bonds are made from opposing sides rather than from the same side

241
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,540
of that alkene.

242
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,500
So the consequences of this anti-addition become more important when we consider halogenation

243
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,740
using more complex alkenes, like 3,4-dimethyl-3-heptene.

244
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,140
Since the starting material is planar, the chloronium ion, of course, can form from either

245
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,460
side.

246
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,380
But once a chloronium ion is formed, only the opposing side can be attacked by the chloride

247
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,060
ion to complete the reaction, leading to a mixture of enantiomers.

248
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:46,220
So halogenation of the Z-isomer of my starting material will produce a set of enantiomers

249
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,900
in the RR and SS form.

250
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,860
But these products are distinct from that produced when I halogenate the E-isomer, which

251
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,420
would be the SR and RS products.

252
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,460
Now, alkenes can undergo halogenation in similar reactions.

253
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,900
First forming an alkene with two halogens, transferred to one another because of the

254
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,020
anti-addition, followed by a second halogenation to form a tetrahalogenated alkane.

255
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,220
Now, when the product of a single halogenation is desired, carefully controlling the amount

256
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,500
of halogen added is all that's required.

257
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,260
So adding just one molar equivalent of halogen will produce that one-two dihaloalkene, almost

258
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,340
exclusively.

259
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,380
And this works because the resulting dihalogenated alkene has two electronegative halogen atoms

260
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,220
attached, withdrawing electron density from the pi bond, making it less nucleophilic,

261
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,660
and therefore much less reactive than the alkyne starting material.

262
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,380
So we don't expect the second halogenation addition to take place until all the starting

263
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,100
alkene has been consumed.

264
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,660
This means that I could, for example, produce trans-2,3-di-chloro-2-butene from 2-butyne

265
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,860
simply by carefully adding exactly one molar equivalent of chlorine to the alkyne starting

266
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,380
material.

267
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,980
In the 1890s, an American chemist named James F. Boyce Sr. developed a method for processing

268
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,500
cottonseed oil into a material of greater viscosity, more suitable for use in soap and

269
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,100
food products.

270
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,180
He discovered that the addition of a small amount of nickel to the mixture facilitated

271
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,900
the addition of hydrogen molecules to form this new product, and it changed the properties

272
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,660
in a favorable way.

273
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,740
Now this work was also picked up by a renowned French chemist named Paul Sabatier.

274
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,820
He refined this process into the catalytic hydrogenation which earned him a Nobel Prize

275
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,780
and today bears his name.

276
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,860
You see what Boyce and Sabatier were after was a process which would convert less saturated,

277
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:12,260
less expensive, plant oils into molecules more closely resembling animal fats.

278
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,500
This is because animal fats have a higher degree of saturation, making them solids near

279
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,220
room temperature and increasing their shelf life.

280
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,700
Now because animal fats are more expensive, converting a cheaper source, like vegetable

281
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,420
oils, into a similar material was just good business.

282
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,500
Their success in this endeavor led to the production of partially hydrogenated vegetable

283
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,540
oils which we're so accustomed to seeing listed on the back of food packages even today.

284
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,180
The double bonds of hydrocarbons can be saturated using molecular hydrogen at pretty reasonable

285
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,300
temperatures and pressures, achievable even in Sabatier's day.

286
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
But there's one important catch to this.

287
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,260
The reaction is painfully slow.

288
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,900
So Boyce and Sabatier realized that the solution to this problem was the use of a catalyst

289
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,740
to weaken the bond in the hydrogen molecules, thereby promoting the reaction without the

290
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,940
need for excessive temperatures.

291
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,660
Fortunately, such catalysts exist.

292
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,020
Unfortunately, these catalysts are very rare and expensive metals like platinum and palladium.

293
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,020
And Sabatier's method uses heterogeneous catalysis, meaning the catalyst itself is

294
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,100
a solid while the reagents are liquid or gas phase.

295
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,460
And even though the metal catalyst is not consumed in the reaction, a massive precious

296
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,980
metal would cost a great deal of money only to have a small exposed surface area onto

297
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,340
which that chemistry can take place.

298
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,380
This potentially prohibitive cost issue is often circumvented by producing a catalyst

299
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,660
not as a pure metal material but as a thin veneer of precious metal adhered to a highly

300
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,740
porous carbon support.

301
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,100
This tremendously increases the amount of surface area which can be generated per gram

302
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,460
of metal, making this process much more cost effective.

303
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,500
So let's take a look at this catalytic hydrogenation in action.

304
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,140
What I have here is a very simple hydrogenation reaction in which I'm going to attach a hydrogen,

305
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:25,460
which is represented here by the small molecule, to again our very familiar ethene alkene molecule.

306
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,180
And I've indicated that I'll be doing this using a catalyst, which is consisting of platinum

307
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,380
metal adhered to a carbon support.

308
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,540
And when the reaction takes place, of course my product, which I hope to make, is ethane

309
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,940
gas.

310
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,700
So I've depicted my catalyst as simply a bar down here.

311
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,500
Of course it would really be an array of exposed precious metal atoms.

312
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,340
And to that I'm going to add my hydrogen and my alkene.

313
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,540
But just as before when we did our halogenation, I have to turn my alkene so that we can see

314
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,420
it in the reactive orientation.

315
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,140
As it approaches the surface of the catalyst, the hydrogen is first separated into separate

316
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,460
hydrogen atoms.

317
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,300
So we've already succeeded in weakening the bond between the two hydrogens.

318
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,780
My alkene comes in from the side and new bonds are formed to the activated hydrogen atoms

319
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,300
at the catalyst surface.

320
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,220
Once hydrogenation is complete, you can see the molecule detaches itself and moves back

321
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,140
away into either the liquid or gas phase.

322
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,220
Now the catch to this, of course, is we can only add the hydrogens from the same side

323
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,620
of the alkene, meaning that this particular process proceeds as a syn addition.

324
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Syn meaning the same side of the alkene is modified.

325
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,940
So in situations where we have reactions which may produce stereoisomers, meaning when these

326
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,580
carbons here have different substituents, we have a potential for a different kind of

327
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,860
product to form, one which is either a particular diastereomer or a particular enantiomer.

328
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,580
So in the case of asymmetrical alkenes, this means the reaction is diastereoselective.

329
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:14,900
An example of this is catalytic hydrogenation of E3-4-dimethyl-3-octene.

330
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,780
This reaction produces the RR and SS pair of stereoisomers.

331
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,460
Now the catalytic hydrogenation of the Z-stereoisomer, the same starting material, would lead to

332
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,260
the RS and SR stereoisomers.

333
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:36,380
So in this case, my choice of starting material is very important.

334
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,620
Now hydrogenation of alkenes is yet another versatile set of reactions.

335
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,940
And this process was developed by Sabatier.

336
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:49,300
It's quite effective for the complete hydrogenation of an alkyne all the way to an alkane.

337
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:57,820
But it's difficult, if not impossible, to halt the reaction at the intermediate alkene.

338
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:04,140
This challenge was of particular interest to a Swiss chemist named Herbert Lindlar.

339
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,180
Lindlar was working for a German pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-Laroche in 1952 when he published

340
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:17,700
work on a selective catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes stopping at the alkene stage.

341
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:24,100
Now what Lindlar did was he took the usual catalyst of the day, platinum and palladium.

342
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,440
But he used a technique known as poisoning, in which he deliberately added non-reactive

343
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,500
material to the catalyst to sort of cut down on its activity towards this particular reaction.

344
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,660
And the result of his effort was a catalyst which is strong enough to promote the addition

345
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:47,380
of hydrogen to an alkyne, but not strong enough to do so to an alkene.

346
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:52,500
So you'll notice in this reaction I've added hydrogen to acetylene, but I've also included

347
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,540
Lindlar catalyst rather than a pure veneer of that precious metal that catalyzes the

348
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
reaction.

349
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Let's see what happens.

350
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,300
My hydrogen moves to the surface and again is activated.

351
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,860
Now when my alkyne comes in, it reacts with those hydrogens at the surface, which means

352
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:18,060
that the addition is going to always take place with syn-stereochemistry.

353
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:26,220
So Lindlar had achieved a syn addition of hydrogen to an alkyne stopping at the alkene stage.

354
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,460
So in the case of forming ethene, that's not very impressive because there really aren't

355
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,880
any stereoisomers to speak up.

356
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,220
But imagine if we were to do this reaction with an internal alkyne rather than a terminal

357
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,180
alkyne or acetylene.

358
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,900
Simplest example of this would be the reaction of hydrogen with 2-butyne, which has its triple

359
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,700
bond internally placed.

360
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:58,180
When I react this with Lindlar catalyst, I produce a specific stereoisomer of the 2-butene

361
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,740
product.

362
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,780
And the reason for this is, as we've already said, the hydrogen is going to come in and

363
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,700
become activated at the catalyst surface.

364
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,620
From there, it will react with our alkyne molecule, which then detaches from the surface.

365
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,180
And because the Lindlar catalyst is poisoned, it can't go any further.

366
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:24,500
So as you can see here, my syn addition has created the cis-isomer.

367
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,500
But what if the trans or e-isomer were the intended product of our synthesis?

368
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,820
Lindlar's catalyst would not achieve the correct stereochemistry because the mechanism is inherent

369
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,500
to the reaction that has a syn addition of hydrogen.

370
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,180
So in this case, we have to turn to more drastic methods, like what we call the metal ammonia

371
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,900
reduction technique.

372
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,500
In this method, a strong reducing agent like sodium metal is used to convert the alkyne

373
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,780
into a radical anion.

374
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:03,140
These anions preferentially form in a trans configuration because of sterics.

375
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,180
So after abstracting a proton from an ammonia molecule, the resulting vinyl radical repeats

376
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,540
this process of reduction and protonation and ultimately leads to a trans product.

377
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:23,620
So this would be our solution for turning our internal alkynes into trans alkenes.

378
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,300
So let's review what we've learned today.

379
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,460
We've worked our way through the basics of how addition reactions occur.

380
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:37,100
We saw how pi bonds are traded for more stable sigma bonds at the cost of reduced entropy.

381
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,440
We discussed the mechanism of hydrohalogenation of alkenes and alkynes.

382
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,060
We saw how Markovnikov's rule governs their regiochemistry, predicting that the halogen

383
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:52,220
will take its place at the more substituted carbon of the alkene starting material.

384
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,980
We also noted that proceeding through a carbocation intermediate makes these kinds of reactions

385
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,380
prone to rearrangements.

386
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,320
We also saw how hydrohalogenation of alkenes leads to alkyl halides and hydrohalogenation

387
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,660
of alkynes can produce vinyl halides or geminal dye halides depending on how much of that

388
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,820
hydrogen halide we've added.

389
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Next, we investigated halogenation reactions in which alkenes react via a cyclic-halonium

390
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:31,040
intermediate on their way to an anti-addition producing vissinal dye halides.

391
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:39,220
We also saw how an analogous reaction with alkynes leads to a trans-dihalogenated alkene

392
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:45,540
or to a tetrahalide in a 1-1-2-2 configuration, meaning that we have two halogens on each

393
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,040
adjacent carbon.

394
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,160
We talked about how Boyce and Sabatier discovered that the addition of certain metal catalysts

395
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,840
to alkenes in the presence of hydrogen gas leads to a sin-hydrogenation of their double

396
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,480
bonds, developing a chemistry which is used to modify oils and fats to produce food additives

397
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,520
to this day.

398
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:13,360
Of course, this method also works to completely saturate alkynes as well.

399
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,100
We also looked into the methods used to halt hydrogenation of alkynes at the alkene stage.

400
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,340
Specifically, catalytic hydrogenation with Linn-Lars catalysts to form cis-alkenes and

401
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,060
the metal-ammonia reduction reaction, which leads to trans-alkenes.

402
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,340
So with this, we've completed our tour of the three general classes of reactions most

403
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:43,300
often encountered in organic chemistry, substitution, elimination, and addition.

404
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,160
We managed to do this for the most part using just hydrocarbons and alkyl halides as reaction

405
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,000
substrates, but that's all about to change.

406
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,080
These three key types of reactions are not limited to the small library of molecules

407
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,600
that we've used so far.

408
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,480
Now that we have a command of a few of the most basic mechanisms by which reactions take

409
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,920
place, a vast library of functional groups and motifs containing other atoms awaits.

410
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,740
This time, we'll begin to expand this library by considering the role of oxygen in organic

411
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
chemistry.

412
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,620
I'll see you then.
