00:00.000 --> 00:16.560
Last time, we discussed Fritz Haber's quest to find a way to turn essentially unreactive

00:16.560 --> 00:19.800
nitrogen from the air into ammonia.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.760
But because our discussion was limited only to compounds of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen,

00:24.760 --> 00:29.160
I stopped sort of explaining exactly what it was that Haber intended to do with this

00:29.160 --> 00:30.160
ammonia.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.560
You see, it wasn't simply ammonia that Haber was ultimately after.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.160
He was trying to fuel a war machine, and a war machine needs artillery.

00:40.160 --> 00:46.600
Now, you've probably heard of gun-cotton, nitroglycerin, dynamite, and TNT.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.640
But what you may not have been aware of is that they all contain very similar organic

00:50.640 --> 00:56.960
motifs, which combine both nitrogen and oxygen with organics to form compounds of extremely

00:56.960 --> 00:59.160
high reactivity.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.680
Today, we will take a look at these and other materials which contain both nitrogen and

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
oxygen.

01:05.680 --> 01:11.560
Now, long before Haber's day, it was known that a material commonly called saltpeter,

01:11.560 --> 01:16.480
known by chemists as potassium nitrate, was a naturally occurring mineral resource and

01:16.480 --> 01:21.160
a crucial ingredient in the manufacture of gunpowder.

01:21.160 --> 01:25.760
As early as the first century AD, the Chinese had discovered that saltpeter had medicinal

01:25.760 --> 01:30.280
properties, and that it could be used to treat heart and circulatory ailments.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.880
It was much later discovered that saltpeter decomposes in the body to form a substance

01:33.880 --> 01:39.200
known as nitric oxide, which is the source of this therapeutic value.

01:39.200 --> 01:44.520
Evidence from the 8th century AD indicates that by then, far eastern cultures had repurposed

01:44.520 --> 01:49.880
saltpeter, using it in combination with sulfur and charcoal to create what is known today

01:49.880 --> 01:53.760
as gunpowder.

01:53.760 --> 01:58.400
Other civilizations independently made this discovery at different times in history,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.680
and the exact year of its introduction to Europe is unclear.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.960
But what is clear, however, is that by the 17th century, saltpeter was so valued for

02:06.960 --> 02:13.520
this application that in England there existed a government post known as saltpeter.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.440
Those charged with this post were given carte blanche authority to dig anywhere in the kingdom,

02:18.440 --> 02:23.000
even through the floors of homes in search of this commodity.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.200
All they needed was a shovel and a hunch.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.160
By the 20th century, the ridiculous degree of authority given to these pedermen had long

02:32.160 --> 02:37.160
faded in England, but usable nitrogen was still being dug up elsewhere by ambitious

02:37.160 --> 02:40.880
European and American entrepreneurs.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.440
Saltpeter from as far away as the Atacama Desert of South America was being mined and

02:45.440 --> 02:50.880
shipped back to Europe and the Americas as a source of fixed nitrogen.

02:50.880 --> 02:57.000
But in the early 1900s, Haber's process made ammonia abundant, low-cost, and best of all

02:57.000 --> 03:02.920
prepared on-site in a factory from readily available materials and catalysts.

03:02.920 --> 03:07.280
All that needed to be done was to convert the ammonia into its oxidized form, like that

03:07.280 --> 03:08.840
found in saltpeter.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.560
All we had to do to do this was burn it in oxygen.

03:12.560 --> 03:17.480
So the nitrogen oxides produced from this can be hydrated to form nitric acid, the crucial

03:17.480 --> 03:23.520
ingredient in the formation of many modern explosives.

03:23.520 --> 03:28.400
So today we'll discuss a few functional groups which contain both nitrogen and oxygen.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.440
We'll see how different combinations of these elements lead to some of the most reactive

03:31.440 --> 03:36.360
substances known to man, and also to some of the motifs essential to the function of

03:36.360 --> 03:38.360
life as we know it.

03:38.360 --> 03:48.600
So let's get started.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.840
So Haber's contribution was the starting material for the synthesis of, among other

03:52.840 --> 03:55.640
things, nitric acid.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.840
This is accomplished with relative ease.

03:58.840 --> 04:03.640
Oxidation of the ammonia to nitrogen oxides like NO2 is carried out, and after this, bubbling

04:03.640 --> 04:09.120
the nitric oxide gases through water produces nitric acid.

04:09.120 --> 04:13.720
The importance of nitric acid in the field of explosives was realized much earlier than

04:13.720 --> 04:15.760
Haber's time.

04:15.760 --> 04:22.080
One day in 1846, according to legend, German Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schoenbein

04:22.080 --> 04:26.840
spilled a bit of nitric acid on a table where he was working.

04:26.840 --> 04:32.800
After wiping up the spill with a cotton apron, he hung the apron on a stove door to dry.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.980
After drying, the apron suddenly and vigorously burst into flames.

04:37.980 --> 04:42.560
One can only imagine what went through Schoenbein's head at that exact moment.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.600
But after extinguishing the fire and carefully considering what had happened, Schoenbein

04:46.600 --> 04:52.160
realized that it was the combination of nitric acid and the carbohydrate fibers in his apron

04:52.160 --> 04:57.600
which had led to the formation of the explosive material.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.640
We'll closely look at the structure of carbohydrates in a few lectures, but for now I want you

05:01.640 --> 05:03.680
to focus on this.

05:03.680 --> 05:10.040
These very interesting functional groups decorating this long polymer, it's the colorful nitrogen

05:10.040 --> 05:11.520
and oxygen containing groups there.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.880
They're quite different than anything we've seen so far, aren't they?

05:14.880 --> 05:20.040
Now, these functional groups are called nitrate esters, and they aren't present in the naturally

05:20.040 --> 05:22.800
occurring plant fibers.

05:22.800 --> 05:27.280
You may notice that the arrangement of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the nitrate ester groups

05:27.400 --> 05:33.520
makes it impossible to draw a resonance contributor in which all atoms have zero charge.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.880
This makes these groups very unstable.

05:36.880 --> 05:41.160
Add the fact that all the oxygen needed for combustion is already present in the nitrate

05:41.160 --> 05:48.160
ester group, and you have one very explosive substance.

05:48.160 --> 05:55.160
Now, this is a very exciting time for me in the course.

05:55.160 --> 06:01.160
We've already discussed the accomplishments and stories of about a half-dozen Nobel laureates,

06:01.160 --> 06:04.160
and before we're done, we're going to meet many more.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.160
In this lecture, however, the nitrate ester gives me the perfect segue into the story

06:09.160 --> 06:14.160
of the man who founded the prize himself, Alfred Nobel.

06:14.160 --> 06:20.160
You see, Nobel's story is one of a very explosive compound called nitroglycerin.

06:20.160 --> 06:25.160
It can be made from glycerin, which is easily obtained from the soap-making process.

06:25.160 --> 06:32.160
Now, it was originally synthesized by a man named Ascanio Sobrero, and Sobrero realized

06:32.160 --> 06:38.160
that he could take glycerin and react it with nitric acid, three equivalents to be exact,

06:38.160 --> 06:44.160
and that when he did this, the OH groups of the glycerin would be replaced by a new functional group,

06:44.160 --> 06:46.160
these nitrate esters.

06:46.160 --> 06:52.160
So our nitrates come in, displacing water, and creating nitroglycerin.

06:52.160 --> 06:56.160
Now, Sobrero realized immediately how dangerous nitroglycerin could be,

06:56.160 --> 07:00.160
and in fact, even after he created it and had published about it,

07:00.160 --> 07:05.160
he continued to lobby against its use in mining and war applications.

07:05.160 --> 07:09.160
And Sobrero's unwillingness to advance this particular compound in those applications

07:09.160 --> 07:15.160
left an opening for another very opportunistic individual, Alfred Nobel.

07:15.160 --> 07:21.160
Nobel was a contemporary of Sobrero who took up the mantle of finding a way to stabilize nitroglycerin enough

07:21.160 --> 07:25.160
to use it as an explosive for those applications.

07:25.160 --> 07:30.160
He discovered that by adding a little bit of sawdust that he could stabilize the nitroglycerin long enough

07:30.160 --> 07:34.160
and well enough to form it into sticks, he could then develop blasting caps

07:34.160 --> 07:38.160
and other methods of detonating these sticks of dynamite.

07:38.160 --> 07:42.160
And of course, this made him a great deal of money.

07:42.160 --> 07:47.160
See, Nobel realized the addition of that adsorbent like sawdust had a stabilizing effect,

07:47.160 --> 07:50.160
and the adsorbent nitroglycerin could be wrapped in paper,

07:50.160 --> 07:55.160
formed into sticks, and triggered with some of Nobel's other inventions.

07:55.160 --> 08:00.160
So his invention made the packaging and transport of this high explosive simple and safer,

08:00.160 --> 08:05.160
leading to its rapid adoption worldwide in mining and military applications.

08:05.160 --> 08:11.160
So the invention of dynamite seemed to be Nobel's inevitable legacy.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.160
Having secured the U.S. patent for his dynamite invention,

08:14.160 --> 08:18.160
Nobel had become extremely wealthy as a result of this product.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.160
And in 1895, Nobel officially changed the name of the company

08:22.160 --> 08:27.160
and in 1895, Nobel officially changed his will for the last time,

08:27.160 --> 08:32.160
designating nearly all of his massive estate to establish a prize

08:32.160 --> 08:36.160
to be conferred upon those who, as Nobel himself put it,

08:36.160 --> 08:42.160
during the preceding year shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.

08:42.160 --> 08:48.160
Nobel's endowment hasn't only survived but thrived for over the past century.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.160
This come to represent the pinnacle of human achievement in not only the sciences,

08:52.160 --> 08:56.160
but in medicine, literature, and economics as well.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.160
A somewhat more stable functional group containing both nitrogen and oxygen

09:08.160 --> 09:11.160
is the nitrate functional group.

09:11.160 --> 09:16.160
Compounds containing this group are collectively referred to as nitro compounds.

09:16.160 --> 09:21.160
Probably the most famous nitro compound is TNT, or Trinitrotoluene.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.160
And we will take a look at this and how its compounds like it

09:24.160 --> 09:28.160
are made in our electrophilic aromatic substitution lecture.

09:28.160 --> 09:32.160
But for today, we'll concern ourselves with some simpler aliphatic nitrates

09:32.160 --> 09:35.160
and how they react.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.160
Most commercially relevant nitro compounds are synthesized

09:38.160 --> 09:44.160
by reacting small hydrocarbons with nitric acid at very high temperatures.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.160
This reaction is complex, proceeding through radicals

09:47.160 --> 09:50.160
and usually producing mixtures of nitrated compounds.

09:50.160 --> 09:57.160
But these compounds are of such great value that we frequently overlook this inefficiency.

09:57.160 --> 10:01.160
One particularly useful application of the nitro group in synthesis

10:01.160 --> 10:05.160
is that it can be used as a sort of non-nucleophilic placeholder

10:05.160 --> 10:08.160
for the nucleophilic amine functional group.

10:08.160 --> 10:12.160
This can significantly uncomplicate a synthesis.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.160
Now, at the end of a synthesis, the nitro group can be converted into an amine

10:16.160 --> 10:19.160
simply using familiar hydrogen and metal catalyst chemistry

10:19.160 --> 10:24.160
that was developed by Sabatier.

10:24.160 --> 10:30.160
A classic example of this technique is in the synthesis of Novocaine.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.160
So let's start with the molecule Novocaine

10:32.160 --> 10:34.160
and apply a retro-synthetic analysis to it

10:34.160 --> 10:39.160
and see if we can design a technique for synthesizing it.

10:39.160 --> 10:44.160
Now, I can make Novocaine using a compound called aminobenzoyl chloride

10:44.160 --> 10:47.160
and the appropriate nucleophile.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.160
Now, the aminobenzoyl chloride I've shown here

10:50.160 --> 10:53.160
can be prepared from a compound called aminobenzoyl acid

10:53.160 --> 10:55.160
which is readily available commercially

10:55.160 --> 10:58.160
and is probably on the shelf in the laboratory right now.

10:58.160 --> 11:01.160
So my retro-synthetic analysis looks pretty good so far,

11:01.160 --> 11:04.160
but let's run our analysis forward

11:04.160 --> 11:07.160
and see if it really gives us what we think we're going to get.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.160
The first step of my proposed synthesis involves the nucleophilic attack

11:10.160 --> 11:15.160
of the OH from aminobenzoyl acid on vinyl chloride.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.160
This reaction should lead to my intermediate

11:18.160 --> 11:23.160
which I can then expose to another nucleophile to diethyl-aminoethanol

11:23.160 --> 11:26.160
which will give me my product, right?

11:26.160 --> 11:28.160
Well, not quite.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.160
There's an unfortunate caveat here

11:30.160 --> 11:32.160
and that is that the amine that I'm hoping will tag along

11:32.160 --> 11:35.160
is actually potentially reactive as well.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.160
Remember, NH2 can be a nucleophile.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.160
It has a lone pair of electrons.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.160
So this step of my synthetic analysis was faulty.

11:43.160 --> 11:48.160
But I have the tool I need to get around this problem now.

11:48.160 --> 11:52.160
I can take my proposed synthesis and modify it in one very simple way.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.160
Instead of using the NH2 or amine group,

11:55.160 --> 11:58.160
I'm going to use an O2 or nitrate

11:58.160 --> 12:01.160
which is completely non-nucleophilic.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.160
So having replaced those with my nitrates,

12:04.160 --> 12:08.160
I can now rest assured that that promiscuous reaction will not occur.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.160
And at the end of my synthesis,

12:10.160 --> 12:14.160
I can simply use rainy nickel to conduct a reduction

12:14.160 --> 12:19.160
thereby changing that nitrate into the amine group I originally wanted.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.160
So it's acted as a placeholder through the entire synthesis

12:22.160 --> 12:24.160
at the end of which I finally make my modification,

12:24.160 --> 12:26.160
giving me the desired product.

12:26.160 --> 12:30.160
So this would be a successful synthesis of Novocaine.

12:35.160 --> 12:41.160
Now, so far today we've looked at nitrate esters and nitrates,

12:41.160 --> 12:44.160
both of which contain nitrogen-oxygen bonds,

12:44.160 --> 12:49.160
and not so coincidentally both of which can be used to make high explosives.

12:49.160 --> 12:52.160
But there are other organics which contain both of these elements joined,

12:52.160 --> 12:56.160
not directly to one another, but through one or more carbons.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.160
And when we make this very subtle structural change,

13:00.160 --> 13:03.160
we find ourselves making molecules which have a very different

13:03.160 --> 13:05.160
but equally versatile chemistry

13:05.160 --> 13:09.160
and can be used safely and reliably in organic synthesis.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.160
When a carboxylic acid motif is connected to an amine group

13:12.160 --> 13:15.160
via at least one intervening carbon,

13:15.160 --> 13:19.160
we call the resulting molecule an amino acid.

13:19.160 --> 13:23.160
Amino acids will be the star of the show in our lecture on proteins,

13:23.160 --> 13:26.160
where we will consider their biological role.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.160
But since they meet the criterion for this lecture as well,

13:28.160 --> 13:30.160
having both oxygen and nitrogen,

13:30.160 --> 13:33.160
I thought we would give them a little bit of attention here.

13:36.160 --> 13:41.160
Amino acids combine an acidic carboxylic acid group with a basic amine group.

13:41.160 --> 13:45.160
And so they're often found in a state in which the acid is deprotonated,

13:45.160 --> 13:47.160
but the amine is protonated.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.160
We call species like this,

13:49.160 --> 13:52.160
ones with a positive and negative charge in separate regions,

13:52.160 --> 13:54.160
zwitter ions.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.160
The most famous group of amino acids are, of course,

13:58.160 --> 14:02.160
the 20 amino acids used by your body and all other living systems

14:02.160 --> 14:06.160
to produce proteins and enzymes which moderate our biochemistry.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.160
Notice that all of them share a common amino acid motif,

14:10.160 --> 14:14.160
one in which the two groups are separated by one carbon,

14:14.160 --> 14:17.160
and we call these alpha-amino acids.

14:19.160 --> 14:24.160
But amino acids can have more than one carbon separating their acid-base groups.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.160
Two carbons in between produces a beta-amino acid,

14:28.160 --> 14:32.160
and three carbons leads to a gamma-amino acid,

14:32.160 --> 14:36.160
the simplest of which is gamma-amino-butyric acid.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.160
Now, this is a powerful neurotransmitter

14:39.160 --> 14:42.160
and an integral part of your central nervous system.

14:42.160 --> 14:48.160
Gamma-amino-butyric acid often abbreviated GABA plays a role in neurotransmission

14:48.160 --> 14:51.160
by activating a very large protein complex

14:51.160 --> 14:55.160
which allows chloride ions to cross neuronal cell walls.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.160
So when GABA binds to this protein complex,

14:59.160 --> 15:03.160
it allows the flow of chloride ions which reduces the chance of neurons firing,

15:03.160 --> 15:06.160
and so it has a sedative effect.

15:08.160 --> 15:11.160
This natural biological effect is also part of the mechanism of action

15:11.160 --> 15:13.160
of a number of sedatives and hallucinogens,

15:13.160 --> 15:17.160
like the muskimol found in certain types of wild mushrooms.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.160
See, muskimol imitates GABA in the brain,

15:21.160 --> 15:27.160
over-activating the GABA receptor proteins, causing an exaggerated state of sedation.

15:27.160 --> 15:31.160
So in this case, the extract of your mushroom is acting just like the neurotransmitter

15:31.160 --> 15:33.160
that you naturally produce.

15:41.160 --> 15:45.160
Yet another pervasive motif in organic chemistry containing oxygen and nitrogen

15:45.160 --> 15:47.160
is the amide functional group.

15:47.160 --> 15:52.160
And you may think of an amide as a carboxylic acid or ester with an sp3 nitrogen

15:52.160 --> 15:54.160
rather than an sp3 oxygen.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.160
The lower electronegativity of the amide nitrogen

15:57.160 --> 16:00.160
means that they're significantly less acidic than organic acids,

16:00.160 --> 16:06.160
having a pKa somewhere around 25 compared to 5 for a typical organic acid.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.160
Primary amides have an NH2 group

16:11.160 --> 16:15.160
and can be synthesized from carboxylic acids by reaction with ammonia gas.

16:15.160 --> 16:20.160
In this case, a favorable proton transfer forms carboxylate and ammonium,

16:20.160 --> 16:25.160
which are heated to drive off water as a byproduct of the amide bond formation.

16:25.160 --> 16:29.160
It's this condensation reaction which forms our primary amide.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.160
Primary amides are named using the R group prefix,

16:35.160 --> 16:38.160
followed by an amide suffix.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.160
For example, this two-carbon primary amide is called ethanamine.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.160
Just as carboxylic acids are similar to esters,

16:47.160 --> 16:51.160
varying only by replacement of the acidic hydrogen with an R group.

16:51.160 --> 16:56.160
So primary amides can be changed into secondary and tertiary amides,

16:56.160 --> 17:00.160
in which one or both hydrogens are substituted with an R group as well.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.160
When there are R groups present,

17:04.160 --> 17:08.160
we name them as substituents of the parent primary amide.

17:08.160 --> 17:13.160
For example, this is N-methylethanamine,

17:13.160 --> 17:17.160
and this is NN-dimethylethanamine.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.160
You may see these names shortened by dropping the N designation

17:21.160 --> 17:25.160
and simply calling them methylethanamide and dimethylethanamide.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.160
Amides are a very interesting motif in and of themselves,

17:30.160 --> 17:33.160
as we'll see when we cover proteins and peptides in a few lectures.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.160
But for now, let's take a look at a few reactions

17:36.160 --> 17:40.160
in which amides can be converted into some other familiar functional groups.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.160
In addition to being a biologically relevant structural motif,

17:50.160 --> 17:55.160
amides give us a useful alternative to the direct amination route to create amines.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.160
You'll recall that amines can be synthesized easily

17:59.160 --> 18:03.160
in the R groups of alkyl chloride substrate, our primary or secondary.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.160
But an SN2 reaction is essentially impossible

18:06.160 --> 18:10.160
when the alkyl halide substrate is tertiary.

18:10.160 --> 18:14.160
So we're left wondering how we might create something like t-butylamine,

18:14.160 --> 18:18.160
in which the amine nitrogen is attached to a tertiary carbon.

18:19.160 --> 18:24.160
If we were to try to do a direct amination of t-butyl bromide or t-butyl chloride,

18:24.160 --> 18:28.160
we expect a preponderance of the elimination product to form

18:28.160 --> 18:30.160
if anything forms at all.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.160
One solution to this problem is the Hoffman rearrangement

18:35.160 --> 18:39.160
named for German chemist August Wilhelm von Hoffman.

18:40.160 --> 18:45.160
Now Hoffman discovered that primary amides could be converted into amines

18:45.160 --> 18:48.160
by reaction with a molecular halogen like chlorine or bromine

18:48.160 --> 18:52.160
and an aqueous base like sodium hydroxide solution.

18:53.160 --> 18:57.160
This reaction works even if the adjacent carbon is tertiary.

18:58.160 --> 19:02.160
So let's go through this reaction using t-butyl amide, molecular bromine,

19:02.160 --> 19:05.160
and aqueous sodium hydroxide.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.160
Under these conditions, just a small amount of the amide is deprotonated,

19:09.160 --> 19:14.160
forming a nucleophilic species which attacks the bromine molecule.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.160
So you can already see the important difference here.

19:17.160 --> 19:20.160
The R groups are already attached to the nucleophile,

19:20.160 --> 19:24.160
not the substrate, in the initiating event of the reaction.

19:25.160 --> 19:31.160
This process forms an N-bromo amide, which is deprotonated a second time.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.160
Now this is where the magic happens.

19:33.160 --> 19:38.160
The bromide group is displaced from the amide nitrogen in an alkyl shift.

19:38.160 --> 19:43.160
This effectively reverses the carbon and nitrogen ordering in the chain,

19:43.160 --> 19:46.160
creating what we call an isocyanate.

19:48.160 --> 19:52.160
Hydroxide ion then catalyzes the conversion of isocyanate

19:52.160 --> 19:55.160
to a motif known as a carbamic acid.

19:56.160 --> 20:01.160
Carbamic acid is essentially just a carboxylic acid bonded directly to a nitrogen rather than a carbon.

20:02.160 --> 20:07.160
And carbamic acids have a strong tendency to decarboxylate under basic conditions,

20:07.160 --> 20:09.160
leading to an amine.

20:09.160 --> 20:16.160
So we've used the Hoffman rearrangement starting with t-butyl amide to produce t-butyl amine.

20:23.160 --> 20:28.160
Perhaps the most interesting chemistry involving amides is they're used to link together dimers

20:28.160 --> 20:32.160
and short oligomers, meaning a short chain of a few subunits,

20:32.160 --> 20:37.160
of amino acids to form some consumer goods with which you might be very familiar.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.160
Let's look at one right now.

20:39.160 --> 20:43.160
This is a molecule of the artificial sweetener aspartame.

20:43.160 --> 20:49.160
Aspartame consists of essentially three subunits linked by hydrolyzable bonds.

20:50.160 --> 20:54.160
One of them is an amide bond indicated here.

20:54.160 --> 20:58.160
The other linkage is actually an ester bond formed here.

20:59.160 --> 21:05.160
So if we take a look at the aspartame molecule as a whole and then break it down into these three subunits,

21:05.160 --> 21:09.160
we see that we have essentially what is a condensed methanol,

21:09.160 --> 21:12.160
a condensed amino acid phenylalanine,

21:12.160 --> 21:16.160
and aspartic acid, another amino acid.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.160
So what this means is that when you ingest or consume aspartame,

21:21.160 --> 21:24.160
this is the molecule that gives you the sweet taste.

21:24.160 --> 21:29.160
But what happens to it once it's past your lips and tongue and into your digestive system?

21:29.160 --> 21:33.160
Well, when it reaches your digestive system, and particularly your bloodstream,

21:33.160 --> 21:40.160
it's exposed to a great deal of water and enzymes from your liver which break it down.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.160
Your body recognizes that this molecule isn't natural,

21:43.160 --> 21:46.160
that it's a foreign compound that needs to be removed.

21:46.160 --> 21:51.160
And it does this using water to hydrolyze the two connective bonds.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.160
When it does this, we get three different species.

21:54.160 --> 21:59.160
An aspartic acid, a phenylalanine, and a methanol.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.160
Now there's always some discussion about that methanol

22:05.160 --> 22:07.160
because there's always a few folks who wonder,

22:07.160 --> 22:10.160
does that methanol constitute a danger to my health?

22:10.160 --> 22:13.160
After all, if I eat our drink aspartame,

22:13.160 --> 22:16.160
and it hydrolyzes and becomes, at least in part, methanol,

22:16.160 --> 22:21.160
am I not leaving myself open to potentially developing blindness?

22:21.160 --> 22:24.160
Well, the answer lies in quantity.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.160
So let's look at an aspartame molecule one more time.

22:28.160 --> 22:32.160
Aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than sugar.

22:32.160 --> 22:36.160
Now that means that in order to make a soda, that's a diet soda,

22:36.160 --> 22:39.160
as sweet as its non-diet alternative,

22:39.160 --> 22:42.160
we've got to use only about 200 milligrams of aspartame.

22:42.160 --> 22:46.160
That's enough to make your soda as sweet as 40 grams of sugar.

22:46.160 --> 22:49.160
That's about 10 teaspoons.

22:49.160 --> 22:54.160
So let's take some water and hydrolyze 200 milligrams of aspartame

22:54.160 --> 22:56.160
and see if the content of your diet soda

22:56.160 --> 22:59.160
is enough to generate a worrisome amount of methanol.

22:59.160 --> 23:04.160
All right, our hydrolysis reaction takes place.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.160
And when we run our calculation,

23:06.160 --> 23:08.160
what we find is that 200 milligrams of aspartame

23:08.160 --> 23:12.160
is only enough to make about 90 milligrams of aspartic acid,

23:12.160 --> 23:15.160
112 milligrams of phenylalanine,

23:15.160 --> 23:18.160
and 22 milligrams of methanol.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.160
Now if you're one of just a few percent of the population

23:21.160 --> 23:25.160
who has a condition which allows you or doesn't allow you

23:25.160 --> 23:29.160
to metabolize phenylalanine properly, you may have an issue.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.160
We call this condition phenylketonuria.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.160
But if you're like everyone else and can actually metabolize this,

23:35.160 --> 23:38.160
then your only real health concern is the methanol,

23:38.160 --> 23:41.160
and you get 22 milligrams per soda.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.160
So to put that much methanol into perspective,

23:44.160 --> 23:47.160
let's take a look at some other stuff that we might put into our bodies.

23:47.160 --> 23:51.160
It turns out that your diet soda actually has less methanol,

23:51.160 --> 23:54.160
or produces less methanol in your bloodstream,

23:54.160 --> 23:57.160
than grape juice, wine, or tomato juice.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.160
Depending on storage conditions, it can be considerably more.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.160
And yet, those of us who love to eat tomatoes

24:03.160 --> 24:05.160
don't seem to have any problems with our vision.

24:05.160 --> 24:10.160
So the diet soda being bad for your vision is actually a myth.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.160
It simply doesn't produce enough methanol to be toxic.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.160
So let's review today's lecture.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.160
Today we took a look at some slightly more complex functional groups,

24:22.160 --> 24:25.160
involving both nitrogen and oxygen.

24:25.160 --> 24:29.160
We started with nitrate esters, a very unstable functional group

24:29.160 --> 24:33.160
which can be produced by reacting nitric acid with alcohols.

24:33.160 --> 24:37.160
We saw how materials from cotton fibers to glycerin,

24:37.160 --> 24:39.160
collected during soap making,

24:39.160 --> 24:44.160
can be turned into highly flammable and even explosive material by this reaction.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.160
We also explored nitro compounds,

24:48.160 --> 24:50.160
most notably trinitrotoluene,

24:50.160 --> 24:53.160
which is another widely used explosive material.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.160
But nitro groups themselves are not nearly as unstable

24:56.160 --> 24:58.160
as their nitroester counterparts,

24:58.160 --> 25:02.160
and so many stable examples of these compounds can be prepared

25:02.160 --> 25:07.160
and reduced to amines using hydrogen gas and metal catalysts.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.160
We took a quick look at amino acids,

25:09.160 --> 25:13.160
in which amine and carboxyl functionalities are on the same molecule

25:13.160 --> 25:15.160
but are isolated from one another,

25:15.160 --> 25:19.160
producing molecules which can undergo an intramolecular proton transfer

25:19.160 --> 25:22.160
to form what's known as a zwitterion.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.160
We saw how the amide functional group can be prepared

25:25.160 --> 25:28.160
by heating a carboxylic acid in the presence of ammonia,

25:28.160 --> 25:32.160
driving off water to push the reaction forward.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.160
Starting from this structural motif,

25:34.160 --> 25:40.160
Hoffman was able to devise a strategy to form primary amines with substantial branching,

25:40.160 --> 25:45.160
a feat which cannot be accomplished by the direct amination of alkyl halides.

25:46.160 --> 25:50.160
Finally, we saw how amino acids can be joined together through an amide bond,

25:50.160 --> 25:54.160
like that in the popular artificial sweetener aspartame,

25:54.160 --> 25:58.160
and how the acid hydrolysis of this amide bond can spell trouble

25:58.160 --> 26:03.160
for phenyl ketoneurics who can't properly metabolize and remove the resulting phenylalanine,

26:03.160 --> 26:08.160
but is highly unlikely to cause vision problems in the general population.

26:10.160 --> 26:15.160
We've reached the end of our five lecture series on functional groups containing nitrogen and oxygen,

26:15.160 --> 26:19.160
but our study of molecular structure isn't yet over.

26:19.160 --> 26:24.160
Over the next three lectures, we're going to bring back an old friend, alkenes.

26:24.160 --> 26:28.160
But this time, we'll be considering what happens when entire systems of double bonds

26:28.160 --> 26:32.160
are linked together to form some very special molecules.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.160
I'll see you then.
