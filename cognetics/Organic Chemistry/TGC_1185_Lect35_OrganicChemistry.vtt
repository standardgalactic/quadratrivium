00:00.000 --> 00:18.040
Last time, we investigated the phenomenon of partitioning and how it can be exploited

00:18.040 --> 00:24.000
to separate compounds based on their relative affinities for two distinct chemical environments.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Specifically, we looked at liquid-liquid systems and solid-liquid systems.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
In this lecture, we're going to explore one of the most powerful separation techniques ever developed,

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
one which, when properly applied, allows us to isolate almost anything we can imagine.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
It's also a bit near and dear to my heart because I spent two and a half years of my life

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
chained to a lab bench analyzing pharmaceutical products with one of these techniques.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Now, you might say that in that way, it was chromatography which inspired me to return to school for my PhD.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Our brief look at chromatography starts with its inventor, Mikhail Tsvet.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Tsvet was educated in Switzerland, where he received his PhD in 1896.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
Shortly after this, however, he found himself in Russia, facing a similar fate to that of Zitsev,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
whose foreign credential had nearly marginalized him in the Russian system.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Tsvet's non-Russian credential was not recognized by the National Establishment,

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
prompting him to undertake a second PhD program to become a functional scientist in the Russian system.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
I can only imagine the sinking feeling he must have had when he first realized

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
that he would have to earn his PhD all over again.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
In retrospect, however, it may have been the single greatest thing that ever happened to him,

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
since it was the topic of his second PhD which earned him immortality in the science of separation.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
You see, Tsvet became interested in self-physiology during his first PhD program,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
and he wanted to continue working with natural plant products,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
trying to understand the chemistry which drives their unique biology.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
It was during experiments with the ubiquitous plant pigment chlorophyll

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
that he made the observation which would forever change his life and the science of separations.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Tsvet knew that isolated chlorophyll could be easily dissolved in an organic solvent known as petroleum ether.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Yet, when he attempted to extract the pigments from the leaves of plants,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
he noted that it was very difficult to dissolve in the same solvent.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Even after grinding and tearing the leaves to expose more surface area and break open cells,

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
the distinctive dark green pigment simply wouldn't cooperate.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
His conclusion was that the chlorophyll pigment must be adhered to the solid plant matter

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
through intermolecular forces, reducing its solubility in the petroleum ether solvent.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Using this idea as a springboard for his research,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Tsvet tried adhering chlorophyll to different solid surfaces

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
and then washing it away with various solvents

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
by allowing those solvents to flow through the solid matrix to which he had adhered the pigment.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
He found that not only did chlorophyll migrate at different rates in different systems,

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
but also that mixtures of pigments would many times separate in space

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
because of the differing attractive forces at work between them and the two phases.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
This created an array of colors on Tsvet's column,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
prompting him to dub his new technique chromatography

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
from the Greek words meaning color and writing.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
Where Tsvet's creation really differed from simple liquid-liquid or solid-liquid extraction

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
is that he added motion to the equation.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
By allowing one of the phases to move across the other,

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
the partitioning of a solute between heterogeneous phases

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
can be used to move compounds across the stationary phase, but at varying rates.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Obviously, the more time a particular compound spends partitioned onto the mobile phase

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
or into the mobile phase, the faster it moves.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Indeed, the modern definition of chromatography is

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
a separation technique which relies on the differing affinity of a substance

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
for a stationary phase and a mobile phase.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
We can very closely duplicate the results of some of Tsvet's experiments

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
using a simple piece of chalk, some markers,

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
and a solvent that's readily available to us, like ethanol.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take that piece of chalk

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
which I've applied a little bit of some pigments from a marker,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
and I'm going to use ethanol as a mobile phase

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
to cause those dyes and pigments to migrate, but at different speeds.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
So ahead of time, I've already prepared my column, if you will,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
and as I promised, this is an experiment that's pretty easily done right in your own kitchen.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
This is nothing more than a piece of common sidewalk chalk.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
This is calcium carbonate, the exact same stationary phase

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
used by Tsvet in his original experiment.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Now on this piece of chalk, I placed bands of different colors

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
simply by touching the tip of a marker to the chalk.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
So this chalk is now my stationary phase.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
It's going to stand perfectly still throughout the experiment.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
I have a beaker here with a little bit of the solvent ethanol in it.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Now I'm using ethanol instead of petroleum ether

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
because the pigments from the markers are actually much more polar molecules

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
than the pigments that Tsvet was separating.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
So I need a little bit more polar solvent to encourage this ink to migrate.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
What I'm going to do now is place my chalk into this beaker

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
containing a very shallow pool of my mobile phase ethanol

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
and allow it to migrate up through the chalk through essentially capillary action.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
So my chalk will absorb the solvent and chromatography will take place.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
So let's start that now.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm going to very carefully balance my chalk here

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
and place a piece of aluminum foil over the top

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
in an attempt to discourage evaporation of my mobile phase

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
while separation takes place.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So if we wait for just a moment, we should already be able to see the chalk

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
is becoming darker as the solvent moves up toward the ink.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
So before long, it's going to pass over my bands of different colors

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
and begin to separate those molecules based upon chromatography.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
So our chalk has been developing for a little while

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
and even though the solvent has only run a very small distance

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
it's already very easy to see what's been going on here.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
So let's take a closer look.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
I'm going to remove my stationary phase along with the adhered pigments.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I'll move my ethanol to the side.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Now if I turn this chalk you can see very clearly

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
that different colored markers contain different colored pigments

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
and not only that but those different colored pigments have traveled different distances.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Now since calcium carbonate is a particularly polar substance

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
and ethanol is an organic solvent, I can say with relative certainty

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
for example that the yellow dye to produce the color of the yellow marker

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
contains molecules which are less polar

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
than say the compounds used in this blue dye which were used to produce the green marker.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
And I can make this sort of qualitative assessment of the polarity of the different dyes within

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
simply by looking at how they move during my chromatography experiment.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
Of course chromatography has advanced considerably over the past century.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Stationary phases like calcium carbonate and sugar from Svets experiments

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
have been replaced by a number of superior options.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
The first of these was actually paper.

08:42.000 --> 08:51.000
You see paper consists of cellulose, a long polymer consisting mostly of interconnected glucose units.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
And we already know that these glucose units have many, many hydroxyls

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
which are available to interact with polar or hydrogen bonding compounds.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Two English chemists by the name of Archer J.P. Martin and Richard Singh

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
developed a method of chromatography using paper and organic solvents

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
as stationery and mobile phases respectively.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
In 1942 they published a paper outlining this technique

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
but more importantly it discussed the fundamentals of partitioning

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
as it applied to chromatographic systems.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
This technique proved extremely useful in the identification of small organic molecules

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
including amino acids like glycine and alanine.

09:41.000 --> 09:50.000
This method was so influential that Martin and Singh received the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this concept.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Not only did these two receive the prize for their work

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
but a further validation came just a year later

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
when a young scientist named Stanley Miller used this method

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
to verify the presence of amino acids in his now famous Primitive Earth experiment.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
More recently, advances in material manufacturing

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
had made quick identifications like millers even easier and more accurate.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
For example, microporosilica can now be manufactured.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
Silica is a fantastic stationery phase because even though its formula is SiO2

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
at its surface are an array of silanol groups or SiOH motifs.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
These groups will interact well with anything of high polarity or good hydrogen bonding ability

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
and because silica can be manufactured with a tremendous amount of surface area per volume ratio

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
more compound can be separated with greater efficiency or on larger scales.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
For example, instead of the everyday paper used by Martin and Miller

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
modern organic chemistry researchers often use a thin layer chromatography plate

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
with a plastic backing and just a 200 micron thick layer of silica bound to it.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
That's just about the width of a human hair.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
But that small amount of silica has a surface area of literally hundreds of square meters

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
because the extremely small size and porosity of the silica particles

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
gives it this very, very large surface area to volume ratio.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
In the technique of thin layer chromatography, a small amount of compound to be analyzed

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
is spotted onto the plate as a solution and it's allowed to dry.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
So once that spot is dried, it's placed into a developing chamber

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
which contains a thin pool of the selected mobile phase

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
which will move up the plate in the very same way that our mobile phase moved up the chalk in our previous demonstration.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
So let's take a look at a thin layer chromatography experiment

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
just like we did our chalk experiment which simulated the work of Svet.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Now this time I'm going to put on some gloves just because I'd like to hold up for you

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
and show you what a thin layer chromatography plate actually looks like.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Now they come in many sizes and they come with many different stationary phases

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
but by far the most common uses silica and it's backed in plastic

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
so the shiny side on the back here is actually plastic on which chromatography would never happen.

12:27.000 --> 12:35.000
But this is the surface which contains the very, very thin layer of microscopic beads of silica.

12:35.000 --> 12:44.000
In fact, this jar contains loose silica, the likes of which would be adhered to the backing of the plate.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
So as you can see it's extremely fine particle size

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
and that gives it its extremely large surface area to volume ratio.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
Now I have a small developing chamber here which has alcohol in it just as before

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
and I've created a plate which I've spotted with some of the markers that we used in the previous experiment as well

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
and you're probably going to notice a market difference in their chromatographic behavior

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
because even though I'm using the same mobile phase, we're changing our stationary phase now

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
from calcium carbonate to silica, both very polar but in their own way

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
so we're going to see a drastically different separation pattern taking place.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Nonetheless, the development process is essentially the same.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm going to take my plate onto which I placed three small spots, one of green, one of orange and one of the red marker

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
and I've spotted them just as I did in my bars on the chalk stick

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
in such a way that they don't submerge beneath the thin pool of mobile phase

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
because I don't want them to dissolve into all that mobile phase.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
So I'm going to place that inside very carefully, going to cover that back up with my foil

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
to discourage any evaporation of my mobile phase

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
and fairly quickly, we should be able to see that the alcohol mobile phase is making its way up the plate once again

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
and just as before with the chalk, when it encounters the spots, they will begin to migrate at a rate

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
which is consistent with their relative affinity for the mobile and stationary phases.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
So we'll come back to this and take a look at it in just a few minutes when it's done.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
So the mobile phase has moved an appreciable distance up the plate

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
which is the stationary phase in my TLC experiment, so I'm ready to take a look now at the result.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
I'm going to remove my plate. Now if I were in the lab, I would very quickly take a pencil and mark the lane

14:45.000 --> 14:53.000
because as we'll see here briefly, over time I expect that that alcohol mobile phase will begin to evaporate

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
and it won't be quite so clear as it is now where it traveled to.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Now it's very important for me to know that because I can use the distances traveled by the spots

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
relative to that traveled by the mobile phase to get some numbers that we'll talk about in a moment.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
But first let's just take a look at the plate. So it's very obvious that the green marker actually contains some blue dye.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Now we may not have guessed that originally simply from looking at the marker itself,

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
but the chromatography plate makes this fact essentially undisputable.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
Not only that, I can say that some of that blue dye moved very well with the mobile phase

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
and therefore didn't have a terribly high affinity for the stationary phase.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
In other words, it's moving that way because it's less polar than the others.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
We can even see similar components in the red and orange markers but in slightly different proportions

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
and of course the orange having more yellow and the red having more of the darker pigments in it.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
So this is how TLC can be used to very quickly get qualitative assessments of compounds polarities and solubilities

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
in different solvents but also to give us a very quick and easy way to compare one lane to the next

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
and identify common compounds in different samples.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Now since my solvents still evaporating, I'll show you another one which I prepared earlier

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
in which the solvent has all but evaporated completely.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
And again you can see I've got basically the same result.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
Yet another very important property of this chromatography technique is that it's reproducible.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
So as long as I use the same stationary and mobile phases each time,

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
I can expect the same relative mobilities for all the spots within a given sample.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
So as the mobile phase wicks up through the plate by capillary action,

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
different compounds in our samples were moving at different rates.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
Now compounds which interact more strongly with the polar silica move to shorter distance

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
while those which interacted better with the lower polarity mobile phase move to greater distance.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
At the completion of the experiment we can measure those distances traveled by the sample spots

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
as a fraction of the distance traveled by the mobile phase.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
And we report that number as the RF value for that sample in our particular chromatographic system.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
RF stands for retention factor and it gives us a semi-quantitative way to describe simple chromatographic mobility,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
like we just saw in our experiment.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
Now thin layer chromatography may be a versatile, quick, low-cost way to observe the chromatographic mobility of a compound.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
But working with such small quantities makes collection of a meaningful sample of the compound somewhat difficult.

17:35.000 --> 17:42.000
In order to collect a sample which can be used as raw material, drug, an analytical sample, or a synthetic intermediate,

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
we need to increase the scale of the experiment.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
This is frequently done in the lab using a technique known as column chromatography.

17:52.000 --> 18:00.000
In column chromatography we abandon the thin layer of stationary phase on the backing in favor of a column.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
Now this brings the third dimension into play and this means that a 2 centimeter wide column

18:06.000 --> 18:17.000
can separate about 8,000 times as much sample as a TLC lane which is just 200 microns thick.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Now we accomplish this using a device like this.

18:20.000 --> 18:28.000
It's a glass column which contains a Teflon stopcock at the base and a stem through which we can drain mobile phase.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
I place a small bit of glass wool or some other obstruction in the neck to prevent solids from moving through,

18:35.000 --> 18:48.000
then a nice even layered bed of sand onto which I would build a column of silica again using this finely, finely powdered silica material.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
The key here is that because I'm using a column which has depth,

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
instead of that extremely thin layer of silica I'm using a very large bed of silica.

18:58.000 --> 19:07.000
In fact the bed contains about 8,000 times the volume per unit length in a column this size compared to the kind of TLC plates that we saw previously.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
So using a column I can get a larger quantity of material.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
The only real catch here comes when we try to analyze the mobility.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
We have to remember that in our previous examples the mobile phase migrated from the bottom of the column to the top.

19:22.000 --> 19:30.000
But in this case once we packed a column and add sample we'd be adding mobile phase through the top and draining through the bottom,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
meaning that all the motion is now downward.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
So there's a common point of confusion is that even though the bands may appear to be reversed from a TLC experiment,

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
they're in fact, if they are reversed, exactly what we would expect.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
Now the techniques that we've looked at in this lecture so far are just the very basic techniques taught at the introductory level,

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
though still used frequently in research labs today.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
In recent decades though chromatography has undergone a virtual explosion of advancements

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
leading to techniques involving ultramicroscopic silica particles with such small pores

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
that powerful pumps have to be used to push solvent through them at high pressures.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
We call this technique HPLC for high pressure liquid chromatography.

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
The extremely high surface area of the contents of an HPLC column allows very precise separations,

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
but it also requires a closed system consisting of a steel column to be used

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
so that it can resist the pressure applied by pumps which move the solvent.

20:37.000 --> 20:44.000
So it's impossible to load compounds in the same way as traditional chromatography since the system is sealed.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Similarly, it's impossible to see even the brightest colored compounds as they move through the system

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
because the column is encased in steel.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
Now the loading problem is solved with a device called an injection loop.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
An injection loop consists of a manifold with two separate loops made of a pressure resistant tubing.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
So when the valve handle is rotated, one loop is in line with the flowing mobile phase

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
and the other is in line with a special injection septum.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
The sample is pushed into the open loop using a syringe

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
and when the handle is turned, places the injection loop in line with the mobile phase,

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
thereby introducing the sample to the chromatographic system without ever opening it and losing pressure.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
Of course, since columns need to be packed into stainless steel cases,

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
it becomes impossible to monitor a run with my eyes even if my compounds are absorbing the visible light.

21:40.000 --> 21:49.000
So HPLC systems also have a detecting system which is usually something like a simple spectrophotometer flow cell.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
The simplest example of this is a UV visible detection system

21:53.000 --> 22:00.000
in which a specific wavelength of light is aimed so that it passes through the exiting solvent, striking a detector.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
As the sample molecules move out of the column and through the detector cell,

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
they absorb the light, leading to a reduced intensity at the detector.

22:10.000 --> 22:18.000
So if we plot the observed absorbance as a function of time starting with the injection of the sample at zero minutes,

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
we can create what's called a chromatogram or a graphical representation of the separation taking place.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
There are many more chromatographic methods available to the modern chemist.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Certainly many more than we can survey in a single lecture.

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
But no lecture on chromatography would be complete without the mention of gas chromatography, commonly referred to as GC.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
Archer J.P. Martin is the name most commonly associated with the invention of gas chromatography.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
Now, Martin is actually most famous for his invention of paper chromatography,

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
the technique used by Stanley Miller to detect the amino acids in his primordial concoction made in Harold Urie's lab.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Martin shared the 1952 Nobel Prize for that work,

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
but like most Nobel laureates, even the indisputable pinnacle of scientific honors was not enough to satisfy his curiosity.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
Martin continued to explore ways in which partitioning could be exploited to separate organic compounds faster and even more efficiently.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
It was around the time of his Nobel Prize award that he hit on another great concept.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Partitioning involves the motion of molecules from one phase to another.

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
So why confine this methodology to transitions between adhered solid states and dissolved liquid states?

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
After all, molecules move faster in gases and slowest of all in solids.

23:45.000 --> 23:53.000
So it stands to reason that molecules could switch from phase to phase much more quickly if the gas phase were somehow included in the experiment.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
So Martin wondered, could a form of chromatography be developed using liquid as the stationary phase and gas as the mobile phase?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Martin's idea proved viable.

24:05.000 --> 24:15.000
He demonstrated that separation could be accomplished with extreme speed and precision using a dense liquid phase and a gas like helium as the mobile phase.

24:16.000 --> 24:24.000
By slowly heating a column filled with a liquid stationary phase, through which a carrier gas like helium or nitrogen is flowing,

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
compounds are driven off one by one in order of decreasing volatility.

24:29.000 --> 24:39.000
His new method allowed faster separation with far less material and has become a staple technique in forensic and analytical labs all around the world.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
Using various detection methods, GC can be used to analyze practically anything that will vaporize.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
In this lecture, we explored our last topics on the science of separations.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
Specifically, we continued our investigation into partitioning,

24:57.000 --> 25:06.000
which is the equilibrium that compounds naturally establish between two distinct phases upon or based upon their relative affinity for those phases.

25:07.000 --> 25:16.000
We took a look at the work of Michael Svet, whose second PhD dissertation gave rise to the science of chromatography,

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
in which partitioning between a stationary and mobile phase leads to predictable rates of movement for compounds.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
This movement is based upon their relative affinity for the two phases.

25:28.000 --> 25:35.000
We saw how this very basic principle plays out on a piece of blackboard chalk, much like Svet's first experiment.

25:35.000 --> 25:42.000
And then again on a TLC plate, which is designed for small-scale characterizations and method development.

25:42.000 --> 25:53.000
And finally, we talked about columns, which could allow us to collect enough sample to carry our work forward and perform additional reactions or testing.

25:53.000 --> 26:02.000
Finally, we briefly mentioned some of the more powerful techniques in use today for special applications from quality testing to medical research and beyond.

26:02.000 --> 26:10.000
We looked at HPLC, which uses extremely fine silica with very small pores to generate a huge surface area,

26:10.000 --> 26:19.000
giving us better separations but requiring powerful pumps operating at thousands of pounds per square inch to keep that mobile phase moving.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
And we also saw how Archer J. P. Martin's second claim to fame, gas chromatography,

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
operates by partitioning between the liquid and gas phases rather than the traditional solid and liquid phases.

26:31.000 --> 26:41.000
And we discussed how this gives more partitioning events in a given unit of time, creating a fantastic resolution in a very short experiment.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
From recrystallization to distillation to liquid-liquid extractions and chromatography,

26:47.000 --> 26:54.000
there is truly a solution for nearly any separation problem that could possibly come up in the lab.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
We've come a long way, from atomic and molecular structure to the synthesis of organic compounds,

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
a host of identification techniques and methods used for purification.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
In the last 35 lectures, we have managed to gather an understanding of some of the most basic tenets of organic chemistry.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
But we spent most of our time looking back on the history of this complex and powerful science.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
An absolute must, if one is to gain the perspective to meaningfully look forward,

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
at the possibilities that organic chemistry holds for the future.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
So, the topic of our final lecture will be just that.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
We'll experience the joy of taking some of what we've learned from the past 35 lectures,

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
adding a dash of imagination, and trying to gaze into the future through the eyes of an organic chemist.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I'll see you there.
