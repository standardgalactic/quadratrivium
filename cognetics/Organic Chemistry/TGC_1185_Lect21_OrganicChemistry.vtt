00:00.000 --> 00:16.980
So last time we took a look at how benzene rings were first discovered, the debate over

00:16.980 --> 00:22.580
their structure, and exactly why they possessed such an unusual stability.

00:22.580 --> 00:27.740
The benzene ring is a pervasive motif in organic chemistry, not only because of its stability,

00:27.740 --> 00:34.520
but also for its complex, yet predictable and controllable reactivity.

00:34.520 --> 00:38.500
As we discussed previously, benzene is an aromatic compound.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.060
In fact, it's the structural basis for aromatic compounds, though how they got this name is

00:43.060 --> 00:47.180
something of a mystery since only some of them have strong or pleasing odors.

00:47.180 --> 00:52.260
Nonetheless, this moniker has stuck with benzene in its derivatives for nearly two centuries.

00:52.260 --> 00:57.540
Now, as an aromatic, the pi electrons in a benzene ring are not nearly as susceptible

00:57.540 --> 01:02.220
to undergoing addition reactions as their non-aromatic counterparts.

01:02.220 --> 01:06.260
We discussed how heats of hydrogenation are evidence of just how stable benzene rings

01:06.260 --> 01:13.020
really are in the face of addition reactions, which require them to sacrifice their aromaticity.

01:13.020 --> 01:15.940
But what about substitution reactions?

01:15.940 --> 01:20.540
Is it possible to entice benzene to react in such a way that one of its six-ring hydrogens

01:20.540 --> 01:25.620
can be replaced with a more complex functional group of our choosing without sacrificing

01:25.620 --> 01:27.820
its aromaticity?

01:27.820 --> 01:31.940
The answer to this question is yes, and one of the most frequently employed pathways to

01:31.940 --> 01:38.500
accomplish this is electrophilic aromatic substitution.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.580
During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the science of organic chemistry was booming

01:42.580 --> 01:45.060
in both Europe and America.

01:45.060 --> 01:49.420
Many names with which we are familiar today were hard at work during this time period,

01:49.420 --> 01:54.700
devising new ways to make and break chemical bonds in a useful fashion.

01:54.700 --> 02:00.380
One such chemist was Adolf von Beyer, who in 1873 was working at the University of Strasbourg

02:00.380 --> 02:01.380
in Germany.

02:01.380 --> 02:07.180
Now, Beyer was supervising a graduate student by the name of Othmar Zeidler, whose graduate

02:07.180 --> 02:15.100
project included the synthesis of a substituted benzene compound known as Dichlorodifenyltrichloroethane,

02:15.100 --> 02:18.620
DDT for short.

02:18.620 --> 02:24.340
Zeidler's synthesis of his compound was accomplished using chlorobenzene and chloral, under acidic

02:24.340 --> 02:26.420
conditions.

02:26.420 --> 02:32.260
Under these conditions, the two chlorobenzene rings are joined by substituting the chloral

02:32.260 --> 02:36.500
for hydrogens in the parallel location on each ring.

02:36.500 --> 02:41.860
Zeidler's synthesis in 1873 was largely viewed as an academic exercise.

02:41.860 --> 02:46.740
Neither he nor his revered mentor, Beyer, had any idea that this compound would ultimately

02:46.740 --> 02:51.380
alter the course of human history some seven decades later.

02:52.380 --> 02:57.700
See, it was only during and after World War II that the insecticidal properties of DDT

02:57.700 --> 03:03.860
were discovered and applied with breathtakingly effective results.

03:03.860 --> 03:08.620
The Swiss chemist, Paul Mueller, is credited with later discovering and documenting, and

03:08.620 --> 03:14.620
also obtaining Swiss patents for, the insecticidal use of this compound, after which the US government

03:14.620 --> 03:18.580
tested and used the compound to combat infectious diseases abroad.

03:19.300 --> 03:25.860
You see, DDT was such a powerful, broad spectrum and long-lasting insecticide that its use could

03:25.860 --> 03:31.500
eradicate entire populations of disease-carrying insects, so efficiently that the disease they

03:31.500 --> 03:35.900
carried was eliminated as well.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.740
This includes a notable quelling of a typhus outbreak in Naples in the dead of winter.

03:40.740 --> 03:45.140
Until that time, such insect-borne epidemics could only be combated by bearing down and

03:45.140 --> 03:46.980
waiting for spring.

03:47.540 --> 03:52.020
Additionally, there are many examples in which DDT was used to wipe out malaria completely

03:52.020 --> 03:55.060
in confined populations.

03:55.060 --> 03:59.780
Shortly after the conclusion of World War II, the US government began to allow commercial

03:59.780 --> 04:03.620
use of DDT for pest control and domestic crop production.

04:03.620 --> 04:09.220
Clearly, DDT had changed the world.

04:09.220 --> 04:14.100
In the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony speech for Dr. Mueller, Professor G. Fisher noted of

04:14.100 --> 04:16.740
Mueller's discovery, quoting here,

04:16.740 --> 04:22.900
At requisite insecticidal dosages, it is practically non-toxic to humans and acts in very small

04:22.900 --> 04:27.220
dosages on large number of various species of insects.

04:27.220 --> 04:33.700
Furthermore, it's cheap, easily manufactured, and exceedingly stable, unquote.

04:33.700 --> 04:38.740
Clearly, in 1948, the scientific community was riding high on the success of this newly

04:38.740 --> 04:42.740
discovered use of DDT.

04:42.740 --> 04:49.940
Unfortunately, the stability and long-lasting effects of DDT also proved to be its undoing.

04:49.940 --> 04:55.620
DDT lasted so long in the environment that it could be transmitted from insects to fish,

04:55.620 --> 05:00.660
and from fish to birds, where it had the unintended effect of inhibiting calcium production in

05:00.660 --> 05:02.340
those birds.

05:02.340 --> 05:05.700
This caused them to produce eggs with thinner shells than normal,

05:05.700 --> 05:09.700
and many bird species, most notably birds of prey like eagles,

05:09.700 --> 05:15.060
osprey and hawks, suffered tremendous population declines due to the presence of DDT in their

05:15.060 --> 05:18.420
food sources.

05:18.420 --> 05:23.620
In 1962, environmentalist and Johns Hopkins University-trained marine biologist,

05:23.620 --> 05:27.860
Rachel Carson, published the book Silent Spring.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.620
This book is considered one of the seminal works in modern environmentalism,

05:31.620 --> 05:36.580
and it spends a great deal of its time on the U.S. agricultural industry's use of DDT

05:36.580 --> 05:44.100
as a prime example of how rampant use of such compounds can lead to environmental disaster.

05:44.100 --> 05:51.060
It was only in 1972, just shy of a century after its first synthesis, and three decades

05:51.060 --> 05:56.420
since its implementation as an insecticide, that the U.S. banned the use of DDT in agricultural

05:56.420 --> 05:58.100
applications.

05:58.100 --> 06:06.020
Today, it only finds use in emergencies as a vector control agent to prevent the spread of disease.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.260
So why am I telling you this story?

06:08.260 --> 06:12.660
Well, because it's a shining example of how organic chemistry can change the world,

06:12.660 --> 06:15.940
both for the better and for the worse.

06:15.940 --> 06:22.420
The synthesis of DDT is also a shining example of an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction,

06:22.420 --> 06:26.340
the topic of today's lesson.

06:26.340 --> 06:30.420
Today, we will build on our understanding of the structure of benzene by investigating this

06:30.420 --> 06:32.820
very useful class of reactions.

06:32.820 --> 06:36.340
We'll investigate the general mechanism by which it takes place.

06:36.340 --> 06:40.580
We'll discuss how other reagents often need to be activated to make them reactive enough

06:40.580 --> 06:45.780
to entice the substantially stabilized benzene ring to react with them.

06:45.780 --> 06:50.260
We'll learn about just a handful of the many modifications that we can make to benzene.

06:50.260 --> 06:54.900
And finally, we'll consider how already modified benzene's can be further modified to produce

06:54.900 --> 07:00.580
some of those orthometa and paraisomers that we talked about last time.

07:00.660 --> 07:06.420
Electrophilic aromatic substitution is so named because the newly attached motif starts out as

07:06.420 --> 07:13.140
an electrophile, unlike nucleophilic substitution in which the newly added group is nucleophilic.

07:13.140 --> 07:17.540
So let's begin by looking at a reaction coordinate diagram for the reaction of benzene

07:17.540 --> 07:22.580
and a generic electrophile. Here, I'm just going to use E plus to identify the electrophile,

07:22.580 --> 07:26.740
but we'll soon look at some real examples.

07:26.740 --> 07:31.700
Recall that even though they're in an aromatic system, the pi electrons of benzene are still

07:31.700 --> 07:37.620
not held as tightly as most sigma bonding electrons. And although it takes an extraordinarily

07:37.620 --> 07:41.220
electrophilic reagent to coax them into attacking, it can be done.

07:42.740 --> 07:47.460
When an adequately electrophilic reagent is added to benzene, the pi electrons of benzene

07:47.460 --> 07:53.380
simply can't resist attacking, and in doing so, they generate a tetrahedral center adjacent to

07:53.380 --> 07:59.860
a resonance stabilized carbocation. We call this intermediate a sigma complex because we

07:59.860 --> 08:04.740
have traded two of our pi electrons to make a new sigma bond to the electrophile.

08:07.700 --> 08:13.460
Clearly, even with the newly formed more stable sigma bond, the sigma complex is a much higher

08:13.460 --> 08:18.900
energy than the starting material. And this is mainly because the ring has lost its aromaticity

08:18.900 --> 08:21.860
and the associated stability that comes from that aromaticity.

08:24.420 --> 08:28.660
Under conditions like this, the intermediate will immediately begin to look for ways to dispense

08:28.660 --> 08:34.740
with the positive charge of the carbocation and recover its aromaticity. Naturally, the simplest

08:34.740 --> 08:39.220
way to remove the newly acquired positive charge is to lose a proton to the solvent,

08:40.020 --> 08:46.180
but which proton exactly will be lost? We'll take a look at that tetrahedral center we generated

08:46.180 --> 08:52.020
in the first step. If we remove one of the substituents about this center in a heterogenic bond

08:52.020 --> 08:57.220
cleavage, we can repopulate the aromatic ring using the bonding electrons which were holding

08:57.220 --> 09:03.060
that substituent in place. Removal of the electrophile would produce an uninteresting result

09:03.060 --> 09:08.500
since we'd simply return to the starting materials. But what if instead we remove the proton on the

09:08.500 --> 09:14.420
same tetrahedral center? A molecule of solvent or another weak base is usually all it takes

09:14.420 --> 09:19.780
to abstract that proton, leading to a return to aromaticity and therefore stability,

09:19.780 --> 09:25.220
while leaving the new benzene electrophile bond intact. Our substitution reactions complete.

09:27.940 --> 09:33.540
Zeidler's synthesis of DDT relied on this mechanism to couple two molecules of chlorobenzene

09:33.540 --> 09:39.540
to a compound known as chloral. He was able to substitute chloral for one of the ring hydrogens

09:39.540 --> 09:44.580
of chlorobenzene, creating an intermediate which substituted for yet another ring hydrogen

09:44.580 --> 09:50.580
on a second molecule of chlorobenzene. This somewhat complicated use of electrophilic

09:50.580 --> 09:54.420
aromatic substitution will make more sense to us as we continue through the lecture.

09:56.740 --> 10:00.420
As simple as our electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism seems,

10:01.380 --> 10:05.780
getting such a reaction started can be complicated because it requires a species so

10:05.780 --> 10:10.660
electronegative, so hungry for electrons that it can compensate for the temporary loss of

10:10.660 --> 10:16.420
aromaticity during the reaction's first step. Indeed, the key to successful substitution

10:16.420 --> 10:21.940
is to generate an adequately electrophilic substitution reagent. Now remember what makes

10:21.940 --> 10:27.860
a good electrophile, high positive charge density, and the ability to accept electrons to form a new

10:27.860 --> 10:36.660
bond. Back to Zeidler's synthesis of DDT, chloral itself is not electrophilic enough to react with

10:36.660 --> 10:42.260
the aromatic electrons of chlorobenzene, and this is why he added a small amount of sulfuric acid to

10:42.260 --> 10:48.740
his reaction. Sulfuric acid is strong enough to protonate a carbonyl group like that of chloral,

10:49.460 --> 10:54.740
increasing the electrophilic character of its carbonyl carbon. It's this protonated carbonyl

10:54.740 --> 11:00.420
species which is key to starting the reaction, which ultimately produced his history-changing compound.

11:03.140 --> 11:07.380
Over the past two centuries, many researchers have devised ways to substitute benzene using

11:07.380 --> 11:13.060
many familiar functional groups. Now three of these groups we'll discuss today. Those are

11:13.060 --> 11:22.500
nitration, halogenation, and alkylation. In all three of these cases, simply mixing benzene with,

11:22.500 --> 11:28.500
say, nitric acid, molecular bromine, or an alkyl halide will not achieve the desired reaction.

11:29.540 --> 11:33.940
We need to find ways to make each of these three reagents even more electrophilic than they already

11:33.940 --> 11:38.580
are. So let's look at how each of these three can be accomplished one by one.

11:41.220 --> 11:45.620
Nitration of benzene is typically achieved by adding a bit of sulfuric acid to the mixture.

11:46.820 --> 11:51.220
The purpose of the sulfuric acid is to protonate the nitric acid. That's right,

11:51.300 --> 11:57.380
nitric acid is going to act as a base. And this may sound crazy, but sulfuric acid is extremely

11:57.380 --> 12:02.580
strong, with a pKa of about negative two. Strong enough that it can protonate just a small amount

12:02.580 --> 12:10.580
of nitric acid and get the process started. Once protonated, nitric acid can lose a water molecule

12:10.580 --> 12:16.100
to form a species known as nitronium. The electron cloud around the nitronium is similar to that of

12:16.180 --> 12:22.980
carbon dioxide, but it has a central nitrogen atom instead. Now, that extra proton in the nucleus

12:22.980 --> 12:29.140
of nitrogen means that the nitrogen now has a plus one charge associated with it. And this dense

12:29.140 --> 12:33.860
region of positive charge, complete with oxygen atoms ready to accept pi electrons as the attack

12:33.860 --> 12:38.740
occurs, is all that it takes to make an effective electrophile for nitration.

12:38.740 --> 12:46.740
This reaction can be used to produce nitrobenzene, which is frequently used as an organic solvent,

12:47.300 --> 12:53.060
but it can also be used to create a number of very useful products. Let's take a look at one now.

12:54.340 --> 12:58.660
Let's nitrate a compound called phenol using the same strategy that we just discussed.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.420
This is the structure for phenol. It's benzene with a hydroxyl group attached

13:04.420 --> 13:09.380
and is very easily obtained from coal tar extracts. So this compound was available to

13:09.380 --> 13:17.700
chemists working in the early 1800s. If we add to that sulfuric acid H2SO4 with the sulfur atom

13:17.700 --> 13:24.020
indicated here in yellow and nitric acid HNO3, the nitrogen atom in the center here in blue,

13:24.900 --> 13:30.900
we can expect to generate a nitronium electrophile. Now, all of these materials have been readily

13:30.900 --> 13:35.540
available for quite some time, so this was a very simple reaction to run very early in the

13:35.540 --> 13:41.460
history of organic chemistry. Our sulfuric acid is going to transfer its proton to the nitric acid.

13:42.260 --> 13:45.860
Even if only a small amount does this, it's enough to get the reaction started.

13:47.060 --> 13:52.020
The product of this is our protonated nitric acid and a hydrogen sulfate anion,

13:52.020 --> 13:59.940
the conjugate base of H2SO4. Now, once protonated, the nitric acid can lose this water functional

13:59.940 --> 14:07.780
group, generating the nitronium ion and a water byproduct. As the reaction proceeds, the nitronium

14:07.780 --> 14:13.940
ion is attacked by the phenol and forms that new sigma bond to create the sigma complex.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.900
But we've lost our aromaticity now and we have a carbocation instead.

14:20.180 --> 14:24.020
So to relieve this loss of aromaticity, in this case I'm going to show water

14:24.580 --> 14:28.420
taking the proton from the tetrahedral center, which is in back here just behind the carbon,

14:29.940 --> 14:36.580
and in doing so it will reestablish aromaticity, having left behind the newly attached nitro group.

14:37.620 --> 14:41.620
So we've completed one round of nitration of phenol,

14:43.940 --> 14:47.940
but it doesn't have to stop there. There are four more hydrogens on the ring,

14:48.980 --> 14:53.780
and in the case of nitronium and the case of phenol, they react so well together that using a

14:53.780 --> 14:59.380
little bit more nitric and sulfuric acid can result in this compound, a trinitro phenol

14:59.380 --> 15:07.220
known as picric acid. Now picric acid is noteworthy because it's a chemical cousin of trinitrotoluene

15:07.220 --> 15:14.340
or TNT, but it was easier to make, was discovered much earlier, and believe it or not, has an even

15:14.340 --> 15:20.980
higher explosive yield. No community can attest better to the explosive power of picric acid

15:20.980 --> 15:26.900
than the community of Halifax Nova Scotia, which was devastated by an immense blast from a French

15:26.900 --> 15:34.340
cargo ship carrying this wartime munition in 1917. After colliding with another ship in the bay,

15:34.340 --> 15:38.820
the French ship Mont Blanc caught fire, prompting the crew to evacuate the ship.

15:40.340 --> 15:45.620
The resulting blast when the cargo detonated has been estimated at a force equivalent to about

15:45.620 --> 15:51.940
three kilotons of TNT, creating a one mile wide swath of complete and utter destruction.

15:52.900 --> 15:57.940
Now that yield is about one-fifth the explosive yield of the nuclear bomb which destroyed Hiroshima

15:57.940 --> 16:03.060
nearly 30 years later at the end of World War II. This is a true testament to the

16:03.060 --> 16:07.700
reactivity of nitro groups and what they can bring to organic compounds. As the aromatic

16:07.700 --> 16:12.500
stabilization of benzene is clearly dramatically overwhelmed by the instability of the three

16:12.500 --> 16:18.100
nitro groups which are introduced to it by this method. Halogenation of benzene is another useful

16:18.180 --> 16:23.780
synthetic process, but again one which cannot be achieved simply by mixing benzene and molecular

16:23.780 --> 16:30.500
halogens like chlorine. In this case inorganic complexes like aluminum-3 chloride or iron-3

16:30.500 --> 16:35.860
chloride are used to induce a strong dipole in the molecular halogen bond.

16:38.500 --> 16:44.820
This method of chlorination is so effective that when taken to extremes all six hydrogens from a

16:44.820 --> 16:52.980
benzene can be substituted with chlorine producing hexachlorobenzene. Now this halogenated hydrocarbon

16:52.980 --> 16:59.620
is a powerful antifungal agent which was used in the 1940s 50s and 60s to protect wheat crops

16:59.620 --> 17:04.260
before its use was discontinued over, you guessed it, environmental concerns.

17:06.020 --> 17:11.620
The same type of catalyst can be used to enhance the dipole of an alkyl halide to produce an alkylation.

17:12.500 --> 17:17.620
Now alkylated benzene compounds produced in this way can be used to make such useful products as

17:17.620 --> 17:24.740
synthetic detergents. And there's a long library of catalysts and tricks to attach a wide variety

17:24.740 --> 17:30.020
of functional groups to benzene, but we're going to conclude our discussion with these three examples

17:30.020 --> 17:33.780
and as I continue through the remainder of the lecture I'll try to use these three for

17:33.780 --> 17:38.740
demonstration purposes, but keep in mind that the huge range of modifications are possible.

17:41.940 --> 17:51.060
So we've taken a look at what happens when we substitute just one hydrogen on a benzene ring,

17:51.060 --> 17:56.500
like its nitration, and when we substitute all of its protons like we did using chlorine and

17:56.500 --> 18:02.660
aluminum-3 chloride catalyst. In cases like these only one possible isomer of the intended product

18:02.660 --> 18:08.980
exists, but we also took a look at picric acid which has some but not all of the hydrogens

18:08.980 --> 18:15.300
around its aromatic ring substituted, and this presents a new consideration. The isomer that

18:15.300 --> 18:23.140
I showed you in the slide has three nitrates at the two, four, and six positions, but why not this

18:23.140 --> 18:31.460
isomer, right, two, three, four, or maybe this isomer, three, four, five. Now you can see the

18:31.460 --> 18:37.060
issue that we're facing here. Once a substituent has been placed on the ring the remaining hydrogens

18:37.060 --> 18:43.540
are no longer equivalent. We have two ortho, two meta, and one para positions around the ring.

18:44.980 --> 18:49.060
So we must now ask ourselves if the second substitution will take place preferentially

18:49.060 --> 18:54.180
at one of these positions, or will we get a statistical mixture of all three possibilities.

18:55.940 --> 19:02.260
This consideration is well illustrated by Zeidler's successful DDT synthesis. I say successful in the

19:02.260 --> 19:09.380
sense that he was able to modify two chlorobenzines only at their para positions. If his electrophilic

19:09.380 --> 19:15.860
aromatic substitution methodology caused substitutions at random locations around the ring we would

19:15.860 --> 19:20.820
expect that any given sample of chlorobenzine molecules should produce a mixture of products

19:20.820 --> 19:31.540
which are 40% ortho, 40% meta, and only 20% para. Moreover, the chances of a second substitution

19:31.540 --> 19:37.860
occurring at the para position are again 20%, leaving a paltry 4% of the final product in the

19:37.860 --> 19:45.060
preferred configuration. Yet when Zeidler's synthesis is performed the desired regioisomer

19:45.060 --> 19:51.300
is the major product that's obtained. So how did it come to be that chlorobenzine selectively

19:51.300 --> 19:58.900
undergoes electrophilic substitution at its para position? We call this tendency for a reaction

19:58.900 --> 20:04.740
to occur at one particular position among several similar positions, regiospecificity.

20:06.180 --> 20:10.500
Functional groups attached to benzene rings alter not only the reactivity of the ring,

20:11.060 --> 20:17.540
but the regiospecificity of subsequent additions as well. Now recall we noted earlier that there

20:17.540 --> 20:23.620
are three different positions available to react in a substituted benzene ring, two ortho, two meta,

20:23.700 --> 20:29.060
and one para. So based on this distribution one might expect that, for example,

20:29.060 --> 20:34.900
brominating in nitrobenzene molecule would yield a mixture of products which is 40% ortho,

20:34.900 --> 20:42.740
40% meta, and 20% para substituted. Yet when we conduct this reaction we find that this

20:42.740 --> 20:48.500
distribution of products is rarely the case. In fact, we usually find a preponderance of one

20:48.500 --> 20:54.500
product with just a small amount of the others. So how does this preference to substitute at a

20:54.500 --> 21:01.300
particular location on the ring happen? Well the answer lies in the stability of the sigma complex

21:01.300 --> 21:07.620
intermediates of all three reaction pathways. So let's start by analyzing the three possible

21:07.620 --> 21:12.740
pathways for the electrophilic aromatic substitution of a chlorobenzene molecule.

21:13.700 --> 21:19.300
Notice that when an electrophile finds itself at the meta position we see an intermediate form

21:19.300 --> 21:24.740
in which re-resonance contributors can form, all of which look very similar to those in a simple

21:24.740 --> 21:31.940
benzene ring undergoing substitution. However, when an electrophile attaches to the para position

21:31.940 --> 21:37.140
or the ortho position of the ring something interesting happens. We can draw a fourth resonance

21:37.140 --> 21:42.180
contributor and you may recall from our earlier discussions on resonance that more resonance

21:42.420 --> 21:48.740
contributors means a more stable species. And we can rely on something called Hammond's Postulate

21:48.740 --> 21:54.180
which tells us that a more stable intermediate and a rate limiting step leads to a faster reaction.

21:56.820 --> 22:02.260
So plotting reaction coordinate diagrams for the three possible products of any electrophilic

22:02.260 --> 22:08.740
substitution of chlorobenzene might look something like this. With the meta intermediate being similar

22:08.740 --> 22:14.420
in energy to the substitution of benzene but the ortho and para intermediates being lower in energy

22:15.300 --> 22:19.060
thus lowering the activation energies of the pathways for those two products.

22:21.380 --> 22:26.260
So we have successfully demonstrated why the meta position of chlorobenzene is less reactive than

22:26.260 --> 22:32.100
the ortho in the para positions. In fact, chlorine is part of a class of substituents which we call

22:32.100 --> 22:38.580
ortho-paradirectors. However, we've not yet explained exactly why the para position is

22:38.580 --> 22:45.380
substituted more than the ortho in this case. This requires that we look to our second consideration,

22:45.380 --> 22:47.140
ring activation and deactivation.

22:49.540 --> 22:54.100
See the second consideration here is that the already attached group may withdraw or

22:54.100 --> 22:59.780
donate electron density to the ring. Reducing electron density within the ring makes it less

22:59.780 --> 23:04.980
likely to attack. Since doing so would only increase the magnitude of the charge generated on the

23:04.980 --> 23:11.060
intermediate. Conversely, donating additional electron density to the ring would be expected

23:11.060 --> 23:18.340
to activate the ring and make it even more reactive. One of the traits which makes chlorine and

23:18.340 --> 23:22.740
bromine so interesting in this reaction type is that they withdraw electrons from the ring

23:22.740 --> 23:28.900
inductively. This means that the electronegativity of chlorine causes it to pull electrons out of

23:28.900 --> 23:35.460
the ring through bonds like current through a wire. And unlike resonance which has the effect

23:35.460 --> 23:40.500
of causing charges to jump every other atom, inductive effects attenuate with distance.

23:41.700 --> 23:46.580
So this gives us an explanation for the strong preference for the para substitution over ortho.

23:47.460 --> 23:51.940
The higher positive charge on the ortho atoms of chlorobenzene simply makes them less likely

23:51.940 --> 23:55.220
to attack an electrophile and take on even more positive charge.

23:55.860 --> 24:01.540
If we turn our attention to the synthesis of DDT one more time, we now understand how Zyla was able

24:01.540 --> 24:07.300
to produce the specific isomer he wanted. The chlorine substituent on his starting material

24:07.300 --> 24:12.420
directed the chloral substitution to the para position, ensuring that the proper structural

24:12.420 --> 24:19.220
isomer was obtained. Not only that, but the newly attached chloral group quickly dehydrates under

24:20.180 --> 24:27.620
acidic conditions to produce a new electrophile. This deactivates the already attached ring,

24:27.620 --> 24:32.980
discouraging additional substitutions, while simultaneously encouraging a second chlorobenzene

24:32.980 --> 24:41.380
to attack, leading to the product DDT. The final product of Zydler's synthesis can be

24:41.380 --> 24:47.140
thought of as two disubstituted rings bearing deactivating substituents. So the desired product

24:47.140 --> 24:54.500
forms in great abundance with very limited byproduct formation. So now that we understand

24:54.500 --> 24:59.140
how substituents can affect the sites on which substituted benzenes are modified in electrophilic

24:59.140 --> 25:04.740
aromatic substitutions, let's take a quick look at some common motifs and how they affect reactivity.

25:07.780 --> 25:12.100
Activating ortho-para directors include groups such as the amine group of aniline,

25:12.660 --> 25:16.500
the hydroxyl group of phenol, and the methoxy group of anisol.

25:18.020 --> 25:22.100
Groups like these have the ability to donate electrons to the ring by resonance.

25:25.220 --> 25:31.300
Deactivating ortho-para directors include halogens like fluorine, chlorine and bromine.

25:32.500 --> 25:37.700
These groups direct by donating electrons in resonance, but deactivate because of the strong

25:37.700 --> 25:45.140
dipole they create in the carbon halogen bond. Finally, we have deactivating metadirectors,

25:45.140 --> 25:52.020
such as nitrates, carboxylic acids and aldehydes, which all draw electrons strongly by resonance.

25:53.220 --> 25:56.740
Now notice that all of these groups contain a heteroatom two bonds away from the ring,

25:57.380 --> 26:02.900
while all of our activators contain the heteroatom adjacent to the ring. That's not a coincidence.

26:03.060 --> 26:09.620
Now the true utility and importance of directing effects on synthesis can be seen in this simple

26:09.620 --> 26:16.660
illustration. The bromination of nitrobenzene produces mainly meta-bromonitrobenzene,

26:16.660 --> 26:23.460
owing to the metadirecting nitro group. Yet the nitration of bromobenzene produces mainly

26:23.460 --> 26:30.660
para-bromonitrobenzene, owing to the ortho-paradirecting bromogroup. So in this case, the order in

26:30.660 --> 26:35.860
which I carry out my substitutions on the benzene has a direct effect on the product that I obtain.

26:37.540 --> 26:41.700
Now let's consider the activating effects of substituents and how they can affect a synthetic

26:41.700 --> 26:48.900
outcome as well. A one-to-one mixture of benzene and chlorine with a small amount of aluminum

26:48.900 --> 26:55.540
chloride catalysts should produce a quantitative or complete conversion to chlorobenzene, owing

26:55.540 --> 27:01.300
to the deactivating nature of the chloro groups. Since chlorobenzene itself is less reactive than

27:01.300 --> 27:06.100
benzene, we don't expect much of the chlorinated product or rather we don't expect much of the

27:06.100 --> 27:12.980
dichlorinated product to form. Yet a one-to-one mixture of benzene with ethyl chloride and

27:12.980 --> 27:20.260
catalytic aluminum chloride produces a mixture of benzene, ethyl benzene, diethyl benzene isomers,

27:20.260 --> 27:26.420
and even some triethylbenzene. Now the reason for this is that the alkyl groups are activating,

27:26.420 --> 27:31.620
so as a small amount of ethyl benzene forms in the reaction mixture, its increased reactivity

27:31.620 --> 27:36.820
means that its conversion to diethylbenzene will outpace alkylation of the remaining starting

27:36.820 --> 27:42.580
material. In situations like this, we have to turn to some tricks to achieve a single alkylation.

27:43.220 --> 27:47.700
For example, using a huge excess of benzene in order to dilute the electrophile to the point

27:47.700 --> 27:51.220
at which two alkylations on a single molecule becomes very unlikely.

27:57.940 --> 28:02.420
Today we have investigated the ability of electrophiles to substitute themselves for ring

28:02.420 --> 28:08.020
hydrogens of benzene molecules. We've discussed how the resonance stabilization of the resulting

28:08.020 --> 28:13.700
transition state makes it possible to entice a ring to give up its aromaticity, even if only for

28:13.700 --> 28:19.540
an instant while the modification is occurring. We've looked at ways to generate electrophiles,

28:19.540 --> 28:24.820
including acidification of substrates like nitric acid and chloral, as well as the use of a Lewis

28:24.820 --> 28:29.860
acid catalyst like aluminum III chloride to activate halogens and alkyl halides.

28:32.260 --> 28:37.220
And finally, we considered the effect of having a substituent already attached to the ring.

28:37.940 --> 28:43.140
We saw how substituents like amine, hydroxyl, and methoxy groups, which donate electrons to the

28:43.140 --> 28:49.300
ring, activate an ortho-paradirect. How substituents like aldehydes and nitrates,

28:49.300 --> 28:53.540
which withdraw electrons from the ring by resonance, deactivate and metadirect.

28:54.740 --> 28:59.300
And we also considered how the high electronegativity of halogens gives them the very unusual

28:59.300 --> 29:07.300
property of deactivating while ortho-paradirecting. And of course, along the way, we considered how

29:07.300 --> 29:12.820
all of these factors combined in a simple, highly efficient synthesis of a remarkably stable

29:12.820 --> 29:19.060
molecule. A molecule with such powerful biological activity that it not only changed the world,

29:19.060 --> 29:22.340
but ultimately the way that humans think about how we interact with the world.

29:23.300 --> 29:29.700
Powerful chemistry indeed. Speaking of biological systems, in the next few lectures,

29:29.700 --> 29:33.860
we're going to take our organic chemistry knowledge to the interface between chemistry

29:33.860 --> 29:40.660
and biology. As we investigate the large, complex molecules of life, including carbohydrates,

29:40.660 --> 29:46.820
nucleic acids, proteins, through the eyes of an organic chemist. I'll see you then.
