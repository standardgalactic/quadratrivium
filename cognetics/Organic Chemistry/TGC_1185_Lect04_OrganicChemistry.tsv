0	17520	Welcome back. I hope that our first few lectures on bonding and molecular structure have piqued
17520	21880	your interest in the relationship between those structures and the physical and chemical
21880	27840	properties that they lead to in organic compounds. Of course, observation of these properties
27840	33800	takes time, so we can't just rely on a static snapshot of a structure to tell the whole
33800	43480	story. Let me show you an example. Here I have a molecule called acrolein. Acrolein is a
43480	49040	potent toxin found in cigarette smoke. It's also used in commercial biocides, and its
49040	53400	reactivity is similar to that of formaldehyde, so it finds use as a fixative agent, preserving
53400	60360	biological samples. Now, in textbooks and in papers, acrolein is commonly drawn in this
60360	66600	configuration. And yet, something about this configuration doesn't make sense to us. There's
66600	71800	a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbon-carbon single bond, and a carbon-oxygen double bond
71800	77400	in this molecule, which means the central bond should rotate freely. Yet, when we use
77400	81480	the static structure like this one and try to model its behavior, we see that this kind
81480	86520	of rotation doesn't happen. And so the chemical properties of acrolein, like its boiling point,
86520	92920	its acid-base properties, are all different than the prediction based upon this model.
92920	98400	So we find the carbon-oxygen bond dipole here is actually larger than the structure predicts,
98400	104040	and that electron density around these carbons is not the same. So clearly there's something
104040	110380	going on here that this static model just can't explain. Now, so far we've concerned
110380	117340	ourselves primarily with the drawing of molecular structures, these stationary, unchanging representations
117340	123820	of molecules in their most ideal states. They'll have median bond lengths and angles and dihedrals
123820	130300	just the way that we want them. Now, as useful as it is to have these representations, showing
130300	136220	compounds in their most stable, ideal states, as chemists we're ultimately concerned with
136220	141020	materials physical and chemical properties in the real world, where bonds vibrate, electrons
141020	147340	move through clouds, and those bonds change. So the physical and chemical changes would
147340	153740	be best communicated not by a single ideal representation, but by how the molecule truly
153740	161740	behaves as time passes. So we need to develop a method for communicating how substances behave
161740	169460	and change through time, instead of just a single instantaneous ideal snapshot. We naturally
169460	174540	benefit from a method which is generally accepted by all chemists so that we can give one another
174540	179380	all the information we need to reach a common understanding of chemical processes as well
179380	186180	as physical processes. In this lecture I'll show you how to create drawings which depict
186180	190660	the transfer of electrons from one location to another in order to form and break chemical
190660	198020	bonds. Some of these motions will be intramolecular, meaning they take place within a single molecule,
198020	204580	and others will be intermolecular, meaning that they take place between two or more molecules.
204580	211100	In all cases, the relocation of electrons will result in the formation, alteration, or breaking
211100	220020	of connections between atoms. Get ready, chemistry is about to come alive.
220020	225940	So let's begin with an intramolecular process called resonance. Electrons within an electron
225940	230980	cloud are always in motion, and we've already seen in one of our previous lectures that
230980	235060	pi bonds have a unique ability to form and break without altering the connectivity of
235060	240420	atoms, and since the stronger sigma bonds can remain intact while the weaker pi bonds are
240420	246660	broken. So electron pairs which are not involved in bonding at all, sometimes called lone
246660	251580	pair electrons and pi bonding electrons, can be made more mobile within a molecule's
251580	258180	overall electron cloud. Now these electrons can sometimes occupy a region much larger
258180	262540	than just that defined by a hybrid orbital or an isolated pi bond. They can traverse
262540	267140	great distances across molecules using p orbitals without disrupting the connectivity of the
267140	274140	atoms. These long interconnected systems of p orbitals, sometimes called pi systems.
274140	279180	So as electrons move through the pi systems, no reaction is really taking place, but our
279180	284940	method of drawing an individual structure begins to fail. We're already familiar with
284940	290540	today's acrolein molecule, and I drew it like this just the way that I had represented it
290540	295700	in the model that I showed you previously. But the problem is that the pi electrons in
295700	299940	acrolein want more space. They want to run throughout the molecule, and if given a chance
299940	307260	to do so, that's exactly what they'll do. Now if you look at the acrolein structure,
307260	316020	you'll see many, many sp2 carbons and even an sp2 oxygen all arranged in a row. Now if
316020	319180	I show you the molecule on its side, it'll probably make a little bit more sense what's
319180	322620	happening here. I'm going to take the hydrogens away so it's easier to see, and I'm going
322620	330220	to turn my acrolein molecule. Now these are the p orbitals participating in pi bonding.
330220	334780	So even though I've drawn it here with an isolated pi bond on alternating carbons, the
334780	340820	truth of the matter is that pi system is completely interconnected. So when the bonds are arranged
340820	347900	appropriately so that all p orbitals are aligned, the electrons can run throughout the molecule.
347900	352980	So I need a way to represent acrolein, which is a little bit more realistic. And we do
352980	360100	this by breaking the structure down and drawing every conceivable extreme. For example, here
360100	364700	I have three duplicates of my acrolein structure, but I'm going to alter them, remembering my
364700	370420	rule. Sigma bonds can't break, only pi bonds can move. So let's take a look at what happens
370420	374260	when I do this to my first structure on the left. I'm going to move one pi bond up to
374260	379860	the oxygen, creating a charge separation. In my other one here, I'm going to relocate
379860	385500	both of those pi bonds, one to the oxygen and one to the central carbon-carbon bond,
385500	390340	creating a different kind of charge separation. And my third I'm going to leave exactly as
390340	397260	it was. So these extremes of electron motion that we draw in this type of way are called
397260	402020	resonance contributors. And you'll see this drawn in the chemical literature and in your
402060	406820	textbooks. But what happens when you see that, or at least when a trained chemist does, is
406820	413460	this. They mentally combine all of those resonance contributors into a single resonance hybrid,
413460	419020	which is essentially the weighted average of these three structures. In my resonance
419020	424660	hybrid, I can understand why there is no rotation or limited rotation about that central bond,
424660	429220	because it has a little bit of pi character, which my static structure that I drew originally
429260	435540	would not predict. So this is the utility of thinking more about the motion of electrons
435540	442940	through time than about a single instantaneous snapshot of my molecule. So in that drawing,
442940	447260	I had brackets and straight double-headed arrows, giving me my cue to create the best
447260	451980	possible approximation of acrylene structure. And I did this by mentally combining them
451980	456940	all into that new weighted average called the resonance hybrid. And it will help me
456980	462100	to predict the reactivity and properties of acrylene much better. But it's important to
462100	466580	remember that hybrid is a weighted average, meaning that the contributors with less charge
466580	472180	separation and more ideal electron positions tend to be a closer representation of the hybrid
472180	480500	than their charge-containing counterparts. Now, creating a static depiction of a system
480500	485460	changing through time can be a challenging undertaking, but one which humanity has deemed
485500	490900	worthy since prehistory. Just ask cave painters of Paleolithic Europe and Africa. They tried to
490900	495900	document their hunts with just a few simple markings on a cave wall. Or if you don't have a
495900	503140	time machine, ask any modern-day comic strip author. The comic strip artists try to tell
503140	508860	a story using a storyboard of static images, depicting different moments within the narrative.
508860	514740	And it's up to us as readers to combine these images in our minds to create a seamless running
514780	521780	story. For example, here's Garfield holding a piece of pie, and then suddenly in the next
521780	528660	frame, pie's gone. But where did it go? Well, as the readers, we have to rely on our experience
528660	533180	and our intuition to tell us how that transition occurred. I'm pretty sure I know where the
533180	538340	pie went. Now, organic chemistry is no different than that comic strip. I might show you the
538340	543340	chemical structures, for example, of ammonium cyanate and urea. But unless I give it greater
543380	548900	detail, it's up to you to decide how you think the transition took place, using your understanding
548900	554340	of how organic chemistry works. Of course, technologies progress to the point at which
554340	558740	we don't often have to perform this exercise anymore. Computer animation fills in all the
558740	565500	gaps and gives us maximum detail about how a process takes place. But even with the advantages
565500	571540	of modern technology, fully animating a story is not always the best choice. It certainly
571540	576460	leaves out most ambiguities, but it requires a great deal of effort to create, and also
576460	582660	special devices to view. So for the purposes of day-to-day communication, chemists prefer
582660	587660	to use a faster, shorthand style of depicting reactions that's developed over the centuries.
587660	593780	Now, last time, we took a detailed look at methods chemists use to unambiguously convey
593780	598420	molecular structures to one another. And in this lecture, we'll be taking a detailed
598420	604020	look at how organic chemists convey changes in those structures through time. Specifically,
604020	608160	how the chemical energy of a system changes, and how the bonding between and among atoms
608160	615160	changes when that chemistry takes place. So let's begin with the simplest possible illustration
615180	621140	of a chemical change, a reaction scheme. Now chemists often don't know or feel the need
621140	627440	to convey minute mechanistic details of a chemical reaction as it takes place. And sometimes
627440	631580	their arguments simply depends on what was present at the beginning of the reaction and
631580	637700	what was present at the end. For example, if we just want to give the basic details
637700	643580	of a reaction, we rely on something called a reaction scheme. The reaction scheme consists
643580	650060	of reagents on the left side, products on the right side, an arrow which indicates whether
650060	655340	the reaction is reversible or not, we'll get to that in a moment, and also any special
655360	660400	conditions which are required for the reaction to take place. A great example of this is
660400	665480	the reaction scheme used by Friedrich Wohler to synthesize urea. Remember, his reagent
665480	672480	was ammonium cyanane. His products ultimately were urea. The reaction runs irreversibly,
673520	679640	meaning that it completely and quantitatively converts all of the reagents into products.
679640	684160	And the conditions that he used were simply heating. We represent heat sometimes with
684180	689180	the capital Greek letter delta. So this is how Wohler's synthesis would appear if I
689180	696180	were to write it as a reaction scheme. I have the synthesis of urea formed from ammonium
696300	701740	cyanate in an irreversible process driven by heat. Now it's that last element of the
701740	706780	scheme that requires a little bit more explanation. See, chemists distinguish between reactions
706780	711420	which can be reversed from those and those which cannot. So in a reaction like Wohler's
711420	716400	synthesis, the product formed is so stable that once it forms, it can never go back to
716400	721600	the original starting materials through the reverse pathway. Of course, this means that
721600	725520	if we wait long enough, the reaction will eventually result in the complete conversion
725520	730200	of reactants to products. And as the course progresses, we'll eventually see why this
730200	736240	is so important to make a distinction like this when plotting out a synthesis. So now
736240	741360	that we have our completed scheme for Wohler's irreversible synthesis of urea, let's take
741380	748380	a look at a scheme for another famous reaction, which this time is reversible. Another classic
748900	754060	example of a reaction scheme is a Haber-Bosch process, which one might argue is not truly
754060	758860	organic since carbon is not involved, but it's probably the single most influential
758860	763820	chemical reaction of all time. And it's a critical entry point for nitrogen into the
763820	768900	biosphere. So I'm going to exercise the professor's privilege here and step outside the bounds
768920	774960	of my own discipline for just a moment. During World War I, with Germany facing dwindling
774960	780760	natural resources to fuel their war efforts, famous German chemists Fritz Haber and Karl
780760	786120	Bosch were engaged in a project to provide Germany with all the fixed nitrogen it could
786120	793120	ever need for explosives and crop fertilization. The scheme that Haber used looks like this.
793980	800980	As reagents, he used nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. For products, he was hoping to get ammonia.
802660	807400	And what Haber realized was that in order to accomplish this, he was going to have some
807400	812660	trouble because he had a reversible process. But he could get it to go if he ran it at
812660	819660	400 degrees centigrade and 200 atmospheres of pressure in the presence of an iron catalyst,
820200	824520	which speeds the reaction but doesn't really participate in it overall. That's why we place
824520	831600	the iron here in the conditions rather than as a reagent. So Haber's scheme was, again,
831600	837520	to try to get nitrogen and hydrogen to combine in a reversible process at 400 degrees and
837520	844200	200 atmospheres of pressure with an iron catalyst, all to make ammonia. So you'll notice in
844200	848000	this case that I've placed some numbers in front of my reagents here. And those numbers
848020	853220	indicate a quantity. So you'll hear me from time to time refer to three moles of hydrogen
853220	858820	or two moles of ammonia. This is because chemists usually count molecules using a very large
858820	864780	quantity. It's no different than a dozen or a gross. So if I need a dozen eggs to make
864780	869820	two dozen cookies, you now know the ratio needed. So if I need three moles of hydrogen
869820	876100	to make two moles of ammonia, again, you know the ratio that's needed. So the only difference
876120	881000	here is that in chemistry, we're counting atoms and molecules. So a mole is tremendous
881000	888520	in quantity by comparison. 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd to be exact. So my reaction here
888520	893480	involves one mole of nitrogen gas reacting with three molar equivalents of hydrogen
893480	898440	to produce two moles of ammonia. And it would be a great way to make ammonia from the air
898440	903680	if we could convert it into this much needed ammonia. The only problem here is the reaction
903680	909100	is reversible. So once it's formed, the ammonia can convert back to hydrogen and nitrogen
909100	915820	gases, thereby completely undoing the reaction. So as the concentration of ammonia builds,
915820	920140	the reverse reaction accelerates until it matches out of the forward reaction, establishing
920140	925700	what chemists call an equilibrium. The problem that Haber and Bosch faced is that ammonia
925700	931060	decomposes to nitrogen and hydrogen very rapidly under common laboratory conditions, so only
931080	938080	a small fraction of material in the reactor will be ammonia at any given time. So equilibrium
938640	944400	is defined as a dynamic process in which the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.
944400	948520	And it's a common misconception actually that equilibrium means equal amounts of both
948520	953200	products and reactants, but this is really not the case at all, much to the chagrin
953200	960200	of Haber and Bosch. So let me show you what I mean by that. We model equilibria as chemists
960580	966860	using something called an equilibrium constant, which is written as the capital letter K. Now
966860	972020	in the equilibrium constant we place a function of the products in the numerator, a function
972020	976620	of the reagents in the denominator, and we raise those functions to a power equal to
976620	981720	their coefficients in the reaction. So here I've created a sort of generic reaction,
981720	988720	one mole of reagent A plus three moles of reagent B forms two moles of product C. So to construct
989340	995200	the equilibrium constant K, I simply place my product's concentration, which we indicate
995200	1001560	by brackets, raised to the power of two for its coefficient. I place my first reagent
1001560	1008240	in the denominator, raised to a power of one, and my second reagent also in the denominator,
1008240	1014740	raised to a power of three. So this is my general equilibrium constant for this type
1014760	1021440	of reaction. So Haber and Bosch were attempting to use nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia in
1021440	1028040	an equilibrium process, meaning that its equilibrium constant expression will look like this, concentration
1028040	1035040	of ammonia squared over concentration of nitrogen over concentration of hydrogen cubed equals
1035040	1041540	ten to the minus sixth. This is a highly disfavored equilibrium. So this reaction is capable of
1041560	1046880	producing only a small amount of ammonia once equilibrium is reached. So the scheme
1046880	1052840	that Haber and Bosch were hoping to use to create ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen,
1052840	1056560	unfortunately at equilibrium didn't look much like this, instead it looked a little
1056560	1063560	bit like this. So the genius of what Haber and Bosch did was not in this reaction that
1063720	1069920	they used. In fact, it's a pretty simple reaction. The genius of what Haber and Bosch accomplished
1069980	1075100	was in their reactor design, which altered the conditions of pressure and temperature,
1075100	1079700	increasing both of these factors to speed the rate of ammonia formation relative to
1079700	1084460	the rate of its decomposition. So they influenced the equilibrium in a manner which suited their
1084460	1091460	needs. But even that strategy didn't produce large quantities of ammonia at equilibrium.
1091780	1096100	So in a final manipulation, they devised a way to remove ammonia from the reactor as
1096120	1102120	it formed, thereby causing the equilibrium to shift continuously in favor of their desired
1102120	1108720	products. This tendency of reversible systems to shift in ways which relieve stresses like
1108720	1115720	removal of product is known as Le Chatelier's principle. Now at this early stage, reversible
1117040	1121200	reactions may seem like a nuisance. After all, wouldn't it be great if we could just
1121200	1125960	mix some ingredients, wait for a little while, and ultimately have the maximum possible amount
1125980	1131220	of product? Sure, many times it would. But later in the course, we're going to see some
1131220	1138220	examples of reactions whose reversibility makes them even more useful in synthetic design.
1140100	1143540	So far our drawing examples have been limited in the sense that they convey a great deal
1143540	1148860	about what we start and end with, but relatively little about what goes on in the interim.
1148860	1153700	And since reaction schemes only show a list of starting materials and products, we're
1153760	1159960	often left to wonder exactly how those materials go about changing. One might make the analogy
1159960	1163960	that it's like having a pile of boards, screws, and other pieces, and then a picture of a
1163960	1170960	finished table when assembled, but our step-by-step manual is missing. So when organic chemists
1170960	1175640	want to convey a process in a little more detail, they turn to a style of drawing known
1175640	1181240	as a mechanism. And a mechanism, just like that manual for assembling their table, it's
1181260	1186660	a series of elementary steps showing not only the starting material, reversibility, conditions
1186660	1192420	and products, but also explicitly showing how electrons from each species are exchanged
1192420	1198260	to make and break bonds. So let's take a look at Wohler's Synthesis one more time
1198260	1203940	as an example, knowing that chemists now understand what happened during that happy accident.
1203940	1207900	So our scheme only showed the starting material and products, but let's see if we can fill
1207920	1214920	in some of the gaps now. So once again, here is Wohler's Synthesis. Ammonium cyanate
1215480	1221040	and forming urea. But if I break this reaction down to elementary steps, I see that there
1221040	1227800	are different compounds which form as intermediates, specifically ammonia and cyanic acid, and ultimately
1227800	1234240	a charge-separated intermediate, before it finally becomes urea. So Wohler's Synthesis,
1234260	1237900	as I showed you before, left out a lot of information. There's actually quite a few
1237900	1244900	additional species involved in the transition. But that's still not enough information.
1244900	1248260	If you look at this now, it's sort of like reading that comic strip. We might have multiple
1248260	1253780	pains in the comic, but we still haven't really clearly defined how one transition
1253780	1260380	occurs and forms the next. Now to do this, we use a mechanism. And a mechanism consists
1260400	1265360	of not only the structures of all of these species, but arrows indicating how and when
1265360	1272360	electrons move. For example, here's a representation of ammonium and of cyanate. And I've colored
1272920	1276080	the nitrogens just a little bit different shades of blue so they're easier to follow
1276080	1280780	through the process. So I could skip ahead and draw the new structures for ammonia and
1280780	1286200	cyanic acid, but that would leave you wondering how the transition happened. So to fill in
1286220	1291820	that gap, I'm going to use some arrows. When I use an arrow like this, I'm trying to show
1291820	1297500	you that a pair of electrons is moving from this nitrogen to this hydrogen, abstracting
1297500	1304380	it, forming a new chemical bond to it. As that happens, the original chemical bond breaks,
1304380	1311380	and that pair of electrons moves back to the nitrogen of the ammonium ion. Now I can draw
1311380	1318380	this intermediate in my process, and it's absolutely clear how it got that way. In a
1318480	1324980	second fundamental step, I have my ammonia reacting with the cyanic acid, which was produced,
1324980	1329980	forming a new bond between the nitrogen and carbon, and breaking a pi bond between the
1329980	1336980	carbon and the original nitrogen of the cyanic acid. This produces a charged intermediate
1337080	1342200	in which there's a rearrangement where one of the hydrogens moves from my nitrogen here
1342200	1348440	to my nitrogen down below, breaking that bond. Now I can complete my mechanism, and it becomes
1348440	1354640	clear exactly how we got from this point to this point, including each individual bond
1354640	1360520	forming and breaking. And this is the value of a mechanism. It gives us the maximum level
1360520	1367520	of detail. So we're now acquainted with the techniques used not only to draw molecular
1368060	1373500	structures, but the elements of drawings used to convey elementary steps, and the electron
1373500	1378780	transitions which take place in each one. But there's one more piece of information
1378780	1384060	which is crucial to understanding how these transitions occur, and that is the chemical
1384060	1391060	energetics of the process. You see, just like in classical physics, chemists think in terms
1391680	1397320	of potential energy. And just like a physical object, like a ball, is expected to roll down
1397320	1403920	a hill, thereby decreasing its potential physical energy and reaching a more stable state, so
1403920	1409880	will a molecular system react in a way which decreases its overall potential chemical energy,
1410020	1415540	also making it more stable. The difference is that chemical energy is a bit less intuitive
1415540	1422940	to determine. Still, to fully understand the process of a chemical reaction, we need a
1422940	1427980	quick and convenient method for demonstrating whether a particular transition increases
1427980	1434340	or decreases the overall chemical free energy of the system, and by how much. And to better
1434340	1438480	understand this concept, we should consider a simple example like that ball perched on
1438500	1444260	a hilltop. Classical physics tells us that the potential energy of that ball in its current
1444260	1451260	position is higher than that of the same ball at the bottom of the hill. So we can see from
1451340	1457300	the diagram that when we give it a small push to overcome the barrier, which would be friction
1457300	1461900	or a small hill preventing it from rolling in the first place, the ball will spontaneously
1461900	1466420	roll downward, presumably coming to rest at the bottom of the hill in the lowest energy
1466440	1472600	state available. Chemical systems are a perfect analogy for this physical system that I just
1472600	1478080	described. Just as that ball has an associated physical potential energy, which it would
1478080	1484080	like to release, so does a collection of molecules have an associated chemical free energy that
1484080	1490080	it would like to release. When a small energetic barrier is overcome by the addition of heat,
1490080	1495400	catalyst or some other perturbation, the system can then convert spontaneously to its lower
1495420	1502420	energy state. Now chemists often convey this energetic landscape for a chemical reaction
1502780	1508900	using this hill analogy, and we call it a reaction coordinate diagram. The only difference
1508900	1514420	here is that the hill is one of chemical potential energy rather than one of physical potential
1514420	1519740	energy. So the diagrams are essentially a plot of system free energy as a function of
1519740	1525020	reaction progress. So let's finish our discussion today by applying this diagram to Wohler's
1525040	1531040	Urea Synthesis, and recall that the mechanism for this process involves starting materials,
1531040	1536200	products, and two different intermediate states, which are meta-stable, and they can exist
1536200	1542700	for a little while. So we begin by defining the original energy of the system as the y
1542700	1548760	intercept of our plot, and the first step of our reaction begins with a new bond forming
1548760	1554520	to hydrogen while its original bond breaks. So this process actually increases the energy
1554520	1560140	of the system until we reach a maximum energy for the step. The structure at that local
1560140	1567140	energy maximum is called the transition state. Now at first it might seem strange to suggest
1567780	1572540	that the system is going to move energetically uphill. After all, balls aren't known to roll
1572540	1578020	suddenly uphill without a little outside help. And the same is actually true of chemical
1578020	1583660	systems, but often the help is already there. It's all around us permeating every object
1583680	1590680	in this room. Of course I'm talking about heat. At all temperatures but absolute zero,
1591520	1596520	there will be some molecular motion, bond vibration, molecular collisions, and other
1596520	1601800	kinds of motions. And so long as there's sufficient thermal energy in a system to get it over
1601800	1606560	that initial barrier from starting materials to the transition state, the reaction will
1606580	1613580	take place. Now we call that activation, that barrier activation energy as you already know.
1613940	1618460	And just as you might expect, often the addition of heat to a reaction mixture is all it needs
1618460	1624660	to traverse that barrier, thereby speeding the reaction up. Now as that first step winds
1624660	1630700	down, we see that the energy of the system begins to decrease to a local minimum. But
1630700	1636260	in this case it has a second energetic hill to climb on its way to the final product.
1636280	1641680	So we call this local minimum an intermediate. And it's distinct from transition states because
1641680	1647240	it has a small energy well there which makes it metastable so it can exist in measurable
1647240	1654240	amounts while the reaction is running. In the next step ammonia forms its bond to the
1654240	1659960	newly formed cyanic acid. Again this increases the energy of the system initially to a point
1659960	1665640	representing the transition state for that process. After that new bond formation completes
1665660	1672180	and the system reaches another metastable state. We finally conclude the reaction with
1672180	1679180	the reorganization of the product by an intramolecular exchange of a hydrogen. So we've created an
1679180	1684380	energy diagram here for the entire process of converting ammonium cyanate into urea
1684380	1689380	in three steps. Now let's review the relevance of all the features of this diagram.
1690120	1696120	Our starting materials must pass through a transition state to become the first intermediates
1696120	1702400	ammonia and cyanic acid. The diagram tells me two important things. First that the reaction
1702400	1707640	will happen quickly because the energetic barrier is relatively low. And second that
1707640	1711520	a large amount of this intermediate will exist in equilibrium with the starting material
1711520	1717200	because the intermediate is lower in energy. The second step of the mechanism reaches a
1717220	1721740	considerably higher transition state energy which tells me that this is a rate limiting
1721740	1727460	step of the reaction. Since this step is expected to proceed much more slowly than the others
1727460	1733960	by virtue of the energy change taking place. Finally the intramolecular proton relocation
1733960	1738580	or hydrogen relocation takes place quickly and irreversibly once that last intermediate
1738580	1743980	has formed. This creates a product of greater stability than the original starting materials
1744120	1751120	and my reaction is complete. So today we've taken a look at how chemists communicate chemical
1752120	1756520	transitions to one another. We do this in much the same way that a cartoonist tells
1756520	1763520	a story with pains showing punctuated depictions of a system as it undergoes changes. We started
1764080	1769540	with the phenomenon of resonance or delocalization of electrons. And we talked about how multiple
1769560	1774640	resonance contributors contained in brackets and separated by straight two headed arrows
1774640	1781640	can be mentally combined in a mathematical average to produce the resonance hybrid.
1781720	1786520	We looked at how to write a reaction scheme which communicates the four crucial details
1786520	1793520	of a reaction, the starting materials, the products, the conditions and the reversibility.
1793680	1797480	And we discussed how the choice of arrows separating the starting materials and products
1797620	1803700	give us a little bit of information about that reversibility. Then we explored the art
1803700	1808540	of depicting mechanisms in which schemes are expanded into their elementary steps and the
1808540	1813660	motion of electrons is indicated by curved arrows pointing from the original location
1813660	1820220	to their final destination in a given step. And finally we took a look at a reaction coordinate
1820220	1825260	diagram and how it shows us the energetic landscape of a chemical change making such
1825280	1830600	details as the transition state and intermediate energies and rate limiting steps all evident
1830600	1837040	to us. As we progress through the remainder of this course, we're going to rely heavily
1837040	1841800	on what we've learned regarding chemical drawing. And next time we'll put some of these drawing
1841800	1847840	skills into practice as we investigate the acid based properties of organic compounds.
1847840	1848360	I'll see you then.
