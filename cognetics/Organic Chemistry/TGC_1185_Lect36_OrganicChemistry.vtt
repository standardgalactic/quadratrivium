00:00.000 --> 00:16.880
Welcome to our closing lecture on organic chemistry.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.320
The final lecture of this course is bittersweet for me, but it's also exciting for me to

00:21.320 --> 00:25.300
think about how much you've learned and that you are now ready to take that knowledge

00:25.300 --> 00:29.160
with you out into the world.

00:29.160 --> 00:34.600
We spent 35 lectures exploring the definition of organic chemistry, the theories upon which

00:34.600 --> 00:40.120
it is built, and many examples of how organic chemistry as a science has touched our lives

00:40.120 --> 00:43.440
and steered our history as a species.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.240
It's unlikely that Lavassier and Buller ever dreamed that simply by challenging historical

00:48.240 --> 00:53.320
ideas that they would help to start 300 years of experimentation, which would ultimately

00:53.320 --> 00:59.120
lead us to where we are today, at the precipice of understanding the origins of our own existence.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.800
The scientists who follow them carry that understanding forward in ways which have improved

01:04.800 --> 01:09.380
the lives of billions of people on the planet today, and countless more who will come after

01:09.380 --> 01:11.880
them.

01:11.880 --> 01:17.120
So now that we understand and appreciate the contribution of these past researchers,

01:17.120 --> 01:20.200
I think we've earned the right to have a little bit of fun.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.240
Let's turn our attention forward and dream about the future that will be created by

01:24.240 --> 01:28.900
the scientists who stand on the shoulders of these giants, who helped us understand the

01:28.900 --> 01:33.940
chemistry carbon-based compounds.

01:33.940 --> 01:38.660
One of the most exciting frontiers in modern organic chemistry is its interface with other

01:38.660 --> 01:43.900
scientific disciplines like biology, engineering, and earth sciences.

01:43.900 --> 01:49.020
So why not start there and ask the question, how might this interface help us create a

01:49.020 --> 01:54.660
better world for ourselves in the coming decades?

01:54.660 --> 02:01.500
If you'll pardon a pun, our understanding of the origins of life continue to evolve.

02:01.500 --> 02:06.060
Even as the scientific community begins to get a handle on just how complex biological

02:06.060 --> 02:12.940
systems can be, like those driving DNA translation or protein structure and function, we still

02:12.940 --> 02:18.380
struggle with the simplest question of all, how did it all get started?

02:18.380 --> 02:23.060
Even now, evidence of exactly how the first carbon-containing compounds blinked into existence

02:23.060 --> 02:27.740
on earth is scarce.

02:27.740 --> 02:31.820
Stanley Miller gave us some insight into how certain biological materials might form

02:31.820 --> 02:36.980
under the conditions of the primitive earth's atmosphere some three billion years ago.

02:36.980 --> 02:41.620
But there are those who believe that these molecules didn't form on earth at all.

02:41.620 --> 02:48.700
There are those who think that life may have literally fallen to earth from outer space.

02:48.700 --> 02:54.860
In 1969, a huge fireball rocketed across the Australian sky before separating into several

02:54.860 --> 03:01.300
pieces and finally crashing to earth near the town of Merchison, Victoria.

03:01.300 --> 03:04.900
This meteorite strike is unusual in three important ways.

03:04.900 --> 03:09.940
First, it was witnessed so there's no debating its extraterrestrial origins.

03:09.940 --> 03:15.360
Second, it was rather large, delivering more than 100 kilograms of material to the surface

03:15.360 --> 03:16.900
of the earth.

03:17.900 --> 03:22.980
And finally, the most fascinating characteristic of this meteorite is that it appears to have

03:22.980 --> 03:29.100
carried with it a buffet of organic compounds which is hard to believe.

03:29.100 --> 03:33.840
As spectroscopic techniques continue to advance, the Merchison meteorite has been analyzed from

03:33.840 --> 03:39.860
time to time, always with new and interesting results.

03:39.860 --> 03:45.020
In 2010, for example, a group of researchers attempted to extract organic compounds from

03:45.020 --> 03:48.420
freshly broken samples of the Merchison.

03:48.420 --> 03:53.940
Now careful chromatographic separation of the extracts, analyzed by mass spectrometry

03:53.940 --> 03:59.900
and NMR spectroscopy techniques, revealed that the meteorite contained not just a few,

03:59.900 --> 04:06.580
but thousands or even tens of thousands of different small organic molecules all encased

04:06.580 --> 04:07.420
within it.

04:09.940 --> 04:13.840
Of course, the implication here is that just like the meteorite, which is unquestionably

04:13.840 --> 04:19.800
an authentic space rock, those molecules which were trapped within its matrix must have fallen

04:19.800 --> 04:22.360
from space.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.280
So this brings up new questions.

04:24.280 --> 04:31.920
If the Merchison results are accurate, just how did these compounds get there?

04:31.920 --> 04:37.000
Even more tantalizing evidence of extraterrestrial organics has been collected in recent decades

04:37.000 --> 04:42.840
as organizations like NASA launch sophisticated probes in telescopes like the Spitzer Space

04:42.840 --> 04:44.840
Telescope.

04:44.840 --> 04:50.000
The Spitzer operated in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, and it looked

04:50.000 --> 04:56.520
at interstellar space through infrared eyes, sensing absorptions caused by organic molecular

04:56.520 --> 05:04.400
vibrations occurring tens or even hundreds of thousands of light years away or more.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.560
Perhaps not surprisingly, in light of the Merchison meteorite results, Spitzer indeed

05:08.560 --> 05:15.960
found not only evidence of carbon, but specifically of sp3 hybridized carbon.

05:15.960 --> 05:21.160
A clear absorbance at 2900 wave numbers was reported when the telescope was pointed at

05:21.160 --> 05:23.640
interstellar space.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.920
That's an absorption corresponding to the CH bond vibrations one would find in a typical

05:28.920 --> 05:33.080
organic compound.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.800
The implication?

05:34.800 --> 05:42.160
That organic carbon does indeed exist in abundance in regions of space which harbor little else.

05:42.160 --> 05:47.480
It would seem that even the void of deep space may harbor the seeds of life.

05:47.480 --> 05:52.440
So the more we search, the more we seem to find evidence that organics can spontaneously

05:52.440 --> 05:57.480
form, not only on Earth, but elsewhere in the universe, potentially seeding the cosmos

05:57.480 --> 06:01.920
with life.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.600
Yet another curiosity which scientists are still trying to address is this.

06:06.600 --> 06:12.000
All life on Earth that we know of uses L, or left-handed, amino acids as the principal

06:12.000 --> 06:15.620
constituent of the proteins of life.

06:15.620 --> 06:20.360
That means that even though we may think of ourselves as being achiral at the macroscopic

06:20.360 --> 06:28.280
level, we are in fact not symmetrical when we look at ourselves through molecular eyes.

06:28.280 --> 06:33.600
For example, the amino acids and proteins making up the skin and muscle in your arms

06:33.600 --> 06:36.000
are all of one-handedness.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.720
So if you could look at your right index finger and your left index finger with atomic resolution,

06:41.720 --> 06:45.400
they would in fact not be reflections of one another.

06:45.400 --> 06:51.280
So at the molecular level, you are chiral.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.040
Yet every reliable source of data on abiologically synthesized organics, from those formed in

06:57.040 --> 07:01.200
Miller's primitive Earth experiment, to the interstellar stowaways on the Merchison

07:01.200 --> 07:09.880
meteorite, suggests that racemic mixtures of these compounds are created in natural processes.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.960
This leads us to two important questions.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.360
First, why L amino acids?

07:16.360 --> 07:20.280
The molecular machinery which our bodies use to create proteins and enzymes we need to

07:20.280 --> 07:25.680
live are chiral themselves, so it makes sense that we should use all of one-handed amino

07:25.680 --> 07:27.240
acid or the other.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.840
So clearly, nature had to make a choice early on.

07:30.840 --> 07:37.360
Left-handed biochemistry or right-handed biochemistry?

07:37.360 --> 07:42.200
But is there any real difference between our biochemical world and its mirror image?

07:42.200 --> 07:47.120
Is there some quantum mechanical effect that we don't understand perfectly which dictated

07:47.120 --> 07:48.600
that choice?

07:48.600 --> 07:56.560
Or was it a cosmic coin toss that led us to be composed of L amino acids instead of D?

07:56.560 --> 08:01.520
This question was effectively answered in the early 1990s, when the labs of Stephen Kent

08:01.520 --> 08:07.320
at Scripps Research Institute created a right-handed version of a naturally occurring left-handed

08:07.320 --> 08:11.240
protein, HIV protease.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.560
Kent used modified techniques pioneered by Bruce Merrifield to create a perfect mirror

08:15.560 --> 08:18.620
image of that protein.

08:18.620 --> 08:24.440
He then tested it for activity against mirror images of its normal substrates, finding that

08:24.440 --> 08:29.720
the chemical activity of his right-handed protein was identical in every way to the left-handed

08:29.720 --> 08:33.080
version.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.040
This closed the book on the question of handedness in the chemistry of life.

08:37.040 --> 08:41.600
Racemic sources of material which led to our left-handed biochemistry should be equally

08:41.600 --> 08:45.200
capable of seeding right-handed biochemistry.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.600
So if we ever do make contact with extraterrestrial carbon-based life forms, it would appear

08:50.600 --> 08:56.400
that there's a 50% chance that their biochemistry will be not exactly the same as our own, but

08:56.400 --> 09:00.520
rather a perfect reflection of our own.

09:00.520 --> 09:04.340
But Kent's research opened up a whole new vein of inquiry.

09:04.340 --> 09:08.600
Now that we know that D amino acids can be used to create enzymes with every bit as much

09:08.600 --> 09:14.920
power to promote highly specialized chemistry, researchers are trying to develop new therapeutics

09:15.280 --> 09:20.760
made from those D amino acids.

09:20.760 --> 09:25.160
It may be that someday these mirror images, which previously had no use in biology, or

09:25.160 --> 09:30.920
little use in biology, will find use in the hands of humans who can not only rationally

09:30.920 --> 09:36.440
design them, but produce them in laboratories for use as medicines, chiral catalysts and

09:36.440 --> 09:36.800
more.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.960
When humans sought to take to the air and fly, birds and their wings were an obvious

09:49.960 --> 09:53.080
inspiration for the design of early aircraft.

09:53.080 --> 09:58.160
In fact, evidence of working bird-shaped gliders may date as far back as ancient Egypt.

09:58.160 --> 10:04.040
Now, scientists call this kind of design strategy one of observing the properties of natural

10:04.040 --> 10:08.640
systems and applying them to engineering, bio-mimicry.

10:08.640 --> 10:13.600
And we've been doing this for a very, very long time.

10:13.600 --> 10:19.040
And just as the designs of some planes, trains and boats have been inspired by nature, as

10:19.040 --> 10:24.040
we learn more and more about the biomolecular world, scientists, more and more, turn to

10:24.040 --> 10:29.320
the biological for inspiration in their designs of useful compounds.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.880
This may one day help us to accomplish similar chemistry to the molecules of life, but with

10:33.880 --> 10:38.800
smaller compounds which are more easily obtained and whose properties are more easily adjusted

10:38.800 --> 10:44.240
and tuned than their larger biological counterparts.

10:44.240 --> 10:50.040
We call this practice of imitating the function of biological molecules, biomimetic chemistry.

10:50.040 --> 10:54.720
And it may provide the springboard that we need to create small molecules with the exact

10:54.720 --> 10:59.600
chemical properties that we need to accomplish a number of tasks.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.360
Take the example of oxygen transport and storage.

11:03.360 --> 11:08.560
Our bodies and those of many other animals rely on hemoglobin to bind, transport and

11:08.560 --> 11:14.040
release oxygen within our bodies so that our cells have the oxidizer that they need to

11:14.040 --> 11:21.040
carry out cellular respiration and give us life-sustaining chemical energy.

11:21.040 --> 11:26.320
Hemoglobin consists of four proteins bound together in a quaternary structure which supports

11:26.320 --> 11:29.400
four organometallic heme molecules.

11:30.400 --> 11:35.840
It's here at the iron atom within the heme that oxygen binds when it is present in great

11:35.840 --> 11:39.920
abundance, like in the air that enters our lungs.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.800
Now that oxygen is then released in environments which are lower in oxygen concentration like

11:44.800 --> 11:49.400
the tissues of our body where it's most needed.

11:49.400 --> 11:55.040
The elegant balance of binding and releasing oxygen is mediated by the protein itself which

11:55.040 --> 12:00.120
affects solubility and tunes the chemistry of the heme so that it grabs oxygen with striking

12:00.120 --> 12:04.880
efficiency in the lungs, then transports it through the blood and releases it at just

12:04.880 --> 12:07.280
the right time as well.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.960
So proteins in a way are nature's organic chemists, tinkering with the properties of

12:11.960 --> 12:16.240
small molecules and asserting an influence over how they behave.

12:16.240 --> 12:20.080
Well, that sounds a lot like something that humans are learning to do for themselves,

12:20.080 --> 12:23.400
doesn't it?

12:23.400 --> 12:27.440
So can we abandon the large protein and substitute the knowledge that we've gained over the

12:27.440 --> 12:33.800
past two centuries to create other molecules which can imitate the properties of hemoglobin?

12:33.800 --> 12:36.360
Researchers at the University of Leeds think so.

12:36.360 --> 12:41.720
They successfully synthesized what they called porphyrin-chord hyperbranched polymers which

12:41.720 --> 12:46.880
have oxygen binding properties, very similar to hemoglobin, but can be easily created in

12:46.880 --> 12:50.600
a laboratory.

12:50.600 --> 12:55.240
Looking at the structure of a porphyrin-chord hyperbranched polymer, it's easy to see where

12:55.240 --> 12:58.560
the inspiration came from for this compound.

12:58.560 --> 13:03.280
It's also easy to see how someday compounds like this one might offer a non-biological

13:03.280 --> 13:08.080
oxygen carrier for use in medical applications like surgery.

13:08.080 --> 13:12.320
An artificial blood like this would all but eliminate concerns over disease transmission

13:12.320 --> 13:18.120
or incompatible antibodies associated with human blood transfusions.

13:18.120 --> 13:23.680
With available polymer arms which could be modified to achieve almost any solubility,

13:23.680 --> 13:28.080
oxygen binding affinity, or other property that we need, we might even see compounds

13:28.080 --> 13:31.920
like this in use one day, colonizing new planets.

13:31.920 --> 13:37.240
The tenuous Martian atmosphere, for example, has a very small amount of oxygen in it naturally.

13:37.240 --> 13:42.760
Now, solutions of biomimetic oxygen carriers might someday be used to extract that small

13:42.760 --> 13:47.600
amount of oxygen from outside of a structure, pumping it back inside the building where

13:47.600 --> 13:57.120
it's released, essentially creating a building which breathes so that its occupants can too.

13:57.120 --> 14:02.280
But our ability to imitate life goes far beyond creating small mimetic molecules.

14:02.280 --> 14:08.240
Remember that Ken was able to construct not only working copies of HIV protease from L-amino

14:08.240 --> 14:11.680
acids but from D-amino acids as well.

14:11.680 --> 14:17.280
This shows that even large biomolecules can be created abiologically and then used to

14:17.280 --> 14:22.160
enhance or even create biological systems.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.960
Yet another exciting advancement was made by scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute

14:26.960 --> 14:29.240
in 2010.

14:29.240 --> 14:34.440
This is when they reported that they had chemically synthesized a genome of over one million base

14:34.440 --> 14:43.280
pairs, then substituted that DNA for the native DNA in a bacteria.

14:43.280 --> 14:48.800
In this proof-of-concept experiment, the researchers made just a few small changes between the natural

14:48.800 --> 14:54.120
DNA of the bacteria and their synthetic form, targeting regions of the genome which were

14:54.120 --> 14:59.440
known to act as structural supports rather than those coding for specific proteins.

14:59.440 --> 15:04.280
Now, such a simple change was enough that it could be detected in the cells which had

15:04.280 --> 15:09.400
accepted the transplant without compromising the viability of those cells.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.680
So the genetic deck was stacked in favor of success in this experiment.

15:14.680 --> 15:20.640
Still, this achievement will no doubt take us to the next level of biomolecular engineering,

15:20.640 --> 15:26.640
as it demonstrates clearly and effectively that the molecular machinery of life is modular

15:26.640 --> 15:31.200
and can be transplanted from one cell to another.

15:31.200 --> 15:37.040
This experiment shows it with enough understanding and cautious, dedicated effort, genetic material

15:37.040 --> 15:42.960
and the cellular machinery which uses it can be mixed, matched and altered to produce

15:42.960 --> 15:46.000
any biochemistry that we desire.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.040
Someday we may even create entire cells from nothing more than chemicals on a lab bench

15:51.040 --> 15:57.280
using organic reactions which are available to us today.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.520
Just imagine what these cells might be designed to accomplish.

16:00.520 --> 16:05.840
We could literally synthesize self-replicating microscopic production plants for fixed nitrogen

16:05.840 --> 16:10.800
with nitrogenase activity many-fold more powerful than rhizobia.

16:10.800 --> 16:15.440
We could create super red blood cells to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood used

16:15.440 --> 16:18.320
in transfusions.

16:18.320 --> 16:23.400
Imagine vast pools of photosynthetic bacteria of our own design, harvesting light and converting

16:23.400 --> 16:29.680
it into biomass or even energy faster and better than any living thing ever has.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.560
All to the benefit of mankind.

16:33.560 --> 16:38.600
The possibilities are truly limitless and the inspiration for it all harkens back to

16:38.600 --> 16:45.720
that day in 1828 when Voler accidentally created urea on his lab bench and realized that mastering

16:45.720 --> 16:51.760
the chemistry of carbon didn't require any mystical vital force but careful study and

16:51.760 --> 16:56.640
application of the scientific method.

16:56.640 --> 17:01.920
I'd also like to challenge you with one of humanity's major environmental concerns.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.260
We spend a lot of time looking at how chemists build upon carbon scaffolds to make organic

17:06.260 --> 17:09.480
compounds with new structures and properties.

17:09.480 --> 17:14.440
And we saw how some of the major entry points for carbon into organic chemistry include

17:14.440 --> 17:19.280
the hydrocarbons isolated from fossil fuels which can be halogenated to make reactive

17:19.280 --> 17:24.760
substrates for substitution and elimination reactions.

17:24.760 --> 17:29.640
We discussed how biological systems can also bring carbon into the organic world.

17:29.640 --> 17:33.640
Science convert carbon dioxide into biomass which makes its way through the food chain

17:33.640 --> 17:38.120
where it's used by organisms to produce all of the necessary chemicals to exist, some

17:38.120 --> 17:42.880
of which are extracted from those living systems by opportunistic chemists like Justice von

17:42.880 --> 17:45.040
Liebig.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.560
But what about the exit point for carbon from organic chemistry?

17:48.560 --> 17:54.080
It's a fair question, it's actually a very good question.

17:54.080 --> 17:59.560
As our activities as humans concentrates carbon in our fuels and biomass, we have to ask

17:59.560 --> 18:04.240
the question, where does that carbon go when we're done with it?

18:04.240 --> 18:08.000
Carbon containing compounds contain a great deal of chemical energy.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.680
And whether we are burning fuels or using foods for respiration, a large amount of the

18:12.680 --> 18:17.820
organic material in the world is destined to become carbon dioxide.

18:17.820 --> 18:21.880
And although it isn't particularly pleasant to think about when humans and other creatures

18:21.880 --> 18:26.920
are done with their biomass for good, decomposition naturally releases much of their carbon as

18:26.920 --> 18:30.680
CO2 as well.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.880
Now that might not sound like a big problem, after all carbon dioxide's a gas so it's

18:34.880 --> 18:37.640
just carried away by the atmosphere, right?

18:37.640 --> 18:39.400
Well not quite.

18:39.400 --> 18:44.120
We know from our discussions on spectroscopy just how powerful an IR absorber the carbon

18:44.120 --> 18:49.600
oxygen double bond can be because the vibrations of those very polar bonds in the molecule

18:49.600 --> 18:52.280
give it a strong absorption.

18:52.280 --> 18:56.800
Recall also from Sir William Herschel's experiments that when objects absorb infrared

18:56.800 --> 19:01.680
light, they tend to heat up.

19:01.680 --> 19:07.120
So carbon dioxide acts as what we call a greenhouse gas, absorbing radiated heat from

19:07.120 --> 19:12.880
the Earth's surface leading to climate change when it's not properly balanced.

19:12.880 --> 19:17.480
This has led to a global movement to devise ways to store and use carbon dioxide in ways

19:17.480 --> 19:21.280
which prevent its release into the atmosphere.

19:21.280 --> 19:27.040
For example, the U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that 2.4 billion metric tons

19:27.040 --> 19:33.000
of industrially produced CO2 could be stored by injecting it into subsurface structures

19:33.000 --> 19:38.360
like unminable coal seams where it can become adsorbed to the surface of the underground

19:38.360 --> 19:41.400
deposit.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.880
The concern here is that there are other gases already bound to coal in seams like these,

19:45.880 --> 19:47.800
most notably methane.

19:47.800 --> 19:52.200
Obviously, those who advocate this method are betting on irreversible strong binding

19:52.200 --> 19:57.640
of carbon dioxide to subsurface structures like the carbon-rich coal deposits of coal

19:57.640 --> 20:02.120
seams, binding so strong that hopefully it can displace methane.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.720
Now, could such an idea work?

20:04.720 --> 20:10.040
Well, there's a good chance that it would, but it depends on how well each environmental

20:10.040 --> 20:15.760
gas absorbs to the stationary coal phase relative to its tendency to vaporize.

20:15.760 --> 20:20.720
In complex geological systems like these, the overall composition and chemical behavior

20:20.720 --> 20:26.000
of formations can be tricky to predict, so we don't know the best method for sequestering

20:26.000 --> 20:29.680
CO2 until we try and see the results.

20:29.680 --> 20:35.200
Just remember, it's all about those partitioning coefficients.

20:35.200 --> 20:43.960
So, organic chemistry may change the world we live in, but it may also play a pivotal

20:43.960 --> 20:48.560
role in getting us off of that world someday very soon.

20:48.560 --> 20:52.720
There are those who estimate that the Earth's current population of seven billion people

20:52.720 --> 20:55.680
would not be naturally sustainable.

20:55.680 --> 21:00.680
That without chemical advancements like the Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation,

21:00.680 --> 21:03.440
global famine would already have ensued.

21:03.440 --> 21:09.600
Yet, the global population continues to expand, pressing ever closer to the nine billion or

21:09.600 --> 21:13.520
so that could be fed using modern technologies.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.960
But what then?

21:14.960 --> 21:19.160
When we've completely exhausted the ability of our planet to provide for us, even with

21:19.160 --> 21:22.680
some assistance from science, what's next?

21:22.680 --> 21:28.160
Well, even if we one day master the chemistry of nitrogen fixation, there will still come

21:28.160 --> 21:33.480
a day when there simply isn't enough land to feed every mouth on the planet.

21:33.480 --> 21:37.760
The natural next step is that we look beyond the Earth for places to live.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.280
We continue to expand our knowledge and carry our species into the reaches of the solar

21:41.280 --> 21:45.120
system and eventually the cosmos.

21:45.120 --> 21:50.240
To do so, at least to get started, will require that we take with us everything and every

21:50.240 --> 21:56.760
one that a colony might need to survive transport to and establishing that colony on a new celestial

21:56.760 --> 21:59.680
body.

21:59.680 --> 22:04.680
But that leads to a number of logistical questions, not the least of which is, how do we get that

22:04.680 --> 22:08.520
much material off of the Earth and into space?

22:08.520 --> 22:10.400
That's a valid question.

22:10.400 --> 22:15.240
See with current rocket technology, it costs thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars

22:15.240 --> 22:20.400
just to get one pound of material into orbit around the Earth.

22:20.400 --> 22:25.320
So step one of colonizing space is to find a cost-effective way to escape the gravity

22:25.320 --> 22:27.280
of Mother Earth.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.240
Now there are many possible approaches to this challenge.

22:30.240 --> 22:36.160
And one very interesting proposal is the construction of a so-called space elevator, which would

22:36.160 --> 22:42.360
consist of a line which reaches from the equator of the Earth to an altitude of about 36,000

22:42.360 --> 22:47.880
kilometers, the altitude at which a geostationary orbit is obtained.

22:47.880 --> 22:53.160
Of course, building a tower more than 40,000 times the height of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai

22:53.160 --> 22:56.480
presents some obvious structural challenges.

22:56.480 --> 23:01.360
It's unlikely that any such structure could support its own weight.

23:01.360 --> 23:05.400
One proposed solution to this problem is to use a structure which is supported not

23:05.400 --> 23:11.840
by compression but by tension, constructing a cable with a counterweight reaching so far

23:11.840 --> 23:17.560
into space that its center of mass is above 36,000 kilometers and its overall length is

23:17.560 --> 23:24.040
about 100,000 kilometers so that it's held taut under its own momentum as it turns with

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
the Earth.

23:25.040 --> 23:31.340
Now, using a cable like this, a mechanical climber could simply move up the cable, taking

23:31.340 --> 23:36.260
its payload of people and supplies to the necessary altitude to escape Earth's gravity

23:36.260 --> 23:38.220
and reach outer space.

23:38.220 --> 23:44.020
Now, estimates are that a device like this, though profoundly expensive to build, once

23:44.020 --> 23:49.460
operating could lower the cost of delivering material into space by more than tenfold.

23:49.460 --> 23:54.540
So it would cost just a few hundred dollars per pound to reach orbit, instead of the thousands

23:54.540 --> 23:59.860
or even tens of thousands of dollars that are currently required.

23:59.860 --> 24:04.980
So in order to construct this modern marvel, a cable about 100,000 kilometers in length

24:04.980 --> 24:06.340
would have to be produced.

24:06.340 --> 24:08.820
Now, let's think about that for a moment.

24:08.820 --> 24:13.140
That's more than twice the circumference of the Earth, nearly a quarter of the way to

24:13.140 --> 24:15.060
the moon.

24:15.060 --> 24:20.300
But to build a cable that long which can withstand the tension produced by its orbiting counterweight,

24:20.300 --> 24:25.040
we're going to have to find the lightest, most durable material with the greatest tensile

24:25.040 --> 24:29.180
strength to weight ratio ever developed.

24:29.180 --> 24:33.860
And the front runner for that material is carbon nanotubes.

24:33.860 --> 24:39.180
Under one proposal, nanotubes several meters in length could be woven together into a rope,

24:39.180 --> 24:44.300
creating the longest man-made object in human history and providing us with that cable that

24:44.300 --> 24:47.180
we need to make the space elevator a reality.

24:47.180 --> 24:52.420
Now, this may seem like an insurmountable target, a three meter long nanotube, especially

24:52.420 --> 24:58.380
when you consider that that rivals the length of a completely extended strand of human DNA.

24:58.380 --> 25:02.660
But researchers have reported recently that they've managed to create single nanotubes

25:02.660 --> 25:08.060
with lengths approaching that necessary mark needed to form the proposed cable.

25:08.060 --> 25:11.740
So it would seem that soon the only thing standing in the way of a space elevator will

25:11.740 --> 25:16.180
be our own imagination, and about 20 billion dollars.

25:16.180 --> 25:21.180
Now, if this project ever takes place, it would be a fitting application for these allotropes

25:21.180 --> 25:22.580
of carbon.

25:22.580 --> 25:27.220
The same element which makes up the scaffold of the molecules of life on Earth will also

25:27.220 --> 25:34.740
make up the scaffold of the vehicle which we use to propel that life forward into outer space.

25:34.740 --> 25:39.100
So our day dreaming about the role of organic chemistry in surmounting the challenges faced

25:39.100 --> 25:43.440
by humanity in coming generations is coming to an end.

25:43.440 --> 25:47.540
But just because our time together is up doesn't mean that your time with organic chemistry

25:47.540 --> 25:49.540
has to be over.

25:49.540 --> 25:56.020
If you found the last 36 lectures gratifying, I encourage you to carry your knowledge forward

25:56.020 --> 26:00.500
and use it as a basis on which to learn from other chemists.

26:00.500 --> 26:05.380
You now have all the tools necessary to read and digest current chemical literature created

26:05.380 --> 26:09.940
by researchers in the field, intended for those with an interest in the science of organic

26:09.940 --> 26:12.780
chemistry.

26:12.780 --> 26:17.100
Countless university and public libraries subscribe to such prestigious professional journals

26:17.100 --> 26:22.180
as Science, Nature, and the Journal of the American Chemical Society, as well as more

26:22.180 --> 26:27.020
focused organic chemistry journals like the Journal of Organic Chemistry and Tetrahedron.

26:27.020 --> 26:33.100
I strongly advise you to search out these publications and others like them.

26:33.100 --> 26:38.140
There are a window into the incredible accomplishments being achieved every day by those toiling

26:38.140 --> 26:43.260
in the lab hoping to develop the next great catalyst like Sabatier or find a new way to

26:43.260 --> 26:46.580
isolate vital compounds like Tzvet.

26:46.580 --> 26:51.580
Perhaps they want to mathematically decrypt the kinetics of reactions like Ingold or decipher

26:51.580 --> 26:55.900
the function of a critical biomolecule the way McKinnon did.

26:55.900 --> 27:00.380
And you now have the tools you need to join in on the conversation.

27:00.380 --> 27:06.020
It has been my distinct privilege to help you get started on what I hope will be a lifelong

27:06.020 --> 27:10.780
journey exploring and appreciating the rich and beautiful chemistry which breathes life

27:10.780 --> 27:16.020
into our planet, the chemistry of molecules based on carbon.

27:16.020 --> 27:16.900
Thank you for joining me.
