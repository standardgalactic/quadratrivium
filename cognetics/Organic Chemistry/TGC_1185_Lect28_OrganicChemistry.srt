1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,840
Last time we started considering how spectroscopists use light as a means of probing the structure

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,440
and behavior of molecular systems.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,120
Specifically, we took a look at the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,040
spectrum and how radiation of this energy is perfectly suited to excite electrons from

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,120
one molecular orbital to another, giving us a way to probe the energetics of these kinds

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,520
of systems.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,200
Today, we're going to take a look at the red end of the visible spectrum and what lies

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,720
beyond that.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,880
Just like UV light, infrared light from the sun is constantly bombarding us.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,760
Like UV light, though, infrared light isn't associated with any particularly dangerous

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,240
health effects.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,480
Infrared is still a very interesting part of the electromagnetic spectrum, though.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,580
Objects at or near room temperature naturally emit this wavelength of light, and that includes

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,080
you.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,800
Believe it or not, you glow in the dark.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,760
The catch is that you glow in the dark at too long of a wavelength to be detected by

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,720
the human eye.

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,480
Now, scientists like those at NASA have developed cameras and telescopes capable of detecting

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,920
the infrared emissions of both small objects here on Earth and of celestial bodies on the

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,080
other side of the known universe, creating false color images like these in which the

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,080
detected infrared light has been shown as different colors.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,240
But infrared light isn't just radiated.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,680
Like all other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, it can also be absorbed.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,240
And just as a warm object cools by radiating energy as I are light, so can an object be

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,000
warmed by absorbing it.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,080
Now, last time I made it sound like Ritter was stricken with a divine inspiration to

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,680
look outside the blue end of the visible spectrum.

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,000
But in fact, his experiment was almost certainly inspired by one conducted earlier that year

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,400
by another English scientist, Sir William Herschel.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Herschel was a prolific astronomer, a composer and a mathematician, a true Renaissance man.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,800
And he was the one who made a truly inspired discovery when he asked a simple question,

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,160
which color of light is most effective at heating a surface when shined on it?

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,360
To answer this question, he used a prism to diffract sunlight into a spectrum and placed

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:52,760
thermometers with blackened bulbs at regular intervals within that spectrum.

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,720
So let's bring up this IR spectrum, or visible spectrum, with infrared just outside of it.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,840
So Herschel saw that the temperature indicated by his thermometers increased across the spectrum,

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,680
from blue to red.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,440
And knowing what we do about the amount of energy contained in photons of different wavelengths,

39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,520
it might seem a little bit counterintuitive at first.

40
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,880
But Herschel essentially proved that red light is absorbed more efficiently by objects that

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,420
are near room temperature.

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,840
But the pertinent result of Herschel's experiment wasn't the trend he saw in the visible spectrum.

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,360
His real breakthrough came when he wondered if the trend continued beyond the spectrum

44
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,400
that he could see.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,320
And sure enough, when he placed another thermometer just beyond the red portion of the spectrum,

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,920
it read an even higher temperature than the one in the red light.

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,680
Clearly, there was some form of light beyond the red portion of the spectrum, prompting

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,120
him to call his new discovery, infrared light.

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,280
Today we're going to take a look at how modern scientists use Herschel's discovery to probe

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,840
the structures of organic compounds and make new discoveries today more than 200 years

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
after its initial discovery.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,640
Modern spectroscopy in the infrared region is conducted using instruments very similar

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,760
to those used for the UV visible.

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,920
The simplest of these will follow the same format, starting with a light source, but

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,640
in this case a light source which emits powerful infrared light.

56
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,320
That light will again go through a monochromator which will selectively direct one wavelength

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,080
at a time through a beam splitter.

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,920
The beam splitter will split the beam into two, giving us two different beams of infrared

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,120
light, one traversing a reference cell, one traversing a sample cell which is exactly

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,160
the same but contains one additive and that's the molecules that we want to analyze.

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,880
As the beams exit, their intensities are measured by two detectors and compared.

62
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,960
Now there are much more sophisticated apparatus, but this is the simplest way to conduct and

63
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,480
therefore to understand infrared.

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Okay, so now that we know how scientists shine infrared light on samples and measure which

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,880
wavelengths of light are absorbed, but we still need to try to understand exactly why

66
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,840
anyone would want to do such a thing.

67
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,400
Now to explain this, I want to show you a molecule called fluorinone on the big screen

68
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,880
here using my ChemDraw Chem3D software.

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
Now we're used to seeing molecules in this kind of configuration when we see them in

70
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,760
textbooks and papers.

71
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,080
Notice that all of the bond lengths and angles are identical and ideal.

72
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,400
The molecule appears perfectly planar.

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,120
Every bond in my benzene rings is exactly 120 degrees.

74
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,160
Everything looks exactly as it should, right?

75
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,240
But do molecules really look like this?

76
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,760
Do they really act like this?

77
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,120
Are they rigid, unmoving, and symmetrical?

78
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,720
No, of course not.

79
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,440
This representation is done using average bond angles and average bond lengths of a dynamic

80
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,240
set of bonds.

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,320
They really look more like this.

82
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,280
What's running right now is a dynamic simulation which approximates the random motions of each

83
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,680
atom within a molecule.

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,320
The bonds between and among those atoms are stretching, bending and twisting in many different

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
ways.

86
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,400
Just put more simply, bonds vibrate.

87
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,320
They don't all vibrate in the same way either.

88
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,440
Notice that the carbon-oxygen bond is oscillating very slowly compared to some of those carbon-hydrogen

89
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,880
bonds.

90
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,960
If you watch for a while, you can see not only individual bonds stretching and compressing,

91
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,840
but other sets of bonds are opening and closing like scissors and even twisting.

92
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,200
This is really evident when I turn the molecule to look at it edge-on.

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,320
Instead of being perfectly flat and planar, you'll notice that some of the vibrations

94
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,320
cause the molecule to flex and twist in and out of the plane that we usually use to represent

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,820
it.

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,540
Let me stop my simulation now and bring my molecule back to its idealized state.

97
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,220
So we're used to seeing the molecules drawn in this way, but to the eyes of a seasoned

98
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,900
chemist, it's apparent that they really aren't like this.

99
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,900
When it comes to actually modeling how molecules behave, we have to learn how to think of a

100
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:43,340
picture like this in terms of that animation that we saw previously.

101
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,760
In order to understand infrared spectroscopy, we need to begin to think of molecules in

102
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,220
terms of that dynamic model that I just showed you, rather than the rigid, idealized structures

103
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,580
that are so often depicted.

104
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,800
So let's begin breaking this down by looking at a set of much simpler molecules and how

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,300
they behave.

106
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,660
First, let's consider carbon monoxide, two atoms joined by a triple bond.

107
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,100
Now with only two atoms, there's only one possible bond vibration which can take place,

108
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,220
a stretching between the atoms.

109
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,700
But what if we move on to carbon dioxide, a molecule with three atoms?

110
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:28,980
Well, now we can conceive of vibrations involving a symmetrical stretch, an asymmetrical stretch,

111
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,900
a symmetrical bend, and an asymmetrical bend.

112
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:42,540
So there are actually four different ways in which a CO2 molecule can vibrate.

113
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,100
If we continue adding atoms, we find that the total number of these vibrations, which

114
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,820
we call vibrational modes, is equal to 3n minus 5, where n is the number of atoms in

115
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,040
a linear molecule, or 3n minus 6 for nonlinear molecules.

116
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,660
So this means that for a compound as simple as methane, we expect to find nine different

117
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,020
types of vibrations going on within that molecule.

118
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,060
Carbon has 24, and even more complex molecules like fluorinone have dozens or even hundreds

119
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:21,980
of vibrational modes, each with their own distinct frequency.

120
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,260
So we've now covered how IR spectroscopy is conducted, and the vibration of bonds and

121
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,100
sets of bonds in organic molecules.

122
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,660
And I'm sure by now you're wondering, what is it that brings these two apparently disparate

123
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,940
concepts together?

124
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,620
The answer is this.

125
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,900
Many bond vibrational frequencies are the same as those of infrared light.

126
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,420
And just as electronic transitions could be promoted by just the right photon in a UV

127
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,620
visible experiment, so can transitions in the vibrations of a molecule be introduced

128
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,260
by just the right infrared photon.

129
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,260
When a bond vibrating in a particular frequency encounters a photon of identical frequency,

130
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,100
that photon can be absorbed, increasing the amplitude of the associated vibration in

131
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,300
the process.

132
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,700
This is the absorption which is measured by the spectrophotometer.

133
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,860
Now the frequencies which correspond to the vibrations of bonds in organic molecules

134
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,500
are on the order of billions of cycles per second, or billions of hertz, much faster

135
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,820
than the model I showed you.

136
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,500
This produces some pretty unwieldy numbers for frequency, of course.

137
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,100
So in IR spectroscopy, we instead use a unit called wave numbers.

138
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,940
A wave number is simply the reciprocal of a photon's wavelength in centimeters.

139
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,020
For example, light with a wavelength of 5 microns, or .0005 centimeters, which is a

140
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:59,580
typical IR wavelength, will have a wave number of 2000, 2000 reciprocal centimeters.

141
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,100
Of course, as you might imagine, we have a pretty good idea of the vibrational frequencies

142
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,660
of different types of bonds near room temperatures.

143
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,620
It's actually easier to predict than you might think.

144
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,860
You simply have to think of atoms and bonds as though they were weights and springs.

145
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,060
Let me demonstrate this for you.

146
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,980
If I connect a set of light weights by a fairly stiff spring and give it some energy, the

147
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,380
vibrational frequency is expected to be fairly high.

148
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,620
And this is because the light weights have only a small amount of momentum which is easily

149
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:40,460
overcome by the strong spring in order to reverse the masses direction.

150
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,580
Of course, right now we have nothing to compare this to, so let's make a change and connect

151
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,280
a heavier weight to the same kind of spring.

152
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,620
You see that the spring needs more time to overcome the greater momentum of the larger

153
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,020
weight, causing the frequency of the oscillation to be lower.

154
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,100
I can also alter the frequency by adjusting the stiffness of the spring.

155
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,580
For example, connecting similar weights to a stronger spring means that the spring can

156
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,020
overcome the momentum of those weights more easily and reverse the motion of the mass

157
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,260
more quickly.

158
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,900
So we've increased the vibrational frequency in this case.

159
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,500
So larger masses and weaker springs lead to slower vibrations.

160
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,660
If we translate this phenomenon from the macroscopic example of weights and springs to the molecular

161
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,720
level, atoms would be our weights and the chemical bonds between them would be our springs.

162
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,020
We would say that larger atoms and weaker bonds lead to slower vibrations.

163
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,180
In other words, a C-H bond should vibrate faster than a carbonyl bond, which should

164
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,220
vibrate faster than a carbon-oxygen ether bond.

165
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:01,300
In fact, this is exactly what we see in IR spectroscopy.

166
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,220
Now there's one more catch to the science of IR spectroscopy.

167
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,220
It's known as the IR Selection Rule.

168
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,100
Now the IR Selection Rule states simply this, that a vibrating bond or set of bonds can only

169
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,820
absorb a photon of the same frequency if that vibration causes a change in the dipole of

170
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,680
the molecule.

171
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,420
No dipole change means no absorption.

172
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Strong dipole change means a strong absorption.

173
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,380
So it should come as no surprise that functional groups which usually have strong dipoles in

174
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:43,300
their bonds are often powerful IR absorbers, while less reactive bonds like alkyl C-H bonds

175
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,660
tend to absorb very weakly or sometimes not even at all.

176
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,380
Now you've probably noticed that most functional groups contain good strong polar bonds to

177
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:59,700
at least one hydrogen or double and triple bonds among larger atoms, sometimes both.

178
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,020
So the signatures associated with the most common functional groups in infrared are typically

179
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:11,660
found at higher frequency regions of the spectrum, whereas the vibrations within the skeleton

180
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:21,380
tend to have absorptions in the lower frequency region of the spectrum on the other side.

181
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,620
The few but distinct absorptions caused by functional groups leads us to define the higher

182
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,860
frequency region of the IR spectrum as the functional group region, because it's often

183
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,460
where we find the information we need to catalog which functional groups are present in the

184
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,780
sample and which are not.

185
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,540
What this region tells us very little about the carbon-carbon bonds within the scaffold

186
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,540
of the molecule, which is usually fairly large with many complex vibrational modes.

187
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,340
Too many to consider individually, but these types of molecular vibrations tend to have

188
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:58,460
lower frequency IR absorptions, so we've labeled that region of the spectrum, the fingerprint

189
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,700
region, for the fact that its complexity makes it difficult to interpret but unique to each

190
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,260
molecule which generates it.

191
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,340
So, let's take a look at a few IR spectra and see if we can make sense of the information

192
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,980
that they contain, starting with the functional group region of some common hydrocarbons.

193
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,300
Let's take a look at three different hydrocarbons with which we're very familiar.

194
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:33,500
The saturated hydrocarbon pentane, one pentene, a terminal alkyne, and one pentine, a terminal

195
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,800
alkyne.

196
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,420
So these molecules are all very similar to one another structurally with one distinct

197
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:45,420
difference, that difference being that the degree of saturation or unsaturation is changing.

198
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,540
So let's begin by taking a look at the infrared spectrum of pentane.

199
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,020
Now we've taken these spectra from a database called the AIST database.

200
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,980
They're available online free of charge, so if you'd like to check them out for yourself,

201
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,140
be sure that you find the URL and have a look.

202
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,060
It's a very, very broad database with lots of really good data to see, certainly more

203
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,820
than I'm going to show you today.

204
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,620
So let's start with pentane again.

205
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,860
Here's my structure.

206
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,940
It's a simple hydrocarbon consisting only of carbon-carbon single bonds and carbon-hydrogen

207
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,740
single bonds, so I expect to see primarily evidence of those kinds of bonds in the molecule.

208
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,140
Now looking at the functional group region, which is over here on the left-hand side at

209
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,220
my higher frequencies and therefore higher wave numbers, I see that there's a very strong

210
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:38,380
absorbance at about 2900 wave numbers, and this is a classic signature for an SP3 hybridized

211
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,780
carbon-hydrogen bond.

212
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,780
The rest of this is the fingerprint of the molecule, which corresponds to the backbone

213
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,540
atoms and their particular vibrations.

214
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,780
So this is a very simple infrared spectrum of a very simple hydrocarbon and a great place

215
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,820
to start.

216
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,980
When I move to one pentane, I'm going to introduce a few changes to the molecule, most notably

217
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,740
the hybridization of two of the carbon atoms which bear CH bonds.

218
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,100
By changing their hybridization state from an SP3 to an SP2, I'm going to increase the

219
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,780
S character of those bonds, and that means that I'm going to make them a little bit tighter,

220
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,460
a little bit tougher, and that means their frequency should increase ever so slightly.

221
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,340
So let's keep our eyes on the functional group region as I switch my spectrum over from

222
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,340
pentane to one pentane.

223
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,980
Here it is, a classic signature of an SP2 CH bond.

224
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,500
I now have an absorption not only at 2900 wave numbers corresponding to my SP3 hybridized

225
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,420
carbon-hydrogen bonds, but I also have a new absorption, which is taking place at about

226
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,140
3100 wave numbers.

227
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,420
Now remember, my axis here is transmittance, so my peaks are actually valleys.

228
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,020
So the lower the spectrum goes, the stronger the absorption is.

229
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,260
Okay, so let's move on to one pentane after we think for just a moment about what kind

230
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,140
of change we expect to see in the functional group region.

231
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,580
I'm going to be changing the hybridization state of at least two of my atoms here.

232
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,380
These two are going to go from SP2 to SP3.

233
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,860
Excuse me, they're going to go from SP2 to SP, and that means they'll have even more

234
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,260
S-character.

235
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,100
And having even more S-character means I expect to see, that's right, an infrared absorption

236
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,140
at an even higher frequency.

237
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,340
So let's make that change now.

238
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,540
Sure enough, here is my absorption at about 3300 wave numbers, a perfect signature for

239
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,580
an SP-hybridized carbon-hydrogen bond, just like the one I have in one pentane.

240
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,420
But remember, we talked about the importance of polarity and how IR is a great tool for

241
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,260
probing the structures and presence of functional groups.

242
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,380
So let's put some more functional groups in and see what happens to our IR spectra.

243
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Let's compare one pentanol to pentanoic acid.

244
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Both compounds, which we know, have very polar CO and OH bonds.

245
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,380
Well, the IR spectrum of one pentanol has a very clear signature for an OH.

246
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,380
It's this large, broad peak here.

247
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,220
Now the peak is fairly broad because OHs have a tendency to hydrogen bond to one another

248
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,420
and exchange back and forth between and among molecules.

249
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,980
And so this broadens their peaks out a little bit because their chemical environments can

250
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,980
change as the experiment progresses.

251
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Nonetheless, I can see it very clearly here.

252
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,980
And on top of that peak, I can also see my SP3 carbon hydrogens.

253
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,980
So what I have here is a very obvious functional group region for an aliphatic alcohol.

254
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Now if I make a slight change here and oxidize my one pentanol down to pentanoic acid, let's see what happens.

255
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Okay, two changes that we can point to directly.

256
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,980
The first of which is that the OH peak has gotten broader,

257
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:17,980
and also that this very large absorbance has come into my spectrum at around 1700 wave numbers.

258
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:26,980
So we can easily explain this broadness here by, again, the exchange of my OH bond from the pentanoic acid,

259
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,980
not the bond itself, mind you, but the hydrogen being exchanged.

260
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,980
But what's causing the really, really powerful absorbance here at 1700 at a lower frequency?

261
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,980
That's the presence of a carbonyl.

262
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,980
Heavier carbon and oxygen atoms lead to lower frequency vibrations in that particular bond.

263
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,980
So once again, my functional group region has given me a very clear signal here.

264
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,980
I have an aliphatic organic acid.

265
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Let's continue and do a few more functional groups.

266
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,980
How about the IR of ketones and esters, some more carbonyl-containing compounds?

267
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,980
Now we should be able to use what we know so far to get a rough idea of what these will look like.

268
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Two pentanone is a very clean IR spectrum here.

269
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Obviously aliphatic because we have strong absorptions here at about 2900.

270
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Now the strong absorption isn't because the carbon-hydrogen bond is very polar actually.

271
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,980
The strong absorption is because there are so many of those bonds in the molecule.

272
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,980
But in addition to that, I have my carbonyl absorbing at about 1700 wave numbers.

273
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,980
So this is a very obvious functional group region for an aliphatic ketone.

274
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,980
It shares some of its features in common with my organic acids,

275
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,980
but it's missing the critical OH signal which would tell me it's an acid.

276
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,980
So you need to think in terms of not only what's present in your spectrum when you're doing an analysis,

277
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,980
but also what's not there.

278
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,980
The absence of peaks can be just as informative as the presence.

279
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,980
Now let's move on to butyl acetate, an ester compound.

280
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Very similar, isn't it, to two pentanone, sp3CHs, and my carbonyl.

281
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,980
But there's another very strong absorbance which is working its way down into the fingerprint region.

282
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,980
But it's so strong that I can easily pick it out.

283
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
It's right here.

284
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:32,980
And this is one of the absorbances which is commonly caused by the presence of a carbon-oxygen single bond.

285
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,980
Remember double bonds are stronger so they create a higher frequency vibration.

286
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Carbon-oxygen single bonds would be weaker but have the same sized atoms.

287
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,980
Therefore we see a lower frequency vibration.

288
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
One last look at the fingerprint region.

289
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Let's take a look at the IR of amines, amines.

290
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,980
I'm going to compare a primary, secondary, and tertiary amine here.

291
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,980
First let's look at the primary amine, pentalamine.

292
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,980
Again, easily seen as an aliphatic.

293
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:15,980
And we also have two absorptions that are slightly higher in frequency than my aliphatic sp3CHs.

294
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,980
And those aren't from an alkyne proton.

295
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,980
Those are from the NH protons here.

296
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,980
This is from an asymmetric stretch and symmetric stretch mode.

297
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,980
In other words, it's the interpretive dance portion of the course now.

298
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,980
In other words, if you think of my head as a nitrogen atom and my hands as being the hydrogens,

299
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,980
there are two vibrational modes there because two hydrogen atoms means they can vibrate symmetrically

300
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,980
or asymmetrically relative to the nitrogen.

301
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,980
Hence two peaks in the NH region of my spectrum.

302
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,980
But what if instead I have a secondary amine like N-methylbutylamine?

303
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Well let's watch the spectrum change.

304
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,980
A lot of similarity there in the functional group region but one very crucial change.

305
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,980
There is only one absorbance now in the NH region of the spectrum.

306
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,980
So this tells me that there's only a single NH and therefore only a single vibrational mode,

307
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,980
only a single stretching mode, which can appear.

308
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
And the trend continues.

309
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:28,980
If I move on to a tertiary amine like ethyl diisopropylamine, let's take a look at the spectrum.

310
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Again, the functional group region looks very similar to the others,

311
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,980
except that there are now no NH stretches to be found whatsoever.

312
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,980
So we can not only detect the presence of amines, but we can detect whether they're primary, secondary, or tertiary,

313
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,980
simply using the functional group region of the spectrum.

314
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:54,980
So the high frequency region of the IR spectrum tells us about the presence or absence of functional groups.

315
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
But what about that lower frequency region?

316
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:03,980
If it's so complex that it defies dissection, why do we bother to collect that information?

317
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,980
Well, we call the low frequency region of the spectrum the fingerprint region,

318
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,980
because just like fingerprints, the complex set of vibrations within the skeleton of a molecule

319
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,980
give it a complex pattern in this region, which is unique to that particular molecule.

320
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,980
So just as a fingerprint can be compared to a reference to identify its owner,

321
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,980
so can the fingerprint region of an IR spectrum be compared to a standard to identify a molecule.

322
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Let's work through a quick example here to see if I can illustrate my point.

323
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,980
I'm going to show you the IR spectra of four different aliphatic esters.

324
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:47,980
Butylacetate, isobutylacetate, secbutylacetate, and tbutylacetate.

325
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,980
All of these have the same molecular formula, and they all have the same kinds of bonds,

326
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:57,980
carbon-carbon singles, carbon-hydrogen singles, carbonyls, and carbon-oxygen singles.

327
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,980
So when we look at the functional group region of these molecules and try to tell them apart,

328
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,980
we're going to be a little disappointed.

329
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Let's start with butylacetate.

330
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,980
We can break down the spectrum very easily.

331
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,980
2,900 wave numbers means it's aliphatic, lots of carbon-hydrogen bonds with sp3 carbons,

332
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,980
clear presence of a carbonyl, and also the clear presence of a CO single bond.

333
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,980
But what about all these other little absorptions in here?

334
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,980
Are they really useless?

335
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
No, they're not.

336
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Because when I switch my spectrum from butylacetate to isobutylacetate,

337
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,980
I want you to keep your eye on the functional group region the first time.

338
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Hardly anything has changed.

339
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,980
So looking at this from a functional group region perspective, the two spectra appear almost identical.

340
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Let me go back again to butylacetate.

341
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,980
All the same maxima, all the same peaks, and essentially the same frequencies.

342
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
So could we tell them apart from one another?

343
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,980
And the answer, of course, is yes, as long as I have a reference spectrum.

344
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,980
If I know the specific pattern that occurs in the functional group region,

345
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,980
take a look at this now as I change the fingerprint region, excuse me.

346
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,980
Take a look at the fingerprint region as I switch the spectrum back to isobutylacetate once more.

347
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
We see some specific changes now.

348
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:31,980
If I switch to secbutylacetate, even greater difference, moving over to tbutylacetate, even more variability.

349
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,980
So even though I can't dissect every peak there and break them all down into their individual vibrational modes,

350
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,980
in the case of the fingerprint region of the spectrum, I don't have to,

351
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:50,980
because I can always go to a data library just like the AIST and compare it to the data that I see when I run my experiment.

352
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,980
So let's summarize what we've learned about FTIR spectroscopy today.

353
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,980
We talked about what lies beyond the red portion of the visible spectrum,

354
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:06,980
a form of radiation with lower energy than red light, earning it the name InfraRed.

355
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,980
We took a brief look at the layout of a very basic IR spectrophotometer,

356
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,980
and how, just like UV visible spectrophotometers, they split and compare light beams

357
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,980
which pass through reference cells and sample cells to determine the transmittance of a sample.

358
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,980
We looked at molecular structures in a new light as well,

359
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,980
not as a rigid construct of ideal bond lengths and angles,

360
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,980
but as a dynamic, vibrating framework with many degrees of freedom for its atoms to move,

361
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,980
and therefore its bonds to stretch and bend.

362
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,980
We covered how these vibrations tend to have frequencies corresponding to those of InfraRed photons,

363
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,980
and these photons can be absorbed when they encounter a bond vibrating at that frequency,

364
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,980
as long as the vibration causes a change in the overall dipole of the molecule.

365
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,980
We discussed factors affecting the rates of vibrations in both macroscopic systems and in bonds.

366
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,980
How lighter atoms joined by tighter bonds lead to higher vibrational frequencies.

367
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Of course, this means that hydrogen-containing bonds, as well as double and triple bonds to larger atoms,

368
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,980
tend to appear at the higher frequency end of the IR spectrum, called the functional group region,

369
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,980
while vibrations in the carbon scaffold contribute more to the complex,

370
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,980
but equally useful, fingerprint region in the lower frequencies.

371
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,980
Next time, we'll turn our attention to a phenomenon different from absorbance,

372
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,980
a new form of interaction between light and matter, called optical rotation.

373
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,980
I'll see you then.
