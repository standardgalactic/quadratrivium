00:00.000 --> 00:17.520
In today's health-conscious world, we often see the terms saturated and unsaturated used

00:17.520 --> 00:21.120
in reference to fats, which are part of our diets.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.400
Most of us are familiar with the general idea that saturated fats tend to be solid at room

00:25.400 --> 00:32.520
temperature, compared to unsaturated fats, which commonly exist in the liquid form.

00:32.520 --> 00:37.440
In our lecture on alkenes and alkynes, we discussed how these terms are used by chemists

00:37.440 --> 00:42.440
to describe the presence and number of pi bonds in hydrocarbons.

00:42.440 --> 00:47.360
Saturated hydrocarbons contain no pi bonds at all, while unsaturated hydrocarbons do,

00:47.360 --> 00:50.120
sometimes one, sometimes more.

00:50.120 --> 00:54.120
In the case of fats, we're using these terms in exactly the same way.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.560
They also refer to the presence and number of pi bonds, but this time they're on the

00:58.560 --> 01:01.680
hydrocarbon tails of fat molecules.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.720
The kind of fat molecules I'm referring to look something like this.

01:05.720 --> 01:12.120
Now this would be an example of a triacylglyceride, or a fat consisting of three long hydrocarbon

01:12.120 --> 01:18.480
tails, which are coming off of a motif that we call glycerol motif, or a triacyl motif.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.240
But we don't really want to look at that right now, so we're more interested in the

01:22.240 --> 01:23.880
chains on the fats.

01:23.880 --> 01:28.240
Now in this animal fat product here, you'll notice that all of the hydrocarbons within

01:28.240 --> 01:33.280
the tail, all three of them, consist entirely of sp3 carbons.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.200
But if I bring up a similar triacylglyceride, or fat, but one that you might find in a plant

01:38.200 --> 01:44.280
product, what you should immediately notice is that the tails in the hydrocarbons are

01:44.280 --> 01:46.400
no longer saturated.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.620
They contain pi bonds, and those pi bonds cause the chains to kink and move outward in

01:51.620 --> 01:58.160
different directions instead of packing together nicely as they do in the saturated version.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.340
So this is our explanation of how and why vegetable oils tend to be liquids, whereas

02:03.340 --> 02:06.620
animal products tend to be solids.

02:06.620 --> 02:10.900
So most of us know that medical science has determined that saturated fats are far less

02:10.900 --> 02:15.740
healthy for human consumption than their unsaturated counterparts.

02:15.740 --> 02:20.180
But what you may not know is that the scientific world's very first foray into the chemistry

02:20.180 --> 02:26.380
of this type of compound was actually a crusade to find ways to convert unsaturated fats into

02:26.380 --> 02:27.940
their saturated counterparts.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.620
Yeah, that's right.

02:29.620 --> 02:34.060
In the early decades of the 1900s, a great deal of chemistry was developed, and even

02:34.060 --> 02:40.260
a Nobel Prize awarded for techniques which are used to turn healthy plant oils into artery-clogging

02:40.260 --> 02:48.060
saturated fats by removing the double bonds in favor of additional bonded hydrogens.

02:48.060 --> 02:54.400
In short, any reaction which converts unsaturated carbons, or those in SP, or SP2 hybridization

02:54.400 --> 03:00.780
states, into saturated carbons, or those in SP3 hybridization states, is referred to

03:00.780 --> 03:03.640
as an addition reaction.

03:03.640 --> 03:08.260
This class of reaction represents the third permutation in our trifecta of simple organic

03:08.260 --> 03:09.900
reactions.

03:09.900 --> 03:14.180
And today we're going to take a look at several examples of this class of reactions, including

03:14.180 --> 03:19.980
the now infamous, but often necessary, process of hydrogenating oils to change their chemical

03:19.980 --> 03:25.220
properties.

03:25.220 --> 03:28.940
So far we've covered substitution and elimination.

03:28.940 --> 03:33.260
Substitutions can be simply described as molecules exchanging groups, like the exchange

03:33.260 --> 03:37.060
of chloride for a hydroxyl group.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.820
Elimination can be described as a decomposition in which a molecule loses some attached groups

03:41.900 --> 03:46.620
to become less saturated, like the conversion of ethyl chloride into ethylene.

03:46.620 --> 03:51.820
Today, we're going to complete that trifecta of fundamental organic reactions by discussing

03:51.820 --> 03:58.980
that third possibility, adding new groups to unsaturated molecules by sacrificing pi bonds.

03:58.980 --> 04:03.420
This is what we call addition.

04:03.420 --> 04:09.420
So addition reactions involve the replacement of a pi bond with new sigma bonds to new substrates.

04:09.420 --> 04:14.060
And this means that these reactions tend to be entropically disfavored.

04:14.060 --> 04:17.380
They create fewer molecules than they consume.

04:17.380 --> 04:23.100
But from an enthalpy standpoint, they're usually favored, since the newly created sigma bonds

04:23.100 --> 04:29.980
are lower in energy and therefore more stable than the pi bonds in the starting materials.

04:29.980 --> 04:34.780
So let's begin by considering the reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons, those alkenes

04:34.780 --> 04:38.420
and alkynes that we looked at earlier in the course.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.620
The presence of a pi bond gives them an ability, unique among those compounds we've investigated

04:42.620 --> 04:48.060
so far, to act as nucleophiles themselves instead of as a substrate.

04:48.060 --> 04:54.180
They use their pi electrons to attack electrophilic species.

04:54.180 --> 05:00.260
So let's consider what happens when an alkene, like propene, attacks a generic electrophile.

05:00.260 --> 05:03.820
Since we're concerned with the behavior of the alkene itself, for now I'm just going

05:03.820 --> 05:07.780
to use a letter E to represent that electrophile.

05:07.780 --> 05:12.860
Now our propene molecule sees an opportunity to convert its pi bond electrons into more

05:12.860 --> 05:18.300
stable sigma bonding electrons by attacking that electrophile.

05:18.300 --> 05:22.740
But doing so means that the resulting species must take on a positive charge and become

05:22.740 --> 05:25.420
a carbocation.

05:25.420 --> 05:27.220
So the tables have turned now.

05:27.220 --> 05:31.500
The original nucleophile is now an electrophile.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.900
The adjacent carbon is electron deficient, positively charged and ready to be attacked

05:35.900 --> 05:41.300
itself by anything nucleophilic enough to do so.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.900
So you may notice I've been deliberately vague about exactly what this electrophilic

05:44.900 --> 05:47.060
intermediate looks like.

05:47.060 --> 05:51.860
And this is because unlike substitution and elimination reactions, even some of the most

05:51.860 --> 05:56.380
elementary addition reactions can proceed through a wide variety of transition states

05:56.380 --> 06:01.820
and intermediates owing to the complex structure of that transition state that's produced

06:01.820 --> 06:04.580
during the process.

06:04.580 --> 06:08.020
Today we're going to be investigating a few of these mechanisms in an attempt to understand

06:08.020 --> 06:14.700
some of the more fundamental addition reactions of organic chemistry.

06:14.700 --> 06:19.980
Now before his epic clash with Zetsev over the regiochemistry of elimination reactions,

06:19.980 --> 06:25.140
Markovnikov had already made a name for himself by publishing his famous rule governing the

06:25.140 --> 06:29.260
regiochemistry of addition reactions.

06:29.260 --> 06:33.820
These addition reactions can be used to produce alkyl halides from alkenes.

06:33.820 --> 06:39.580
And we call this class of reactions hydrohalogenation because the reaction involves adding a molecule

06:39.580 --> 06:45.020
of HCl or HBr across a double bond.

06:45.020 --> 06:50.780
You see, even though he was never quite certain exactly how it happened, Markovnikov was able

06:50.780 --> 06:56.460
to demonstrate that any time an alkene with sp2 carbons of differing substitution, like

06:56.460 --> 07:02.660
our propene, was reacted with a hydrogen halide, like this hydrochloric acid.

07:02.660 --> 07:10.460
The newly added halogen is always added preferentially to the more substituted carbon of the alkene,

07:10.460 --> 07:15.700
and consequently the hydrogen would end up on the less substituted carbon.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.180
So let's take a look at Markovnikov's rule in action and see if we can mechanistically

07:19.180 --> 07:22.820
explain exactly how and why this happens.

07:22.820 --> 07:28.300
It took about 30 years and the proposal of the carbocation structure to finally bring

07:28.300 --> 07:30.740
it all into focus.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.620
So here's the reaction that we've been discussing so far today.

07:33.620 --> 07:38.820
We have a molecule of propene with a double bond, and it's going to react with a molecule

07:38.820 --> 07:40.740
of hydrochloric acid.

07:40.740 --> 07:44.700
I've highlighted the hydrogen from the hydrochloric acid, so it's easy to follow it through the

07:44.700 --> 07:50.500
reaction and not confuse it with the other hydrogens from the propene molecule.

07:50.500 --> 07:55.060
So we have this set of pi electrons that's willing to act as a nucleophile, and it's

07:55.060 --> 08:01.580
going to attack, obviously, the most electrophilic site on our acid, the proton.

08:01.580 --> 08:05.860
When this happens, there are actually two different ways that this proton can attach

08:05.860 --> 08:08.900
itself to the propene molecule.

08:08.900 --> 08:14.280
In the first, we have the proton from the hydrochloric acid attaching itself at the end

08:14.280 --> 08:20.500
of the molecule, creating our secondary carbocation, and in the other possibility, it attaches itself

08:20.500 --> 08:24.740
here to the secondary carbon, creating a primary carbocation.

08:24.740 --> 08:30.340
So we've got two potential intermediate states here, in which our hydrogen from the hydrochloric

08:30.340 --> 08:35.180
acid is in a different position on the carbocation.

08:35.180 --> 08:39.940
Now in the top example, my carbocation is attacked by the resulting chloride from the

08:39.940 --> 08:47.100
initial process, creating a molecule of 2-chloropropane.

08:47.100 --> 08:51.820
But in my second example, the reactive site is now on the primary carbon, and that would

08:51.820 --> 08:55.820
generate 1-chloropropane.

08:55.820 --> 08:59.420
And we already know from our discussions about alkyl halides in the carbocation they can

08:59.420 --> 09:06.100
produce that the secondary carbocation is far more stable than the primary carbocation.

09:06.100 --> 09:10.860
Markovnikov simply made this observation that the products are consistent with this.

09:10.860 --> 09:15.540
So when we have a more substituted alkyl halide forming, as is the case here with our secondary

09:15.540 --> 09:19.900
product, we call it the Markovnikov addition product.

09:20.260 --> 09:25.260
Whereas if it ends up at the less substituted carbon of the original double bond, we call

09:25.260 --> 09:27.020
this an anti-Markovnikov.

09:27.020 --> 09:31.420
And Markovnikov's rule simply states that the major product will be the one of greater

09:31.420 --> 09:35.660
substitution.

09:35.660 --> 09:39.180
So there's some evidence for this that we've managed to collect over the years as organic

09:39.180 --> 09:44.780
chemists, not the least of which is the fact that we can't make a chiral product using

09:44.780 --> 09:46.620
this type of reaction.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.580
And the reason is, as follows.

09:48.700 --> 09:53.780
I have my attack on my hydrogen from my hydrochloric acid just as before.

09:53.780 --> 09:58.980
But in this case, the substrate I've used has a more substituted carbon, which contains

09:58.980 --> 10:07.100
three different groups, a methyl group represented by Me, an ethyl group represented by Et, and

10:07.100 --> 10:13.540
what would be over here a three-carbon group, which is eventually going to be propyl.

10:13.540 --> 10:18.620
So when my addition reaction takes place, I produce my carbocation intermediate, which

10:18.620 --> 10:21.220
is planar at this location.

10:21.220 --> 10:26.340
And that means that the chloride nucleophile can attack either from the top of my molecule

10:26.340 --> 10:28.060
or from the bottom.

10:28.060 --> 10:32.700
And there's nothing in particular stopping it from coming in from either direction.

10:32.700 --> 10:38.340
The result of this is that we make a perfectly equal mixture of the R and S enantiomers of

10:38.340 --> 10:39.340
the products.

10:39.340 --> 10:42.300
We call this a racemic mixture.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.380
And it's the presence of these racemic products in reactions like this that gives us some

10:46.380 --> 10:49.740
evidence for carbocation formation.

10:52.740 --> 10:56.860
Now additionally, this mechanism is supported by the fact that we see rearrangements in

10:56.860 --> 10:59.380
hydrohalogenations of alkenes.

10:59.380 --> 11:05.060
Now an example of a reaction in which this might happen is the reaction of 3-methyl-1

11:05.060 --> 11:08.140
butene with hydrochloric acid.

11:08.140 --> 11:13.180
So again, I'm going to conduct my reaction just as we discussed previously.

11:13.180 --> 11:18.420
My alkene will attack the hydrogen from the HCl, creating my new nucleophile in the form

11:18.420 --> 11:22.020
of chloride ion.

11:22.020 --> 11:28.500
Now when this happens, I have that magic recipe of a secondary carbocation adjacent to a tertiary

11:28.500 --> 11:30.860
center on the molecule.

11:30.860 --> 11:37.700
So this is a perfectly primed carbocation to undergo what we would call a hydride shift.

11:37.700 --> 11:41.900
So I've labeled the shifting hydride here in orange and I've introduced it into my line

11:41.900 --> 11:46.900
angle formula below so that we can track it through the shift.

11:46.900 --> 11:52.100
So as the shift takes place, my carbocation increases in substitution from secondary to

11:52.100 --> 11:57.540
now tertiary and that tertiary carbocation is what's attacked by the chloride ion to

11:57.540 --> 12:01.020
complete the reaction.

12:01.020 --> 12:06.180
So the fact that I generate a tertiary alkyl halide here in this reaction, instead of the

12:06.180 --> 12:11.300
expected secondary alkyl halide, tells me that I'm probably going through a carbocation

12:11.300 --> 12:15.860
since they're so, so very prone to rearranging like this.

12:15.860 --> 12:20.820
So one might wonder how a rule governing such a small subset of reactions led to such great

12:20.820 --> 12:23.380
fame for Markovnikov.

12:23.380 --> 12:28.580
But the truth is that although his rules originally were focused on the addition of hydrogen halides

12:28.580 --> 12:34.180
like hydrochloric acid, they're remarkably consistent when applied to many, many more

12:34.180 --> 12:37.860
reactions, some of which we'll investigate in future lectures.

12:37.860 --> 12:43.140
So from time to time, you'll hear me refer to addition reactions as being Markovnikov

12:43.140 --> 12:50.180
or Antimarkovnikov, just as I'll be referring to eliminations as Zetsev or Antizetsev, sometimes

12:50.180 --> 12:54.460
called Hoffman.

12:54.460 --> 12:59.860
Now very similar chemistry takes place in the case of hydrohalogenation of alkynes.

12:59.860 --> 13:03.540
They can be hydrohalogenated either once or twice.

13:03.540 --> 13:07.600
The major difference here is that to complete the first addition requires the formation

13:07.600 --> 13:09.100
of a vinyl cation.

13:09.100 --> 13:14.140
Now the word vinyl actually comes from the Latin for wine and it's sort of a tie to

13:14.140 --> 13:17.460
the ethanol molecule because they both have two carbons.

13:17.460 --> 13:22.340
Now it's difficult to say if this is really how the reaction proceeds, but what's undeniable

13:22.340 --> 13:28.460
is that it proceeds much more slowly than does the hydrohalogenation of an alkene.

13:29.460 --> 13:34.540
Nonetheless, it can be achieved, creating what we call a vinyl halide in accordance with

13:34.540 --> 13:37.420
Markovnikov's rule.

13:37.420 --> 13:41.900
Of course, in the presence of excess hydrogen halide, this is a little consequence to us

13:41.900 --> 13:47.460
because any stereochemistry that's introduced in the form of ENZ isomers will be wiped out

13:47.460 --> 13:53.700
when the carbocation forms in the second hydrohalogenation step.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.620
When this takes place, Markovnikov's rule holds yet again.

13:57.620 --> 14:03.500
But even in situations involving equally substituted sp2 carbons, the halogen will end up on the

14:03.500 --> 14:07.140
same carbon atom as its predecessor.

14:07.140 --> 14:12.100
This is because the attached halogen atom stabilizes the carbocation by resonance on

14:12.100 --> 14:15.700
its way to becoming what we call a geminal dihalide.

14:15.700 --> 14:20.940
Now geminal is a word meaning twins and it implies that those two halogens are on the

14:20.940 --> 14:23.540
same carbon.

14:23.540 --> 14:30.100
The alternate possibility would be called a visceral dihalide from the word for neighbor.

14:30.100 --> 14:34.300
That indicates the halogen atoms are on adjacent carbons, but this doesn't happen in this type

14:34.300 --> 14:38.420
of reaction.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.460
So how might one go about making that visceral dihalide?

14:41.460 --> 14:47.580
Well, another commonly used addition reaction is the addition of molecular chlorine or bromine

14:47.580 --> 14:50.380
to alkenes.

14:50.380 --> 14:55.140
Unlike radical halogenation of alkenes, we don't have to resort to extremes like photoactivated

14:55.140 --> 14:59.620
radical chemistry to halogenate these alkenes and alkynes.

14:59.620 --> 15:04.380
This reaction is typically accomplished simply using molecular halogens like chlorine or

15:04.380 --> 15:05.540
bromine.

15:05.540 --> 15:10.260
And we do this in a non-nucleophilic solvent like dichloromethane to try to discourage

15:10.260 --> 15:14.420
any outside or unexpected reactions from taking place.

15:15.340 --> 15:21.420
In the case of a halogenation of an alkene, we actually have a very unusual intermediate

15:21.420 --> 15:22.700
which forms.

15:22.700 --> 15:27.820
So in order to show you this first, I'm going to run a reaction between chlorine gas depicted

15:27.820 --> 15:34.620
here as my green diatomic molecule and a very familiar molecule from class ethene.

15:34.620 --> 15:39.580
It's going to proceed through something called a chloronium intermediate and a chloride ion

15:39.580 --> 15:44.380
will attack my chloronium intermediate to complete the reaction.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.620
So let's watch this reaction take place.

15:46.620 --> 15:50.220
Now we're used to seeing ethene drawn like this in sort of a plan view where I'm looking

15:50.220 --> 15:54.180
down on all of the atoms in the plane of the page.

15:54.180 --> 15:58.780
But to show you this reaction properly, I'm going to have to turn that molecule 90 degrees

15:58.780 --> 16:02.540
and look at it end on.

16:02.540 --> 16:07.340
When I do this, the reactive position of a chlorine might be something like this.

16:07.340 --> 16:09.420
So remember, there's a double bond here.

16:09.420 --> 16:13.260
The second bond is sort of obscured by the rotation, but it's still there.

16:13.260 --> 16:17.460
And that means that it can attack my chlorine gas molecule.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.420
And you probably are already ready to stop me here and say, wait a minute, Professor Davis,

16:21.420 --> 16:26.020
you just told me that this is a nucleophile attacking an electrophile, but I don't see

16:26.020 --> 16:27.340
any dipole here.

16:27.340 --> 16:30.860
I see two equal atoms of equal electronegativity.

16:30.860 --> 16:32.380
You'd be right about that.

16:32.380 --> 16:37.540
But you've got to remember that halogens have very large electron clouds and are very polarizable.

16:37.540 --> 16:41.900
So as the alkene attacks one of these two chlorine atoms, the electrons can run away

16:41.900 --> 16:47.620
to the other side, inducing a dipole and ultimately breaking the bond between the two chlorine

16:47.620 --> 16:49.820
atoms.

16:49.820 --> 16:54.780
When this takes place, I create something called a chloronium ion.

16:54.780 --> 17:00.180
Now unlike a carbocation, a chloronium ion has a cyclic structure consisting of three

17:00.180 --> 17:05.260
atoms, the two original carbons from the alkene and one of the chlorines from the original

17:05.260 --> 17:07.660
chlorine molecule.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.700
And the bonds I've shown you here are sort of partially formed.

17:10.700 --> 17:14.940
They're not really a very excellent representation of how it looks, but it's the best that we

17:14.940 --> 17:17.740
can do while drawing these on a page.

17:17.740 --> 17:22.980
But what is true is that the chlorine that's part of the chloronium ion is sitting on top

17:22.980 --> 17:25.220
of what used to be the double bond.

17:25.220 --> 17:30.500
It's not really, hasn't been claimed really by either one of these two carbons.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.780
And because it sits directly in the middle and because it's so large, it sterically

17:34.780 --> 17:39.580
obstructs the nucleuride ion from attacking from the same side.

17:39.580 --> 17:44.140
So the only way that this chloride ion can get around and reach these electrophilic carbons

17:44.140 --> 17:47.380
is to move to the other side of the molecule.

17:47.380 --> 17:51.740
At this point, attack can occur and one of those bonds holding the cyclic chloronium

17:51.740 --> 17:54.780
ion together will break.

17:54.780 --> 17:58.940
So I'll end up with a visceral dihalide in this case.

17:58.940 --> 18:04.300
Not only that, but my visceral dihalide is the product of what we call an anti-addition,

18:04.300 --> 18:09.980
meaning that the two new bonds are made from opposing sides rather than from the same side

18:09.980 --> 18:12.540
of that alkene.

18:12.540 --> 18:17.500
So the consequences of this anti-addition become more important when we consider halogenation

18:17.500 --> 18:23.740
using more complex alkenes, like 3,4-dimethyl-3-heptene.

18:23.740 --> 18:28.140
Since the starting material is planar, the chloronium ion, of course, can form from either

18:28.140 --> 18:29.460
side.

18:29.460 --> 18:35.380
But once a chloronium ion is formed, only the opposing side can be attacked by the chloride

18:35.380 --> 18:40.060
ion to complete the reaction, leading to a mixture of enantiomers.

18:40.060 --> 18:46.220
So halogenation of the Z-isomer of my starting material will produce a set of enantiomers

18:46.220 --> 18:49.900
in the RR and SS form.

18:49.900 --> 18:54.860
But these products are distinct from that produced when I halogenate the E-isomer, which

18:54.860 --> 19:00.420
would be the SR and RS products.

19:00.420 --> 19:06.460
Now, alkenes can undergo halogenation in similar reactions.

19:06.460 --> 19:09.900
First forming an alkene with two halogens, transferred to one another because of the

19:09.900 --> 19:17.020
anti-addition, followed by a second halogenation to form a tetrahalogenated alkane.

19:17.020 --> 19:22.220
Now, when the product of a single halogenation is desired, carefully controlling the amount

19:22.220 --> 19:27.500
of halogen added is all that's required.

19:27.500 --> 19:33.260
So adding just one molar equivalent of halogen will produce that one-two dihaloalkene, almost

19:33.260 --> 19:35.340
exclusively.

19:35.340 --> 19:41.380
And this works because the resulting dihalogenated alkene has two electronegative halogen atoms

19:41.380 --> 19:47.220
attached, withdrawing electron density from the pi bond, making it less nucleophilic,

19:47.220 --> 19:52.660
and therefore much less reactive than the alkyne starting material.

19:52.660 --> 19:57.380
So we don't expect the second halogenation addition to take place until all the starting

19:57.380 --> 20:00.100
alkene has been consumed.

20:00.100 --> 20:07.660
This means that I could, for example, produce trans-2,3-di-chloro-2-butene from 2-butyne

20:07.660 --> 20:12.860
simply by carefully adding exactly one molar equivalent of chlorine to the alkyne starting

20:12.860 --> 20:13.380
material.

20:18.220 --> 20:25.980
In the 1890s, an American chemist named James F. Boyce Sr. developed a method for processing

20:25.980 --> 20:31.500
cottonseed oil into a material of greater viscosity, more suitable for use in soap and

20:31.500 --> 20:34.100
food products.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.180
He discovered that the addition of a small amount of nickel to the mixture facilitated

20:38.180 --> 20:43.900
the addition of hydrogen molecules to form this new product, and it changed the properties

20:43.900 --> 20:47.660
in a favorable way.

20:47.660 --> 20:52.740
Now this work was also picked up by a renowned French chemist named Paul Sabatier.

20:52.740 --> 20:57.820
He refined this process into the catalytic hydrogenation which earned him a Nobel Prize

20:57.820 --> 21:00.780
and today bears his name.

21:00.780 --> 21:05.860
You see what Boyce and Sabatier were after was a process which would convert less saturated,

21:05.860 --> 21:12.260
less expensive, plant oils into molecules more closely resembling animal fats.

21:12.260 --> 21:16.500
This is because animal fats have a higher degree of saturation, making them solids near

21:16.500 --> 21:20.220
room temperature and increasing their shelf life.

21:20.220 --> 21:24.700
Now because animal fats are more expensive, converting a cheaper source, like vegetable

21:24.700 --> 21:30.420
oils, into a similar material was just good business.

21:30.420 --> 21:34.500
Their success in this endeavor led to the production of partially hydrogenated vegetable

21:34.500 --> 21:40.540
oils which we're so accustomed to seeing listed on the back of food packages even today.

21:40.540 --> 21:46.180
The double bonds of hydrocarbons can be saturated using molecular hydrogen at pretty reasonable

21:46.180 --> 21:50.300
temperatures and pressures, achievable even in Sabatier's day.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.300
But there's one important catch to this.

21:52.300 --> 21:56.260
The reaction is painfully slow.

21:56.260 --> 22:00.900
So Boyce and Sabatier realized that the solution to this problem was the use of a catalyst

22:00.900 --> 22:05.740
to weaken the bond in the hydrogen molecules, thereby promoting the reaction without the

22:05.740 --> 22:08.940
need for excessive temperatures.

22:09.900 --> 22:13.660
Fortunately, such catalysts exist.

22:13.660 --> 22:20.020
Unfortunately, these catalysts are very rare and expensive metals like platinum and palladium.

22:20.020 --> 22:25.020
And Sabatier's method uses heterogeneous catalysis, meaning the catalyst itself is

22:25.020 --> 22:29.100
a solid while the reagents are liquid or gas phase.

22:29.100 --> 22:33.460
And even though the metal catalyst is not consumed in the reaction, a massive precious

22:33.460 --> 22:38.980
metal would cost a great deal of money only to have a small exposed surface area onto

22:38.980 --> 22:44.340
which that chemistry can take place.

22:44.340 --> 22:49.380
This potentially prohibitive cost issue is often circumvented by producing a catalyst

22:49.380 --> 22:55.660
not as a pure metal material but as a thin veneer of precious metal adhered to a highly

22:55.660 --> 22:58.740
porous carbon support.

22:58.740 --> 23:03.100
This tremendously increases the amount of surface area which can be generated per gram

23:03.100 --> 23:08.460
of metal, making this process much more cost effective.

23:08.460 --> 23:12.500
So let's take a look at this catalytic hydrogenation in action.

23:12.500 --> 23:18.140
What I have here is a very simple hydrogenation reaction in which I'm going to attach a hydrogen,

23:18.140 --> 23:25.460
which is represented here by the small molecule, to again our very familiar ethene alkene molecule.

23:25.460 --> 23:29.180
And I've indicated that I'll be doing this using a catalyst, which is consisting of platinum

23:29.180 --> 23:33.380
metal adhered to a carbon support.

23:33.380 --> 23:38.540
And when the reaction takes place, of course my product, which I hope to make, is ethane

23:38.540 --> 23:40.940
gas.

23:40.940 --> 23:43.700
So I've depicted my catalyst as simply a bar down here.

23:43.700 --> 23:48.500
Of course it would really be an array of exposed precious metal atoms.

23:48.500 --> 23:53.340
And to that I'm going to add my hydrogen and my alkene.

23:53.340 --> 23:57.540
But just as before when we did our halogenation, I have to turn my alkene so that we can see

23:57.540 --> 24:00.420
it in the reactive orientation.

24:00.420 --> 24:06.140
As it approaches the surface of the catalyst, the hydrogen is first separated into separate

24:06.140 --> 24:07.460
hydrogen atoms.

24:07.460 --> 24:12.300
So we've already succeeded in weakening the bond between the two hydrogens.

24:12.300 --> 24:18.780
My alkene comes in from the side and new bonds are formed to the activated hydrogen atoms

24:18.780 --> 24:21.300
at the catalyst surface.

24:21.300 --> 24:25.220
Once hydrogenation is complete, you can see the molecule detaches itself and moves back

24:25.220 --> 24:29.140
away into either the liquid or gas phase.

24:29.140 --> 24:34.220
Now the catch to this, of course, is we can only add the hydrogens from the same side

24:34.220 --> 24:40.620
of the alkene, meaning that this particular process proceeds as a syn addition.

24:40.620 --> 24:45.620
Syn meaning the same side of the alkene is modified.

24:45.620 --> 24:50.940
So in situations where we have reactions which may produce stereoisomers, meaning when these

24:50.940 --> 24:55.580
carbons here have different substituents, we have a potential for a different kind of

24:55.580 --> 25:00.860
product to form, one which is either a particular diastereomer or a particular enantiomer.

25:00.860 --> 25:06.580
So in the case of asymmetrical alkenes, this means the reaction is diastereoselective.

25:06.580 --> 25:14.900
An example of this is catalytic hydrogenation of E3-4-dimethyl-3-octene.

25:14.900 --> 25:20.780
This reaction produces the RR and SS pair of stereoisomers.

25:20.780 --> 25:26.460
Now the catalytic hydrogenation of the Z-stereoisomer, the same starting material, would lead to

25:26.460 --> 25:30.260
the RS and SR stereoisomers.

25:30.260 --> 25:36.380
So in this case, my choice of starting material is very important.

25:36.380 --> 25:40.620
Now hydrogenation of alkenes is yet another versatile set of reactions.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.940
And this process was developed by Sabatier.

25:42.940 --> 25:49.300
It's quite effective for the complete hydrogenation of an alkyne all the way to an alkane.

25:49.300 --> 25:57.820
But it's difficult, if not impossible, to halt the reaction at the intermediate alkene.

25:57.820 --> 26:04.140
This challenge was of particular interest to a Swiss chemist named Herbert Lindlar.

26:04.140 --> 26:10.180
Lindlar was working for a German pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-Laroche in 1952 when he published

26:10.180 --> 26:17.700
work on a selective catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes stopping at the alkene stage.

26:17.700 --> 26:24.100
Now what Lindlar did was he took the usual catalyst of the day, platinum and palladium.

26:24.100 --> 26:29.440
But he used a technique known as poisoning, in which he deliberately added non-reactive

26:29.440 --> 26:36.500
material to the catalyst to sort of cut down on its activity towards this particular reaction.

26:36.500 --> 26:41.660
And the result of his effort was a catalyst which is strong enough to promote the addition

26:41.660 --> 26:47.380
of hydrogen to an alkyne, but not strong enough to do so to an alkene.

26:47.380 --> 26:52.500
So you'll notice in this reaction I've added hydrogen to acetylene, but I've also included

26:52.500 --> 26:58.540
Lindlar catalyst rather than a pure veneer of that precious metal that catalyzes the

26:58.540 --> 26:59.540
reaction.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.540
Let's see what happens.

27:01.540 --> 27:06.300
My hydrogen moves to the surface and again is activated.

27:06.300 --> 27:11.860
Now when my alkyne comes in, it reacts with those hydrogens at the surface, which means

27:11.860 --> 27:18.060
that the addition is going to always take place with syn-stereochemistry.

27:18.060 --> 27:26.220
So Lindlar had achieved a syn addition of hydrogen to an alkyne stopping at the alkene stage.

27:26.220 --> 27:29.460
So in the case of forming ethene, that's not very impressive because there really aren't

27:29.460 --> 27:31.880
any stereoisomers to speak up.

27:31.880 --> 27:37.220
But imagine if we were to do this reaction with an internal alkyne rather than a terminal

27:37.220 --> 27:42.180
alkyne or acetylene.

27:42.180 --> 27:47.900
Simplest example of this would be the reaction of hydrogen with 2-butyne, which has its triple

27:47.900 --> 27:51.700
bond internally placed.

27:51.700 --> 27:58.180
When I react this with Lindlar catalyst, I produce a specific stereoisomer of the 2-butene

27:58.180 --> 27:59.740
product.

27:59.740 --> 28:03.780
And the reason for this is, as we've already said, the hydrogen is going to come in and

28:03.780 --> 28:07.700
become activated at the catalyst surface.

28:07.700 --> 28:13.620
From there, it will react with our alkyne molecule, which then detaches from the surface.

28:13.620 --> 28:18.180
And because the Lindlar catalyst is poisoned, it can't go any further.

28:18.180 --> 28:24.500
So as you can see here, my syn addition has created the cis-isomer.

28:24.500 --> 28:30.500
But what if the trans or e-isomer were the intended product of our synthesis?

28:30.500 --> 28:34.820
Lindlar's catalyst would not achieve the correct stereochemistry because the mechanism is inherent

28:34.820 --> 28:39.500
to the reaction that has a syn addition of hydrogen.

28:39.500 --> 28:44.180
So in this case, we have to turn to more drastic methods, like what we call the metal ammonia

28:44.180 --> 28:46.900
reduction technique.

28:46.900 --> 28:52.500
In this method, a strong reducing agent like sodium metal is used to convert the alkyne

28:52.500 --> 28:55.780
into a radical anion.

28:55.780 --> 29:03.140
These anions preferentially form in a trans configuration because of sterics.

29:03.140 --> 29:08.180
So after abstracting a proton from an ammonia molecule, the resulting vinyl radical repeats

29:08.180 --> 29:14.540
this process of reduction and protonation and ultimately leads to a trans product.

29:14.540 --> 29:23.620
So this would be our solution for turning our internal alkynes into trans alkenes.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.300
So let's review what we've learned today.

29:26.300 --> 29:30.460
We've worked our way through the basics of how addition reactions occur.

29:30.460 --> 29:37.100
We saw how pi bonds are traded for more stable sigma bonds at the cost of reduced entropy.

29:37.100 --> 29:41.440
We discussed the mechanism of hydrohalogenation of alkenes and alkynes.

29:41.440 --> 29:46.060
We saw how Markovnikov's rule governs their regiochemistry, predicting that the halogen

29:46.060 --> 29:52.220
will take its place at the more substituted carbon of the alkene starting material.

29:52.220 --> 29:56.980
We also noted that proceeding through a carbocation intermediate makes these kinds of reactions

29:56.980 --> 30:00.380
prone to rearrangements.

30:00.380 --> 30:06.320
We also saw how hydrohalogenation of alkenes leads to alkyl halides and hydrohalogenation

30:06.320 --> 30:12.660
of alkynes can produce vinyl halides or geminal dye halides depending on how much of that

30:12.660 --> 30:15.820
hydrogen halide we've added.

30:16.820 --> 30:22.820
Next, we investigated halogenation reactions in which alkenes react via a cyclic-halonium

30:22.820 --> 30:31.040
intermediate on their way to an anti-addition producing vissinal dye halides.

30:31.040 --> 30:39.220
We also saw how an analogous reaction with alkynes leads to a trans-dihalogenated alkene

30:39.220 --> 30:45.540
or to a tetrahalide in a 1-1-2-2 configuration, meaning that we have two halogens on each

30:45.540 --> 30:49.040
adjacent carbon.

30:49.040 --> 30:53.160
We talked about how Boyce and Sabatier discovered that the addition of certain metal catalysts

30:53.160 --> 30:58.840
to alkenes in the presence of hydrogen gas leads to a sin-hydrogenation of their double

30:58.840 --> 31:04.480
bonds, developing a chemistry which is used to modify oils and fats to produce food additives

31:04.480 --> 31:06.520
to this day.

31:06.520 --> 31:13.360
Of course, this method also works to completely saturate alkynes as well.

31:13.360 --> 31:19.100
We also looked into the methods used to halt hydrogenation of alkynes at the alkene stage.

31:19.100 --> 31:25.340
Specifically, catalytic hydrogenation with Linn-Lars catalysts to form cis-alkenes and

31:25.340 --> 31:31.060
the metal-ammonia reduction reaction, which leads to trans-alkenes.

31:31.060 --> 31:35.340
So with this, we've completed our tour of the three general classes of reactions most

31:35.340 --> 31:43.300
often encountered in organic chemistry, substitution, elimination, and addition.

31:43.300 --> 31:48.160
We managed to do this for the most part using just hydrocarbons and alkyl halides as reaction

31:48.160 --> 31:54.000
substrates, but that's all about to change.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.080
These three key types of reactions are not limited to the small library of molecules

31:58.080 --> 32:00.600
that we've used so far.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.480
Now that we have a command of a few of the most basic mechanisms by which reactions take

32:04.480 --> 32:11.920
place, a vast library of functional groups and motifs containing other atoms awaits.

32:11.920 --> 32:16.740
This time, we'll begin to expand this library by considering the role of oxygen in organic

32:16.740 --> 32:17.740
chemistry.

32:17.740 --> 32:18.620
I'll see you then.
