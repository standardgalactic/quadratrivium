1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Well, last time I gave an unfair amount of attention to beer when we had our lecture

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,240
on aldehydes and ketones.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,440
So in this lecture, I'm going to try to give wine its due attention.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,960
Now most of us know the conversion of grapes into wine introduces new flavors and smells.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,680
And we also know that as wine ages, its flavor profile and bouquet are expected to change,

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,400
usually for the better at first with flavors mellowing and pleasing aromas intensifying.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,320
Now the complexity of wine starts with the many chemical processes which take place

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,280
during fermentation.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,400
One of these is the formation of new pleasant smelling organic compounds called esters.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,880
Esters and also organic acids contain a functional group or motif that we can look at here on

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
our hologram.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,360
So let's pull that up now.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,800
Now the motif that defines these two classes of compounds has a carbonyl, which would be

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,440
a carbon double bonded to an oxygen, just like we saw in aldehydes and ketones.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,360
But the carbonyl carbon is also bonded to an sp3 oxygen.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,280
So this motif is distinct from our ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and ethers in the sense

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,400
that it combines more than one oxygen atom into a single organic motif.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,440
Now we can see this motif in compounds, which give wine some of its pleasing aromas.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,920
For example, this molecule is pentyl acetate, and it has the aroma of pears.

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,000
But if we change a little bit of the R groups attached to this motif, we get ethyl butyrate,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,480
which is reminiscent of pineapple, or octyl acetate, which is more of an orange like aroma.

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,200
So you can see that they all contain the same internal structure with the carbonyl and the

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
sp3 oxygen.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,600
But what's changing here is the identity of the attached R groups.

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,440
But the complexity doesn't stop there.

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,960
See, over time, esters and others like them can interconvert chemically inside the bottle.

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,280
And this creates a changing mixture, which stimulates your nose and your palate differently

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,080
through time, making the experience that a wine offers change as the years go by.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,720
Now another type of compound, which can affect the flavors of wines, are organic acids, and

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,060
they share a very similar structure to esters.

31
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,040
So let's go back to that motif we just looked at, where we have a carbonyl to which there

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,120
is also bonded an sp3 oxygen.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,400
Now keeping this motif in mind, see if you can find it in the following molecules.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,760
This is tartaric acid, which is responsible for giving wine a sort of tart flavor.

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,720
But if we change the molecule up, we get malic acid.

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,880
And malic acid is actually the flavor of green apples.

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,280
We can change the structure slightly again and get lactic acid, which is responsible

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,920
for more of a milky flavor in mouthfeel in wines.

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,360
So just like esters, these acids are formed, consumed, and even interconverted as the contents

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,120
of a bottle of wine age, making the same vintage taste different from one year to the next.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,520
So with a little bit of time, organic chemistry can improve that bottle of wine that you so

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,120
carefully sought out during your last visit to Napa.

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,640
But an overly protective connoisseur might hold that bottle a little bit too long with

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,520
disastrous consequences.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
See wine's a complex mixture of many classes of organic compounds, including quite a bit

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,920
of the alcohol ethanol.

47
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,280
Now I venture to say that most of us already knew that much, but what you may not realize

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,040
is that in addition to all those pleasant tasting and smelling components, every wine

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,400
bottle also has a sinister gang of microbial chemists at work in it.

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Microbes like this one, called acetobacter.

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,160
Now acetobacter quickly set up residents in grapes when they're still in the vine.

52
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:14,120
And they're practically impossible to remove, and they simply love to drink your wine.

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,000
So the growth of these bacteria is held at bay by the careful exclusion of vital oxygen

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,360
and the addition of some sodium metabysulfite.

55
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,500
Sodium metabysulfite is a flavorless inorganic material which slowly decomposes into antibacterial

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,360
sulfur dioxide under acidic conditions, inhibiting microbial growth while not particularly affecting

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,080
the flavor of the wine.

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,920
But slowly with time and just a little bit of oxygen permeating the seal of the bottle,

59
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,120
acetobacter eventually overwhelms the preservative and metabolically converts the wine's ethanol

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,760
into acetic acid for energy.

61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,840
This process destroys the flavor profile that the vinter works so tirelessly to create

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,960
and demotes your favorite bottle of wine to the ranks of what we commonly call wine vinegar.

63
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,760
Now we've already considered the oxidation of ethanol to ethanol also known as acid aldehyde.

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,960
This is a process which chemists perform on the bench and which you perform in your own

65
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,120
bloodstream after a night on the town.

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
Today, among other things, we're going to take a look at the next step in this oxidation

67
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,160
process, that of acid aldehyde to acetic acid.

68
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,680
Now all of these compounds, the complex esters and acids that form that perfect bottle, as

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,200
well as the acetic acid, which ultimately causes its devise, are members of a subset

70
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,720
of organic compounds which contain not one, but two oxygen atoms.

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,080
But these two types of compounds don't find their only home in the beverage industry.

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,720
Carboxylic acids are a primary component of compounds that we come into contact with every

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:00,160
day, including many detergents like the loric acid you might find in your shampoo bottle,

74
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,280
the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen, and the commonly used food preservative benzoic

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,080
acid.

76
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,560
Esters include compounds like isoamyl acetate, the fragrance and flavor component of bananas,

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,480
and also, coincidentally, a signaling hormone which is released from the stinger of an attacking

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,080
bee to call for backup.

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,880
So I'm guessing this means that beekeepers aren't particularly fond of banana flavored

80
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,920
anything, especially on a work day.

81
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,400
Now esters also find use in the drug industry in a cleverly designed class of compounds

82
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,960
known as pro-drugs, which include heart medications, antivirals, and more.

83
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,440
Because they're at the end of the line in many natural oxidative processes, simple

84
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,280
carboxylic acids were discovered very early in the history of organic chemistry.

85
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,120
So some of them have common names which will actually serve as the basis for their more

86
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,880
modern IUPAC substituent prefixes, so let's take a look at those now.

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,240
Let's start just by looking at the four simplest carboxylic acids.

88
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,560
The simplest of all is formic acid.

89
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,400
This takes its name from the Latin word for ant, because it was first isolated from the

90
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,680
venom of fire ants.

91
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,200
Another common carboxylic acid is acetic acid, which gets its name from the Latin word for

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,680
acid itself, because this was the very first compound which was characterized which had

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,360
these properties.

94
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,840
Next is propionic acid.

95
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,960
Propionic acid takes its name from the Greek, meaning first fat.

96
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,640
This is because it was the first organic acid which was isolated which wouldn't dissolve

97
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,840
in water.

98
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,600
And finally, the next largest would be butyric acid, which gets its name because it was first

99
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,720
isolated from butter.

100
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Now you can see the commonalities here in all of these structures.

101
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,880
They all contain the essential carbonyl group, to which is bonded an sp3 oxygen.

102
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,360
And there's one more crucial part of the structure which makes them carboxylic acids.

103
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,920
That is that they have a hydrogen attached to that sp3 oxygen.

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,720
So this is the structural motif which makes carboxylic acids carboxylic acids.

105
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,400
So now that we have a better understanding of the structures of carboxylic acids and

106
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,560
how some of them are named, let's take a look at some esters of similar size and you'll

107
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,760
probably notice quite a few of these names reproducing themselves.

108
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,520
Take the example of the simplest possible ester, methylformane.

109
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,360
Notice the name, formate.

110
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,040
It gets that name because our ester contains an R group which is simply one carbon, methyl,

111
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,040
and it also has this carbonyl carbon which is by itself.

112
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,920
So one carbon sort of gets this prefix form a lot of the time.

113
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,120
So methylformate is a natural choice for the name.

114
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,920
Very similarly we have ethylacetate which takes the acetate name from the two carbons

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,520
that are in the carbonyl containing portion of the structure.

116
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,560
Next is propylpropionate and just like that butylbutyrate.

117
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,000
Now it's not necessary for both sides of the ester to have the same number of atoms as

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,880
they do in my examples here, for example 4 and 4, 3 and 3.

119
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,560
They could just as easily be a mixture of two different chain lengths.

120
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,400
But the nomenclature system would stay basically the same.

121
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,920
And what defines them all is the presence of a carbonyl group attached to an sp3 oxygen

122
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:43,640
but this time the sp3 oxygen contains that second R group rather than a hydrogen.

123
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,400
So let's take a look at how we name acids and esters from an IUPAC perspective as opposed

124
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,080
to their traditional names.

125
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,160
We're going to use the rules that we have devised before for many other classes of

126
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,160
organic compounds but in the case of acids we always want to be sure that the carbonyl

127
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,080
carbon is included in the parent chain because it's a functional group.

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,800
We always want to give it the lowest number for the same reason and we'll name our parent

129
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,440
compound using the suffix oic acid to indicate the presence of this functional group.

130
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,400
So let's work an example here.

131
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's try to name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,120
First thing I'm going to do is find my organic acid group here it is.

133
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,240
And then I'm going to label the longest attached carbon chain which I haven't done yet.

134
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Did you catch this?

135
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,520
There's a longer chain so I have to use this one as my parent.

136
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,960
So this will be a pentanoic acid because it's a five carbon chain terminating in an

137
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,440
organic acid functional group.

138
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,160
I have one substituent with a single carbon so this is a methyl substituent.

139
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,920
And again because the carboxylic acid is a functional group it receives priority in

140
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,480
numbering.

141
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,040
So I'll number my parent chain in this way one to five in my example here from right

142
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,600
to left.

143
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:09,160
Now I can construct my name using the standard rules three methyl one pentanoic acid but

144
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,080
because the organic acid necessarily terminates a chain see it has two bonds to oxygen here

145
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,480
one bond to oxygen here leaving only one bond to go to the chain.

146
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:27,200
It's really not necessary to include the one so we omit this three methyl pentanoic acid.

147
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,360
The IUPAC nomenclature of esters is similar but there's one very important change and

148
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,560
that is that we have to remember that there is an R group attached to an oxygen now and

149
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,360
that oxygen won't have an address because it's not part of the parent carbon chain.

150
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,120
So that sp3 oxygen now becomes an address in and of itself otherwise we'll be following

151
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,040
the same essential nomenclature rules ultimately naming it a carboxylate.

152
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,400
Let's do an example.

153
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,840
Let's name this ester.

154
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,080
Again we want to first find the functional group and the parent carbon chain which would

155
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,200
include the carbonyl so I've highlighted that here in orange.

156
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,360
Now I have a butanowate because I have four carbons but I now have an ethyl substituent

157
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,400
on the sp3 oxygen rather than simply a hydrogen.

158
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,720
I also of course have this chloro group out here on the parent carbon chain now remember

159
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,480
the substituent on the sp3 oxygen always gets priority in the naming so in this case

160
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,840
I'll number my chain and I'll move the ethyl to the front of the name followed by my three

161
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,400
chloro for the substituent followed by my butanowate.

162
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:51,440
So this is ethyl three chloro butanowate.

163
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,280
So now that we've talked a little bit about nomenclature let's move on and think about

164
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,720
the properties of acids and esters.

165
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,640
Specifically let's take a look at a carboxylic acid here propionic acid and we'll break

166
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,080
its structure down and see if we can use that to explain some of the observations that we

167
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,800
make when we work with it in the laboratory.

168
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,880
Now propionic acid has carbon oxygen double bond with a dipole right here a carbon oxygen

169
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,600
single bond dipole here and also an OH dipole here.

170
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,000
So there are a number of polar bonds in this molecule which means that it's going to have

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,120
very high polarity.

172
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,840
It's also got oxygens with lone pair electrons and a very important OH motif.

173
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,680
This means that it is not only a hydrogen bond acceptor but can also be a hydrogen bond

174
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,000
donor.

175
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,520
So one molecule of propionic acid can easily create hydrogen bonds to another molecule

176
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
of propionic acid.

177
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,160
This leads to relatively high boiling points and means that acids tend to be either very

178
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,400
low volatility liquids or usually even solids around room temperature.

179
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:03,960
Now by comparison esters like this methyl acetate have the carbon oxygen double bond

180
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,800
dipole and actually two CO single bond dipoles but you notice that even though they have

181
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,720
all these polar bonds within the motif that they are lacking one very important piece

182
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,520
of the motif that we saw previously and that is there's no OH motif there's no OH bond

183
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,760
here.

184
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,360
That means that even though this methyl acetate can be a hydrogen bond acceptor through its

185
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,040
oxygens it has no way of donating a hydrogen and that means that with another methyl acetate

186
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,520
molecule they really can't interact in this way and what this means is that esters tend

187
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,680
to have lower boiling points than do their similar sized carboxylic acids.

188
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,040
So notice here that methyl acetate's boiling point is closer to that of pentane a hydrocarbon

189
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,120
of similar size than it is to propionic acid.

190
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,400
So this allows us to explain in some ways why it is that esters seem to be so important

191
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,120
in the aromas of wines whereas we see that acids tend to be more important toward the

192
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,200
flavors of wines.

193
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:14,840
It's a simple question of volatility you can't smell that which doesn't vaporize.

194
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,000
So let's survey all the boiling points from some of the oxygen containing compounds we've

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
looked at so far.

196
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,760
When we do we can see which types of bonds within the motif are most important to increasing

197
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,960
boiling points.

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,760
Notice that if I take pentane with no oxygens at all I get the lowest boiling point of all

199
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,840
but that simply adding sp3 oxygens or even carbonyls that can't hydrogen bond to other

200
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,120
molecules of the same kind I have only a modest increase in boiling point.

201
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,800
For example an ether, methyl acetate, butanol and methyl ethyl ketone.

202
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,400
But as soon as I introduce that OH group there allowing these molecules to hydrogen bond

203
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,760
to other molecules of the same type we see a drastic rise in the boiling points and therefore

204
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,840
we see a very different type of chemical behavior as well as physical behavior.

205
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,120
Now another very important difference between carboxylic acids and esters is their acid base

206
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
behavior.

207
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,920
Carboxylic acids get their name of course because they have an acidic hydrogen but they're

208
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,480
also amphoteric being ever so slightly basic.

209
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,280
So let's take a look at a carboxylic acid acting as a base for a moment.

210
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,560
Here is acetic acid a very simple carboxylic acid which has a carbonyl oxygen which is

211
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,200
at least in theory capable of donating an electron pair to form a new bond to a proton.

212
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,560
Now when it does this it creates this very unstable looking species but this very unstable

213
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,240
looking species also has resonance stabilization.

214
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,820
Not a lot but just enough to make it possible.

215
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,120
So what we're dealing with is the equilibrium between the acid and a conjugate base with

216
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,320
this very slight resonance stabilization but which is otherwise not very favorable looking

217
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
structure.

218
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,840
So it has a pKa of around negative seven.

219
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,560
This is a very strong acid right here a protonated carboxylic acid has acid strengths that begin

220
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,160
to rival things like hydrochloric acid some of the stronger mineral acids that we know

221
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,440
of but they can form under extreme conditions.

222
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,880
Of course carboxylic acids are much better at acting as acids and in that case they lose

223
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:29,480
their acidic hydrogen which is the OH to form a resonance stabilized carboxylate.

224
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,600
This is a fairly stable anion and therefore the pKa of a neutral carboxylic acid is somewhere

225
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
around five.

226
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,080
Now think about that compared to an alcohol with a pKa of around sixteen or seventeen

227
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,960
so we're talking about something that's millions of times more acidic.

228
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,400
Esters on the other hand although they are still considered as amphoteric can act as

229
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
a base in very much the same way.

230
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,440
Again my carbonyl oxygen here has lone pair electrons which you can use to form a new

231
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:06,520
bond and again create this resonance stabilized but somewhat unstable looking conjugate acid.

232
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,880
So in this case the pKa of our protonated esters it rivals that of our protonated carboxylic

233
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,840
acids at about negative seven but the real difference comes when we try to look at the

234
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
acidity of a neutral ester.

235
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,640
In this case there is no OH to be deprotonated so instead the most acidic hydrogen is here

236
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,640
one bond away from our carbonyl motif.

237
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,240
Now to deprotonate this we have to rely again on resonance stabilization to make it possible

238
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,680
but even this resonance stabilization doesn't make our deprotonated ester even remotely

239
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,840
as stable as a deprotonated carboxylic acid.

240
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,560
Consequence of this is that we have an acid, well not an acid, an ester which has a pKa

241
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,560
of about twenty five.

242
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Now carboxylic acids are the end of the line as oxidation of primary alcohols goes.

243
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,720
They can be produced using our now familiar aqueous chromic acid reaction in which one

244
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:13,280
round of oxidation produces an aldehyde followed by hydration and a second round of oxidation.

245
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,320
You may remember that last time we learned pyridinium chlorochromate or PCC could be

246
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,760
used to halt ethanol oxidation at the acid-aldehyde stage, indeed it could do this for any primary

247
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,400
alcohol.

248
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,840
But if we instead wanted to continue oxidation to the extreme and reach a carboxylic acid

249
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,640
we can treat that primary alcohol with aqueous chromic acid and in this way not only would

250
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,280
a primary alcohol like ethanol be oxidized to an aldehyde like ethanol but it would then

251
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,080
be oxidized again to ethanoic acid which we commonly know as acetic acid.

252
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,760
But carboxylic acids don't have to be created from starting materials that have oxygen in

253
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
them.

254
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,160
Now certain alkenes can also be oxidized to form acids using a suitable oxidizing agent

255
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
as well.

256
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,080
Consider for example 2-butene which can be reacted with potassium permanganate under acidic

257
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,840
conditions to produce two molecules of acetic acid.

258
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,280
This reaction takes place to an intermediate which we would call a viscinal dial and the

259
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,880
viscinal dial quickly splits under acidic conditions to form two carboxylic acids, in

260
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,840
this case two molecules of acetic acid.

261
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,920
So we sometimes refer to this technique as oxidative cleavage of a double bond.

262
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,560
No discussion of carboxylic acids and esters is complete without mentioning one of the

263
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,920
most prolific chemists of the 1800s and someone whose contributions to the science we've

264
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,480
already begun to explore in earlier lectures.

265
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,200
I'm speaking of Hermann and Milfischer, a revered German chemist whose work on carbohydrates

266
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,720
will be one of the highlights of our lecture on that topic.

267
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,080
Now far from being just a carbohydrate chemist, Fischer was driven to synthesize many of the

268
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,560
small biologically relevant molecules we encounter on an almost daily basis.

269
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,880
These include caffeine found in coffee and tea and the theobromine found in chocolate.

270
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,320
He's also well known for developing a technique for producing an ester from a carboxylic acid

271
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,200
under very mild reaction conditions, a reaction which bears his name to this day.

272
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,720
This reaction called the Fischer esterification is a condensation reaction, meaning that it

273
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
forms water as a byproduct.

274
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,240
It relies on a strong mineral acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid.

275
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,760
Now just like ketone and aldehyde carbonyls, in this protonated state the carbon of a carboxylic

276
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,800
acid becomes significantly electrophilic and can be attacked by even weak nucleophiles

277
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,160
like a neutral alcohol.

278
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,680
This attack forms a tetrahedral intermediate, which can take on two different tautomeric

279
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,840
states, one in which the attacking alcohol oxygen is protonated and one in which a hydroxyl

280
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,720
oxygen of the original acid is protonated.

281
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,760
So the departure of an alcohol from this original tautomer would constitute a simple

282
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,800
reversal of the first step.

283
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,120
But if instead a water can depart from the second tautomer, thereby you get a protonated

284
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,560
ester, which quickly loses the catalytic proton to become neutral again.

285
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,840
So one of the great benefits of Fischer esterifications when compared to other methods of the day

286
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,960
is that none of the reagents are sensitive to water, notoriously difficult substance

287
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,040
to exclude from organic reactions.

288
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,880
But this benefit comes at a cost, that the reaction is an equilibrium, which only very

289
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,920
slightly favors product formation.

290
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,640
So Fischer esterifications usually require the use of one reagent in extremely high concentrations

291
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,640
to ensure that the other is almost completely converted.

292
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,840
Now in yet another twist, the nearly equal energies of the reactants and products means

293
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,880
that we can turn the Fischer esterification reaction around, reversing the roles of product

294
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,760
and reactant.

295
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,360
So we can exploit Le Chatelier's principle and turn a Fischer esterification into an

296
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,640
ester hydrolysis, simply by changing the solvent from alcohol to water.

297
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:24,320
The product of this reaction should be a nearly complete conversion of ester to acid.

298
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,320
So let's take a look at an interesting ester that you may have already encountered and

299
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
not even known it.

300
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,120
There's a popular antiviral drug that's on the market today, it's called Tamiflu.

301
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,760
And Tamiflu itself contains an ester motif, and it's part of a very interesting class

302
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,160
of compounds called prodrux.

303
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,520
This is a molecule called Oseltamivir.

304
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,480
Now Oseltamivir, you'll notice, has an ester motif.

305
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,120
Here's another molecule that's very similar, called Oseltamivir carboxylic, which I've

306
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,160
drawn as a carboxylic acid, but could just as easily have been drawn in its deprotonated

307
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,520
state.

308
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,080
What's interesting about these two molecules is the properties that they have.

309
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,040
So it turns out Oseltamivir, when you swallow it, about 80% of that molecule gets from your

310
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,640
GI tract into your bloodstream.

311
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,800
This is a pretty good delivery for a drug molecule.

312
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:25,300
Whereas Oseltamivir carboxylate is only about 5% absorbed, meaning that for every 20 molecules

313
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,840
of this that you swallow, only one of them ultimately makes it all the way into your

314
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
bloodstream.

315
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,240
Now here's another interesting factoid.

316
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,040
Oseltamivir does absolutely nothing to help you get over the flu.

317
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,720
Whereas Oseltamivir carboxylate does.

318
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,240
It actually binds to the capsids of viruses and thereby sort of prevents them from adhering

319
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,400
to the cell so that they can inject their RNA into their damage.

320
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,080
But remember, Oseltamivir carboxylate is not absorbed into your bloodstream where it could

321
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,400
help you.

322
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,040
So are we, is all lost here?

323
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Is there no reason to continue looking at or working with either one of these molecules?

324
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,800
I don't think so.

325
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,320
They differ by, again, only one functional group, this ethyl ester and this carboxylic

326
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,480
acid.

327
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:20,720
But we know how to convert one into the other so we can exploit the properties of both molecules.

328
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,960
This is the way that Tamiflu works.

329
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,300
Oseltamivir is put into a pill or capsule which a patient swallows.

330
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,020
This molecule reaches the patient's GI tract where it is transferred into the bloodstream

331
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:37,580
very efficiently but where it also can't do anything to help fight a viral infection.

332
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,860
But in your bloodstream naturally is water and also enzymes from your liver which specialize

333
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,540
in hydrolyzing this bond in the same way that a fissurist verification would.

334
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:54,380
So once this molecule is already in your bloodstream, your body converts it from the ethyl ester

335
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,780
into the carboxylic acid.

336
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,820
Oseltamivir carboxylate can now do its job having been delivered as a different molecule

337
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,380
altogether.

338
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,580
So this strategy constitutes what we call a pro-drug and you'll find uses of them in

339
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,620
many different therapies, not just antivirals.

340
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,420
So we know that esters can be chemically broken down to acids by enzymes in our body or in

341
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,700
a beaker using aqueous acid as an a fissurist verification.

342
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,300
But there's yet another method available for hydrolyzing esters which was in use long before

343
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,180
beakers even existed.

344
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:35,100
See, soap making is a process nearly as old as or possibly even older than recorded history

345
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,940
with the first credible historical sources of these recipes being on a Babylonian tablet

346
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,940
which is nearly 5,000 years old.

347
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,100
So early soap makers deserve credit as some of the first, albeit unwitting, organic chemists

348
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,900
of the human race.

349
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,820
The traditional making of soap uses a reaction which accomplishes nearly the same result

350
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,340
as an acidic ester hydrolysis reaction, but it does so irreversibly and with remarkable

351
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,220
ease and efficiency.

352
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,900
You may recall that animal fats and vegetable oils contain compounds known as triacylglycerides.

353
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,540
We've already seen how Sabatier in his contemporaries toyed with the saturation of these alkyl chains

354
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,820
using hydrogenation reactions.

355
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,260
But triacylglycerides are useful for much more than just a food source.

356
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,540
When the ester bonds are broken in these molecules, several useful compounds can result, including

357
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,340
those used in soap.

358
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,580
So instead of relying on the acidity to increase the electrophilicity of an ester, suponification

359
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,460
relies on the removal of a proton from water to produce a stronger nucleophile in the form

360
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,900
of hydroxide.

361
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,500
This is easily accomplished even in ancient times by allowing rainwater to percolate through

362
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,740
wood ashes, which creates a material known as lye.

363
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,860
Modern chemists would probably call this potassium hydroxide.

364
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:05,660
The hydroxide from lye is a much better nucleophile than water, and it attacks the carbonyl of

365
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,300
neutral esters easily to form a tetrahedral intermediate.

366
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,660
Just as with the acidic mechanism, this intermediate is now faced with two options, lose a hydroxide,

367
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:23,900
go back to starting materials, or lose an alkoxide as it recovers its carbonyl bond.

368
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,060
So now we can see the secret to the irreversibility of suponification and why it's so easy to

369
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,580
run this reaction to completion.

370
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,460
The final step in the mechanism involves the transfer of a proton from the resulting carboxylic

371
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:44,100
acid, the pKa of about 5, to the byproduct alkoxide, which has a conjugate acid pKa of

372
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,300
about 16.

373
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:52,700
With pKa values this drastically different, clearly the proton transfer is not only fast,

374
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,820
but irreversible, and the products obtained are alcohol and the carboxylate salt of an

375
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,540
organic acid.

376
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,540
This carboxylate salt is no longer reactive and can be isolated from the resulting glycerol,

377
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,580
so our soap preparation is complete.

378
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,940
But suponification is not limited to the hydrolysis of fats.

379
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,660
It can be used to disassemble a range of esters into carboxylates and alcohols, and so it

380
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:26,260
gives us yet another tool to break down practically any small organic ester that we desire.

381
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,740
I think it's time now.

382
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,060
We've finally amassed a substantial arsenal of techniques for the inner conversion of

383
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:38,180
hydrocarbons, alkyl halides, and oxygen-containing compounds that we can begin to appreciate

384
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,220
and participate in a synthetic design problem.

385
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,300
So let's pretend that we're chemists attempting to synthesize adipic acid, a dicarboxylic

386
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,780
acid used frequently in the manufacture of nylon.

387
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:59,060
But let's simplify this problem and say we have only cyclohexanol and other common inorganic

388
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,100
reagents to work with.

389
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,860
Now your instinct might be to begin by considering cyclohexanol and all the different compounds

390
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,420
one could make from it, then consider how each of those might be modified.

391
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,980
But even our small arsenal of techniques leads to a hopelessly complex diagram of potential

392
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,860
reactions which could take us far too long to consider.

393
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,340
Not only that, but a typical lab will have an inventory of reagents, all of which could

394
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,700
be considered as starting materials.

395
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,840
So the number of permutations of reactions grows so rapidly that it becomes absolutely

396
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,340
overwhelming.

397
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,500
So is all hope lost?

398
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,940
Well, of course not.

399
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,980
Just like solving a maze can be much simpler if you start from the destination and work

400
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,420
backwards, so can a synthesis puzzle be better attacked in that way?

401
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:56,660
One way which chemists attack this is to use a technique that we call retro-synthetic analysis.

402
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,940
So if we turn our attention from the starting material to the product and ask ourselves

403
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:10,460
what could I make this material from, usually we find just a few realistic possibilities.

404
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,940
Contemplating the reaction in this way, in reverse, it's called retro-synthetic analysis.

405
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:23,220
And often block arrows are used to distinguish this kind of analysis from a forward synthesis.

406
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:30,260
For example, adipic acid can be produced in a single step using only two of our techniques,

407
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:40,420
either the oxidation of a dialdehyde or the oxidative cleavage of a cyclic alkene.

408
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:45,380
Now let's take a look at these two and ask ourselves how might we prepare these potential

409
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,380
intermediates?

410
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,900
Well, the needed dialdehyde could be produced by oxidation of a corresponding diol, but

411
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,340
we're two steps along our retro-synthesis and this product isn't looking much like

412
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,860
our available starting material, is it?

413
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,340
Ah, but cyclohexene shows promise.

414
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:09,100
It more closely resembles the starting material because of the six-membered ring that it has.

415
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,980
Now a quick survey of methods for preparing alkenes reminds us that we can prepare them

416
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,780
by elimination reactions involving the appropriate alcohol under acidic conditions.

417
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:25,540
So what appears to be an overwhelming synthetic problem is now solved in just a few short

418
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:31,220
steps using retro-synthetic analysis.

419
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,180
So today we concluded our tour of oxygen-containing compounds by covering carboxylic acids and

420
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,900
esters.

421
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:44,740
We discussed how both of these motifs contain an sp3 oxygen connected to a carbonyl carbon.

422
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,540
How carboxylic acids stand alone among compounds we've looked at so far and how acidic they

423
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,500
are and how replacement of that acidic hydrogen converts the motif to what is known as an ester

424
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,180
with drastically different solubility, volatility, and acid-base properties.

425
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,060
We took a look at two ways to prepare carboxylic acids.

426
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,060
First, by the oxidation of aldehydes with chromic acid, emulating the action of acetylbacter,

427
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,260
and second we saw how they can be prepared by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with

428
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,300
hot potassium permanganate.

429
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,700
Then we took a look at the Fischer's Derrification, which allows us to produce esters from an organic

430
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,100
acid and an alcohol.

431
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,300
We also saw how this process can be reversed to get the acid and alcohol back in a process

432
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,540
called acid hydrolysis.

433
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,020
We discussed how enzymes in your body can accelerate the same process in your bloodstream,

434
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,940
prompting medical researchers to use esters frequently in a class of pharmaceuticals

435
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,180
known as pro-drugs, including products like Tamiflu, which have significantly improved

436
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,660
bioavailability over the active compound alone.

437
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,420
Next we covered saponification, an age-old process in which a strong hydroxide solution

438
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,860
is used to promote hydrolysis of esters.

439
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,460
This process is most well-known for its use in the production of soap products, but is

440
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,580
applicable to a wide range of organic reactions.

441
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,100
And finally, we were introduced to a technique known as retro-synthetic analysis, in which

442
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,740
we navigate a synthetic problem backwards in order to minimize the number of reactions

443
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,340
that we have to consider.

444
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,380
As we close the book on oxygen-containing motifs, we'll move forward and add yet another

445
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,780
highly influential element to our discussion.

446
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,300
Nitrogen is next on our tour of common functional groups.

447
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,860
I'll see you then.
