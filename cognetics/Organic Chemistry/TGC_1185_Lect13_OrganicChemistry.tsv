0	17520	In today's health-conscious world, we often see the terms saturated and unsaturated used
17520	21120	in reference to fats, which are part of our diets.
21120	25400	Most of us are familiar with the general idea that saturated fats tend to be solid at room
25400	32520	temperature, compared to unsaturated fats, which commonly exist in the liquid form.
32520	37440	In our lecture on alkenes and alkynes, we discussed how these terms are used by chemists
37440	42440	to describe the presence and number of pi bonds in hydrocarbons.
42440	47360	Saturated hydrocarbons contain no pi bonds at all, while unsaturated hydrocarbons do,
47360	50120	sometimes one, sometimes more.
50120	54120	In the case of fats, we're using these terms in exactly the same way.
54120	58560	They also refer to the presence and number of pi bonds, but this time they're on the
58560	61680	hydrocarbon tails of fat molecules.
61680	65720	The kind of fat molecules I'm referring to look something like this.
65720	72120	Now this would be an example of a triacylglyceride, or a fat consisting of three long hydrocarbon
72120	78480	tails, which are coming off of a motif that we call glycerol motif, or a triacyl motif.
78480	82240	But we don't really want to look at that right now, so we're more interested in the
82240	83880	chains on the fats.
83880	88240	Now in this animal fat product here, you'll notice that all of the hydrocarbons within
88240	93280	the tail, all three of them, consist entirely of sp3 carbons.
93280	98200	But if I bring up a similar triacylglyceride, or fat, but one that you might find in a plant
98200	104280	product, what you should immediately notice is that the tails in the hydrocarbons are
104280	106400	no longer saturated.
106400	111620	They contain pi bonds, and those pi bonds cause the chains to kink and move outward in
111620	118160	different directions instead of packing together nicely as they do in the saturated version.
118160	123340	So this is our explanation of how and why vegetable oils tend to be liquids, whereas
123340	126620	animal products tend to be solids.
126620	130900	So most of us know that medical science has determined that saturated fats are far less
130900	135740	healthy for human consumption than their unsaturated counterparts.
135740	140180	But what you may not know is that the scientific world's very first foray into the chemistry
140180	146380	of this type of compound was actually a crusade to find ways to convert unsaturated fats into
146380	147940	their saturated counterparts.
147940	149620	Yeah, that's right.
149620	154060	In the early decades of the 1900s, a great deal of chemistry was developed, and even
154060	160260	a Nobel Prize awarded for techniques which are used to turn healthy plant oils into artery-clogging
160260	168060	saturated fats by removing the double bonds in favor of additional bonded hydrogens.
168060	174400	In short, any reaction which converts unsaturated carbons, or those in SP, or SP2 hybridization
174400	180780	states, into saturated carbons, or those in SP3 hybridization states, is referred to
180780	183640	as an addition reaction.
183640	188260	This class of reaction represents the third permutation in our trifecta of simple organic
188260	189900	reactions.
189900	194180	And today we're going to take a look at several examples of this class of reactions, including
194180	199980	the now infamous, but often necessary, process of hydrogenating oils to change their chemical
199980	205220	properties.
205220	208940	So far we've covered substitution and elimination.
208940	213260	Substitutions can be simply described as molecules exchanging groups, like the exchange
213260	217060	of chloride for a hydroxyl group.
217060	221820	Elimination can be described as a decomposition in which a molecule loses some attached groups
221900	226620	to become less saturated, like the conversion of ethyl chloride into ethylene.
226620	231820	Today, we're going to complete that trifecta of fundamental organic reactions by discussing
231820	238980	that third possibility, adding new groups to unsaturated molecules by sacrificing pi bonds.
238980	243420	This is what we call addition.
243420	249420	So addition reactions involve the replacement of a pi bond with new sigma bonds to new substrates.
249420	254060	And this means that these reactions tend to be entropically disfavored.
254060	257380	They create fewer molecules than they consume.
257380	263100	But from an enthalpy standpoint, they're usually favored, since the newly created sigma bonds
263100	269980	are lower in energy and therefore more stable than the pi bonds in the starting materials.
269980	274780	So let's begin by considering the reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons, those alkenes
274780	278420	and alkynes that we looked at earlier in the course.
278420	282620	The presence of a pi bond gives them an ability, unique among those compounds we've investigated
282620	288060	so far, to act as nucleophiles themselves instead of as a substrate.
288060	294180	They use their pi electrons to attack electrophilic species.
294180	300260	So let's consider what happens when an alkene, like propene, attacks a generic electrophile.
300260	303820	Since we're concerned with the behavior of the alkene itself, for now I'm just going
303820	307780	to use a letter E to represent that electrophile.
307780	312860	Now our propene molecule sees an opportunity to convert its pi bond electrons into more
312860	318300	stable sigma bonding electrons by attacking that electrophile.
318300	322740	But doing so means that the resulting species must take on a positive charge and become
322740	325420	a carbocation.
325420	327220	So the tables have turned now.
327220	331500	The original nucleophile is now an electrophile.
331500	335900	The adjacent carbon is electron deficient, positively charged and ready to be attacked
335900	341300	itself by anything nucleophilic enough to do so.
341300	344900	So you may notice I've been deliberately vague about exactly what this electrophilic
344900	347060	intermediate looks like.
347060	351860	And this is because unlike substitution and elimination reactions, even some of the most
351860	356380	elementary addition reactions can proceed through a wide variety of transition states
356380	361820	and intermediates owing to the complex structure of that transition state that's produced
361820	364580	during the process.
364580	368020	Today we're going to be investigating a few of these mechanisms in an attempt to understand
368020	374700	some of the more fundamental addition reactions of organic chemistry.
374700	379980	Now before his epic clash with Zetsev over the regiochemistry of elimination reactions,
379980	385140	Markovnikov had already made a name for himself by publishing his famous rule governing the
385140	389260	regiochemistry of addition reactions.
389260	393820	These addition reactions can be used to produce alkyl halides from alkenes.
393820	399580	And we call this class of reactions hydrohalogenation because the reaction involves adding a molecule
399580	405020	of HCl or HBr across a double bond.
405020	410780	You see, even though he was never quite certain exactly how it happened, Markovnikov was able
410780	416460	to demonstrate that any time an alkene with sp2 carbons of differing substitution, like
416460	422660	our propene, was reacted with a hydrogen halide, like this hydrochloric acid.
422660	430460	The newly added halogen is always added preferentially to the more substituted carbon of the alkene,
430460	435700	and consequently the hydrogen would end up on the less substituted carbon.
435700	439180	So let's take a look at Markovnikov's rule in action and see if we can mechanistically
439180	442820	explain exactly how and why this happens.
442820	448300	It took about 30 years and the proposal of the carbocation structure to finally bring
448300	450740	it all into focus.
450740	453620	So here's the reaction that we've been discussing so far today.
453620	458820	We have a molecule of propene with a double bond, and it's going to react with a molecule
458820	460740	of hydrochloric acid.
460740	464700	I've highlighted the hydrogen from the hydrochloric acid, so it's easy to follow it through the
464700	470500	reaction and not confuse it with the other hydrogens from the propene molecule.
470500	475060	So we have this set of pi electrons that's willing to act as a nucleophile, and it's
475060	481580	going to attack, obviously, the most electrophilic site on our acid, the proton.
481580	485860	When this happens, there are actually two different ways that this proton can attach
485860	488900	itself to the propene molecule.
488900	494280	In the first, we have the proton from the hydrochloric acid attaching itself at the end
494280	500500	of the molecule, creating our secondary carbocation, and in the other possibility, it attaches itself
500500	504740	here to the secondary carbon, creating a primary carbocation.
504740	510340	So we've got two potential intermediate states here, in which our hydrogen from the hydrochloric
510340	515180	acid is in a different position on the carbocation.
515180	519940	Now in the top example, my carbocation is attacked by the resulting chloride from the
519940	527100	initial process, creating a molecule of 2-chloropropane.
527100	531820	But in my second example, the reactive site is now on the primary carbon, and that would
531820	535820	generate 1-chloropropane.
535820	539420	And we already know from our discussions about alkyl halides in the carbocation they can
539420	546100	produce that the secondary carbocation is far more stable than the primary carbocation.
546100	550860	Markovnikov simply made this observation that the products are consistent with this.
550860	555540	So when we have a more substituted alkyl halide forming, as is the case here with our secondary
555540	559900	product, we call it the Markovnikov addition product.
560260	565260	Whereas if it ends up at the less substituted carbon of the original double bond, we call
565260	567020	this an anti-Markovnikov.
567020	571420	And Markovnikov's rule simply states that the major product will be the one of greater
571420	575660	substitution.
575660	579180	So there's some evidence for this that we've managed to collect over the years as organic
579180	584780	chemists, not the least of which is the fact that we can't make a chiral product using
584780	586620	this type of reaction.
586620	588580	And the reason is, as follows.
588700	593780	I have my attack on my hydrogen from my hydrochloric acid just as before.
593780	598980	But in this case, the substrate I've used has a more substituted carbon, which contains
598980	607100	three different groups, a methyl group represented by Me, an ethyl group represented by Et, and
607100	613540	what would be over here a three-carbon group, which is eventually going to be propyl.
613540	618620	So when my addition reaction takes place, I produce my carbocation intermediate, which
618620	621220	is planar at this location.
621220	626340	And that means that the chloride nucleophile can attack either from the top of my molecule
626340	628060	or from the bottom.
628060	632700	And there's nothing in particular stopping it from coming in from either direction.
632700	638340	The result of this is that we make a perfectly equal mixture of the R and S enantiomers of
638340	639340	the products.
639340	642300	We call this a racemic mixture.
642300	646380	And it's the presence of these racemic products in reactions like this that gives us some
646380	649740	evidence for carbocation formation.
652740	656860	Now additionally, this mechanism is supported by the fact that we see rearrangements in
656860	659380	hydrohalogenations of alkenes.
659380	665060	Now an example of a reaction in which this might happen is the reaction of 3-methyl-1
665060	668140	butene with hydrochloric acid.
668140	673180	So again, I'm going to conduct my reaction just as we discussed previously.
673180	678420	My alkene will attack the hydrogen from the HCl, creating my new nucleophile in the form
678420	682020	of chloride ion.
682020	688500	Now when this happens, I have that magic recipe of a secondary carbocation adjacent to a tertiary
688500	690860	center on the molecule.
690860	697700	So this is a perfectly primed carbocation to undergo what we would call a hydride shift.
697700	701900	So I've labeled the shifting hydride here in orange and I've introduced it into my line
701900	706900	angle formula below so that we can track it through the shift.
706900	712100	So as the shift takes place, my carbocation increases in substitution from secondary to
712100	717540	now tertiary and that tertiary carbocation is what's attacked by the chloride ion to
717540	721020	complete the reaction.
721020	726180	So the fact that I generate a tertiary alkyl halide here in this reaction, instead of the
726180	731300	expected secondary alkyl halide, tells me that I'm probably going through a carbocation
731300	735860	since they're so, so very prone to rearranging like this.
735860	740820	So one might wonder how a rule governing such a small subset of reactions led to such great
740820	743380	fame for Markovnikov.
743380	748580	But the truth is that although his rules originally were focused on the addition of hydrogen halides
748580	754180	like hydrochloric acid, they're remarkably consistent when applied to many, many more
754180	757860	reactions, some of which we'll investigate in future lectures.
757860	763140	So from time to time, you'll hear me refer to addition reactions as being Markovnikov
763140	770180	or Antimarkovnikov, just as I'll be referring to eliminations as Zetsev or Antizetsev, sometimes
770180	774460	called Hoffman.
774460	779860	Now very similar chemistry takes place in the case of hydrohalogenation of alkynes.
779860	783540	They can be hydrohalogenated either once or twice.
783540	787600	The major difference here is that to complete the first addition requires the formation
787600	789100	of a vinyl cation.
789100	794140	Now the word vinyl actually comes from the Latin for wine and it's sort of a tie to
794140	797460	the ethanol molecule because they both have two carbons.
797460	802340	Now it's difficult to say if this is really how the reaction proceeds, but what's undeniable
802340	808460	is that it proceeds much more slowly than does the hydrohalogenation of an alkene.
809460	814540	Nonetheless, it can be achieved, creating what we call a vinyl halide in accordance with
814540	817420	Markovnikov's rule.
817420	821900	Of course, in the presence of excess hydrogen halide, this is a little consequence to us
821900	827460	because any stereochemistry that's introduced in the form of ENZ isomers will be wiped out
827460	833700	when the carbocation forms in the second hydrohalogenation step.
833700	837620	When this takes place, Markovnikov's rule holds yet again.
837620	843500	But even in situations involving equally substituted sp2 carbons, the halogen will end up on the
843500	847140	same carbon atom as its predecessor.
847140	852100	This is because the attached halogen atom stabilizes the carbocation by resonance on
852100	855700	its way to becoming what we call a geminal dihalide.
855700	860940	Now geminal is a word meaning twins and it implies that those two halogens are on the
860940	863540	same carbon.
863540	870100	The alternate possibility would be called a visceral dihalide from the word for neighbor.
870100	874300	That indicates the halogen atoms are on adjacent carbons, but this doesn't happen in this type
874300	878420	of reaction.
878420	881460	So how might one go about making that visceral dihalide?
881460	887580	Well, another commonly used addition reaction is the addition of molecular chlorine or bromine
887580	890380	to alkenes.
890380	895140	Unlike radical halogenation of alkenes, we don't have to resort to extremes like photoactivated
895140	899620	radical chemistry to halogenate these alkenes and alkynes.
899620	904380	This reaction is typically accomplished simply using molecular halogens like chlorine or
904380	905540	bromine.
905540	910260	And we do this in a non-nucleophilic solvent like dichloromethane to try to discourage
910260	914420	any outside or unexpected reactions from taking place.
915340	921420	In the case of a halogenation of an alkene, we actually have a very unusual intermediate
921420	922700	which forms.
922700	927820	So in order to show you this first, I'm going to run a reaction between chlorine gas depicted
927820	934620	here as my green diatomic molecule and a very familiar molecule from class ethene.
934620	939580	It's going to proceed through something called a chloronium intermediate and a chloride ion
939580	944380	will attack my chloronium intermediate to complete the reaction.
944380	946620	So let's watch this reaction take place.
946620	950220	Now we're used to seeing ethene drawn like this in sort of a plan view where I'm looking
950220	954180	down on all of the atoms in the plane of the page.
954180	958780	But to show you this reaction properly, I'm going to have to turn that molecule 90 degrees
958780	962540	and look at it end on.
962540	967340	When I do this, the reactive position of a chlorine might be something like this.
967340	969420	So remember, there's a double bond here.
969420	973260	The second bond is sort of obscured by the rotation, but it's still there.
973260	977460	And that means that it can attack my chlorine gas molecule.
977460	981420	And you probably are already ready to stop me here and say, wait a minute, Professor Davis,
981420	986020	you just told me that this is a nucleophile attacking an electrophile, but I don't see
986020	987340	any dipole here.
987340	990860	I see two equal atoms of equal electronegativity.
990860	992380	You'd be right about that.
992380	997540	But you've got to remember that halogens have very large electron clouds and are very polarizable.
997540	1001900	So as the alkene attacks one of these two chlorine atoms, the electrons can run away
1001900	1007620	to the other side, inducing a dipole and ultimately breaking the bond between the two chlorine
1007620	1009820	atoms.
1009820	1014780	When this takes place, I create something called a chloronium ion.
1014780	1020180	Now unlike a carbocation, a chloronium ion has a cyclic structure consisting of three
1020180	1025260	atoms, the two original carbons from the alkene and one of the chlorines from the original
1025260	1027660	chlorine molecule.
1027660	1030700	And the bonds I've shown you here are sort of partially formed.
1030700	1034940	They're not really a very excellent representation of how it looks, but it's the best that we
1034940	1037740	can do while drawing these on a page.
1037740	1042980	But what is true is that the chlorine that's part of the chloronium ion is sitting on top
1042980	1045220	of what used to be the double bond.
1045220	1050500	It's not really, hasn't been claimed really by either one of these two carbons.
1050500	1054780	And because it sits directly in the middle and because it's so large, it sterically
1054780	1059580	obstructs the nucleuride ion from attacking from the same side.
1059580	1064140	So the only way that this chloride ion can get around and reach these electrophilic carbons
1064140	1067380	is to move to the other side of the molecule.
1067380	1071740	At this point, attack can occur and one of those bonds holding the cyclic chloronium
1071740	1074780	ion together will break.
1074780	1078940	So I'll end up with a visceral dihalide in this case.
1078940	1084300	Not only that, but my visceral dihalide is the product of what we call an anti-addition,
1084300	1089980	meaning that the two new bonds are made from opposing sides rather than from the same side
1089980	1092540	of that alkene.
1092540	1097500	So the consequences of this anti-addition become more important when we consider halogenation
1097500	1103740	using more complex alkenes, like 3,4-dimethyl-3-heptene.
1103740	1108140	Since the starting material is planar, the chloronium ion, of course, can form from either
1108140	1109460	side.
1109460	1115380	But once a chloronium ion is formed, only the opposing side can be attacked by the chloride
1115380	1120060	ion to complete the reaction, leading to a mixture of enantiomers.
1120060	1126220	So halogenation of the Z-isomer of my starting material will produce a set of enantiomers
1126220	1129900	in the RR and SS form.
1129900	1134860	But these products are distinct from that produced when I halogenate the E-isomer, which
1134860	1140420	would be the SR and RS products.
1140420	1146460	Now, alkenes can undergo halogenation in similar reactions.
1146460	1149900	First forming an alkene with two halogens, transferred to one another because of the
1149900	1157020	anti-addition, followed by a second halogenation to form a tetrahalogenated alkane.
1157020	1162220	Now, when the product of a single halogenation is desired, carefully controlling the amount
1162220	1167500	of halogen added is all that's required.
1167500	1173260	So adding just one molar equivalent of halogen will produce that one-two dihaloalkene, almost
1173260	1175340	exclusively.
1175340	1181380	And this works because the resulting dihalogenated alkene has two electronegative halogen atoms
1181380	1187220	attached, withdrawing electron density from the pi bond, making it less nucleophilic,
1187220	1192660	and therefore much less reactive than the alkyne starting material.
1192660	1197380	So we don't expect the second halogenation addition to take place until all the starting
1197380	1200100	alkene has been consumed.
1200100	1207660	This means that I could, for example, produce trans-2,3-di-chloro-2-butene from 2-butyne
1207660	1212860	simply by carefully adding exactly one molar equivalent of chlorine to the alkyne starting
1212860	1213380	material.
1218220	1225980	In the 1890s, an American chemist named James F. Boyce Sr. developed a method for processing
1225980	1231500	cottonseed oil into a material of greater viscosity, more suitable for use in soap and
1231500	1234100	food products.
1234100	1238180	He discovered that the addition of a small amount of nickel to the mixture facilitated
1238180	1243900	the addition of hydrogen molecules to form this new product, and it changed the properties
1243900	1247660	in a favorable way.
1247660	1252740	Now this work was also picked up by a renowned French chemist named Paul Sabatier.
1252740	1257820	He refined this process into the catalytic hydrogenation which earned him a Nobel Prize
1257820	1260780	and today bears his name.
1260780	1265860	You see what Boyce and Sabatier were after was a process which would convert less saturated,
1265860	1272260	less expensive, plant oils into molecules more closely resembling animal fats.
1272260	1276500	This is because animal fats have a higher degree of saturation, making them solids near
1276500	1280220	room temperature and increasing their shelf life.
1280220	1284700	Now because animal fats are more expensive, converting a cheaper source, like vegetable
1284700	1290420	oils, into a similar material was just good business.
1290420	1294500	Their success in this endeavor led to the production of partially hydrogenated vegetable
1294500	1300540	oils which we're so accustomed to seeing listed on the back of food packages even today.
1300540	1306180	The double bonds of hydrocarbons can be saturated using molecular hydrogen at pretty reasonable
1306180	1310300	temperatures and pressures, achievable even in Sabatier's day.
1310300	1312300	But there's one important catch to this.
1312300	1316260	The reaction is painfully slow.
1316260	1320900	So Boyce and Sabatier realized that the solution to this problem was the use of a catalyst
1320900	1325740	to weaken the bond in the hydrogen molecules, thereby promoting the reaction without the
1325740	1328940	need for excessive temperatures.
1329900	1333660	Fortunately, such catalysts exist.
1333660	1340020	Unfortunately, these catalysts are very rare and expensive metals like platinum and palladium.
1340020	1345020	And Sabatier's method uses heterogeneous catalysis, meaning the catalyst itself is
1345020	1349100	a solid while the reagents are liquid or gas phase.
1349100	1353460	And even though the metal catalyst is not consumed in the reaction, a massive precious
1353460	1358980	metal would cost a great deal of money only to have a small exposed surface area onto
1358980	1364340	which that chemistry can take place.
1364340	1369380	This potentially prohibitive cost issue is often circumvented by producing a catalyst
1369380	1375660	not as a pure metal material but as a thin veneer of precious metal adhered to a highly
1375660	1378740	porous carbon support.
1378740	1383100	This tremendously increases the amount of surface area which can be generated per gram
1383100	1388460	of metal, making this process much more cost effective.
1388460	1392500	So let's take a look at this catalytic hydrogenation in action.
1392500	1398140	What I have here is a very simple hydrogenation reaction in which I'm going to attach a hydrogen,
1398140	1405460	which is represented here by the small molecule, to again our very familiar ethene alkene molecule.
1405460	1409180	And I've indicated that I'll be doing this using a catalyst, which is consisting of platinum
1409180	1413380	metal adhered to a carbon support.
1413380	1418540	And when the reaction takes place, of course my product, which I hope to make, is ethane
1418540	1420940	gas.
1420940	1423700	So I've depicted my catalyst as simply a bar down here.
1423700	1428500	Of course it would really be an array of exposed precious metal atoms.
1428500	1433340	And to that I'm going to add my hydrogen and my alkene.
1433340	1437540	But just as before when we did our halogenation, I have to turn my alkene so that we can see
1437540	1440420	it in the reactive orientation.
1440420	1446140	As it approaches the surface of the catalyst, the hydrogen is first separated into separate
1446140	1447460	hydrogen atoms.
1447460	1452300	So we've already succeeded in weakening the bond between the two hydrogens.
1452300	1458780	My alkene comes in from the side and new bonds are formed to the activated hydrogen atoms
1458780	1461300	at the catalyst surface.
1461300	1465220	Once hydrogenation is complete, you can see the molecule detaches itself and moves back
1465220	1469140	away into either the liquid or gas phase.
1469140	1474220	Now the catch to this, of course, is we can only add the hydrogens from the same side
1474220	1480620	of the alkene, meaning that this particular process proceeds as a syn addition.
1480620	1485620	Syn meaning the same side of the alkene is modified.
1485620	1490940	So in situations where we have reactions which may produce stereoisomers, meaning when these
1490940	1495580	carbons here have different substituents, we have a potential for a different kind of
1495580	1500860	product to form, one which is either a particular diastereomer or a particular enantiomer.
1500860	1506580	So in the case of asymmetrical alkenes, this means the reaction is diastereoselective.
1506580	1514900	An example of this is catalytic hydrogenation of E3-4-dimethyl-3-octene.
1514900	1520780	This reaction produces the RR and SS pair of stereoisomers.
1520780	1526460	Now the catalytic hydrogenation of the Z-stereoisomer, the same starting material, would lead to
1526460	1530260	the RS and SR stereoisomers.
1530260	1536380	So in this case, my choice of starting material is very important.
1536380	1540620	Now hydrogenation of alkenes is yet another versatile set of reactions.
1540620	1542940	And this process was developed by Sabatier.
1542940	1549300	It's quite effective for the complete hydrogenation of an alkyne all the way to an alkane.
1549300	1557820	But it's difficult, if not impossible, to halt the reaction at the intermediate alkene.
1557820	1564140	This challenge was of particular interest to a Swiss chemist named Herbert Lindlar.
1564140	1570180	Lindlar was working for a German pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-Laroche in 1952 when he published
1570180	1577700	work on a selective catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes stopping at the alkene stage.
1577700	1584100	Now what Lindlar did was he took the usual catalyst of the day, platinum and palladium.
1584100	1589440	But he used a technique known as poisoning, in which he deliberately added non-reactive
1589440	1596500	material to the catalyst to sort of cut down on its activity towards this particular reaction.
1596500	1601660	And the result of his effort was a catalyst which is strong enough to promote the addition
1601660	1607380	of hydrogen to an alkyne, but not strong enough to do so to an alkene.
1607380	1612500	So you'll notice in this reaction I've added hydrogen to acetylene, but I've also included
1612500	1618540	Lindlar catalyst rather than a pure veneer of that precious metal that catalyzes the
1618540	1619540	reaction.
1619540	1621540	Let's see what happens.
1621540	1626300	My hydrogen moves to the surface and again is activated.
1626300	1631860	Now when my alkyne comes in, it reacts with those hydrogens at the surface, which means
1631860	1638060	that the addition is going to always take place with syn-stereochemistry.
1638060	1646220	So Lindlar had achieved a syn addition of hydrogen to an alkyne stopping at the alkene stage.
1646220	1649460	So in the case of forming ethene, that's not very impressive because there really aren't
1649460	1651880	any stereoisomers to speak up.
1651880	1657220	But imagine if we were to do this reaction with an internal alkyne rather than a terminal
1657220	1662180	alkyne or acetylene.
1662180	1667900	Simplest example of this would be the reaction of hydrogen with 2-butyne, which has its triple
1667900	1671700	bond internally placed.
1671700	1678180	When I react this with Lindlar catalyst, I produce a specific stereoisomer of the 2-butene
1678180	1679740	product.
1679740	1683780	And the reason for this is, as we've already said, the hydrogen is going to come in and
1683780	1687700	become activated at the catalyst surface.
1687700	1693620	From there, it will react with our alkyne molecule, which then detaches from the surface.
1693620	1698180	And because the Lindlar catalyst is poisoned, it can't go any further.
1698180	1704500	So as you can see here, my syn addition has created the cis-isomer.
1704500	1710500	But what if the trans or e-isomer were the intended product of our synthesis?
1710500	1714820	Lindlar's catalyst would not achieve the correct stereochemistry because the mechanism is inherent
1714820	1719500	to the reaction that has a syn addition of hydrogen.
1719500	1724180	So in this case, we have to turn to more drastic methods, like what we call the metal ammonia
1724180	1726900	reduction technique.
1726900	1732500	In this method, a strong reducing agent like sodium metal is used to convert the alkyne
1732500	1735780	into a radical anion.
1735780	1743140	These anions preferentially form in a trans configuration because of sterics.
1743140	1748180	So after abstracting a proton from an ammonia molecule, the resulting vinyl radical repeats
1748180	1754540	this process of reduction and protonation and ultimately leads to a trans product.
1754540	1763620	So this would be our solution for turning our internal alkynes into trans alkenes.
1763620	1766300	So let's review what we've learned today.
1766300	1770460	We've worked our way through the basics of how addition reactions occur.
1770460	1777100	We saw how pi bonds are traded for more stable sigma bonds at the cost of reduced entropy.
1777100	1781440	We discussed the mechanism of hydrohalogenation of alkenes and alkynes.
1781440	1786060	We saw how Markovnikov's rule governs their regiochemistry, predicting that the halogen
1786060	1792220	will take its place at the more substituted carbon of the alkene starting material.
1792220	1796980	We also noted that proceeding through a carbocation intermediate makes these kinds of reactions
1796980	1800380	prone to rearrangements.
1800380	1806320	We also saw how hydrohalogenation of alkenes leads to alkyl halides and hydrohalogenation
1806320	1812660	of alkynes can produce vinyl halides or geminal dye halides depending on how much of that
1812660	1815820	hydrogen halide we've added.
1816820	1822820	Next, we investigated halogenation reactions in which alkenes react via a cyclic-halonium
1822820	1831040	intermediate on their way to an anti-addition producing vissinal dye halides.
1831040	1839220	We also saw how an analogous reaction with alkynes leads to a trans-dihalogenated alkene
1839220	1845540	or to a tetrahalide in a 1-1-2-2 configuration, meaning that we have two halogens on each
1845540	1849040	adjacent carbon.
1849040	1853160	We talked about how Boyce and Sabatier discovered that the addition of certain metal catalysts
1853160	1858840	to alkenes in the presence of hydrogen gas leads to a sin-hydrogenation of their double
1858840	1864480	bonds, developing a chemistry which is used to modify oils and fats to produce food additives
1864480	1866520	to this day.
1866520	1873360	Of course, this method also works to completely saturate alkynes as well.
1873360	1879100	We also looked into the methods used to halt hydrogenation of alkynes at the alkene stage.
1879100	1885340	Specifically, catalytic hydrogenation with Linn-Lars catalysts to form cis-alkenes and
1885340	1891060	the metal-ammonia reduction reaction, which leads to trans-alkenes.
1891060	1895340	So with this, we've completed our tour of the three general classes of reactions most
1895340	1903300	often encountered in organic chemistry, substitution, elimination, and addition.
1903300	1908160	We managed to do this for the most part using just hydrocarbons and alkyl halides as reaction
1908160	1914000	substrates, but that's all about to change.
1914000	1918080	These three key types of reactions are not limited to the small library of molecules
1918080	1920600	that we've used so far.
1920600	1924480	Now that we have a command of a few of the most basic mechanisms by which reactions take
1924480	1931920	place, a vast library of functional groups and motifs containing other atoms awaits.
1931920	1936740	This time, we'll begin to expand this library by considering the role of oxygen in organic
1936740	1937740	chemistry.
1937740	1938620	I'll see you then.
