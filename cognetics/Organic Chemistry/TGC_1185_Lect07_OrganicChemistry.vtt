00:00.000 --> 00:19.280
In the 1700s and early 1800s, the science of organic chemistry had not yet been conceived.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.440
But the industrial revolution was in full swing.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.880
And to put all the new tools and technologies born of this age to best use required activities

00:27.880 --> 00:30.640
take place indoors and at night.

00:30.640 --> 00:36.000
This of course led to an increasing demand for sources of artificial light.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.920
During this time, the preferred lamp fuels were oils sourced from whales.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.640
Whale oil was obtainable through commercial whaling, and it burned brightly if not totally

00:45.640 --> 00:47.640
cleanly.

00:47.640 --> 00:53.320
Being a complex, biologically sourced material, the refinement of whale oils into usable fuels

00:53.320 --> 00:57.160
was always a bit of a roll of a dice.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.320
Some samples burned a bit more or less brightly than others, and with varying degrees of that

01:01.320 --> 01:03.040
unpleasant odor.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.680
So not the most desirable traits in a chemical product, but it was the best available option

01:07.680 --> 01:11.080
in its day.

01:11.080 --> 01:16.040
The cleanest and brightest burning of these oils was that from the nose of the sperm whale.

01:16.040 --> 01:21.640
And this material fetched the equivalent of 200 modern US dollars per gallon at its peak

01:21.640 --> 01:23.920
value in the mid-1800s.

01:23.920 --> 01:28.320
This made commercial whaling a very attractive enterprise.

01:28.320 --> 01:32.160
Whaling operations worldwide were growing dramatically during this time.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.840
And probably without a true appreciation for the damage they were doing, whalers around

01:36.840 --> 01:42.560
the world were aggressively hunting these majestic creatures to the brink of extinction.

01:42.560 --> 01:47.800
By the late 1840s, dwindling populations forced whalers to chase smaller and smaller sperm

01:47.800 --> 01:53.680
whales into more and more remote locations in a futile attempt to prolong this profitable

01:53.680 --> 01:55.320
business.

01:55.320 --> 02:00.080
The sperm whale species may very well have been hunted to extinction at this time.

02:00.080 --> 02:06.440
But just before this happened, they were bailed out by an unlikely group of saviors, a geologist,

02:06.440 --> 02:11.400
a retired railroad conductor, and an American entrepreneur.

02:11.400 --> 02:19.180
See, in 1849, Dr. Abraham Gessner, a Canadian geologist, devised a method for the extraction

02:19.180 --> 02:24.460
of a new liquid fuel from coal and oil shale that he dug from the ground.

02:24.460 --> 02:30.460
His product consisted of compounds called hydrocarbons, which consist of just two elements, hydrogen

02:30.460 --> 02:34.300
and carbon, but bonded together in various ways.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.860
Now, these compounds are fundamentally different from those in whale oil, yet when burned they

02:39.860 --> 02:43.180
have properties that are remarkably similar.

02:43.180 --> 02:47.020
And his new discovery he dubbed kerosene.

02:47.020 --> 02:51.460
This kerosene outperformed even the purest sperm whale oil in the light and heat that

02:51.460 --> 02:56.460
it could produce, as well as its shelf life.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.460
So the result was inevitable.

02:58.460 --> 03:04.740
Demand for kerosene rose through the 1850s and 60s, and demand for sperm whale oil simultaneously

03:04.740 --> 03:07.060
plummeted.

03:07.060 --> 03:12.020
Without a vast army of whaling ships perpetually thinning their numbers, the sperm whale species

03:12.020 --> 03:14.340
began to recover.

03:15.340 --> 03:22.060
Then, in 1865, Edwin Drake, an American railroad conductor who had been forced into early retirement

03:22.060 --> 03:26.700
by an illness, struck another blow to the commercial whale oil industry when he discovered

03:26.700 --> 03:32.540
a massive underground supply of an oily substance in the fields of Pennsylvania.

03:32.540 --> 03:37.260
Just like Gessner's coal and oil shale, this new substance, called petroleum, literally

03:37.260 --> 03:43.940
meaning oil of rocks, contains a vast assortment of hydrocarbons, including the compounds needed

03:44.020 --> 03:46.740
to produce kerosene.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.980
The difference was the remarkable size of this deposit.

03:49.980 --> 03:55.300
With a new, massive source of raw material needed to produce kerosene, the future was

03:55.300 --> 03:57.780
looking bright for sperm whales.

03:57.780 --> 04:03.540
And the third and final nail in the coffin of the whale lamp oil industry was delivered

04:03.540 --> 04:08.460
by legendary American entrepreneur John D. Rockefeller.

04:08.460 --> 04:13.860
Sensing the opportunity provided by a virtually limitless supply of raw material discovered

04:13.860 --> 04:19.260
by Drake to produce a superior product, the one discovered by Gessner.

04:19.260 --> 04:24.820
Rockefeller pounced on this situation and entered that oil business in 1870.

04:24.820 --> 04:30.180
Now, Rockefeller is famous, or infamous, for some of his business tactics.

04:30.180 --> 04:34.740
But whether you love him or hate him, he had an undeniable talent for marketing.

04:34.740 --> 04:39.500
And in a very savvy business move, Rockefeller played on the superior consistency of his

04:39.500 --> 04:43.100
product by naming his company Standard Oil.

04:43.100 --> 04:48.180
Essentially, promising his customers safer and more consistent performance from his kerosene

04:48.180 --> 04:53.100
compared to the alternative products of the day, like whale oil.

04:53.100 --> 04:58.420
Kerosene was now king, and the sperm whales weren't complaining.

04:58.420 --> 05:03.300
So this is the story of how a geologist, train conductor, and a businessman unwittingly joined

05:03.300 --> 05:08.660
forces to save one of the most precious animal species that the world has ever known.

05:08.660 --> 05:12.260
And they did it using organic compounds called hydrocarbons.

05:12.260 --> 05:19.420
One class of hydrocarbons is alkanes, the topic of today's lecture.

05:19.420 --> 05:23.500
So what was it about this new kerosene fuel which made it so superior to the oil from

05:23.500 --> 05:25.180
the nose of a sperm whale?

05:25.180 --> 05:30.780
Well, one reason is that petroleum consists mainly of a class of hydrocarbons.

05:30.780 --> 05:37.020
And what makes hydrocarbons so special is that there is a vast, complex library of molecules

05:37.020 --> 05:42.740
making the class up, yet the fundamental rules governing their behavior are very simple

05:42.740 --> 05:44.580
and very few.

05:44.580 --> 05:50.620
Now, this makes hydrocarbons easier to refine into blends of compounds with exactly the

05:50.620 --> 05:55.200
chemical and physical properties that we want for a given application.

05:55.200 --> 06:02.540
Many commonly used modern materials, including natural gas, propane, gasoline and kerosene,

06:02.540 --> 06:08.260
and even major components of modern lubricants and asphalt used to make roads are all produced

06:08.260 --> 06:13.460
by the isolation of specific groups of hydrocarbons from petroleum.

06:13.460 --> 06:17.700
So let's begin our journey to understanding the chemistry of hydrocarbons by taking a look

06:17.700 --> 06:24.820
at the simplest class of hydrocarbons called alkanes.

06:24.820 --> 06:28.380
So now that we're familiar with at least a few reasons why hydrocarbons are historically

06:28.380 --> 06:35.460
and commercially important compounds, let's turn our attention to their chemistry.

06:35.460 --> 06:40.200
So here are the four simplest normal alkanes as we call them.

06:40.200 --> 06:45.700
Alkanes are defined as hydrocarbons which contain only sp3 hybridized carbon atoms.

06:45.700 --> 06:50.480
So to create these kinds of molecules, I'm going to use carbon and hydrogen, the simplest

06:50.480 --> 06:54.300
combination of which is methane, natural gas.

06:54.300 --> 06:58.180
This has a molecular formula of CH4.

06:58.180 --> 07:00.940
Next on my list would be two carbons.

07:00.940 --> 07:08.180
And to saturate this completely with hydrogens, I need a C2H6 molecular formula.

07:08.180 --> 07:13.500
Continuing on to another familiar compound, propane, I have C3H8.

07:13.500 --> 07:20.380
And butane, the type that you might find in a typical cigarette lighter, is C4H10.

07:20.380 --> 07:29.300
So all of these alkanes have the exact same generic formula, CNH2N plus 2.

07:29.300 --> 07:35.420
The 2N being because there are two hydrogens on every interior carbon, and the plus 2 because

07:35.420 --> 07:38.940
the terminal carbons must have three hydrogens.

07:38.940 --> 07:42.820
Now after the first four linear alkanes were discovered, chemists seem to have come to

07:42.820 --> 07:47.340
their senses and settled on a more systematic naming system.

07:48.340 --> 07:51.940
Again, the first four are based upon historical notes.

07:51.940 --> 07:56.420
But after this, we reach a metric style prefix system, where we attach them to the front

07:56.420 --> 08:00.660
of the name, ending the name with the suffix, AIN.

08:00.660 --> 08:06.420
So here are my methane, propane, and butane again, followed by my more systematic names,

08:06.420 --> 08:16.140
pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane.

08:16.140 --> 08:24.020
And the list continues in this fashion until we run out of carbons to look at.

08:24.020 --> 08:28.860
One can imagine how dull the science of hydrocarbons might actually be if there were only one type

08:28.860 --> 08:33.180
of hydrocarbon that existed for every number of carbons.

08:33.180 --> 08:37.340
And limiting ourselves to ever-lengthening straight chains like I did in the last slide

08:37.340 --> 08:43.100
only provides one distinct hydrocarbon for each molecular formula.

08:43.580 --> 08:51.740
Fortunately, this is only the case for the first three, methane, ethane, and propane.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.860
When we reach four carbons, new connectivities become possible, and the number of possibilities

08:56.860 --> 08:59.460
quickly grows as we add more carbons.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.380
Let's take a look.

09:03.820 --> 09:08.780
In the case of four carbons, I can draw two different carbon chains onto which I can build

09:08.780 --> 09:14.220
my alkane, one perfectly straight and one slightly branched.

09:14.220 --> 09:20.420
When I increase my carbon to five, I find that there are three potential isomers.

09:20.420 --> 09:27.380
Moving on to six, I have a total of five possible isomers, and introducing a seventh carbon

09:27.380 --> 09:30.620
leads me to nine possible isomers.

09:30.620 --> 09:35.980
So you can see here that the number of potential isomers is growing very rapidly as I add additional

09:35.980 --> 09:36.980
carbons.

09:36.980 --> 09:39.860
This trend continues.

09:39.860 --> 09:43.460
In fact, this trend continues very, very rapidly.

09:43.460 --> 09:47.300
You'll notice here that if I increase the number of carbons beyond seven, I reach eight

09:47.300 --> 09:48.300
carbons.

09:48.300 --> 09:53.500
This is a very familiar compound for us, octane, which has seventeen potential arrangements

09:53.500 --> 09:55.860
of the carbon atoms.

09:55.860 --> 10:00.620
If I continue much farther, I have to rescale my plot because there are so many possibilities

10:00.620 --> 10:05.820
for the next addition that all the others appear to be just little bumps in my diagram.

10:05.820 --> 10:10.540
Finally, I reach a compound, the composition of the kerosene that we talked about earlier

10:10.540 --> 10:14.260
with 10,000 or more potential combinations.

10:14.260 --> 10:19.220
And if we go just a little bit farther to 21 carbons, we have almost one million different

10:19.220 --> 10:22.860
ways to connect those 21 carbons together.

10:22.860 --> 10:28.100
Take the sum of all the possibilities, and every alkane from one carbon to 21 carbons,

10:28.100 --> 10:32.140
you can make more than one and one half million different combinations.

10:32.140 --> 10:35.620
Okay, so I hope I have your attention now.

10:35.620 --> 10:39.020
Alkanine chemistry and the structures that they comprise may be simple at their most

10:39.020 --> 10:45.940
basic levels, but the complexity builds rapidly with the addition of more and more carbons.

10:45.940 --> 10:50.140
So now that we've developed an appreciation for how complex those structures of alkanes

10:50.140 --> 10:54.820
can be, I think that we can all agree that a system of nomenclature is in order so that

10:54.820 --> 11:01.340
we can unambiguously define which structure or structures we're talking about.

11:02.340 --> 11:08.580
Now, much like the base names of linear alkanes, some of the simpler branched alkanes have

11:08.580 --> 11:10.340
common names as well.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.880
For example, there are two isomers of butane.

11:13.880 --> 11:19.220
We have the now familiar linear or normal isomer, which we simply call butane, but

11:19.220 --> 11:24.140
we also have the branched version, which is called isobutane.

11:24.140 --> 11:28.140
We call it this because iso is the prefix for similar, so because they have similar

11:28.140 --> 11:31.420
molecular formulas, they have similar names.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.940
Let's take another example and look at pentane.

11:33.940 --> 11:38.780
There are three isomers of pentane, again the normal, one with the single carbon branched,

11:38.780 --> 11:44.260
which we call isopentane, and another one called neopentane.

11:44.260 --> 11:51.060
Now, using common names for isomers of butane and pentane seems like a pretty good idea.

11:51.060 --> 11:55.660
There are, after all, just a few extra structural isomers to consider for each.

11:55.660 --> 12:00.140
But a quick look back at the sheer number of possibilities that form as alkanes grow

12:00.140 --> 12:04.860
larger reminds us just how unwieldy a system like that would be.

12:04.860 --> 12:09.180
I know I don't want to have to memorize one and a half million possible names for a chemistry

12:09.180 --> 12:13.580
exam, and I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't either.

12:13.580 --> 12:18.020
Enter the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, commonly referred to as

12:18.020 --> 12:19.020
IUPAC.

12:19.020 --> 12:24.580
IUPAC is a professional standards agency, which makes recommendation on the standardization

12:24.580 --> 12:27.860
of all things chemistry, including nomenclature.

12:27.860 --> 12:33.860
So, IUPAC has come up with a method of nomenclature, which is highly systematized, and so it doesn't

12:33.860 --> 12:40.820
require that we memorize millions of names, but rather just a few simple, important rules.

12:40.820 --> 12:45.900
So let's take a stab at giving an IUPAC name to this molecule, isopentane, which we've

12:45.900 --> 12:47.460
already seen.

12:47.460 --> 12:52.540
Now, the first rule that we're going to do is find the longest continuous carbon chain

12:52.540 --> 12:57.020
within this molecule, and the way that I've arranged it is not that hard to find.

12:57.020 --> 13:01.060
We have a four carbon continuous chain running through this hydrocarbon.

13:01.060 --> 13:06.100
Now, I could just as easily as drawn have chosen my four carbon chain in this way, but

13:06.100 --> 13:11.460
as we'll see by the end of this slide, the name will actually be unaffected by my choice.

13:11.460 --> 13:16.900
So I'm going to go back to having my basic hydrocarbon chain all the way across the screen

13:16.900 --> 13:19.540
left to right.

13:19.540 --> 13:24.820
So I'm going to call this a butane, even though it's got five carbons total.

13:24.820 --> 13:28.580
And that's because I'm going to give a name to the branched portion of the molecule as

13:28.580 --> 13:35.020
well, and I'm going to use the standard prefixes from my previous slide on naming hydrocarbons.

13:35.020 --> 13:42.100
So a branch which contains one carbon is called a methyl.

13:42.100 --> 13:46.860
Next I need to tell my viewer exactly where that methyl group is on the molecule.

13:46.860 --> 13:51.500
So I have to number the parent chain sequentially from one end to the other in a way that gives

13:51.500 --> 13:55.500
the lowest possible number to the substituents.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.460
In this case, I have two options.

13:57.460 --> 14:03.620
I can name it or number it from left to right, or I can number it from right to left.

14:03.620 --> 14:08.780
Now, in this numbering system, you see that I have a two for the methyl group using my

14:08.780 --> 14:14.420
first choice and a three as the position of the methyl group as my second choice.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.820
So I'm going to go with my instincts here and take my first choice, giving the methyl

14:17.820 --> 14:23.300
group the lowest possible address on this molecule.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.820
Now that I've done all of this, I'm ready to construct a name for this compound.

14:26.820 --> 14:33.540
And I do this by naming my substituents alphabetically, including their address.

14:33.540 --> 14:38.660
If there's more than one, I'll use dye, tri, or tetra to indicate that.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.420
Their numerical address will go at the front of the name, and ultimately I will end with

14:42.420 --> 14:47.260
the name of the parent compound, which I determined at the beginning of the exercise.

14:47.260 --> 14:53.500
So this molecule would be called two-methyl butane.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.020
Now let's apply these rules to a more sophisticated molecule.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.060
Let's try this one out in for size.

14:58.060 --> 15:02.340
We're going to follow the same set of rules as we did previously.

15:02.340 --> 15:07.900
We find that we have a six-membered carbon chain, which contains an ethyl group because

15:07.900 --> 15:14.500
of the two carbons, one, two, and a methyl group, which has a single carbon.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.340
Now I have to number my parent chain in such a way that these two substituents get the

15:18.340 --> 15:20.380
lowest possible numbers.

15:20.380 --> 15:24.140
And I achieve this by starting at the right and working my way to the left, giving me

15:24.140 --> 15:31.260
two, four, as opposed to the alternate direction, which would give me a three, five.

15:31.260 --> 15:36.840
Now I'm ready to construct my name, being sure that I list my substituents alphabetically.

15:36.840 --> 15:41.360
So even though ethyl has a higher number, it appears first in the name.

15:41.360 --> 15:46.080
This is four ethyl, two-methyl hexane.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.400
Let me challenge you with one more.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.440
How about this one?

15:50.440 --> 15:55.440
In step one, we're going to find the longest continuous carbon chain, which looks like

15:55.440 --> 15:56.440
this, right?

15:56.440 --> 15:59.080
It's a hexane, isn't it?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.080
Dramatic pause.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.000
No, it's not, is it?

16:02.000 --> 16:08.780
Remember, these molecules have got saturated sp3 hybridized carbons, whose bonds can rotate.

16:08.780 --> 16:12.360
So I'm not restricted to choosing the longest carbon chain that runs left to right.

16:12.360 --> 16:18.360
I need the longest carbon chain overall, which is actually seven carbons in length.

16:18.360 --> 16:22.680
Once I've determined that, I'll take an inventory of all my substituents, in this case four

16:22.680 --> 16:24.600
methyl groups.

16:24.600 --> 16:28.640
I'll come up with my numbering system, which gives them the lowest address on that parent

16:28.640 --> 16:37.280
hydrocarbon, and then construct my name, two, three, four, five, tetramethyl heptane.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.880
So what is it about kerosene and other petroleum products that make them so versatile?

16:40.880 --> 16:45.280
It allowed Rockefeller to produce such a consistent product.

16:45.280 --> 16:49.800
The answer to this question lies in the effect that size and structural isomerism have on

16:49.800 --> 16:56.920
the properties of alkanes, like their volatility, heats of combustion, viscosity, and others.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.520
Alkanes don't have polar bonds, which can affect the attractive forces between them.

17:00.520 --> 17:05.880
See, they only have their electron clouds, which are soft and polarizable.

17:05.880 --> 17:11.140
What that means is that the electrons in the cloud around the molecule have a lot of motion,

17:11.140 --> 17:14.500
and as they move, intermittent charges can build up.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.440
So we call these intermittent charges intermittent dipoles.

17:18.440 --> 17:23.200
As one forms in one molecule, it has a tendency to induce a second intermittent dipole in

17:23.200 --> 17:26.800
a neighboring molecule, provided they're close enough.

17:26.800 --> 17:32.200
These two intermittent dipoles cause the compounds to attract one another very slightly, resulting

17:32.200 --> 17:36.400
in higher boiling points and increased viscosity.

17:36.400 --> 17:42.760
Now we call this type of attractive force London dispersion forces.

17:42.760 --> 17:47.200
So one can imagine that longer alkanes with larger electron clouds can produce stronger

17:47.200 --> 17:52.160
dispersion forces than their shorter counterparts, and this is clearly manifested in the phase

17:52.160 --> 17:54.360
behavior of hydrocarbons.

17:54.360 --> 17:59.680
See smaller chains make up methane, ethane, propane, and butane, which we easily recognized

17:59.680 --> 18:03.200
as gases at typical pressures and temperatures.

18:03.200 --> 18:09.720
While pentane, hexane, heptane, and of course octane, we all know to be liquids.

18:09.720 --> 18:15.400
Now chemists use the term volatility to describe the tendency of a compound of vaporize.

18:15.400 --> 18:20.400
So we would say that methane is a more volatile compound than pentane, or that octane is less

18:20.400 --> 18:22.880
volatile than propane.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.760
But this term shouldn't be confused with the more colloquial meaning of volatility,

18:26.760 --> 18:30.880
which is taken to be unstable, unpredictable, or explosive.

18:30.880 --> 18:35.760
In organic chemistry, it's actually possible for a compound to be very stable as well as

18:35.760 --> 18:38.240
very volatile.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.400
But the trend in volatility doesn't stop where we left off.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.840
The boiling points of each hydrocarbon I just mentioned systematically increases as the

18:45.840 --> 18:50.960
chains lengthen and the dispersion forces increase, attracting similar molecules to

18:50.960 --> 18:53.960
one another.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.880
But branching also has a predictable effect on physical properties.

18:57.880 --> 19:02.520
As hydrocarbons of the same mass become increasingly branched, they boil at ever lower and lower

19:02.520 --> 19:04.160
temperatures.

19:04.160 --> 19:08.880
And this is a reflection of the reduced surface area contact possible between those branched

19:08.880 --> 19:09.880
molecules.

19:09.880 --> 19:15.760
And just take a look back at butane and isobutane, and you can easily see why isobutane is added

19:15.760 --> 19:20.520
to camping cookstove fuel to prevent it from freezing when pressurized on cold nights.

19:20.520 --> 19:25.920
In fact, isobutane has a boiling point that's about 10 degrees centigrade lower than that

19:25.920 --> 19:28.840
of n-butane.

19:28.840 --> 19:33.040
And this effect is actually more pronounced when we compare n-pentane to its highly branched

19:33.040 --> 19:34.440
isomer, neopentane.

19:34.440 --> 19:40.240
The difference in boiling points there is about 25 degrees centigrade.

19:41.240 --> 19:46.080
Now, alkanes are not terribly reactive from the organic chemistry standpoint.

19:46.080 --> 19:50.800
Their lack of polarity leads to structures which don't tend to participate in most reactions,

19:50.800 --> 19:55.920
but it does give them the ability to dissolve a wide array of more reactive compounds.

19:55.920 --> 20:00.200
For this reason, liquid phase alkanes are commonly used in the organic chemistry lab

20:00.200 --> 20:02.080
as solvents.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.840
Pentane and hexane, for example, are staple materials found in almost every organic chemistry

20:05.840 --> 20:07.840
lab.

20:08.840 --> 20:13.680
But among the reactions which can be undertaken with alkanes is, of course, combustion with

20:13.680 --> 20:20.200
oxygen, which leads to a mixture of carbon dioxide and water in an irreversible process.

20:20.200 --> 20:24.320
And this is one of the processes that we rely on to power engines, provide heat, and give

20:24.320 --> 20:26.440
us light.

20:26.440 --> 20:29.600
But chemists rely on combustion for a different purpose.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.880
We can use it as a means of comparing the stability of similar compounds, and this type

20:33.880 --> 20:38.600
of experiment is called calorimetry.

20:38.600 --> 20:44.200
When calorimetry, a device known as a calorimeter, is a sealed system which is charged with a

20:44.200 --> 20:49.440
known amount of a given compound and enough oxygen to completely combust it.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.240
If the combusted materials produce the same products, in the case of hydrocarbons, this

20:53.240 --> 20:58.800
would be CO2 and water, then any difference in the heat released must be a result of differences

20:58.800 --> 21:01.920
in the stability of the starting material.

21:01.920 --> 21:07.320
Before heat released means a less stable compound was combusted.

21:07.320 --> 21:12.200
So let's start by comparing some straight chain or normal alkanes, like octane, one

21:12.200 --> 21:16.160
of the principal components of motor fuels like gasoline.

21:16.160 --> 21:19.880
Let's compare its stability to heptane, yet another component of gasoline that most of

21:19.880 --> 21:23.480
us would put in our cars.

21:23.480 --> 21:28.400
When identical molar amounts of octane and heptane are combusted in a calorimeter, the

21:28.400 --> 21:34.600
temperature of the calorimeter increases just slightly more for the octane sample.

21:34.600 --> 21:39.960
So you might be tempted to conclude that higher octane motor fuels have more energy,

21:39.960 --> 21:42.960
but you'd be wrong.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.060
You see, we have to account for the fact that heptane is a smaller molecule, which contains

21:47.060 --> 21:51.400
only seven carbon atoms compared to octane's eight carbon scaffold.

21:51.400 --> 21:56.800
In fact, when we normalize the heat released to the number of carbon atoms present, or

21:56.800 --> 22:01.680
in an even more practical way, by the volume of liquid fuel, the energy released by the

22:01.680 --> 22:08.180
combustion of these normal alkanes is essentially identical.

22:08.180 --> 22:09.480
But branching is another story.

22:09.480 --> 22:16.260
See, instead of simply extending normal alkanes, perpetually adding CH2 after CH2 group, branching

22:16.260 --> 22:19.880
introduces a differing inventory of bonds.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.720
Increased branching means that we're introducing more of those stable carbon-carbon bonds that

22:23.720 --> 22:25.800
we talked about back in lecture one.

22:25.800 --> 22:31.840
Moreover, we're doing it without adding extra atoms.

22:31.840 --> 22:37.240
So combustion, for example, of butane versus isobutane in a calorimeter should result in

22:37.240 --> 22:42.200
a greater temperature change for the calorimeter containing in butane.

22:42.200 --> 22:46.560
So if you had any doubt about why that isobutane is in your cookstove fuel, it's definitely

22:46.560 --> 22:48.180
to keep it from freezing.

22:48.180 --> 22:53.800
Your isobutane blended cookstove fuel actually contains just slightly less energy than a

22:53.800 --> 22:56.600
pure and butane cookstove wood.

22:56.600 --> 23:03.040
But that's the trade-off for fuel that vaporizes better in the cold.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.640
Now the differences in these heats of combustion for structural isomers are actually quite

23:06.640 --> 23:08.140
small.

23:08.140 --> 23:12.580
The difference in the heat of combustion between octane and iso-octane, for example, is only

23:12.580 --> 23:17.400
about 1% of the total energy released by each of these molecules.

23:17.400 --> 23:21.000
So this very small difference is actually fortuitous from an engineering and fuel-blending

23:21.000 --> 23:26.640
perspective, because mixing various hydrocarbons isn't really done to alter the energy content

23:26.640 --> 23:31.600
of a fuel, but rather to alter other properties of the fuel without worrying too much about

23:31.600 --> 23:37.000
changing the amount of energy it can provide.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.200
Hydrocarbon fuels are actually blended not to adjust the amount of energy they contain,

23:41.200 --> 23:46.120
but rather to adjust the conditions under which they release that energy.

23:46.120 --> 23:51.160
The octane ratings are meant to communicate how resistant a fuel blend is to detonating

23:51.160 --> 23:55.480
under heat and pressure without the aid of a spark.

23:55.480 --> 23:59.920
Now since gasoline engines are designed to detonate fuel using a spark plug at a specific

23:59.920 --> 24:05.760
time in the engine cycle, it would be potentially damaging to use a fuel which would detonate

24:05.760 --> 24:11.240
prematurely under the heat and pressure conditions inside the cylinder.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.920
So engines which run on higher compression rates require fuels which are more resistant

24:15.920 --> 24:18.880
to detonation under that pressure.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.760
So this is why more branched hydrocarbons are blended into them.

24:22.760 --> 24:28.000
If a fuel blend has a detonation resistance equal to that of pure iso-octane, it's given

24:28.000 --> 24:30.800
an octane rating of 100.

24:30.800 --> 24:38.520
If it's equal to that of pure N-heptane, it receives a rating of zero.

24:38.520 --> 24:43.880
Of course combustion is a rather inelegant type of reaction, obliterating all the carbon-carbon

24:43.880 --> 24:48.800
bonds in alkanes and eradicating those complex scaffolds which make organic compounds so

24:48.800 --> 24:51.320
versatile and useful.

24:51.320 --> 24:56.360
But our ultimate starting point for organic chemistry, alkanes, are fairly unreactive

24:56.360 --> 24:57.840
molecules.

24:57.840 --> 25:03.120
Fortunately, there is a way to introduce a more reactive motif to alkanes without completely

25:03.120 --> 25:06.120
smashing the carbon framework to bits.

25:06.120 --> 25:12.520
So let's stop thinking like automotive engineers, start thinking like synthetic organic chemists.

25:12.520 --> 25:17.200
With such a large supply of varied hydrocarbons available, they make an attractive entry point

25:17.200 --> 25:20.600
to organic synthesis for many different carbon scaffolds.

25:20.600 --> 25:25.280
Despite their relatively low reactivity, alkanes are frequently used for this purpose in labs

25:25.280 --> 25:28.040
and chemical plants around the world.

25:28.040 --> 25:33.720
Now one of the most important uses from synthetic organic chemistry standpoint is as a starting

25:33.720 --> 25:39.920
material used in the synthesis of a set of compounds called alkyl halides.

25:39.920 --> 25:44.480
Because carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are so stable, we have to use an unusual

25:44.480 --> 25:46.800
trick to get them to react.

25:46.800 --> 25:52.240
We have to present them with a highly reactive atom of a halogen, like fluorine, chlorine,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.200
iodine, or bromine.

25:54.200 --> 26:03.400
For my example today I'm going to use chlorine and the simplest of all hydrocarbons, methane.

26:03.400 --> 26:08.360
So the mechanism for this reaction begins with the activation of a halogen molecule by a photon

26:08.360 --> 26:10.000
of a very specific wavelength.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.280
It's usually somewhere in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.

26:14.280 --> 26:18.640
We usually represent this kind of activation in a reaction scheme with the characters H

26:18.640 --> 26:24.420
nu, which are actually variables representing Planck's constant and frequency, which when

26:24.420 --> 26:28.560
multiplied together yield the amount of energy in a particular photon.

26:28.560 --> 26:35.000
So I'll be using this notation to show any light-activated reactions that we consider.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.760
Now when a halogen molecule like chlorine absorbs this photon, the bond between the

26:38.760 --> 26:44.200
two halogen atoms breaks, sending one bonding electron to each atom.

26:44.200 --> 26:50.480
And we call this sort of bond-breaking homolytic, because the bond breaks symmetrically.

26:50.480 --> 26:55.280
This is also called the initiation step of the reaction.

26:55.280 --> 27:01.720
So the result of the process is two halogen atoms, each of which contains an unpaired electron.

27:01.720 --> 27:05.760
Now species with unpaired electrons are referred to as radicals.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.920
In our example, these two chlorine radicals only have seven valence electrons, and they

27:09.920 --> 27:15.080
want desperately to fill that octet.

27:15.080 --> 27:20.560
Now one chlorine radical accomplishes this by removing a hydrogen from the alkyl halide

27:20.560 --> 27:23.400
generating a new alkyl radical.

27:23.400 --> 27:27.560
So now our alkyl radical has a carbon with an incomplete octet.

27:27.560 --> 27:32.760
But if it finds a second halogen molecule to react with, it can satisfy that alkyl

27:32.760 --> 27:39.940
radical, generating a new chlorine radical which can continue the reaction.

27:39.940 --> 27:42.800
This phase of the reaction is called propagation.

27:42.800 --> 27:47.480
And during propagation, new product is forming, but new chlorine radicals are also forming,

27:47.480 --> 27:51.000
carrying on a chain reaction.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.760
Finally at some point, the chain reaction terminates when two alkyl radicals react in

27:55.760 --> 28:02.120
a homogenic bond formation, homogenic meaning forming equally from both sides.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.720
So just like homolytic bond breaking sends two bonding electrons in separate ways, so

28:06.720 --> 28:11.520
homogenic bond formation takes place when the new bond forms from two electrons, one

28:11.520 --> 28:16.160
from each bonding partner.

28:16.160 --> 28:21.680
So at the end of this reaction, we've reacted an alkane with chlorine by a photoactivated

28:21.680 --> 28:28.400
reaction to form hydrochloric acid and then alkyl halide, and also a small amount of determination

28:28.400 --> 28:30.960
product.

28:30.960 --> 28:35.480
Now this is a very distinctive reaction, not only because it's a photoactivated radical

28:35.480 --> 28:39.000
reaction, but because it's a chain reaction.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
So we turn to this technique to modify alkanes because their remarkable stability requires

28:44.000 --> 28:49.160
this kind of extreme measure.

28:49.160 --> 28:53.600
So you might take a look at our radical halogenation reaction and ask yourself, what happens when

28:53.600 --> 28:57.400
there are multiple carbons in the hydrocarbons starting material?

28:57.400 --> 29:01.820
After all, methane only has one carbon which can react, but what about propane, or even

29:01.820 --> 29:03.920
larger hydrocarbons?

29:03.920 --> 29:10.800
These larger hydrocarbons contain chemically distinct carbons, which we call primary, secondary,

29:10.800 --> 29:16.320
tertiary, and quaternary based upon whether they're connected to one, two, three, or four

29:16.320 --> 29:18.960
other carbons respectively.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.900
That's a valid question, and the answer to the question is that the halogenation will

29:23.900 --> 29:29.200
always occur preferentially at the most substituted carbon possible.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.480
The obvious exception here is quaternary carbons because they don't have a bonded hydrogen

29:33.480 --> 29:37.360
which is required for the reaction to take place.

29:37.360 --> 29:43.720
But in our example, propane has a primary and secondary radical which can form, and

29:44.000 --> 29:48.720
even though there are two potential carbons onto which a radical could form as a primary

29:48.720 --> 29:53.560
and only one which could become secondary, we still get the chlorine atom in greatest

29:53.560 --> 30:00.160
abundance on that secondary carbon.

30:00.160 --> 30:05.160
Now to understand why this happens, we need to invoke a phenomenon called hyperconjugation.

30:05.160 --> 30:10.560
So to do this, I'm going to bring up an ethyl radical.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.720
Now I've chosen an ethyl radical because it's the simplest example of this phenomenon.

30:14.720 --> 30:19.040
And when we look at our ethyl radical, what you'll notice is that on one side we have

30:19.040 --> 30:24.540
our single electron, which makes it a radical, in a p-atomic orbital.

30:24.540 --> 30:29.680
But what you'll also notice is that in the adjacent carbon, there's a carbon-hydrogen

30:29.680 --> 30:34.040
bond which I have aligned with that p-atomic orbital.

30:34.040 --> 30:40.200
And when this type of alignment occurs, it allows an electron to very transiently jump

30:40.320 --> 30:45.400
from that bond over to the carbon which is missing an electron, essentially giving it

30:45.400 --> 30:51.160
a little bit of satisfaction that it has an octet for just a split instant in time.

30:51.160 --> 30:55.840
And if you expand this process to occur when there is not just one carbon next to our radical,

30:55.840 --> 31:01.000
but two or three, you can begin to see how the addition of these extra carbons and the

31:01.000 --> 31:05.640
bonds that they have to other substituents can increase the stability of our radical

31:05.640 --> 31:09.720
through hyperconjugation, which sort of fools the radical into thinking that it's got a

31:09.720 --> 31:11.920
full octet, even if just for an instant.

31:18.920 --> 31:23.840
So as we look back now at Rockefeller's standard oil operation, it becomes clear to us exactly

31:23.840 --> 31:27.320
what gave his product that trademark consistency.

31:27.320 --> 31:31.320
While his competitors were selling animal products or are less refined, more unpredictable

31:31.320 --> 31:35.000
mixtures of fuels, causing their customers to wonder whether the next can of fuel would

31:35.000 --> 31:40.280
be the one which burns a little bit too vigorously and sets their roof on fire, Rockefeller's

31:40.280 --> 31:44.160
customers could rest assured that they would receive the same mixture of branched and linear

31:44.160 --> 31:48.760
alkanes of the proper lengths to give them just the right physical and chemical properties

31:48.760 --> 31:52.880
for their intended purpose.

31:52.880 --> 31:57.600
So today we've discussed the basic molecular formula of alkanes, that all hydrocarbons

31:57.600 --> 32:03.240
of this class consist entirely of hydrogen and sp3 hybridized carbon, and that they

32:03.240 --> 32:09.160
have a molecular formula of CnH2n plus 2.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.480
We also touched on the concept of structural isomerism and demonstrated how the ability

32:13.480 --> 32:18.880
of carbon to form these highly branched chains leads to millions of realistic possible alkanes

32:18.880 --> 32:24.080
structures with just a few carbon atoms.

32:24.080 --> 32:28.440
We also took a brief look at how chemists have come to name alkanes and their structural

32:28.440 --> 32:33.880
isomers in a way in which the IUPAC convention allows us to unambiguously name millions of

32:33.880 --> 32:39.160
complex alkanes with just a few simple rules.

32:39.160 --> 32:43.880
We've also discussed how structure affects physical properties of alkanes, most notably

32:43.880 --> 32:52.240
how increasing size and decreasing branching lead to lower volatility and increased viscosities.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.480
We also visited a few chemical reactions involving alkanes, including combustion in

32:56.480 --> 33:02.640
oxygen, which destroys the carbon chain, and free radical halogenation, which can produce

33:02.640 --> 33:10.160
new organic compounds called alkyl halides while leaving the hydrocarbon chain intact.

33:10.160 --> 33:14.400
We were also introduced to the phenomenon of hyperconjugation, which helps us to explain

33:14.400 --> 33:21.480
why radical halogenations tend to occur at more substituted carbons on the hydrocarbon.

33:22.480 --> 33:28.280
And finally, we took a look at how a Canadian geologist, a powerful American business magnate,

33:28.280 --> 33:34.320
and a retired railroad engineer all got together in the mid-19th century and used diverse alkan

33:34.320 --> 33:39.280
components to forever change the commercial, economic, environmental landscape of America

33:39.280 --> 33:41.280
and the world.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.920
And to say the sperm whale species is a bonus.

33:45.920 --> 33:50.320
But our story of the geometric complexity of hydrocarbons is far from over.

33:50.320 --> 33:54.800
In our next lecture, we'll investigate the structural and chemical implications of wrapping

33:54.800 --> 34:00.240
our carbon chains into loops, forming what are sometimes called cycloalkanes.

34:00.240 --> 34:00.880
I'll see you then.
