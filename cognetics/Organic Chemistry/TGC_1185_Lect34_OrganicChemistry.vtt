00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Previously, we discussed the method of recrystallization as a means of purifying non-volatile, organic crystalline solids.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Recrystallization is a powerful technique for the isolation of products when they have melting points well in excess of a solvent's boiling points,

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
and of course when the desired compound is present in great abundance, ensuring that it will become saturated in the cooling solution long before any impurities will.

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
But what can be done when a compound does not have the necessary physical properties for recrystallization, or if it's not the dominant material in a mixture?

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
Well, we really can't turn to recrystallization to obtain an effective separation.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
But there are other ways to isolate organic compounds from one another based on a phenomenon known as partitioning.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
Today we will talk about one of the most common classes of techniques used in this principle, extraction.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
But first, let's just think about partitioning itself in terms of something most of us can relate to, salad dressing.

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
Now, the contents of this bottle include water and olive oil, and we can clearly see the two ingredients because they create two distinct phases.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Since the oil and water are immiscible, or don't dissolve in one another, one simply floats on the other.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
In this case, the oil is above the water because the oil is less dense.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Now, also in this bottle are some other ingredients, including salt and some herbs and herb oils.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
Now, to simplify, let's just say the recipe contains water and oil as solvents and salt and oregano, or the oil of oregano, as a solute.

01:51.000 --> 02:03.000
So, the water and oil provide two different chemical environments in which the sodium and chloride ions from the salt and the organic carvacrol oil from oregano can dissolve.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Now, knowing what we know about intermolecular forces and the role they play in solubility,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
we expect to find the ions of the salt, preferentially dissolved in the high polarity water,

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
which can orient its bondi poles to create favorable interactions with the dissolved ions.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
And of course, the low polarity carvacrol from the herb oils dissolves in the low polarity oil layer on top,

02:27.000 --> 02:36.000
because the larger oil molecules are more polarizable and can form dispersion forces which solvate the carvacrol.

02:36.000 --> 02:45.000
It's exactly because of this separation that the proper blend of flavors is only obtained when we vigorously shake the bottle just before use.

02:45.000 --> 02:56.000
So, to pour just the top layer would be to put only the herb oils onto my salad, while to pour just the lower layer would only add the salt, acid and water.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
So, when we shake the dressing, we're getting ready for lunch.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
But when we don't shake the dressing, but rather deliberately allow the two phases to stay separate, dispensing each individually,

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
we're doing a very simple form of liquid-liquid extraction.

03:15.000 --> 03:25.000
Now, in our first example in this lecture, I used a system in which we assumed that all the particular solute accumulated in one of the two phases available to it.

03:25.000 --> 03:37.000
In part, I was able to make this assumption because of how drastically different sodium chloride and carvacrol are being ionic and organic compounds respectively.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
But the truth for most organic molecules in a system like this isn't so simple.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Many of them have an appreciable solubility in both water and a certain organic solvent.

03:47.000 --> 03:59.000
And when this is the case, we can expect a solute to establish a set of equilibrium concentrations in both solvents based upon its relative solubility in each of them.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
We call this effect partitioning, and the equilibrium constant which governs it is a partitioning coefficient.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
Partitioning coefficients are easily calculated from the maximum solubility of the solute in each of the two solvents.

04:15.000 --> 04:27.000
They give a numerical value which allows us to predict how much of each solute will be in each layer at equilibrium.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
So let's take a look at a partitioning event as it happens.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
In this case, I'm going to use one butanol and water as solvents and some blue-colored food dye as a solute.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
Now we can be pretty sure that this fairly polar food dye would rather be dissolved in the water layer which is on the bottom of these two funnels.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
And yet, it's dissolved in the top layer right now which is an butanol, a less polar solvent.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
It's up there now because I very carefully and very deliberately added it to the top without disturbing the lower layer

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
so that we could see the conditions before I actually perform a liquid-liquid extraction.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Now the glassware that I'm using today are called separatory funnels and their design is very specific for this purpose.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
They contain a ground glass stopper which leads to a port on top so that I can add my liquids to the separatory funnel itself

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
which is a sort of a pear-shaped funnel which leads to a Teflon stopcock.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
And that Teflon stopcock can be used to open the bottom of the funnel draining the liquid through the stem.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
So I can add liquid to the top but I can remove liquids from the bottom.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Now you can see I've already charged them very carefully with my two different solutions.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
So at the moment my food dye dissolved in an butanol is on top because the density of an butanol is about 80% out of water

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
and I have some pure water underneath.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
But that food dye is very polar organic molecule and it really would much rather be in the water than in the butanol.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
So why isn't it there already?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Well it's not there already because it needs a little bit of assistance.

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
You see partitioning takes place very very slowly when we rely on nothing more than random molecular motion

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
and a very narrow interface between the two solvents to allow them to jump from one side to the other.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
They need a little bit of assistance from me in the form of agitation.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
So what I'm going to do next is take one of my two separatory funnels and agitate the mixture creating many inclusions of one solvent in the other

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
thereby drastically increasing the surface area contact.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
Now when I do this it's going to take about a moment for everything to come back to equilibrium and for my two phases to separate again.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
But when they do I think we'll see something very different than what we have now.

06:53.000 --> 07:04.000
So let's take this separatory funnel and again agitate a bit to create some inclusions of one solvent in the other.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Creatically venting to make sure there's no pressure building up.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
We don't want that to happen.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
And then I'm going to return it to the stand.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Now if we look closely we can already start to see the two phases separating.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
And that's not too surprising because enbutinol and water are immiscible in one another.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
But what is surprising is notice the different colors of the layers.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Clearly the food dye is accumulating in the lower layer.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
That's because it's more soluble overall in water than it is in enbutinol.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
So I have affected a liquid-liquid extraction here.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
I've removed some but not quite all of the dye molecules from my enbutinol.

07:52.000 --> 08:01.000
Now at this point if it were my goal to retrieve those molecules all I need is a beaker.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
I can remove my stopper so that I don't have a reduction in pressure in the headspace.

08:05.000 --> 08:18.000
And I can simply drain my aqueous layer through the stem and isolate the dye molecules in aqueous solution from my enbutinol.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Alright and I think that's probably about enough we can stop that.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Now this is where the conical shape of the flask comes into play.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
If I watch my interface as I drain this, let's go for a little bit more here.

08:31.000 --> 08:41.000
If you watch the interface as I drain it, as it reaches the narrow portion of the stem I can very carefully and very precisely cut the flow

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
just as that reaches the stopcock thereby collecting the maximum amount of my aqueous solution.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
So the dye that was in the enbutinol is now in water.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
So you probably noticed there that even though most of that dye made its way into the aqueous layer,

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
that a little bit of it remained in the organic enbutinol layer.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
So there was an equilibrium of concentrations there.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
And this equilibrium is governed by a constant which is equal to the maximum solubility of that dye in the aqueous solvent

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
divided by the maximum solubility in the organic solvent.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
So that's what we call the partitioning coefficient.

09:19.000 --> 09:27.000
So in this case, my dye had a very large partitioning coefficient, so I managed to extract most of it into the aqueous layer.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
But this isn't always the case for organic compounds.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Sometimes they're pretty fussy about going into aqueous solutions.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
So if I want to extract an organic compound from an organic solution into water,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm going to have to play some tricks.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
And one of the best tricks we have is altering the pH of the aqueous layer.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
So let's look at a representative organic molecule and start to think about the factors that affected solubility in aqueous solution.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
For my demonstration, I'm going to use two naphthol.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
This is an aromatic alcohol with a pKa of about 10.

10:02.000 --> 10:13.000
So this hydroxyl group here is slightly acidic because of the resonance stabilization afforded by the benzene or the aromatic ring that it's attached to.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
So we have to think back to our lecture on acids and bases and the Henderson-Husselbach equation,

10:18.000 --> 10:31.000
which gives us a way to relate the amount of a weak acid which is deprotonated with that which is protonated as a function of pH and the pKa of that compound.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
If we do a little bit of rearranging and use the Henderson-Husselbach equation to create a plot of the percent ionized an aqueous solution

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
as a function of the pH of that aqueous solution,

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
we get a trace that looks something like this.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
Notice the very steep transition that takes place right around the pKa of the compound.

10:55.000 --> 11:04.000
So in this case, if I were to attempt to dissolve naphthol in water at a pH of about, let's say, 6,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
it's not going to dissolve as well as it could.

11:07.000 --> 11:16.000
And the reason for this is that at a pH of about 6, none of the dissolved naphthol is going to be ionized or practically none of it will be ionized.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
So if I were to pour some liquid into a beaker, adjust that liquid to pH 6 and attempt to dissolve naphthol,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
only a very small amount will actually go into solution.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Remember, partitioning coefficients are dictated by solubility.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
So if I can change its solubility, I can change its partitioning coefficient.

11:34.000 --> 11:43.000
Now to do that, all I have to do is adjust the pH of my aqueous solution so that I'm on the other side of the pKa.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
So let's do that now.

11:44.000 --> 11:53.000
If I move over to a pH that's greater than 12, let's say 14, four pH units above the pKa, well in excess of what I would need,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm not dissolving naphthol anymore.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm dissolving naphthalate.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm dissolving the ionized version of my weak acid.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Now, polar water interacts much better with ions than it does with neutral organics.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
And that means that these naphthalate ions have a much higher solubility.

12:11.000 --> 12:23.000
So by altering its solubility in water, by adjusting the pH, I'm changing its partitioning behavior when I try to run a liquid-liquid extraction.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
So let's do that now.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Here is my naphthol, but I've drawn two different equilibria.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
And the reason I've done this is that we now know that depending upon the pH of an aqueous layer,

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
I'll either be dealing with the equilibrium between two naphthol in the organic and two naphthol in the aqueous layer

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
or between two naphthol in the organic and two naphthalate in the aqueous layer.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
Let's see how that affects the extraction properties by looking at a Mach extraction funnel here.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
I've got my Henderson-Hasselbach plot with my transition at the pKa of my compound.

12:59.000 --> 13:08.000
And as long as I'm two pH units above or below that position, I'm in a situation where I can consider it to be either all ionized or all unionized.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
So let's zoom in on this extraction funnel and see what happens.

13:14.000 --> 13:23.000
So here I am at the interface with an organic layer, let's say ether, and an aqueous layer, which I've adjusted to a low pH, less than 8.

13:23.000 --> 13:31.000
That means that I'm dealing with an equilibrium between two naphthol in the organic layer and two naphthol in the aqueous layer.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
So at this point I'm dealing with these neutral organic compounds and they're not terribly soluble.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
So at best I can hope that a small fraction of them is going to move down here into the aqueous layer.

13:42.000 --> 13:50.000
I'm not going to be able to wash very much of it away in this fashion, so my extraction is suboptimal at this point.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
But what happens if I change the pH of that aqueous layer?

13:53.000 --> 14:02.000
Let's move to the other side of the Henderson-Hasselbach plot to where our pH is greater than 12, more than two units above the pKa.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
Well now I'm dealing with naphtholate and its solubility is higher, so its partitioning coefficient is greater.

14:08.000 --> 14:17.000
So simply by carefully choosing the pH of my aqueous layer, I can make my extraction work better or worse depending on my goals.

14:18.000 --> 14:27.000
So I can affect a different partitioning coefficient on a compound, at least if it's titratable, simply by adjusting the pH of the aqueous layer that I use.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
So how can I use that to my advantage when I'm trying to extract one organic compound from another?

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
And the answer to this lies in the fact that most organic compounds have slightly different pKa values from one another and slightly different acid-base properties.

14:41.000 --> 14:48.000
For example, we've already considered naphthol and naphthalate, but take a look at naphthoic acid.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
Now this is a compound that's very similar to naphthol, yet its pKa is about four rather than ten.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
So if I were to plot its Henderson-Hasselbach equation, I'd get a plot that looks something like this,

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
in which I have a similar shape, but the transition is taking place at a much lower pH.

15:07.000 --> 15:16.000
So I can solubilize naphtholic acid in water much more easily. I only have to have a pH of around six or higher.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
Now compare that to the equilibrium we just looked at, naphthol and naphthalate, where the pKa is ten.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Its Henderson-Hasselbach plot has a transition at a much higher pH.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
So that's a difference that I can use.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
If we take it one step further and consider a compound which is not acidic but is basic.

15:36.000 --> 15:44.000
For example, naphthylamine. Now naphthylamine actually picks up a proton and becomes charged to form naphthylammonium ion,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
which has a pKa of around 4.6.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
But because naphthylammonium, the conjugate acid, is charged, not only will my Henderson-Hasselbach plot shift,

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
but it will reverse on the vertical axis. And I'll have more ionized at a lower pH.

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
Again, something I can exploit, difference in how they behave based upon the pH of the extraction solution.

16:08.000 --> 16:16.000
So again, our acidic compounds are charged when they're at high pH, but our basic compound is charged at low pH.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
So now that we've laid this groundwork, we're ready to actually perform an extraction.

16:24.000 --> 16:34.000
Let's assume that we needed to separate this naphthoic acid from two naphthol, two compounds whose pKa and acid-base behavior we've already characterized pretty well.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
Their two Henderson-Hasselbach plots are kind of similar in shape, but they have a different transitional pH.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
So you can already begin to see, if you look carefully here, there is a region of the plot where they're behaving very differently from one another,

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
but there are also regions of the plot where they behave very similarly to one another.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
And if we're going to separate them, our goal is to be in that zone where they're different.

16:57.000 --> 17:04.000
So if we were to take a look at an extraction taking place with an organic layer on top and a very acidic aqueous layer on the bottom, what would we see?

17:05.000 --> 17:14.000
Well, we would see a situation where neither of them is particularly ionized in the aqueous layer, and therefore their solubilities are much greater up here in the organics.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
I've color-coded them a little bit. I've shaded them in green and orange, so they're a bit easier to tell apart from one another.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
You'll see that the orange is my naphthoic acid and that the greens are my naphthol.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
So let's move along our Henderson-Hasselbach plot to a different pH and see if we can do better.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
If we move up to about neutral pH, around pH 7, take a look at what's happened here.

17:39.000 --> 17:47.000
I have reached a point on my Henderson-Hasselbach plot where there is a huge difference in the amount present as ions in the aqueous solution.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
My naphthoic acid is completely deprotonated when in water, but my naphthol is completely neutral.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
So their solubilities are very different, which leads to a situation where one partitions into the water as its conjugate base,

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
the other remains up here in the organic layer as its conjugate acid.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
So if I were to attempt an extraction with an aqueous layer of this pH, separating the two is as simple as opening the stopcock at the bottom of the funnel.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
But if I go too far and I raise my pH all the way to say 12 or higher,

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
I reach a point at which not only is my naphthoic acid going to be very water soluble,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
but so is my naphthol because now it can dissolve as naphtholate.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
So at this point I will have a preponderance of both compounds accumulating in the aqueous layer.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
My extraction will have been compromised.

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
And as a final example, let's take a look at the difference between weak acids and weak bases.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
For example, the extraction of naphthol and naphthylamine.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
So if I had a physical mixture of these two and wanted to separate them using this technique,

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
how would that be different from the extraction of two weak acids, one from the other, like we just looked at?

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
Well, remember the Henderson-Husselbach plot for my naphtholamine is reversed.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
It's flipped over on the vertical axis.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
So it's more ionized at low pHs and less ionized at high pHs.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
So what does that mean for my extraction?

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Well, what that means is that if I start my extraction with a very acidic aqueous layer,

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
I expect that my naphthylamine will actually be naphthylamonium ion and therefore very soluble in the water.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
So I'll start at a very low pH with an effective extraction,

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
which places the naphthylamine in the aqueous layer and places the naphthol in the organic layer.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
But as I raise my pH, I run into a problem again.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
If I try this extraction with neutral water,

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
I have a situation where my naphthylamonium is not soluble in water because it's now naphthylamine,

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
and it's going to migrate preferentially into the organic layer where the naphthol already is.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
So by using a neutral aqueous solution, I'm not going to extract anything,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
at least not to any appreciable extent.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Finally, if I continue, raise the pH even farther,

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
I reach a situation where now my naphthol can become deprotonated in the aqueous layer,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
leaving behind the naphthylamine.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I have a good extraction once again,

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
but this time I've got my naphthol accumulating in the aqueous layer

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
as opposed to the naphthylamine that I had at the beginning.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
So one of the benefits of trying to extract an acid from a base

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
is that we can choose which layer each will move into.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
I could put my basic compound in the aqueous layer by using an acidic aqueous solution,

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
or I can put my acidic compound in by using a basic.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
And of course the drawback is I have to use a lot of acid or base to get it done.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
Now so far in this lecture we've thought of partitioning in terms of two immiscible liquid phases.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
But partitioning can also take place between any two distinct phases.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Some other examples are solid liquid or liquid gas systems.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
So naturally it should be possible to conduct extractions using these kinds of systems as well.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
Now probably the most obvious example of an extraction using solid liquid partitioning

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
is the process of brewing a cup of tea.

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
As you add hot water to a tea leaf, certain compounds are going to dissolve in water better than others.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
Now in this case the large and insoluble material making up the tea leaves

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
can interact with say caffeine, polyphenols, and other compounds which would otherwise be soluble in cold water.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
But we all know from experience that steeping tea in cold water leads to a very weak beverage.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
So just as we can manipulate the partitioning coefficient in a liquid-liquid extraction with pH,

22:04.000 --> 22:11.000
so we can manipulate the partitioning coefficients of compounds in solid liquid systems using temperature.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
And tea connoisseurs will understand this well.

22:16.000 --> 22:26.000
Green tea. It's famous for its delicate flavors and aromas, but green tea also contains particularly high levels, tannins,

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
a polyphenolic class of compounds with a bitter taste and a very dry mouthfeel.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
So the goal in preparing this delightful beverage is temperature control.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Fine green teas require careful attention to brewing temperature,

22:43.000 --> 22:52.000
as water just below its boiling point partitions the pleasant and aroma-granting compounds into that water effectively.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
But water too close to boiling will separate the polyphenolic compounds which have a more bitter taste,

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
ruining the otherwise enjoyable experience of a well-crafted green tea.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Just take a look at the pleasant tasting amino acid, theanine,

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
which makes up a sizable portion of the amino acid content of green tea.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
Now take a look at tannic acid, a common polyphenol with a bitter dry taste.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
Is it any wonder why theanine can be liberated from the hydroxyl-rich cellulose fibers of tea leaves more easily?

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
With all those hydrogen bonders, it's obvious it simply clings on tighter.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
So a well-made green tea is a textbook example of a solid liquid chemical extraction,

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
selectively partitioning one type of compound into the liquid while leaving the other behind adhered to the solid matrix.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
So if you're a green tea drinker, I congratulate you on being a great bench chemist as well.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
So let's review what we've covered in this lecture.

23:57.000 --> 24:05.000
We discussed the concept of immiscible liquids and how solvents of very low polarity tend to be immiscible in higher polarity solvents like water.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
We talked about how organic solutes have a finite solubility in each solvent,

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
and how we can use this finite solubility to calculate what's known as a partitioning coefficient.

24:18.000 --> 24:27.000
We then saw how the partitioning coefficient can be used to predict the relative amount of a given compound which will be found in each solvent at equilibrium.

24:29.000 --> 24:37.000
Next, we took a look at how the pH of water can affect the total solubility of titratable organic compounds in that solvent,

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
and how that can drastically change partitioning coefficients predictably and often usefully.

24:44.000 --> 24:51.000
Finally, we took a look at solid liquid extractions in which partitioning occurs not between two immiscible liquid phases,

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
but between being dissolved in solvent and being adhered to an insoluble solid.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
And we saw how this technique is no different than the quest for the perfect cup of green tea.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
But our discussion of partitioning is only half over. We still need to consider one last caveat.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
See, this lecture's discussion focused on partitioning between two phases, which are at rest.

25:18.000 --> 25:29.000
Next time, we're going to set one of those phases in motion, opening up the discussion to one of the most powerful separation techniques ever invented, chromatography.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I'll see you then.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Thank you.
