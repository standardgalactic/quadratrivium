1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So far, we've explored the structure of the atom and how it leads to chemical bonding between atoms.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We've looked at how those chemical bonds lead to molecular structures and some of the tools chemists use

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to communicate changes in those structures through time.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, it may seem daunting when you consider the sheer number of possible structures and how they all might interact with one another.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But many reactions follow similar pathways, and generally they obey similar rules.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So chemists group reactions into just a few fundamental classes.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And probably the simplest of all these reactions is the proton transfer reaction,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
in which an acid in a base exchange one simple hydrogen nucleus.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now, I can practically guarantee that you did some acid-base chemistry at some point today.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Did you maybe take an an acid after a spicy meal? That was acid-base chemistry.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Maybe you noticed some marble statues outside were looking a bit weathered.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You were observing acid-base chemistry.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Or maybe you put a little lemon juice on your seafood to cut down that fishy smell.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Congratulations, you're a chemist who just performed an acid-base reaction.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now, many of us are familiar with some of the more fundamental properties of acids.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For example, they tend to dissolve metals, cause color changes in certain substances,

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and may have very accurate odors or sour tastes.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, the Greeks actually grouped sour tasting substances into a class of compounds called oxen.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And that sentiment is still evident today, as the Latin word for vinegar, acetum,

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
serves as the basis for the modern English word, acid.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So the chemical name for vinegar, acetic acid, literally translates to acetic acid.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And people think scientists don't have a sense of humor.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now, granted, the name is a bit strange, but it's a fitting tribute to how influential

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that simple little molecule has been in human history.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But what exactly makes something an acid?

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is there a certain molecular feature which endows acids with their properties?

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now, the property of acidity was originally associated with sourness in the taste of materials,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
but that's an empirical observation.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Surely there must be some structural motif, which all acids share in common,

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and which endows them with the properties observed by the ancient Greeks.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was our friend Antoine Lavoisier, who turned his attention to this question in the 18th century,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
still using the traditional definition of anything sour tasting.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But he also theorized that there was some material, some essence of acidity,

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
which was common to all compounds of this class.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Unfortunately, Lavoisier mistakenly theorized that it was the element oxygen which did this.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
In fact, this is how oxygen got its name from the Greek root oxy, meaning sharp or sour.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Of course, we now know that Lavoisier was on the right track with assigning acidity to a specific element.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He was just unfortunate enough to guess the wrong one.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Acidity is, in fact, a property granted not by the presence of oxygen, but by the presence of hydrogen.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now, not just any hydrogen will do, though.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hydrogens have to be removed as H plus ions, so there needs to be a specific type of chemical bond which allows us to do this.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And, of course, hydrogen ions are essentially protons, so I'm going to use those terms interchangeably today.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You may also be familiar with the term base.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In chemistry, bases are the alter ego to acids.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The presence of bases lowers the concentration of hydrogen ions.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And in all of our examples at the beginning of this lecture, acids were transferring their acidic protons to another base.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The hydrochloric acid in your stomach was reacting with a basic antacid.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The carbonic acid in rainwater was reacting with a basic limestone.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And the citric acid in lemon juice was reacting with the bases in the seafood.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sometimes, the transfer of protons from one molecule to another happens with desirable results, and sometimes with undesirable results, but always with powerful results.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The transfer of protons from acids to bases is by far the most common and arguably the most influential reaction in all of organic chemistry.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So let's start our discussion about acids and bases by defining exactly what they are from a chemical perspective.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There are three ways in which chemists categorize acids and bases.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Irenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis systems.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Now, each of these is named for the chemists who first proposed the system.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And each was devised to be most useful in a specific situation.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Irenius acids increase the concentration of protons when added to water.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And Irenius bases increase the concentration of hydroxide ions when added to water.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In the Bronsted-Lowry system, acids are still defined as proton donors, but bases are instead defined as proton acceptors.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Finally, Lewis acids are those species which can easily accept an electron pair to form a new bond, while Lewis bases donate electron pairs to those bonds.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This may seem a little bit odd since the process I just described can take place without a proton being involved,

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
but this definition allows us to extend acid-base categorization beyond solutions in water, bringing it into solvents more commonly used by the organic chemists.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So we will revisit Lewis acid-base theory in many of our coming lectures, but for today we're going to focus on the Bronsted-Lowry definition.

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So now that we've made the decision to continue our discussion today using Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases, that is, acids donating protons and bases accepting them,

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
we can turn our attention to modeling reactions involving this transfer more closely.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now proton transfer reactions are usually very fast, reaching equilibrium long before other reactions can occur.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There are of course exceptions to this rule, but in general we can expect that a system will reach its most stable protonation state long before any other reactions can occur.

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Just like the reaction between your lemon juice and your fish is finished before you even begin enjoying your meal.

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now the proton transfer reaction is in equilibrium. It's a state of dynamic interconversion between or among products and reactants.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In some cases, just a small amount of products coexist with reagents at equilibrium, and in others the roles may be reversed,

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
with a sample consisting of nearly all products and just a small amount of reactants.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The extent to which this equilibrium lies in favor of products and reactants is dependent on the strengths of the acids appearing in the equation.

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So let's take a look at one of these reactions now.

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, the slide is not laughing at you.

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
HA is actually how organic chemists write a generic Bronsted-Lowry acid when it's really not too important to us what the rest of the molecule is comprised of.

76
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So for the moment I'm going to use this designation.

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So acids HA we expect will dissociate into a proton and whatever's left over, in this case a minus, and we call a minus a conjugate base.

78
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So my proton dissociation reaction has taken place here now, and I have my acidic hydrogen and I also have what we call the conjugate base.

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Now just like our Haber-Bosch process, we can model the dissociation of an acid as an equilibrium, and when we do this we can calculate an equilibrium constant.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So the equilibrium constant for this process is calculated as the concentration of protons times the concentration of conjugate base divided by the concentration of the conjugate acid.

81
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Now we give it a special subscript here, A, and really this is calculated just like any other KEQ, but we give it the subscript A so that the reader knows that we're talking about this specific type of chemical reaction.

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But the catch is that KA values can be very, very large or very, very small, and the numbers can become somewhat unwieldy.

83
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So we often report on the strength of an acid using something called the pKa.

84
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now the pKa is simply the negative logarithm of KA itself.

85
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So by doing this we've changed our number not only in magnitude, but we've also flipped the relationship over, whereas KA gets larger as the proton concentration increases, meaning a stronger acid,

86
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
the pKa actually gets smaller as proton concentration increases, meaning that a smaller pKa is equal to a stronger acid.

87
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So using this system, a KA of 0.1 becomes a pKa of 1, while a KA of 0.01 becomes a pKa of 2, and a KA of 0.001 becomes 3, and so on.

88
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
These are much more manageable numbers.

89
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now pKa values are a valuable means of quickly comparing acid strengths.

90
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For example, if I were to show you the pKa values for a few acids with which you're likely to be familiar, I can quickly scan that list, and I can say that mole for mole,

91
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
vinegar is about 100 billion times more acidic than ethanol.

92
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because their pKa values differ by 11, so their dissociation constants differ by a factor of 10 to the 11th.

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hydrochloric acid has a pKa of about negative 6, making it 100 billion times more acidic than vinegar.

94
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So you can see how massive the scale of acidity can be, and we use pKa to navigate it more quickly.

95
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But this is only half of the picture.

96
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If proton transfer occurs between an acid and a base, we certainly have to consider the properties of the base partner, right?

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So let's take a look at an example.

98
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If we're interested in determining the extent to which a proton transfer reaction like this one would take place,

99
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it's easier for us to think about if we break it down into two different acid dissociation reactions.

100
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This would be the reaction between our acid and its conjugate base, and our reactant base and its conjugate acid.

101
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So when I break my equation down into these two sub-equations, it's a little bit easier for me to see.

102
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
First I have the acid dissociation of Ha. That equilibrium constant is defined as Ka.

103
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The second part of my reaction I can model as the acid association of this acid here, Ha prime.

104
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So the equilibrium constant for the reaction as I've written it is the reciprocal of Ka for this particular acid.

105
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So why would I want to break this down this way?

106
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, the reason is I can calculate Keq for a total process using the product of the equilibrium constants for all of the processes which add up to create it.

107
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:15,000
In other words, the equilibrium constant for my proton transfer reaction is simply equal to Ka for the dissociating acid divided by Ka for the newly formed conjugate acid.

108
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And in this way I can determine whether my equilibrium will shift to the right or the left or somewhere in between.

109
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Remember that example about using lemon juice to cut down on the fishy smell?

110
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, this is the proton transfer reaction that goes on.

111
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The principal acid component of lemon juice is citric acid.

112
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And the basic compounds in fish that give them that characteristic smell is called methylamine.

113
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Now this is just one of many compounds, but they're all of a similar ilk.

114
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And what goes on during this reaction is a proton is transferred from citric acid creating its conjugate base to the methylamine creating its conjugate acid.

115
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So citric acid and methylamine react to form dihydrogen citrate and methyl ammonium.

116
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So we want to move that acidic proton from one side to the other, but we don't know the extent to which it will occur just yet.

117
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
To do this, to determine how far it will go, we can take a look at the conjugate acid and conjugate base for the reactants,

118
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and we find out that the conjugate acid in this particular pair has a pKa of 3.2.

119
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If we turn our attention to the base, methylamine, and look at its conjugate acid, methyl ammonium,

120
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
we discover that the acid in this particular set has a pKa of 10.6.

121
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So if we want to know exactly how far this equilibrium will shift, we want to answer that question,

122
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to what extent will the reaction take place, we can simply compare the pKa values of citric acid to methyl ammonium.

123
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So here I've done it as a keq, but remember the pKa's are here in the exponents.

124
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So using this equation, I've determined that the equilibrium constant for this reaction is about 10 to the 7.4 power.

125
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's 50 million.

126
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So let's think about what that means for the reaction.

127
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That means that the equilibrium which will be established between equal amounts of citric acid and methylamine

128
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
will favor the products by about 50 million times.

129
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So for every one of those smelly methylamines that remains in your meal, 50 million of them will have been neutralized.

130
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's pretty impressive.

131
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Now so far we've managed to demonstrate how one can compare acid strengths and predict the outcome of a proton transfer reaction

132
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
using acid dissociation constants or pKa values.

133
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Now these two parameters are a reflection of acid strength.

134
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But what exactly is it that makes an acid strong or weak?

135
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Can we predict these properties or are we at the mercy of empirical scientific observation to determine those values?

136
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well the answer to the question lies somewhere in between the extremes.

137
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Careful consideration of a compound structure allows us to estimate its acidity

138
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
or make an assertion about the relative acidities of two compounds,

139
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
though not necessarily to predict their exact pKa values.

140
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And since the loss of a proton by an acid always produces its conjugate base,

141
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
one way to predict acidity is to simply assess the stability of the conjugate base which forms.

142
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
More stable conjugate base means a stronger acid with a higher kA and a lower pKa.

143
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In general there are two major factors which combine to affect the stability of these conjugate bases in organic compounds.

144
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The first is the electronegativity of nearby atoms in groups,

145
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
which cause electrons to be pulled away from the basic site where the proton would be held.

146
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The second is nearby pi systems providing the stabilizing effect of resonance.

147
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And both of these factors affect stability in essentially the same way.

148
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
They're spreading out and delocalizing the charges that conform when a proton removal takes place.

149
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So let's begin this exercise by considering the inductive effect on a simple organic acid with which you may be familiar.

150
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We're going to start with ethanol and then we'll look at a few of its derivatives.

151
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So today we're going to compare the relative acidities of five different organic compounds.

152
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Trifluoromethanol, difluoromethanol, dichloromethanol, a compound known as 2-2 dichloroethanol, and ethanol itself.

153
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Now I've already arranged them in order of decreasing acidity.

154
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And the total range of acidity here goes from a pKa of 12.4 to a pKa of about 16.

155
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So stop and think about that. We're talking about 50,000 fold acidity increase as we add these chlorines and fluorines to the molecule.

156
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So the logical question here is why does the addition of a halogen to this molecule have such an effect on acidity?

157
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Well the reason behind this is easy to see when we compare three of these compounds.

158
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm going to use trifluoromethanol, 2-2 dichloroethanol, and ethanol itself to try to explain this phenomenon.

159
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Now we know already that halogens are very electronegative. Fluorine in fact is the most electronegative element of all.

160
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So in our conjugate bases as I've drawn them here, I have a large quantity of highly electronegative elements very close to the basic site.

161
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In other words, I placed really strong dipoles nearby that are pulling electron density away from the basic site.

162
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Less electron density at the basic site means less negative charge.

163
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And less negative charge means it doesn't attract and hold protons as well.

164
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So this is our explanation for why trifluoromethanol is so much more acidic than a simple alcohol like ethanol.

165
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Now I take a look at my dichloroethanol molecule here. A similar effect is going to take place.

166
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But the dipoles are smaller because of the reduced electronegativity of chlorine and they're farther away in space from the basic site.

167
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This means that the effect of the chlorine atoms will not be as strong as those from the fluorines.

168
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So they will attenuate the negative charge at the basic site a little bit, but not quite as much as the fluorines did.

169
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And finally, of course, we have ethanol, which doesn't have any electronegative elements attached.

170
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And so there is no way for this conjugate base to distribute its negative charge and decrease its own reactivity.

171
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So this leads to a more stable conjugate acid and explains why the pKa of ethanol is so much higher.

172
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So there are three things at work here. The electronegativity of the attached elements, the quantity of those elements that are attached,

173
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and the proximity of those elements or substituents to the actual basic site.

174
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So smaller fluorines, closer in greater quantity, lead to a stronger acid.

175
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But that's not the only factor. Remember, we also said that resonance was important.

176
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So let's take a look at some acids in which that trend occurs.

177
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Here are three organic acids, naphthoic acid, benzoic acid, and the very familiar acetic acid.

178
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I've highlighted their acidic protons here in blue so that we can see where they are.

179
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And now I'm going to switch these structures over to something that's a little bit easier to look at.

180
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Now, my acetic acid has a pKa that's about a full unit above that of naphthoic acid.

181
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So something about adding these rings of carbon atoms with sp2 hybridization is increasing the acidity,

182
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
which means that it's stabilizing the conjugate bases.

183
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So let's look at those conjugate bases now and see if we can figure out what's going on.

184
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, here are my conjugate bases with the charges in place.

185
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And the first thing that I'd like to point out to you is that just because we have this carbonyl here,

186
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
common to all of them, this particular group, which we call a carboxylic acid,

187
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
we'll take a much closer look at this later in the course,

188
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
but that entire group can distribute some of that negative charge,

189
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
which explains why all three of these compounds have pKa values that are so drastically low compared to ethanol.

190
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But why is benzoic acid more acidic than acetic acid?

191
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And why is naphthoic acid even more acidic than benzoic acid?

192
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The reason is that we can draw resonance contributors for these two molecules

193
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
in which the negative charge has moved into the ring.

194
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm not going to draw those contributors for you, but I'm going to show you their general effect.

195
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And that is to attenuate even more of that negative charge in benzoic acid

196
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and even more so in naphthoic acid.

197
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So again, the most stable conjugate base belongs to the strongest conjugate acid.

198
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So the trend holds, this is why we have to consider not only electronegativity, quantity and proximity of groups,

199
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
but also whether or not those groups are in resonance with the basic site.

200
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But not all acids are so simple.

201
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ethanol, trifluoroethanol, acetic acid and benzoic acid all clearly have just one acidic hydrogen,

202
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
because their other hydrogens are bonded strongly and directly to the carbon scaffold.

203
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So their acid-base chemistry is limited to a simple two-state system

204
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
in which the molecule is either protonated or deprotonated.

205
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We call these types of acids monoprotic, since they have just one acidic hydrogen,

206
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
which can be removed under all but the most extreme conditions.

207
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Now this makes acid-base equilibria involving monoprotic acids very easy to model,

208
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
since there's only two potential states, protonated or deprotonated.

209
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But let's take a look at that citric acid molecule one more time.

210
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
In our initial example, I fudged a little bit and implied that citric acid had just one acidic proton

211
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and only one associated pKa value,

212
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
that which governs the removal of its most acidic proton,

213
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
producing the associated conjugate base.

214
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But take a closer look at that conjugate base.

215
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It contains other acidic hydrogens,

216
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
which might be removed if a proton transfer reaction were occurring.

217
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This means that the citric acid can, and sometimes actually does,

218
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
lose two or even three protons in an acid-base reaction.

219
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
When an acid can do this, we refer to it as a polyprotic acid,

220
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
since it has multiple acidic hydrogens.

221
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The conjugate bases, which still contain some acidic hydrogens,

222
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
have the very interesting property of being able to act either as an acid,

223
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
losing another proton,

224
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
or as a base, retrieving the proton that it had lost before.

225
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now, we call species like this, which can act as acids or bases, amphoteric.

226
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So, modeling the behavior of citric acid in a proton transfer reaction

227
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
is actually a bit more complex than I had originally led you to believe.

228
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
To be sure that we're modeling the behavior accurately,

229
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
we must consider the fact that it can undergo three separate acid associations.

230
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Citric acid to dihydrogen citrate, with a pKa of about 3.2.

231
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Dihydrogen citrate to hydrogen citrate, with a pKa of 4.8.

232
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And finally, hydrogen citrate to citrate ion, with a pKa of 6.4.

233
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Remember that in our original example today,

234
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
we used citric acid to neutralize an equal amount of methylamine,

235
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
producing methyl ammonium ion and dihydrogen citrate ion.

236
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But we now know that the resulting dihydrogen citrate ion can also react as an acid.

237
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Of course, it's a weaker acid than citric acid itself,

238
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
since it's already accumulated some negative charge as a result of the loss of its first proton.

239
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But since that dihydrogen citrate has a pKa,

240
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
just 1.6 units greater than citric acid,

241
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
we know that it can act as an acid about 50 times weaker.

242
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So mixing equal amounts of methylamine and citric acid

243
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
will actually produce a mixture of about 98% dihydrogen citrate ions

244
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and 2% hydrogen citrate ions.

245
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Now this means that our original assumption is probably pretty valid

246
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
when you're only adding an equal amount of methylamine.

247
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
After all, 98% is a pretty good number.

248
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Now, if we add another molar equivalent of methylamine, however,

249
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
for a total of two molar equivalents,

250
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
we can create a mixture which is nearly all hydrogen citrate.

251
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And the addition of a third molar equivalent will all but completely convert that into citrate.

252
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Now all this is true because the pKa of the methyl ammonium is somewhere around 11.

253
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's much higher than any of those three acids.

254
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So we can decompose the citric acid all the way down to citrate

255
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
using the proper amount of a strong enough base.

256
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So in truth, to neutralize one mole of methylamine,

257
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
we really only need to add one-third of a molar equivalent of citric acid

258
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
because that citric acid is polyprotic,

259
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
having three protons, all of which are acidic enough to react with the methylamine.

260
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Now, I'd like to talk to you about one more special type of proton transfer reaction

261
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
called tautomerization.

262
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Now, tautomers are defined as two neutral species which differ only by the position of a single proton.

263
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
An example of this is a compound with which we're familiar, acetone.

264
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Now, you may not think about the CH protons of acetone

265
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
as being very acidic,

266
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but they actually can be removed in small quantities by strong enough bases.

267
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And when this happens, the proton can be relocated to the oxygen atom,

268
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
creating a species where the proton has been moved,

269
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
so I'm going to have to put some charge units in here

270
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
because I've moved only the hydrogen nucleus up to that oxygen.

271
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Now, naturally, we can take a look at this and say to ourselves,

272
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
the acetone looks an awful lot more acidic than the proton.

273
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Naturally, we can take a look at this and say to ourselves,

274
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
the acetone looks an awful lot more stable.

275
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There's no charge separation,

276
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and the oxygen has two bonds instead of three.

277
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There are many things about this structure which make it look much more stable than this.

278
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But this species has got a card to play.

279
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It has an sp2 carbon separating those charges,

280
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
which means that it can relocate the pi electrons associated with the carbon-oxygen double bond

281
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
to create a new neutral species in which the proton still remains on the oxygen.

282
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So removing this rather unstable intermediate,

283
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I can see that I now have two essentially similar stability species which can exist.

284
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So the key to this is that sp2 carbon in the middle there.

285
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Now, when that's not available,

286
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
we can still have a proton transfer within a molecule,

287
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
but we create something different called a zwitterion.

288
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
A zwitterion is something that differs from the neutral species only by the relocation of a proton.

289
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But in this case, our zwitterion, like the amino acid glycine,

290
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
cannot attenuate that charge that is built up.

291
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So in the charged species, we now have an sp3 carbon in between,

292
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
which means that there is no way to move electrons from one site to the other

293
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
in an attempt to neutralize that charge.

294
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Now, even though that's true, this equilibrium does actually exist,

295
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and we do find glycine in its zwitterionic state,

296
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
zwitter being the German word for hybrid.

297
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The reason we find it in that state is that the pKa of a neutral carboxylic acid like this one

298
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
is somewhere around 4,

299
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:21,000
whereas that of the charged ammonium motif here is somewhere around 10 or 11.

300
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So it's just like a proton transfer between, say, citric acid and methyl ammonium,

301
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
except that they've been tied together by an sp3 carbon.

302
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So these are the two types of intramolecular proton transfers,

303
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
which we'll need to understand to navigate some of our future chemical reactions.

304
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So today we tackled the first of many reactions that we'll be studying over the course,

305
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
the proton transfer reaction.

306
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
We started by discussing the three classifications of acids and bases,

307
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
specifically the Arrhenius definition,

308
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
in which acids are proton donors and bases hydroxide donors.

309
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We looked at Bronsted-Lowry definition,

310
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
in which acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors.

311
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And finally at the Lewis definition,

312
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
which focuses on the electron accepting ability of acids

313
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and the electron donating ability of bases.

314
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We then turned our attention to the reaction between acids and bases,

315
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and how the pKa of competing acids can be used

316
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
to predict the outcome of a proton transfer reaction.

317
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Then we took a look at exactly what it is that makes one acid stronger than another.

318
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We discussed how the stability of the conjugate base is often the key

319
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
to predicting the acidity of a particular compound,

320
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and how distribution of charge usually goes hand in hand with that stability.

321
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Next we addressed polyprotic acids,

322
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
which have multiple acidic protons,

323
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and the formation of these amphoteric species,

324
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
which can act either as an acid or as a base.

325
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And finally we took a look at two kinds of intramolecular proton transfer reactions.

326
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We saw how in some molecules,

327
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
that intramolecular proton transfer can produce new neutral forms called tautomers.

328
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And in others it can generate charge separation,

329
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and we call those species zwitter ions.

330
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
In our next lecture,

331
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
we're going to turn our attention back to structures again,

332
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
discussing a fascinating and crucial concept in organic chemistry,

333
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the handedness of molecules.

334
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll see you then.
