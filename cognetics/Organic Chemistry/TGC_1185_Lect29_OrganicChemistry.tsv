0	19560	Viking sailors, as early as the first century BC, may have discovered a miraculous talisman
19560	22720	known as Sunstone.
22720	26760	Narratives about historical figures of that time suggest that this stone could be used
26760	31520	to locate the position of the Sun even on the cloudiest of days.
31520	35880	Whether or not such navigational techniques were used remains a bit of a debate among
35880	38560	archaeologists.
38560	42760	But there are those who believe that this apparently fictional and fantastic stone is
42760	48120	not myth, but historical reality.
48120	54760	They believe that it's this, a piece of Icelandic spar, also known as the mineral calcite.
55760	62640	Calcite is unusual among common minerals because of a property called birefringence.
62640	67920	Calcite has the ability to refract light at two different angles depending upon the orientation
67920	73560	of the electromagnetic waves making up the incident light.
73560	77360	Those waves oscillating perpendicular to the surface of the stone refract at an angle different
77360	83440	than the others, and this creates a second image when one looks through the stone.
83440	88120	This is a curious phenomenon, but what does it have to do with navigation, or for that
88120	92520	matter organic chemistry?
92520	96880	Scientists now know that light from the Sun which penetrates the Earth's atmosphere undergoes
96880	100040	a process known as scattering.
100040	104580	Scattering happens when light encounters small particles in the air.
104580	108000	Some familiar effects of this scattering are the blue color of the sky in the daytime and
108000	111320	the reddish and orange hues of sunset.
111320	118360	But a second effect, one which most of us are probably not familiar with, is polarization.
118360	122840	The scattering that goes on as the light enters the atmosphere causes light which reaches
122840	128720	the surface to have waves which are not randomly oriented, but rather are polarized or preferentially
128720	137800	oriented in a direction which points back to the source, in this case, the Sun.
137800	141860	A human eyes aren't capable of detecting the difference between polarized light coming
141860	146880	directly from the Sun and diffuse light coming from other directions.
146880	151960	But with its strong birefringent properties, calcite is.
151960	156120	By scanning the horizon looking through the stone and comparing the intensities of the
156120	162040	images one sees, a skilled navigator can pick out the direction of the Sun on even the most
162040	166000	overcast of days.
166000	170260	Now the notion that the ancient Norse sailors used this technique to navigate is a very
170260	175560	romantic tale, but the problem has been lack of direct evidence in the form of archaeological
175560	180720	samples of calcite from sites dating to 2000 years ago.
180720	184820	There are those who believe that the calcite sunstones were used by these people and simply
184820	190360	weathered away over the centuries erasing all direct evidence that they ever existed.
190360	194720	Others still believe that the stories are pure fiction.
194840	197320	It is certain, however, is this.
197320	202560	In 2002, a block of the mineral calcite was found in the wreckage of an Elizabethan ship
202560	204560	called the Alderney.
204560	208080	The Alderney sank in 1592.
208080	211840	Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the discovery is the fact that this stone was
211840	220280	found just a few feet from other navigational tools, a tantalizing find.
220280	225200	But another tantalizing observation was made by physicist Guy Ropar at the University of
225200	228200	Wren in 2013.
228200	234040	Ropar was able to demonstrate that when properly trained in its use, a group of everyday people
234040	239640	were able to determine the azimuth of the sun on a cloudy day to within one percent
239640	243760	of its true location.
243760	249240	If such a stone was ever used by the Vikings or Elizabethan sailors, one thing is certain.
249240	254600	By the eve of the Industrial Revolution, some 300 years after the sinking of the Alderney,
254600	258440	the technique seems to have been lost to the ages.
258440	264040	Now we owe its rediscovery in the early 1800s to a French soldier, engineer and physicist
264040	269840	Etienne Louis Malus.
269840	275640	In the wake of discoveries by Ritter and Herschel, Malus, as the story goes, had taken an interest
275640	280480	in optics and was contemplating the optical properties of minerals like that Esleinik
280480	284000	spark crystal I just showed you.
284000	290560	One day he was observing the beautiful properties of this material outside Luxembourg Palace.
290560	296080	Now what Malus noticed was that if he looked at various objects through the crystal, he
296080	302040	could see light of the same intensity regardless of how he rotated it.
302040	306960	But then he turned and faced the palace and again rotated the crystal, looking at the
306960	310880	light reflected by the palace's windows.
310880	316120	What he saw was remarkable that the intensity of the transmitted light changed as he rotated
316120	317440	the crystal.
317440	323320	Clearly, something about the process of reflecting sunlight was changing more than just the direction
323320	327080	of its propagation.
327080	333760	When nonpolarized light strikes a smooth surface, like a window at a very specific angle, and
333760	339020	this angle is also, by the way, specific to the material, now some of the light is reflected
339020	344200	from the surface, but some of it is also refracted through the surface.
344200	348880	When the reflected beam and the refracted beam are at a 90 degree angle to one another,
348880	354200	the reflected beam will be plane polarized with all of its constituent waves parallel
354200	357440	to the orientation of the surface.
357440	363160	And what Malus saw through his Icelandic spar sample was simply his crystal either allowing
363160	367920	that plane polarized light through when its edge was properly aligned or blocking it from
367920	371000	view when it was not.
371000	375280	So here is a sample of Icelandic spar or calcite.
375280	378360	And I have on the table in front of me a small image.
378360	383640	Now when I look at the image without my Icelandic spar, I see, of course, a single copy.
383680	390360	But placing the spar on top, I can see a very clear double image.
390360	395200	The source of the double image is the fact that light of different planes of polarization
395200	399760	is interplaying with the crystal in different ways, reflecting and reflecting, refracting
399760	402040	at different angles.
402040	406480	Now if there's any doubt about this, it can be easily proven using a modern polarizing
406480	409440	filter like the one I have here.
409440	415160	If I look down through this filter at my Icelandic spar at the image on the other side,
415160	420600	simply rotating my plane polarizing filter, I can make one image appear and the other
420600	427440	disappear and vice versa simply by changing the arrangement of the plane of polarization
427440	430160	which is allowed through.
435160	439080	This is the principle on which polarized sunglasses work.
439080	443960	Polarized lenses like the one I just used are made by creating long, carefully oriented
443960	450440	polymer molecules which are dyed to produce striations too small for the human eye to detect.
450440	454200	These striations give the coating a polarizing effect.
454200	458320	The coating is oriented on lenses so that it preferentially absorbs light which is plane
458320	461320	polarized parallel to the ground.
461320	466040	In other words, it reduces the amount of road or ground glare you experience in your car
466040	467120	or on the ski slopes.
470080	475200	So we've seen how plane polarized light can be generated by passing light through polarizing
475200	481240	media like the Earth's atmosphere or reflecting it from a flat surface.
481240	486560	We've also seen how it can be detected by turning a second polarizer to either block
486560	490960	or allow the plane polarized light to pass through.
490960	494480	But we're missing one last critical piece of the puzzle.
494480	499000	How does plane polarized light interact with organic samples?
499000	504000	What critical questions can we answer with plane polarized light that we couldn't answer
504000	505000	otherwise?
505000	511760	Well, our tour of optical spectroscopy techniques has taken us through UV visible spectroscopy
511760	517640	which can be used to monitor energy difference in molecular orbital systems and IR spectroscopy
517640	521880	which allows us to detect the presence of functional groups and also to fingerprint
521880	528120	organic molecules using the distinctive signature vibrations of their carbon skeleton.
528120	534480	So we have the tools to probe certain structural features of molecules with light.
534480	538800	But we have not yet addressed the question of chirality.
538800	544280	Of course, we know by now that chirality is a critical property of many organic molecules.
544280	549780	From drugs like thalidomide to the proteins in your body, the profound importance of molecular
549780	555160	handedness has been a focal point in many of our lectures.
555160	560160	We've discussed how Chris Engel had a prolific run at characterizing the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms
560160	565800	in the late 1920s, helping chemists to develop strategies to design syntheses which lead
565800	569760	to products with a desired stereochemistry.
569760	574840	But so far, we've not covered how Engel could distinguish between the two different enantiomers
574840	579480	and determine their relative populations in an otherwise pure sample.
579480	584720	The UV visible and infrared spectra of R and S-thalidomide, for example, are expected
584720	587800	to look exactly the same.
587800	593520	Of course, determining whether a product is an anti-opure or racemic or anywhere in between
593520	602040	for that matter can be critical to our understanding of the mechanism which formed it.
602040	607120	The key to determining the relative abundance of two enantiomers in an otherwise pure sample
607120	613360	is a technique called polarimetry, which relies on one very interesting property of chiral
613360	615040	molecules.
615040	621760	They have the ability to rotate the plane of polarization in polarized light.
621760	628280	Now, a modern polarimiter conducts an experiment not terribly different than the one conducted
628280	632680	by Malus two hundred years ago in France, although the parts are much smaller and the
632680	636400	lamp life is less than ten billion years like the sun.
636400	642480	Malus used the sun as a source of light, the windows of the palace as a polarizer, a crystal
642480	648920	of Icelandic spar as the second polarizer, and his own eyes as the detector.
648920	654720	So the goal in our experiment is going to be to first create plane polarized light and
654720	659200	then to determine or verify the plane of its polarization.
659200	665560	And to do so, all we need is two pieces of polarizing media and a light beam.
665560	670600	Now these are modern polarizing media, they're filters that can be used just like the coating
670600	672920	of sunglasses, for example.
672920	676240	So if I hold one of these up, you can still see through it pretty well.
676240	678480	I'm still there, right?
678480	683280	But the light that was going through this polarizing filter was exiting with only one plane of
683280	687720	polarization, although of course the camera couldn't tell.
687720	691080	So in order to tell that I've plane polarized the light that's moving through my filter
691080	695440	from my face, I can use a second polarizer.
695440	701480	See if I align them parallel to one another, the image makes it to the other side.
701480	709040	But if instead I align them perpendicular, the light can't traverse the second polarizer.
709040	714960	So if I want to know the plane of polarization, I have to rotate my second polarizer until
714960	717560	it is properly aligned with the first.
717560	724360	This gives me a way to actually measure and detect the plane of polarization of polarized
724360	725760	light.
725760	732320	Now a modern polarimeter would use some type of a source lamp rather than the sun.
732320	736680	Frequently we use sodium lamps because they create just several different wavelengths of
736680	738480	light themselves.
738480	743760	Nonetheless, for our polarimetry experiment, we want only one wavelength of light to get
743760	747200	into our experimental sample compartment.
747200	750640	So we'll place a monochromator after the lamp.
750640	755640	Now in our case we're going to use our monochromator to isolate just one wavelength of light known
755640	759960	as the sodium D-line, 589 nanometers.
759960	766280	Alright now after this I'm going to place a polarizer in line after the monochromator.
766280	772200	The polarizer, much like the windows of the palace, ensures that only one plane of polarization
772200	775000	makes it into my sample compartment.
775000	783200	So at this point we have plane polarized light of a single wavelength and countering a sample.
783200	791120	The path of the beam finally passes through a second polarizer on its way to a detector.
791120	796280	So if there's no change in the orientation of the plane of polarization, the rotational
796280	803400	position of the second polarizer will have to be exactly the same as the first polarizer
803480	807760	to maximize the amount of light reaching the detector.
807760	812680	So if we were to rotate the second polarizer, when the flash of light is observed by the
812680	821680	detector, we know that the plane of polarization of light exiting the spectrometer can be measured.
821680	830280	Now, small organic molecules in solution aren't aligned like polymer strands in sunglasses
830280	831780	though.
831780	836900	Instead they tumble and move randomly, so they do not preferentially absorb plane polarized
836900	839300	light like a pair of sunglasses.
839300	844700	They do however interact with plane polarized light in a different way.
844700	851400	See chiral molecules have the very interesting ability to rotate plane polarized light.
851400	856580	As a plane polarized light beam of a specific wavelength passes through a chiral sample,
856580	862260	the plane of polarization rotates so that when the beam exits the sample, the plane
862260	866380	of polarization has a new orientation.
866380	870820	So let's go back to the polarimeter.
870820	875740	So here we have my operating polarimeter where my lamp monochromator and polarizer generate
875740	882180	my monochromatic plane polarized light which traverse an empty compartment and exit through
882180	887820	another polarizer which is oriented in exactly the same angle as the first, so my detector
887820	893100	is firing away letting me know that the plane polarized light is getting through.
893100	895740	Now let's place a sample in our polarimeter.
895740	900500	Now placing a sample inside my polarimeter means that the beam will rotate, the plane
900500	904260	of polarization, now the beam itself is still going straight, but the plane of polarization
904260	906600	of my beam is rotating.
906600	912160	That means that my instrument has to rotate the second polarizer to let the exiting light
912160	915320	get through and reach the detector.
915320	920000	So my instrument has rotated that second polarizer until the detector sees a maximum intensity
920000	922280	of light.
922280	926840	We call the angle between the initial and final planes of polarization alpha.
926840	930500	This is the measured optical rotation and it's very simply measured by taking the first
930500	938240	polarizer and the second polarizer and comparing the angle in between the two.
938240	944220	We call this ability of chiral molecules to rotate plane polarized light optical activity
944220	949100	and just as the ability to absorb light is an intrinsic property of a compound, so is
949100	951560	its optical activity.
951560	955860	This is to say that a given chiral compound rotates a certain wavelength of light by a
955860	958900	known and constant amount.
958900	965020	We call this the specific rotation of a compound and usually label it as a bracketed alpha
965020	969740	with 20 and d annotations indicating that we're talking about the specific rotation
969740	975660	of a compound at 20 degrees centigrade and in reference to that sodium d emission line
975660	980540	which is 589 nanometers.
980540	984860	So our observations so far lead us to derive an equation which is very similar to Beer's
984860	986420	law.
986420	991460	Just as absorbance is equal to the extinction coefficient times the path length times the
991460	997820	concentration in Beer's law, so rotation of an enantiopure sample is equal to its specific
997820	1003140	rotation times the path length times concentration.
1003140	1010260	So if I have a solution of 1 gram of enantiopure R-camper dissolved in 1 milliliter of solvent
1010260	1017300	in a 1 decimeter cell, knowing camper's specific rotation of 44.4 degrees per gram per mill
1017300	1025580	decimeter allows me to calculate that I should see a rotation of 44 degrees clockwise.
1025580	1027080	Fantastic.
1027080	1029980	So let's say that I do just that with a pure sample of camphor.
1029980	1037140	I place the sample in the polarimeter, I collect my reading and the rotation is only 22 degrees.
1037140	1038860	So what just happened here?
1038860	1044900	I have pure camphor, but the observed rotation is less than the calculated rotation.
1044900	1051020	Well what's going on here is that there's another form of camphor, the Esenantiomer,
1051020	1056780	which rotates plain polarized light with equal efficiency but in the opposite direction because
1056780	1060180	of its handedness.
1060180	1063460	So this is where polarimetry deviates from Beer's law.
1063460	1068620	You see in UV visible spectroscopy, there are no anti-absorbers which re-emit light
1068620	1074860	absorbed by their counterparts thus cancelling them out, but in polarimetry there is such
1074860	1078940	a counterpart, the other enantiomer of the compound.
1078940	1085440	So for every degree that our camphor molecule rotates plain polarized D-line light and S-camphor
1085440	1093260	rotates it back to the opposite direction to the same extent undoing that rotation.
1093260	1098540	This explains why a pure sample of camphor may rotate plain polarized light less than
1098540	1100260	expected.
1100260	1105580	We have to include a term in our equation which accounts for the opposing rotation of
1105580	1108540	the minor enantiomer.
1108540	1114300	Now both terms of the equation share the same optical rotation and path length.
1114300	1119040	So we can separate these algebraically and arrive at an equation which works for samples
1119040	1125200	of a compound which aren't enantiopure.
1125200	1130600	Here we have observed rotation equal to the specific rotation of the compound times the
1130600	1137960	path length times the difference in concentrations between R and S enantiomers.
1137960	1143200	This difference is also called the enantiomeric excess.
1143200	1147460	Journal articles covering chiral synthesis will always include a measure of the enantiomeric
1147460	1154020	excess of the desired chiral product reported as a percentage simply calculated by dividing
1154020	1161960	the observed rotation by the calculated rotation and multiplying by 100%.
1161960	1167320	Now it's worth pausing here to note that the enantiomeric excess of one stereoisomer
1167320	1171420	is not the same as its total abundance in the sample.
1171420	1176180	In our sample we had an observed rotation of 22 degrees and a calculated rotation of
1176180	1178200	44 degrees.
1178200	1187060	This makes the enantiomeric excess or EE of the R camphor in our sample 50%.
1187060	1194240	But the total amount of R camphor in our sample is that excess plus half of the remainder
1194240	1198840	since the remaining 50% of our sample were molecules of camphor which were canceling
1198840	1201180	one another out.
1201180	1208380	So the total abundance of the R enantiomer is 50% plus one half of the remaining 50%
1208380	1212880	for a total of 75% R enantiomer.
1212880	1216620	Now in general when organic chemists report their results in an article it's assumed
1216620	1220960	that the reader can conduct this manipulation on their own so we usually see just a report
1220960	1226800	of EE and not one of total abundance.
1226800	1231860	The technique of polarimetry had early and profound influence on the link between chirality
1231860	1234640	and biological systems.
1234640	1241240	Louis Pasteur famously used this technique in 1848 to analyze tartaric acid salt crystals
1241240	1244280	isolated from wine.
1244280	1249320	Pasteur's experiments showed very clearly that biologically sourced tartaric acid had
1249320	1252740	the ability to rotate plain polarized light.
1252740	1258540	But tartaric acid synthesized in the laboratory did not.
1258540	1263140	So in fact what was going on here was the term racemic was coined this way because it
1263140	1267300	refers to an equal mixture of enantiomers and it's derived from the Latin for bunch
1267300	1272860	of grapes because of this observation, a testament to the role of tartaric acid in our understanding
1272860	1276740	of chirality.
1276740	1282240	This lack of optical activity was a conundrum which led Pasteur to take a very, very close
1282240	1286620	look at synthetic tartaric acid.
1286620	1293700	When he did he noticed that carefully crystallized tartaric acid actually forms two different
1293700	1296660	shapes of crystals.
1296660	1301540	It was only when he painstakingly separated these crystals into two different groups by
1301540	1309480	hand that he could recover the optical activity of tartaric acid.
1309480	1312940	Examples of one shape could be combined to produce the optical activity of the tartrates
1312940	1317660	recovered from wine production and the other, quite interestingly, though not surprising
1317660	1322020	to us now, showed equal and opposite activity.
1322020	1326020	So this may be the very first example of a chiral separation.
1326020	1330900	Fortunately, we have better methods today than tweezers and careful observation that
1330900	1333140	Pasteur had to use.
1333140	1338580	But all of these methods find their origins in Pasteur's realization that the same compound
1338580	1347600	can have two equal but opposite, optically active forms or enantiomers.
1347600	1352720	But polarimetry has contributed even more to our understanding of organic reactions.
1352720	1357520	One classic example of this is the work of Saul Winston, a Canadian chemist with a deep
1357520	1360400	interest in carbocation.
1360400	1364840	Winston spent much of his career investigating situations in which this familiar reaction
1364840	1371020	intermediate seemed to act in ways that it shouldn't.
1371020	1375740	One of these situations takes place in certain SN1 reactions.
1375740	1381940	Winston used polarimetry to recognize that not all SN1 reactions proceeded with a total
1381940	1387780	loss of stereochemistry, even though most of them in fact do.
1387780	1393660	Winston was able to show, using polarimetry, that the same SN1 solvalysis reaction run
1393660	1398960	on a chiral substrate in solvents of differing polarity not only proceeds at differing rates
1398960	1402520	but with differing degrees of racemization.
1402520	1407200	This is to say that a chiral substrate might produce a racemic product when reacted in
1407200	1413240	higher polarity solvents, but with maybe a 50% EE when run in lower polarity environments
1413240	1418000	in which a carbocation ion would be less stable.
1418000	1424700	This led Winston to theorize the existence of concerted ion pairs in certain reactions,
1424700	1429860	in which positively charged carbocation ions and negatively charged leaving groups still
1429860	1437180	form but stay close to one another in what he called an intimate ion pair.
1437180	1443380	So if a nucleophile attacks before the ion pair fully separates in space, the leaving
1443380	1449320	group, though detached, can still block the face of the carbocation from which it came.
1449320	1454720	Now this explains the lack of total racemization in a reaction showing SN1 kinetics, and it
1454720	1460480	changed our way of thinking about the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms.
1460480	1465560	See thanks to Winston's work and the technique of polarimetry, we realize now that nucleophilic
1465560	1473360	substitution mechanisms are not necessarily an idealized SN1 or SN2, but rather a continuous
1473540	1480060	continuum of mechanisms ranging from the classical SN1 with total racemization through SN1 involving
1480060	1486500	ion pairs and having partial conservation of chirality to classical SN2 with complete retention
1486500	1490500	of chirality.
1490500	1493220	So let's review what we've covered today.
1493220	1498540	We started with a bit of history, discussing how Etienne-Louis-Malus is often credited for
1498560	1503640	first observing plane polarization of light from the sun using a palace window and a piece
1503640	1509120	of Icelandic spar as polarizers, although Viking navigators may have actually beaten
1509120	1514360	him to it by about 2,000 years.
1514360	1520160	We saw how modern polarimeters operate on the same basic principles as in Malus's experiment,
1520160	1526120	but the wavelength and plane polarization of the analytical beam are more controlled.
1526120	1531660	We investigated the ability of chiral molecules to rotate plane polarized light, and we saw
1531660	1538260	how their specific rotation is equal and opposite for two enantiomers of the same compound.
1538260	1543020	It's this equal and opposite relationship which allows us to observe the optical rotation
1543020	1548460	in an otherwise pure sample, comparing it to the calculated optical rotation of the sample
1548460	1553460	to determine the enantiomeric axis, remembering that the enantiomeric axis is not the same
1553460	1556440	as total abundance.
1556440	1562760	Finally, we took a look at the work of Louis Pasteur and Saul Winsteyn, two scientists
1562760	1568440	separated by a century, but both of whom were able to draw critical inferences about chirality
1568440	1575440	in organic compounds by observing the interaction of plane polarized light with those compounds.
1578000	1582120	Next time, we will move to yet another region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
1582620	1587700	We're going to take a look at the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance, and how tiny
1587700	1594180	atom-sized magnets in organic molecules interact with radio waves, and one another, to produce
1594180	1599260	an effect which has become one of the gold standard identification tools of modern organic
1599260	1600260	chemistry.
1600260	1601260	I'll see you then.
