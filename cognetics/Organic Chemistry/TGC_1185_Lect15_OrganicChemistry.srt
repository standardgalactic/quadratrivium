00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Ben Franklin is purported to have once penned that beer is the best evidence we have that

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,640
there is a God that he loves us and wants us to be happy.

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,040
The accuracy of this quote is disputed by historians, but its sentiment is one which

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,200
most of us probably share during a night of celebration with friends.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,720
So we've already taken a brief look at the structure, properties, and reactivities of

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
ethanol.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,880
This is one of the key components of that delightful concoction.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,200
Then, the next morning arrives.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,000
And those of us who took the most extreme advantage of old Ben's good-hearted observation

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,960
might wake to a headache, sensitivity to light, fatigue, and a general sense that maybe Dr.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,760
Franklin led us a bit astray.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,240
Of course, I'm talking about hangovers, the general sense of awfulness that comes along

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,880
with the buildup of metabolites of the very compound we enjoyed so much the night before.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,240
We're now familiar with the structure of ethanol, also known as beverage alcohol.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,200
And we're aware of the presence of an sp3 hybridized oxygen that it bears in the form

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,920
of a hydroxyl group.

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,880
But enzymes in the liver convert ethanol into a new organic compound, actually several

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,040
of them, which are easier to remove from the human body, but some of which have a significantly

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,080
less pleasant effect on your mood.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,920
Today we're going to be taking a closer look at at least one of the chemicals which participate

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,920
in this rite of passage for beer enthusiasts and wine lovers alike.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,560
Now we will not concern ourselves so much with the biological pathways to these products

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,640
which occur in vivo, meaning in living organisms.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,840
But rather we're going to take more of a look at how organic chemists imitate this chemistry

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,840
in a beaker, an environment which we commonly refer to as in vitro, meaning in glass.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,520
But before we can discuss the details of their synthesis and reactivity, we must first familiarize

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
ourselves with their structure.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Last time we investigated the structure, synthesis and reactivity of alcohols and ethers, which

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,440
have an sp3 hybridized oxygen, which is single bonded to a carbon and one other atom, either

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,920
hydrogen to form an alcohol or carbon to form an ether.

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,320
Today we will look at a different class of oxygen containing compounds known as aldehydes

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,280
and ketones, those in which we still have only one oxygen atom, but it's sp2 hybridized,

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,280
meaning that it's double bonded to just one carbon atom.

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,680
So let's have a look at just the sp2 part of this type of motif here.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,140
So right now what's connected to this carbon is really not of consequence.

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,720
What's important is to look at the oxygen and carbon and how they've been connected

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,880
to one another.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,320
Remember that in our alcohols and ethers, the oxygen had two single bonds, but here

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,580
there's a double bond between the oxygen and the carbon.

40
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,560
This means that both the oxygen and carbon must have an sp2 hybridization state, and

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,480
even more importantly that there's a pi bond.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,120
So if I rotate this molecule so that we can see the bond and on, you can clearly see the

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,680
sigma bond containing electron density in between the two atoms, but also the presence

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,400
of a pi bond, which gives electron density above and below that bond.

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,280
And that's going to be crucial to not only the physical, but also the chemical properties

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,480
of this type of compound.

47
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,800
So let's have a look at some very simple carbonyl containing compounds.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Let's start with formaldehyde.

49
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,200
This is the simplest possible carbonyl containing compound with a carbon oxygen double bond

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,640
and bond angles of 120 degrees all the way around this carbon, right?

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,960
That's what we would expect for an sp2 hybridized atom.

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,760
The next most complex is acetaldehyde, in which we've added a methyl group to the carbon

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
which is attached to our sp2 oxygen.

54
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,520
This has a formula C2H4O.

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,600
We can get even larger by adding a methyl group to the other side and create something

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,400
called acetone, compound with which we're all very familiar.

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,720
And I can continue extending these alkyl chains if I'd like, creating, for example, methylethylketone,

58
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,440
which is a common solvent used in adhesives.

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,400
Now all of these share one structural feature in common.

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,960
That is the carbonyl group, an sp2 carbon double bonded to an sp2 oxygen.

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,040
I've highlighted those here so you can see them well.

62
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,440
Some of them have hydrogens attached to those sp2 carbons.

63
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,360
When they have these, we call those hydrogens aldehyde hydrogens.

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
But there are others which don't contain this particular type of hydrogen.

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,280
They contain carbons that are bonded directly to the sp2 carbon only.

66
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,440
This location is called an alpha carbon.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,640
So you can already see where we're going to draw a distinction here.

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,880
Those carbonyls with which have aldehyde hydrogens tend to get the name aldehyde.

69
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,280
And those which have only alpha carbons attached to the carbonyl carbon tend to get names

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,080
that end in OWN.

71
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,760
These are ketones.

72
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,440
From an IUPAC nomenclature perspective, we treat both aldehydes and ketones as functional

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,720
groups because as we'll see soon, they're very reactive.

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,320
So in this example, I have to choose a parent chain which contains the carbon which is double

75
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,760
bonded to the oxygen making up the carbonyl group.

76
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,320
So this is a butanal molecule.

77
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,120
The AL suffix lets me know that I'm dealing with an aldehyde.

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,000
In other words, a carbonyl which has at least one hydrogen attached to its carbon.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,760
My butanal has a methyl substituent.

80
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,840
So now all I have to do is label my chain in such a way that the functional group,

81
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,080
which is highest priority, gets the lowest possible number.

82
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,160
So clearly, my best choice is to label it in this way.

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,000
If I label the other way, my butanal functional group ends up with a number 4 instead of 1.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,760
So I'm going to choose the top numbering scheme.

85
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,760
And this would make the name of my compound 3-methyl 1 butanal, except that we often don't

86
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,280
see the 1.

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,000
And the reason for that, of course, is that aldehydes by definition have to end the carbon

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
chain because one of their bonded partners must be a hydrogen.

89
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
So to say 1 butanal is a little bit redundant.

90
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,320
Now in the case of ketones, I'm going to follow the same protocol.

91
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,440
Let's name this ketone.

92
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,760
I'll choose my parent hydrocarbon, the longest possible one which contains the carbon which

93
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,840
is part of my group.

94
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,200
So there's my functional group at the second carbon in making this a pentanone.

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,440
So I'll look at my prefixes.

96
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I'll have a chloro because I've got a chlorine which is also attached to the parent hydrocarbon.

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,800
Now I give my addresses to these in such a way that the ketone functional group gets

98
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,600
the lowest possible number, meaning that when I construct my name, I'll have a 4-chloro

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,080
to pentanone.

100
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,960
So now that we know a little bit about naming and identifying these ketones and aldehydes,

101
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,960
let's take a look at their physical properties and what the introduction of this carbonyl

102
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,400
bond really does for them.

103
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,800
We'll start with an aldehyde, a very simple one like this propanal molecule.

104
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,960
The propanal molecule has a carbon-oxygen double bond which creates a dipole, the positive

105
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,600
end of the dipole at the carbonyl carbon, the negative end of the dipole at the carbonyl

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,800
oxygen.

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,720
This means that it's going to have an electronegative oxygen with freelone pairs which can act as

108
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,480
a hydrogen bond acceptor, in other words it can hydrogen bond with other compounds which

109
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,520
have OH, NH, and FH motifs in their functional group.

110
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,640
But the propanal itself doesn't have such a bond, which means that it can't hydrogen

111
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,120
bond to other propanal molecules.

112
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,540
So this is not an H bond donor, only an H bond acceptor.

113
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,940
When we turn our attention to ketones, we see, for example, in propanone, the exact

114
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,660
same issue.

115
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,940
We have a carbon-oxygen double bond with the positive dipole at the carbon, the negative

116
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,260
dipole at the oxygen, and again we have lone pairs which can participate in H bonding with

117
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,260
other types of molecules, but they can't hydrogen bond to themselves because they don't have

118
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,300
the requisite OH, NH, or FH bond.

119
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,420
So when we look at the boiling points of these compounds, we see something very different

120
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,220
than we saw with the alcohols and ethers because neither of them can hydrogen bond well.

121
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,740
Their boiling points are actually quite similar to one another.

122
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,140
Recall that in the case of ethanol and dimethyl ether, that the boiling points differed by

123
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,500
about 100 degrees centigrade.

124
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,580
So in this case, we can see a very clear manifestation of the fact that neither of these two can

125
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,580
hydrogen bond to themselves.

126
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,780
In addition to being polar, these compounds are also amphoteric.

127
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,380
We can see this by looking at a molecule of, this is acid aldehyde, if we take a look at

128
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,820
its conjugate acid, we can protonate that oxygen from the carbonyl and create a resonance

129
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,620
stabilized conjugate acid.

130
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,100
Now it's not terribly stable, as you can see, the pKa is negative 7, so it's very acidic,

131
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,260
but it can form, and it does have the effect of increasing the positive charge density

132
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,780
around the carbonyl carbon.

133
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,300
This will be very important when we get to reactivity.

134
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,900
Similarly, carbonyl compounds can act as acids, but they don't lose the protein that you might

135
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,180
think they do.

136
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,380
Even in the case of aldehydes, the hydrogen attached to the sp2 carbon is not the most

137
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
acidic carbon.

138
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,620
In fact, the one that's removed most frequently is the adjacent alpha carbon, and the explanation

139
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,980
for this is that it forms not only what we call a carbanion, which puts some negative

140
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,780
charge density down here at the site of its removal, but it also creates a new resonance

141
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,500
contributor called an enolate, where that negative charge is up on what was the carbonyl oxygen,

142
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,860
and this provides a lot of stabilization to the conjugate base and results in a pKa of

143
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,980
about 20 for compounds like these.

144
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,860
Okay, so carbonyl compounds are named differently, they have different hydrogen bonding behavior,

145
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,820
and they're amphoteric with slightly different pKa values than alcohols.

146
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,140
But what really distinguishes the carbonyl motif from alcohols and ethers, and gives

147
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,860
them such different reactivity, is the presence of that pi bond.

148
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,220
So I'm going to take this motif and show it to you one more time on its side, and we're

149
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,300
going to see exactly why and how these bonds react the way they do.

150
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,380
Let's try formaldehyde, the simplest possible carbonyl-containing compound.

151
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,060
We're all familiar with formaldehyde, and especially its primary application, which

152
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,500
is a biological preservative, or we call it a fixative.

153
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,580
But this is not the form of the molecule that actually performs that fixation.

154
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,500
Formaldehyde, as I've drawn it here, does not react with proteins, it does not fix them

155
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,500
in place, and it does not preserve animal tissue in that way.

156
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,180
So what's going on here?

157
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,620
Let's turn it on its side.

158
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,620
So again, here are the regions of space where I expect the electrons involved in my pi

159
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,100
bond to be.

160
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,460
But there's another region of space that I'm concerned with.

161
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,300
It's the area that new incoming electrons have to reach in order to create a new bond

162
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,620
to the carbonyl carbon, and break the pi bond to the carbonyl oxygen.

163
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,340
That region of space looks like this, and it's called an antibonding orbital.

164
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,060
So in order to populate that antibonding orbital, an incoming nucleophile doesn't come from

165
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,580
the backside directly, as we would expect in a traditional nucleophilic substitution.

166
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,660
Instead, it comes in from above and below and slightly behind.

167
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,780
So let's try to represent the reaction of formaldehyde with water, and a little bit

168
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,740
of hydroxide, which is naturally present in the water, and see if we can make its actual

169
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,780
functional form that serves as a biological fixative.

170
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,260
Again, here's my molecule of formaldehyde, but now I'm going to put it in water, which

171
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,140
naturally contains a small amount of hydroxide.

172
00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:00,420
Now that hydroxide can act as a nucleophile, and it's going to attack my carbonyl carbon

173
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
like so.

174
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,860
Now I've highlighted my two different oxygens so we can keep track of them, but they're

175
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,540
actually still just ordinary run-of-the-mill oxygen atoms.

176
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,180
So as that attack takes place, not only do I form a new sigma bond, but I also break

177
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,740
the original pi bond from the carbonyl.

178
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,380
So I've created this negatively charged species in the presence of water.

179
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
This looks awfully basic, doesn't it?

180
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,700
And water, as we all know, is a weak acid.

181
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,980
So the water will very quickly transfer a proton and give me a new kind of molecule.

182
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,300
This is called methylene glycol.

183
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,460
It's methylene glycol that reacts with the tissues and animal samples to preserve them.

184
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,140
Interesting, isn't it?

185
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,620
We say formaldehyde is a great preservative, but in truth, the equilibrium constant for

186
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,340
this interconversion is about 40, meaning that in any given aqueous solution of formaldehyde,

187
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,140
somewhere around 98% of it is in this state as methylene glycol.

188
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,820
So a solution of formaldehyde in water really isn't a solution of formaldehyde at all.

189
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,980
It's actually a solution primarily of methylene glycol.

190
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,740
This is a good thing because it's the solution of methylene glycol, called formalin, which

191
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,380
has the desired preservative properties.

192
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,420
In the crucial reaction, it's the hydroxyls of methylene glycol, which are removed to

193
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,500
produce two molecules of water and a new link to nitrogen atoms found in proteins that make

194
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,260
up the tissues of biological samples.

195
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,420
Two hydroxyls means two links, and this crosslinking of proteins, which blocks them in place, preserving

196
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,140
the tissue in all the fats, carbohydrates, and other biologic molecules entombed inside

197
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,220
the matrix of the protein.

198
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,940
No hydroxyl groups, no crosslinks, but it all starts with the addition of formaldehyde

199
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,020
to a preservative solution.

200
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,700
In light of this, it's clear why formaldehyde is the go-to carbonyl compound for this purpose.

201
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,580
First it's the smallest possible molecule with a desired chemistry, helping it find

202
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:06,220
its way into those interstitial spaces within and between proteins in a biological sample.

203
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,140
But before we head any further into reactions involving ketones and aldehydes, let's first

204
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,900
take a look at a few ways to make them.

205
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,420
Aldehydes and ketones can be produced by a number of synthetic routes, some of which

206
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,220
we're ready to investigate, and others of which are going to require a little more foundation.

207
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,900
Now for today, let's concentrate on emulating the chemistry that goes on in your body as

208
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,740
you sleep off that night of fun.

209
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,660
In your body, ethanol is recognized by your liver as a toxin.

210
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,900
Whether or not your brain agrees, as soon as the ethanol hits your bloodstream, enzymes

211
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,980
in your liver go to work preparing to eliminate it from your system.

212
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,180
Now in order to attenuate the neurotoxic effects of the ethanol and prepare it for removal,

213
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,100
an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase converts the offending intoxicant into a more

214
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,580
oxidized state, that of acid aldehyde.

215
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,100
The process of enzymatic oxidation is complex and involves the assistance of large, complicated

216
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,380
biomolecules, but it essentially consists of the removal of the hydroxyl proton and one

217
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,540
of its neighbors, thereby producing a double bond between the carbon and oxygen.

218
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,980
Essentially this is an oxidative elimination reaction.

219
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,660
We call it oxidation because the central carbon is gaining additional attachment to

220
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,580
oxygen atoms, in this case trading a single bond to oxygen for a double bond.

221
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,460
The product aldehyde is eventually metabolized further as the process continues, but in the

222
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,340
meantime it interferes with mitochondrial activity, liver function, and a host of other

223
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,500
biological mechanisms contributing to the condition which we colloquially refer to as

224
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,780
a hangover.

225
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,100
In the laboratory, ketones and aldehydes can be produced using various oxidizing agents

226
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,900
which accomplish the very same task that the alcohol dehydrogenase does in your body.

227
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,060
A classic example of this technique is the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone

228
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,260
using chromic acid.

229
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,740
In this multi-step reaction, the secondary alcohol is substituted for one of the OH groups

230
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,420
on the chromic acid, creating a compound known as a chromate ester.

231
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,540
This mechanism depends on the presence of an alpha hydrogen on the starting material.

232
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,860
A secondary alcohol has only one of these, so this oxidation can only take place once,

233
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,900
ending at the ketone stage in which the carbonyl carbon has no more hydrogens to give up.

234
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,780
In the case of primary alcohols, however, two oxidations can occur, leading not to the

235
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,060
desired aldehyde, but rather to a more oxidized compound called carboxylic acid.

236
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:48,340
So how do we stop the oxidation at that desired point if that's what we want to do?

237
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,820
Well the key to stopping the oxidation selectively at the aldehyde stage is in remembering that

238
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,940
aldehydes and aqueous solution tend to form reactive hydrates, those geminal dials like

239
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,260
we saw in the case of formaldehyde.

240
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,260
So to achieve our goal, we have to substitute a different oxidizing agent which is soluble

241
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,980
in an organic solvent so we remove water from the process.

242
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,280
Pyridinium chlorochromate is one reagent which proves very useful in the oxidation of primary

243
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,420
alcohols to aldehydes in particular because of its solubility in solvents like methylene

244
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,420
chloride which are anhydrous.

245
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:30,940
So this reaction with PCC, Pyridinium chlorochromate, is actually the organic chemistry equivalent

246
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,300
of the biological effects of this.

247
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,300
This is the drug dysulfiram, more commonly known by its trade name, Antibus.

248
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,980
Now, Antibus is often prescribed to discourage alcohol abuse in alcoholic patients and it

249
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,500
does so by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, that enzyme which continues the process of

250
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,700
oxidatively breaking down the alcohol metabolite acid aldehyde into more manageable and far

251
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,140
less toxic acetic acid.

252
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,820
So this would be our small molecule version of shutting down that system.

253
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,220
Now, Antibus binds to and shuts down enzymes in the liver which further oxidize acid aldehyde

254
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,420
and move it along that natural process of removal.

255
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:20,140
So stopping the oxidation process for ethanol at the aldehyde step like this causes an unusually

256
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,380
high level of acid aldehyde to build up in a patient's bloodstream which in turn causes

257
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,300
what could best be described as a super hangover.

258
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,780
PCC simply accomplishes the same effect on the lab bench.

259
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,900
The difference is that it does so by preventing aldehyde hydrate formation instead of enzyme

260
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
inhibition.

261
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,580
It can be done not only for ethanol, but for practically any primary alcohol starting

262
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,700
material that we can imagine.

263
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,380
That's important for a chemist to always be cognizant of reversibility in chemical reactions,

264
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,980
which is to say that today's starting materials may be tomorrow's products and vice versa.

265
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,060
Today it might be our goal to produce an aldehyde from a primary alcohol or a ketone from a

266
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,020
secondary alcohol by oxidation.

267
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,740
But if I can do that, then there's almost certainly a way to somehow produce the alcohols

268
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,460
from the associated carbonyl compounds.

269
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,180
So let's begin our discussion on the reactivity of these compounds in that spirit.

270
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,060
Since we oxidized alcohol to form acid aldehyde previously today, we should be able to find

271
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,300
a way to reduce the acid aldehyde back.

272
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,500
That's right, catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyls leads to an addition product which

273
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,380
hydrogen gas is added across the carbonyl double bond.

274
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,900
So the mechanism is completely analogous to hydrogenation of alkenes.

275
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,220
And this method is often chosen in industrial settings where gas handling equipment is available

276
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,740
and inexpensive hydrogen gas offsets the cost of the equipment.

277
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,180
But in the laboratory, where we usually want to perform reactions on smaller scale, we

278
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,820
often turn to the use of hydride reagents.

279
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,340
Both sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride can accomplish this modification when

280
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,740
added to a ketone or aldehyde in protic solvent.

281
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:14,380
You see, the boron or aluminum in these reagents are both extremely electropositive and they

282
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,020
make bonded hydrogens act more like hydride ions.

283
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,560
These hydride ions are very nucleophilic and will attack the carbonyl very efficiently.

284
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,580
The resulting alkoxide simply removes a proton from the solvent to become the neutral alcohol

285
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,980
product.

286
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,680
Just as with alcohols, aldehydes and ketones are amphiprotic or amphoteric.

287
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,180
So we have to consider the possibility that ketones and aldehydes might act as nucleophiles

288
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,500
or electrophiles depending on their pH environment.

289
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,460
Again, just like alcohols, compounds containing carbonyl groups are prone to reactions under

290
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,580
conditions of extreme pH, either high or low.

291
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,980
When placed in a basic environment, deprotonation of an alpha carbon can form a resonance stabilized

292
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,220
enolate nucleophile.

293
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,720
The removal of the alpha proton produces a carbanion, but one which can easily be drawn

294
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,300
with its charge delocalized onto the oxygen atom of the neighboring carbonyl.

295
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,580
So in this state, the conjugate base of an aldehyde or ketone can act as a good nucleophile,

296
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,420
attacking electrophiles and forming new carbon-carbon bonds.

297
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,740
Now, neutral ketones and aldehydes can be considered to be weakly nucleophilic based

298
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,100
on the formation of an enaltautomer, which forms when a proton from its alpha carbon

299
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,900
is relocated to the carbonyl oxygen.

300
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:41,220
But neutral ketones can also act as weak electrophiles, owing to the dipole between the carbonyl-carbon

301
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,900
and oxygen atoms.

302
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,060
Now, what's particularly interesting about carbonyls is the role and the ability of these

303
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,940
compounds to undergo nucleophilic attack without the loss of a leaving group.

304
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,100
Instead, those antibonding orbitals of the carbonyl, which reach out above and below

305
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,180
the plane of the group itself, can be attacked, breaking only the pi bond and preserving the

306
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,700
connection between carbon and oxygen.

307
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,860
Now that process is even more favorable in acidic conditions, when the carbonyl compound

308
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,920
is protonated at its oxygen.

309
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,100
Reaction at that site increases the electrophilic character of the carbonyl-carbon by creating

310
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,560
a resonance contributor with a positive formal charge at that atom.

311
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,680
So, basifying and acidifying are both viable strategies for activating ketones and aldehydes,

312
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,840
inducing them to react.

313
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,400
And no reaction is a better example of this property than the aldol condensation, a reaction

314
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,440
between two carbonyl compounds which can be conducted under either basic or acidic conditions

315
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,140
with similar efficiency.

316
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,480
The first report of an aldol condensation was given by French chemist Charles Adolf

317
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,800
Wertz in 1872.

318
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,000
Now Wertz discovered that addition of a strong mineral acid to ethanol led to a strange new

319
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,240
product which shared properties with both ketones and alcohols.

320
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,640
The reaction of one ethanol with another takes place when a portion of the sample becomes

321
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,440
protonated at the carbonyl oxygen.

322
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,560
So a mixture of both neutral aldehyde and protonated aldehyde needs to be present.

323
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,640
Now the protonated aldehyde has a resonance contributor with positive charge density at

324
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,960
the carbonyl-carbon and the neutral aldehyde can tautomerize to form a species known as

325
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,440
an enol, for alkene and alcohol motifs which combine to make it up.

326
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,040
So in this system that I've just set up, we have an electrophilic protonated aldehyde

327
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,080
and a nucleophilic enol-tautomer, all the ingredients necessary for an addition reaction

328
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,240
to take place.

329
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,760
As the enol attacks the protonated carbonyl, a new alcohol group forms.

330
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,760
The enol then quickly deprotonates to reform a carbonyl group.

331
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:06,920
Our aldol condensation is complete and a beta-hydroxy ketone has formed.

332
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,560
So words first accomplish this reaction by increasing the electrophilicity of a portion

333
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,360
of aldehyde using acid.

334
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,760
It wasn't long however before it was realized that the same result could be accomplished

335
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,840
by instead increasing the nucleophilicity of a portion of aldehyde by addition of a suitable

336
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,920
base.

337
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,880
So the addition of a base like hydroxide or methoxide can cause a portion of ethanol to

338
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,640
become deprotonated at its alpha-carbon which can participate in resonance and form that

339
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,960
resonance stabilized enolate.

340
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,740
So the enolate nucleophile attacks a neutral but electrophilic carbonyl carbon, breaking

341
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:52,120
its pi bond and promoting a series of steps which lead to the same exact product as in

342
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,120
words' acidic reaction.

343
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,780
Reactions like the aldol reaction are a shining example of how carbonyl chemistry is a very

344
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,960
versatile tool in organic synthesis, often leading us to consider making the same products

345
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,820
under either acidic or basic conditions.

346
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,340
It gives us a choice of reaction conditions which is a very nice thing to have in a complex

347
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,060
synthesis.

348
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,660
But carbonyl-containing compounds don't just react with themselves.

349
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:29,100
They make great nucleophiles and electrophiles to react with a large library of other compounds.

350
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,540
Another commonly used reaction employing ketones and aldehydes as electrophiles is the

351
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,940
reactions with alcohols.

352
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,140
When we do this, we get compounds reminiscent of hydrates like methylene glycol, but one

353
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,420
or both of the OH hydrogens has been replaced with an alkyl group.

354
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:52,100
In the case of an aldehyde like formaldehyde, replacement of 1OH leads to what we call a

355
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:58,220
hemiacetal, while the replacement of both gives us an acetal.

356
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,940
When the carbon bearing the two groups is instead derived from a ketone, meaning it

357
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,460
has two R groups attached to the carbonyl carbon, we call the resulting compounds hemiacetals

358
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,460
and ketals.

359
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:17,060
So let's take a look at how these two motifs can be created using formaldehyde as an example.

360
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,700
Now the formation of hemiacetals and hemiacetals from aldehydes and ketones are accomplished

361
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,220
in exactly the same way that their hydrates are made.

362
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:31,220
We simply substitute an alkoxide in place of the hydroxide nucleophile.

363
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,940
After one nucleophilic attack has taken place, there's no good leaving group to depart and

364
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,220
make room for a second attack.

365
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:45,600
Therefore the reaction stops at the hemiacetal or hemi-ketal stage.

366
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,820
We can instead create acetals and ketals by mixing aldehydes and ketones with an alcohol

367
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,260
under acidic conditions.

368
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,860
Under these conditions the carbonyl group can be protonated, making it a good electrophile.

369
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:05,180
It's then attacked by the weakly nucleophilic alcohol through an SN1 reaction.

370
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,980
This forms a protonated ether which we know will quickly lose its proton to solvent because

371
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,100
of its very low pKa.

372
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,740
But under acidic conditions a second attack is possible because the hemiacetal or hemi-ketal

373
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,260
formed can be protonated to create an oxonium ion in which a water leaving group can be

374
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,300
displaced by yet another alcohol nucleophile.

375
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,700
This leads to the acetal or ketal depending on whether the starting material was an aldehyde

376
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,180
or a ketone respectively.

377
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,020
Both acetals and ketals are very stable to strong bases in nucleophiles, but they can

378
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,100
be easily converted back into their ketone or aldehyde counterparts using acidic hydrolysis,

379
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,020
essentially just reversing the reaction by adding water.

380
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,020
Now these characteristics make acetals and ketals very useful as protecting groups in

381
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,820
synthesis, masking reactive carbonyl sites which can later be unmasked after doing other

382
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,660
chemical modifications to other regions of the molecule.

383
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:14,100
So today we explored the properties and the reactivity of some simple carbonyl compounds.

384
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,540
We discussed how the carbon-oxygen double bond necessitates an sp2 hybridization state

385
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:24,020
for both atoms, leading to a trigonal planar geometry about the carbonyl carbon, leaving

386
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,820
two available substrates.

387
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,020
When one or both of those substrates is a hydrogen, we have an aldehyde.

388
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,740
When neither are a hydrogen, we have a ketone.

389
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,580
We reviewed nomenclature of these compounds, how the carbonyl is treated as a functional

390
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:47,500
group and the suffixes al and own are used to designate aldehydes and ketones respectively.

391
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,100
We explored how these compounds can be produced by oxidation of alcohols, using either aqueous

392
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:58,380
chromic acid in the case of secondary alcohols to ketones or peridinium chlorochromate in

393
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:04,540
an organic solvent in the case of primary alcohols to aldehydes.

394
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,260
We then turned the tables and considered the reduction of aldehydes and ketones, using

395
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:13,820
a familiar reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, which essentially reverses the oxidation process

396
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,740
producing the alcohol.

397
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,580
We also met sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride, reagents which act as a

398
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,560
source of hydride nucleophiles, turning ketones and aldehydes into alkoxides, which quickly

399
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,260
convert to alcohols and protic solvent.

400
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,760
We discussed how carbonyl compounds react in substitution reactions, including their

401
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,260
nucleophilic enolates which form under basic conditions and their electrophilic characteristics

402
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,900
when protonated.

403
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,060
We surveyed how these characteristics affect reactivity in the aldol condensation between

404
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,500
two carbonyl compounds and how they can take place under basic or acidic conditions leading

405
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,900
to essentially the same products.

406
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,660
Finally we considered how aldehydes and ketones can be reacted with alcohols under basic conditions

407
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:11,380
to form hemiacetals and hemiketals, or under acidic conditions to prepare acetals and ketals.

408
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,260
And of course along the way we compared how some of these reactions are merely a clumsy

409
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,180
attempt by chemists to duplicate feats of synthesis which go on in your own body with

410
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,900
remarkably greater efficiency, even if they do come with a little headache.

411
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,860
And that's all for this lesson, but next time we'll continue our tour of oxygen-containing

412
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,060
compounds by considering those which contain multiple oxygen atoms with differing hybridization

413
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
states.

414
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,740
See you then.
