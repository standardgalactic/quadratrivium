1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,040
Last time, we investigated the phenomenon of partitioning and how it can be exploited

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,000
to separate compounds based on their relative affinities for two distinct chemical environments.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Specifically, we looked at liquid-liquid systems and solid-liquid systems.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In this lecture, we're going to explore one of the most powerful separation techniques ever developed,

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
one which, when properly applied, allows us to isolate almost anything we can imagine.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's also a bit near and dear to my heart because I spent two and a half years of my life

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
chained to a lab bench analyzing pharmaceutical products with one of these techniques.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, you might say that in that way, it was chromatography which inspired me to return to school for my PhD.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Our brief look at chromatography starts with its inventor, Mikhail Tsvet.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Tsvet was educated in Switzerland, where he received his PhD in 1896.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Shortly after this, however, he found himself in Russia, facing a similar fate to that of Zitsev,

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
whose foreign credential had nearly marginalized him in the Russian system.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Tsvet's non-Russian credential was not recognized by the National Establishment,

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
prompting him to undertake a second PhD program to become a functional scientist in the Russian system.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can only imagine the sinking feeling he must have had when he first realized

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that he would have to earn his PhD all over again.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In retrospect, however, it may have been the single greatest thing that ever happened to him,

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
since it was the topic of his second PhD which earned him immortality in the science of separation.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You see, Tsvet became interested in self-physiology during his first PhD program,

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and he wanted to continue working with natural plant products,

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
trying to understand the chemistry which drives their unique biology.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It was during experiments with the ubiquitous plant pigment chlorophyll

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that he made the observation which would forever change his life and the science of separations.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tsvet knew that isolated chlorophyll could be easily dissolved in an organic solvent known as petroleum ether.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yet, when he attempted to extract the pigments from the leaves of plants,

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
he noted that it was very difficult to dissolve in the same solvent.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Even after grinding and tearing the leaves to expose more surface area and break open cells,

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the distinctive dark green pigment simply wouldn't cooperate.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
His conclusion was that the chlorophyll pigment must be adhered to the solid plant matter

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
through intermolecular forces, reducing its solubility in the petroleum ether solvent.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Using this idea as a springboard for his research,

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tsvet tried adhering chlorophyll to different solid surfaces

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and then washing it away with various solvents

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
by allowing those solvents to flow through the solid matrix to which he had adhered the pigment.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He found that not only did chlorophyll migrate at different rates in different systems,

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but also that mixtures of pigments would many times separate in space

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
because of the differing attractive forces at work between them and the two phases.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This created an array of colors on Tsvet's column,

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
prompting him to dub his new technique chromatography

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
from the Greek words meaning color and writing.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Where Tsvet's creation really differed from simple liquid-liquid or solid-liquid extraction

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is that he added motion to the equation.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
By allowing one of the phases to move across the other,

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the partitioning of a solute between heterogeneous phases

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
can be used to move compounds across the stationary phase, but at varying rates.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Obviously, the more time a particular compound spends partitioned onto the mobile phase

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or into the mobile phase, the faster it moves.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Indeed, the modern definition of chromatography is

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
a separation technique which relies on the differing affinity of a substance

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
for a stationary phase and a mobile phase.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We can very closely duplicate the results of some of Tsvet's experiments

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
using a simple piece of chalk, some markers,

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and a solvent that's readily available to us, like ethanol.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take that piece of chalk

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
which I've applied a little bit of some pigments from a marker,

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and I'm going to use ethanol as a mobile phase

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to cause those dyes and pigments to migrate, but at different speeds.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So ahead of time, I've already prepared my column, if you will,

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and as I promised, this is an experiment that's pretty easily done right in your own kitchen.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is nothing more than a piece of common sidewalk chalk.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is calcium carbonate, the exact same stationary phase

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
used by Tsvet in his original experiment.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now on this piece of chalk, I placed bands of different colors

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
simply by touching the tip of a marker to the chalk.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So this chalk is now my stationary phase.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's going to stand perfectly still throughout the experiment.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have a beaker here with a little bit of the solvent ethanol in it.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now I'm using ethanol instead of petroleum ether

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
because the pigments from the markers are actually much more polar molecules

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
than the pigments that Tsvet was separating.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So I need a little bit more polar solvent to encourage this ink to migrate.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What I'm going to do now is place my chalk into this beaker

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
containing a very shallow pool of my mobile phase ethanol

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and allow it to migrate up through the chalk through essentially capillary action.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So my chalk will absorb the solvent and chromatography will take place.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So let's start that now.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm going to very carefully balance my chalk here

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and place a piece of aluminum foil over the top

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
in an attempt to discourage evaporation of my mobile phase

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
while separation takes place.

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So if we wait for just a moment, we should already be able to see the chalk

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
is becoming darker as the solvent moves up toward the ink.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So before long, it's going to pass over my bands of different colors

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and begin to separate those molecules based upon chromatography.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So our chalk has been developing for a little while

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and even though the solvent has only run a very small distance

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
it's already very easy to see what's been going on here.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So let's take a closer look.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm going to remove my stationary phase along with the adhered pigments.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll move my ethanol to the side.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now if I turn this chalk you can see very clearly

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that different colored markers contain different colored pigments

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and not only that but those different colored pigments have traveled different distances.

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now since calcium carbonate is a particularly polar substance

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and ethanol is an organic solvent, I can say with relative certainty

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
for example that the yellow dye to produce the color of the yellow marker

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
contains molecules which are less polar

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
than say the compounds used in this blue dye which were used to produce the green marker.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I can make this sort of qualitative assessment of the polarity of the different dyes within

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
simply by looking at how they move during my chromatography experiment.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of course chromatography has advanced considerably over the past century.

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Stationary phases like calcium carbonate and sugar from Svets experiments

103
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
have been replaced by a number of superior options.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The first of these was actually paper.

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You see paper consists of cellulose, a long polymer consisting mostly of interconnected glucose units.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And we already know that these glucose units have many, many hydroxyls

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
which are available to interact with polar or hydrogen bonding compounds.

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Two English chemists by the name of Archer J.P. Martin and Richard Singh

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
developed a method of chromatography using paper and organic solvents

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
as stationery and mobile phases respectively.

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In 1942 they published a paper outlining this technique

112
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
but more importantly it discussed the fundamentals of partitioning

113
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
as it applied to chromatographic systems.

114
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This technique proved extremely useful in the identification of small organic molecules

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
including amino acids like glycine and alanine.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This method was so influential that Martin and Singh received the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this concept.

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Not only did these two receive the prize for their work

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but a further validation came just a year later

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
when a young scientist named Stanley Miller used this method

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
to verify the presence of amino acids in his now famous Primitive Earth experiment.

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
More recently, advances in material manufacturing

122
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
had made quick identifications like millers even easier and more accurate.

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
For example, microporosilica can now be manufactured.

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Silica is a fantastic stationery phase because even though its formula is SiO2

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
at its surface are an array of silanol groups or SiOH motifs.

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
These groups will interact well with anything of high polarity or good hydrogen bonding ability

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and because silica can be manufactured with a tremendous amount of surface area per volume ratio

128
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
more compound can be separated with greater efficiency or on larger scales.

129
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
For example, instead of the everyday paper used by Martin and Miller

130
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
modern organic chemistry researchers often use a thin layer chromatography plate

131
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
with a plastic backing and just a 200 micron thick layer of silica bound to it.

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's just about the width of a human hair.

133
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But that small amount of silica has a surface area of literally hundreds of square meters

134
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
because the extremely small size and porosity of the silica particles

135
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
gives it this very, very large surface area to volume ratio.

136
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In the technique of thin layer chromatography, a small amount of compound to be analyzed

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
is spotted onto the plate as a solution and it's allowed to dry.

138
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So once that spot is dried, it's placed into a developing chamber

139
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
which contains a thin pool of the selected mobile phase

140
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which will move up the plate in the very same way that our mobile phase moved up the chalk in our previous demonstration.

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So let's take a look at a thin layer chromatography experiment

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
just like we did our chalk experiment which simulated the work of Svet.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Now this time I'm going to put on some gloves just because I'd like to hold up for you

144
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and show you what a thin layer chromatography plate actually looks like.

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now they come in many sizes and they come with many different stationary phases

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but by far the most common uses silica and it's backed in plastic

147
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
so the shiny side on the back here is actually plastic on which chromatography would never happen.

148
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But this is the surface which contains the very, very thin layer of microscopic beads of silica.

149
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
In fact, this jar contains loose silica, the likes of which would be adhered to the backing of the plate.

150
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So as you can see it's extremely fine particle size

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and that gives it its extremely large surface area to volume ratio.

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Now I have a small developing chamber here which has alcohol in it just as before

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and I've created a plate which I've spotted with some of the markers that we used in the previous experiment as well

154
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and you're probably going to notice a market difference in their chromatographic behavior

155
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
because even though I'm using the same mobile phase, we're changing our stationary phase now

156
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
from calcium carbonate to silica, both very polar but in their own way

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
so we're going to see a drastically different separation pattern taking place.

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Nonetheless, the development process is essentially the same.

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm going to take my plate onto which I placed three small spots, one of green, one of orange and one of the red marker

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and I've spotted them just as I did in my bars on the chalk stick

161
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
in such a way that they don't submerge beneath the thin pool of mobile phase

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
because I don't want them to dissolve into all that mobile phase.

163
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So I'm going to place that inside very carefully, going to cover that back up with my foil

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to discourage any evaporation of my mobile phase

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and fairly quickly, we should be able to see that the alcohol mobile phase is making its way up the plate once again

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and just as before with the chalk, when it encounters the spots, they will begin to migrate at a rate

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
which is consistent with their relative affinity for the mobile and stationary phases.

168
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So we'll come back to this and take a look at it in just a few minutes when it's done.

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So the mobile phase has moved an appreciable distance up the plate

170
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
which is the stationary phase in my TLC experiment, so I'm ready to take a look now at the result.

171
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm going to remove my plate. Now if I were in the lab, I would very quickly take a pencil and mark the lane

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
because as we'll see here briefly, over time I expect that that alcohol mobile phase will begin to evaporate

173
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and it won't be quite so clear as it is now where it traveled to.

174
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Now it's very important for me to know that because I can use the distances traveled by the spots

175
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
relative to that traveled by the mobile phase to get some numbers that we'll talk about in a moment.

176
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But first let's just take a look at the plate. So it's very obvious that the green marker actually contains some blue dye.

177
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now we may not have guessed that originally simply from looking at the marker itself,

178
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
but the chromatography plate makes this fact essentially undisputable.

179
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Not only that, I can say that some of that blue dye moved very well with the mobile phase

180
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and therefore didn't have a terribly high affinity for the stationary phase.

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In other words, it's moving that way because it's less polar than the others.

182
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We can even see similar components in the red and orange markers but in slightly different proportions

183
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and of course the orange having more yellow and the red having more of the darker pigments in it.

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So this is how TLC can be used to very quickly get qualitative assessments of compounds polarities and solubilities

185
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
in different solvents but also to give us a very quick and easy way to compare one lane to the next

186
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and identify common compounds in different samples.

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Now since my solvents still evaporating, I'll show you another one which I prepared earlier

188
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
in which the solvent has all but evaporated completely.

189
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And again you can see I've got basically the same result.

190
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yet another very important property of this chromatography technique is that it's reproducible.

191
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So as long as I use the same stationary and mobile phases each time,

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can expect the same relative mobilities for all the spots within a given sample.

193
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So as the mobile phase wicks up through the plate by capillary action,

194
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
different compounds in our samples were moving at different rates.

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Now compounds which interact more strongly with the polar silica move to shorter distance

196
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
while those which interacted better with the lower polarity mobile phase move to greater distance.

197
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
At the completion of the experiment we can measure those distances traveled by the sample spots

198
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
as a fraction of the distance traveled by the mobile phase.

199
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And we report that number as the RF value for that sample in our particular chromatographic system.

200
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
RF stands for retention factor and it gives us a semi-quantitative way to describe simple chromatographic mobility,

201
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
like we just saw in our experiment.

202
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Now thin layer chromatography may be a versatile, quick, low-cost way to observe the chromatographic mobility of a compound.

203
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But working with such small quantities makes collection of a meaningful sample of the compound somewhat difficult.

204
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
In order to collect a sample which can be used as raw material, drug, an analytical sample, or a synthetic intermediate,

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
we need to increase the scale of the experiment.

206
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is frequently done in the lab using a technique known as column chromatography.

207
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
In column chromatography we abandon the thin layer of stationary phase on the backing in favor of a column.

208
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Now this brings the third dimension into play and this means that a 2 centimeter wide column

209
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:17,000
can separate about 8,000 times as much sample as a TLC lane which is just 200 microns thick.

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Now we accomplish this using a device like this.

211
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's a glass column which contains a Teflon stopcock at the base and a stem through which we can drain mobile phase.

212
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I place a small bit of glass wool or some other obstruction in the neck to prevent solids from moving through,

213
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:48,000
then a nice even layered bed of sand onto which I would build a column of silica again using this finely, finely powdered silica material.

214
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The key here is that because I'm using a column which has depth,

215
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
instead of that extremely thin layer of silica I'm using a very large bed of silica.

216
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
In fact the bed contains about 8,000 times the volume per unit length in a column this size compared to the kind of TLC plates that we saw previously.

217
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So using a column I can get a larger quantity of material.

218
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The only real catch here comes when we try to analyze the mobility.

219
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We have to remember that in our previous examples the mobile phase migrated from the bottom of the column to the top.

220
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But in this case once we packed a column and add sample we'd be adding mobile phase through the top and draining through the bottom,

221
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
meaning that all the motion is now downward.

222
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So there's a common point of confusion is that even though the bands may appear to be reversed from a TLC experiment,

223
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
they're in fact, if they are reversed, exactly what we would expect.

224
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Now the techniques that we've looked at in this lecture so far are just the very basic techniques taught at the introductory level,

225
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
though still used frequently in research labs today.

226
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In recent decades though chromatography has undergone a virtual explosion of advancements

227
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
leading to techniques involving ultramicroscopic silica particles with such small pores

228
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
that powerful pumps have to be used to push solvent through them at high pressures.

229
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We call this technique HPLC for high pressure liquid chromatography.

230
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The extremely high surface area of the contents of an HPLC column allows very precise separations,

231
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
but it also requires a closed system consisting of a steel column to be used

232
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
so that it can resist the pressure applied by pumps which move the solvent.

233
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So it's impossible to load compounds in the same way as traditional chromatography since the system is sealed.

234
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Similarly, it's impossible to see even the brightest colored compounds as they move through the system

235
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
because the column is encased in steel.

236
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Now the loading problem is solved with a device called an injection loop.

237
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
An injection loop consists of a manifold with two separate loops made of a pressure resistant tubing.

238
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So when the valve handle is rotated, one loop is in line with the flowing mobile phase

239
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and the other is in line with a special injection septum.

240
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The sample is pushed into the open loop using a syringe

241
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and when the handle is turned, places the injection loop in line with the mobile phase,

242
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
thereby introducing the sample to the chromatographic system without ever opening it and losing pressure.

243
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Of course, since columns need to be packed into stainless steel cases,

244
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
it becomes impossible to monitor a run with my eyes even if my compounds are absorbing the visible light.

245
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So HPLC systems also have a detecting system which is usually something like a simple spectrophotometer flow cell.

246
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The simplest example of this is a UV visible detection system

247
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
in which a specific wavelength of light is aimed so that it passes through the exiting solvent, striking a detector.

248
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
As the sample molecules move out of the column and through the detector cell,

249
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
they absorb the light, leading to a reduced intensity at the detector.

250
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So if we plot the observed absorbance as a function of time starting with the injection of the sample at zero minutes,

251
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
we can create what's called a chromatogram or a graphical representation of the separation taking place.

252
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There are many more chromatographic methods available to the modern chemist.

253
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Certainly many more than we can survey in a single lecture.

254
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But no lecture on chromatography would be complete without the mention of gas chromatography, commonly referred to as GC.

255
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Archer J.P. Martin is the name most commonly associated with the invention of gas chromatography.

256
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Now, Martin is actually most famous for his invention of paper chromatography,

257
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the technique used by Stanley Miller to detect the amino acids in his primordial concoction made in Harold Urie's lab.

258
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Martin shared the 1952 Nobel Prize for that work,

259
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but like most Nobel laureates, even the indisputable pinnacle of scientific honors was not enough to satisfy his curiosity.

260
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Martin continued to explore ways in which partitioning could be exploited to separate organic compounds faster and even more efficiently.

261
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It was around the time of his Nobel Prize award that he hit on another great concept.

262
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Partitioning involves the motion of molecules from one phase to another.

263
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So why confine this methodology to transitions between adhered solid states and dissolved liquid states?

264
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
After all, molecules move faster in gases and slowest of all in solids.

265
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So it stands to reason that molecules could switch from phase to phase much more quickly if the gas phase were somehow included in the experiment.

266
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So Martin wondered, could a form of chromatography be developed using liquid as the stationary phase and gas as the mobile phase?

267
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Martin's idea proved viable.

268
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,000
He demonstrated that separation could be accomplished with extreme speed and precision using a dense liquid phase and a gas like helium as the mobile phase.

269
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
By slowly heating a column filled with a liquid stationary phase, through which a carrier gas like helium or nitrogen is flowing,

270
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
compounds are driven off one by one in order of decreasing volatility.

271
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:39,000
His new method allowed faster separation with far less material and has become a staple technique in forensic and analytical labs all around the world.

272
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Using various detection methods, GC can be used to analyze practically anything that will vaporize.

273
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
In this lecture, we explored our last topics on the science of separations.

274
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Specifically, we continued our investigation into partitioning,

275
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:06,000
which is the equilibrium that compounds naturally establish between two distinct phases upon or based upon their relative affinity for those phases.

276
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We took a look at the work of Michael Svet, whose second PhD dissertation gave rise to the science of chromatography,

277
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
in which partitioning between a stationary and mobile phase leads to predictable rates of movement for compounds.

278
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This movement is based upon their relative affinity for the two phases.

279
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We saw how this very basic principle plays out on a piece of blackboard chalk, much like Svet's first experiment.

280
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And then again on a TLC plate, which is designed for small-scale characterizations and method development.

281
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And finally, we talked about columns, which could allow us to collect enough sample to carry our work forward and perform additional reactions or testing.

282
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Finally, we briefly mentioned some of the more powerful techniques in use today for special applications from quality testing to medical research and beyond.

283
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We looked at HPLC, which uses extremely fine silica with very small pores to generate a huge surface area,

284
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:19,000
giving us better separations but requiring powerful pumps operating at thousands of pounds per square inch to keep that mobile phase moving.

285
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And we also saw how Archer J. P. Martin's second claim to fame, gas chromatography,

286
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
operates by partitioning between the liquid and gas phases rather than the traditional solid and liquid phases.

287
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And we discussed how this gives more partitioning events in a given unit of time, creating a fantastic resolution in a very short experiment.

288
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
From recrystallization to distillation to liquid-liquid extractions and chromatography,

289
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
there is truly a solution for nearly any separation problem that could possibly come up in the lab.

290
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We've come a long way, from atomic and molecular structure to the synthesis of organic compounds,

291
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
a host of identification techniques and methods used for purification.

292
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
In the last 35 lectures, we have managed to gather an understanding of some of the most basic tenets of organic chemistry.

293
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But we spent most of our time looking back on the history of this complex and powerful science.

294
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
An absolute must, if one is to gain the perspective to meaningfully look forward,

295
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
at the possibilities that organic chemistry holds for the future.

296
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So, the topic of our final lecture will be just that.

297
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We'll experience the joy of taking some of what we've learned from the past 35 lectures,

298
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
adding a dash of imagination, and trying to gaze into the future through the eyes of an organic chemist.

299
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'll see you there.
