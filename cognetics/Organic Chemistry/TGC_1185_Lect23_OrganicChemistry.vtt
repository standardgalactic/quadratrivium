00:00.000 --> 00:16.280
Your physician screens you to determine risk factors for genetic diseases.

00:16.280 --> 00:21.560
A criminal forensics lab links a sample of blood, skin, or hair from a crime scene to

00:21.560 --> 00:23.240
a suspected criminal.

00:23.240 --> 00:29.240
A zoologist or botanist confirms that his or her latest discovery is in fact a new species.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.080
A pharmaceutical company manufactures human insulin used to treat diabetics using a bacterium

00:35.080 --> 00:38.960
as a microscopic production plant.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.960
All of these remarkable accomplishments have one thing in common, DNA.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.680
Elegantly simple in its library of just four letters, but stunningly complex in the size

00:50.680 --> 00:56.960
and organization of those four letters, DNA and its chemical cousin RNA stand alone among

00:56.960 --> 01:02.440
biomolecules in their ability to help us carry out these kinds of tasks.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.920
That's right, just four letters.

01:04.920 --> 01:10.080
That's all it takes to sum up your entire chemical essence.

01:10.080 --> 01:16.280
Using just four simple letters, modern scientists can document, store, and even reproduce a

01:16.280 --> 01:21.840
code which contains all the basic information which makes you who you are, at least in a

01:21.840 --> 01:25.480
physiological sense.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.880
It might sound too simple to be true.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.080
Why such small alphabet of letters to make up a code as complex as the one that makes

01:33.080 --> 01:36.680
you, you in a chemical sense?

01:36.680 --> 01:40.880
Well Nature makes up for the small library of letters with scale.

01:40.880 --> 01:46.240
A single strand of your DNA contains over three billion of these letters.

01:46.240 --> 01:52.080
Now three billion positions with four possibilities for each makes for more possibilities than

01:52.080 --> 01:55.120
one can realistically imagine.

01:55.120 --> 02:01.040
To get the same number of possible permutations with 26 letters like our alphabet would require

02:01.040 --> 02:10.280
a literary work equivalent to about 430 copies of Tolstoy's classic War and Peace.

02:10.280 --> 02:17.760
Most of us are familiar with these four letters A, G, C, and T. There are a shorthand notation

02:17.760 --> 02:23.880
used by geneticists and molecular biologists to represent adenine, guanine, cytosine, and

02:23.880 --> 02:24.880
thymine.

02:24.880 --> 02:31.880
Now these are the four subunits of a compound which is very familiar to us, DNA.

02:31.880 --> 02:36.320
But remember that Voler helped to demonstrate that the chemistry of life is not off limits

02:36.320 --> 02:38.640
to the organic chemists.

02:38.640 --> 02:45.040
So awesomely complex those cellular biochemistry may be, it is still rooted in the same foundations

02:45.040 --> 02:49.240
as the rest of organic chemistry.

02:49.240 --> 02:54.200
The power of understanding and manipulating DNA has been demonstrated time and again since

02:54.200 --> 03:01.440
its structure was solved in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.640
After decades of study, the United States National Institutes of Health and private entrepreneur

03:06.640 --> 03:12.360
Craig Venter jointly announced that the human genome had been completely mapped.

03:12.360 --> 03:18.680
Now mapping genes and sequencing DNA has given us a tool which can be used not only to scan

03:18.680 --> 03:23.440
for particular health risks in a person, but also to use as a forensic identification

03:23.440 --> 03:29.280
tool, a guide for targeted gene therapy, and a way to understand the chemical basis on

03:29.280 --> 03:36.440
which life evolves and changes in response to environmental stimuli.

03:36.440 --> 03:42.000
Our understanding of DNA and the biochemical processes surrounding it has altered our perception

03:42.000 --> 03:45.040
of what it is to be a living thing.

03:45.040 --> 03:51.080
As scientists, we endeavor to study it, understand it, and ultimately manipulate it in ways which

03:51.080 --> 03:53.240
improve our lives.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.840
Of course, none of this understanding is possible without tearing this beautiful complex down

03:57.840 --> 04:01.600
into its most basic constituent parts.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.240
This is what we will do in this lecture.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.400
Starting from the individual molecules and motifs, we will work our way up to a full

04:08.400 --> 04:14.760
model for the structure of nucleic acid-containing compounds.

04:14.760 --> 04:19.120
So let's begin with RNA, or ribonucleic acid.

04:19.120 --> 04:25.440
RNA serves several critical roles in converting your genetic code, or genome, into the proteins

04:25.440 --> 04:29.600
essential to life, also called a proteome.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.640
In addition to other roles, one of RNA's most important jobs is to transport the information

04:34.640 --> 04:39.840
in the DNA of your cells to areas in those cells where proteins are made.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.440
Now this is a gross underestimation of the versatility of RNA, but for this lecture we're

04:44.440 --> 04:48.920
going to focus on this particular role, since it helps to explain some of the chemical differences

04:48.920 --> 04:55.480
between it and its very close chemical relative, DNA.

04:55.480 --> 05:01.400
The ribo part of that name refers to the carbohydrate ribose.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.680
Now the Fischer projection of D-ribose looks like this.

05:05.680 --> 05:12.120
It's an aldopentose, and like any aldopentose, ribose can undergo cyclization to form the

05:12.120 --> 05:20.120
associated ribofurinose, with its anomeric carbon in one of two positions, alpha or beta.

05:20.120 --> 05:27.800
It's the beta form of this ribofurinose, which is the central building block of RNA.

05:27.800 --> 05:32.360
Ribose alone, however, is a fairly uninteresting molecule from a genetic coding perspective.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.640
I mean, after all, there's only one beta ribofurinose molecule possible.

05:36.640 --> 05:42.620
There's no variation among these structures yet.

05:42.620 --> 05:47.920
To produce the building blocks of RNA, the anomeric hydroxyl in beta ribofurinose is

05:47.920 --> 05:53.200
replaced with an organic base to a nitrogen atom.

05:53.200 --> 06:02.320
In the case of RNA, these four bases are cytosine, uracil, adenine, and guanine.

06:03.160 --> 06:10.000
RNA uses uracil as opposed to the thymine of DNA, for reasons that we're going to discuss shortly.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.160
Now these units are further subdivided into the class of pyrimidine bases and purine

06:16.160 --> 06:21.760
bases based on their backbone structures.

06:21.760 --> 06:28.360
So, using one of these four bases as the aglaicone in beta ribofurinose produces one of the four

06:28.400 --> 06:33.760
subunits of RNA, collectively called nucleosides.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.600
And not surprisingly, these nucleosides have names similar to those of the bases which

06:37.600 --> 06:40.120
gave them their identity.

06:40.120 --> 06:45.840
An aglaicone of cytosine forms the nucleoside cytidine.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.880
Uracil leads to uredine.

06:48.880 --> 06:54.520
Adenine produces adenosine, and guanine produces guanosine.

06:54.520 --> 06:59.200
So we're slowly constructing the monomers of our miraculous biopolymer.

06:59.200 --> 07:05.480
We've attached a pyrimidine or pyrimidine base to ribofurinose as an aglaicone to create

07:05.480 --> 07:11.160
four different letters in the coding alphabet of life.

07:11.160 --> 07:16.160
But a simple collection of letters is not a code.

07:16.160 --> 07:22.120
Consider this random collection of letters from our alphabet, randomly distributed about

07:22.120 --> 07:24.200
the screen.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.280
There's a little bit of information here in the quantity and identity of the letters.

07:28.280 --> 07:33.320
But I can communicate even more specific and detailed information if I order the letters

07:33.320 --> 07:34.560
in a certain way.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.520
So let's put the letters together and see if we can figure out what I'm trying to say

07:37.520 --> 07:40.520
here.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.080
Teachers get sour.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.720
Maybe not.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
Carugate sheets.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.600
Well, if this were an engineering course, that would probably be it.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
But it's not.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.840
So let's keep going.

07:52.840 --> 07:57.600
These same letters can be put together to form saucers together, which maybe would be

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
a cooking course.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
I don't know.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.600
UFOs, possibly.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.720
Who knows?

08:01.720 --> 08:06.840
Or maybe what I'm trying to say is the great courses.

08:06.840 --> 08:11.560
I can communicate very detailed information with the same letters by combining them in

08:11.560 --> 08:13.360
different orders.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.600
DNA does the same thing.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.240
See the building blocks of each of these phrases are the same.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.680
It's the arrangement of the building blocks, which enriches the code and allows me to encode

08:23.680 --> 08:28.360
far more information using far fewer subunits.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.600
So let's go back to RNA.

08:30.600 --> 08:35.960
We must now find a way to link those nucleoside subunits together into a chain so that there's

08:35.960 --> 08:41.480
a sequence to the collection of Cs, Us, As, and Gs, which will make up the information

08:41.480 --> 08:44.080
in our RNA molecule.

08:44.080 --> 08:49.040
We need a way to string them together, just like we string letters to make words and sentences.

08:50.040 --> 08:56.440
The glue which holds our nucleosides together is a phosphate functional group.

08:56.440 --> 09:03.240
Now, by attaching a phosphate group at the five prime position on the sugar of our nucleoside,

09:03.240 --> 09:07.440
we create a motif called a phosphoester.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.920
This phosphoester group will be the linkage through which our nucleosides are connected

09:11.920 --> 09:16.120
to give our collection of building blocks order.

09:16.120 --> 09:21.400
The collection of three crucial elements, information in the base, the backbone of the

09:21.400 --> 09:28.840
ribose, linking the glue of the phosphoester, all together make up what is called a ribonucleotide.

09:28.840 --> 09:34.320
A ribonucleotide is one complete subunit of RNA, ready to be linked to others to create

09:34.320 --> 09:37.840
a useful code.

09:37.840 --> 09:43.440
So let's put our simple code together, consisting of four ribonucleotides condensed into a chain.

09:43.440 --> 09:49.760
We'll use our examples of cytidine monophosphate, uredine monophosphate, adenosine monophosphate,

09:49.760 --> 09:51.880
and guanidine monophosphate.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.600
These will be our ribonucleotides.

09:54.600 --> 09:58.880
Now if we align them so that the five prime phosphoester of one can condense with the three

09:58.880 --> 10:05.760
prime hydroxyl of another, we can form a phosphoester bridge between the two bases, producing

10:05.760 --> 10:11.000
three water molecules in this case as a byproduct.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.320
So here I put C, U, A, and G together in a very specific sequence.

10:17.320 --> 10:21.680
Now as a convention we always read from the five prime end of the chain toward the three

10:21.680 --> 10:23.920
prime end of the chain.

10:23.920 --> 10:29.280
Of course this is a very small chain by biochemistry standards as many RNA strands can be thousands

10:29.280 --> 10:34.440
of units long and they're all performing their functions in your body right now.

10:34.440 --> 10:39.040
Among other functions, RNA is nature's messenger molecule.

10:39.040 --> 10:43.480
This information from the genetic code stored in DNA and assists in the conversion of that

10:43.480 --> 10:52.840
information into the vast library of proteins which our bodies use to regulate the biochemistry.

10:52.840 --> 10:58.600
So now we understand a bit about the structure of RNA, a complex biomolecule whose job is

10:58.600 --> 11:03.360
to act as the middleman, getting information from your permanent genetic code to the site

11:03.360 --> 11:07.560
where that code is used to build other compounds.

11:07.560 --> 11:11.520
Because the role of RNA is transmission of information which is carried out on a fairly

11:11.520 --> 11:17.840
rapid timescale, RNA itself doesn't need to endure for long periods of time to effectively

11:17.840 --> 11:21.000
perform its duties in living systems.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.640
In fact, it's part of RNA's design that it can be broken down easily and its components

11:26.640 --> 11:32.280
recycled for use in creating more RNA as it's needed.

11:32.280 --> 11:36.760
RNA already has a pretty stable backbone, but there's a chink in the armor and it's

11:36.760 --> 11:42.920
right here at the 2-prime hydroxyl group.

11:42.920 --> 11:47.680
This little nucleophile is hanging out right next to the phosphate ester group of the following

11:47.680 --> 11:53.200
nucleoside which has an electrophilic phosphorous atom.

11:53.200 --> 11:58.800
So the connection may last for a while, but before long, a 2-prime hydroxyl of RNA just

11:58.800 --> 12:04.760
can't help but attack the phosphorus, initiating a mechanism which ultimately cuts the chain

12:04.760 --> 12:09.120
that gives RNA its information-carrying ability.

12:09.120 --> 12:13.880
So RNA can carry huge amounts of information back and forth, being broken down and rebuilt

12:13.880 --> 12:16.280
as the organism needs it.

12:16.280 --> 12:20.760
But there would be no information to transport or translate if there were no method of storing

12:20.760 --> 12:25.400
that information indefinitely until it's called upon.

12:25.400 --> 12:31.000
This task of information storage falls to a close chemical cousin of RNA, the famous

12:31.000 --> 12:35.680
DNA.

12:35.680 --> 12:42.400
Dioxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short, is another ribose-based biopolymer which serves

12:42.400 --> 12:44.680
a very different purpose.

12:44.680 --> 12:50.800
DNA is very similar to RNA, consisting of a phosphate, sugar, and base to form what

12:50.800 --> 12:54.880
we call a deoxyribonucleotide.

12:54.880 --> 13:00.160
But there are two key structural differences which make DNA more robust than RNA.

13:00.160 --> 13:06.880
First, it's the lack of the 2-prime hydroxyl group of the beta ribofurinose sugar.

13:06.880 --> 13:13.400
Instead, this group is replaced with a hydrogen, which is non-nucleophilic.

13:13.400 --> 13:18.840
This removal of the one very specific oxygen from the ribose is the source of the deoxyribo

13:18.840 --> 13:22.320
portion of DNA's name.

13:22.320 --> 13:27.080
With that promiscuous little nucleophile out of the picture, DNA hydrolyzes about 100

13:27.080 --> 13:29.800
times slower than RNA.

13:29.800 --> 13:34.080
And this makes DNA a much better choice, not for a short-lived messenger, but for the

13:34.080 --> 13:39.360
permanent storage of a genetic code which needs to last you the rest of your life.

13:39.360 --> 13:45.560
A second feature of DNA, which makes it a more robust system, is the replacement of

13:45.560 --> 13:49.920
uracil with thymine, a methylated version of uracil.

13:50.680 --> 13:55.520
Now the reason for this difference is that cytosine itself can deaminate spontaneously

13:55.520 --> 13:56.960
to become uracil.

13:56.960 --> 14:03.320
Now obviously, when this happens to your DNA, this is bad news, your DNA just mutated.

14:03.320 --> 14:08.320
But your body has a defense mechanism for this, a complex molecule called an enzyme,

14:08.320 --> 14:14.600
which finds that uracil in your DNA and reaminates it to recover the original cytosine.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.000
That's amazing, isn't it?

14:16.000 --> 14:20.400
Your body can actively repair this kind of damage to DNA.

14:20.400 --> 14:25.960
Now, this incredible repair mechanism comes with a cost.

14:25.960 --> 14:31.760
If DNA actually used uracil, how would the enzyme know which uracil is to alter and which

14:31.760 --> 14:33.000
one is to leave alone?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.960
Well, it wouldn't.

14:34.960 --> 14:40.640
So DNA instead uses thymine as the complementary base for cytosine.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.760
The distinguishing methyl group is acting as a signal to the enzyme saying, hey, I'm

14:44.760 --> 14:54.160
supposed to be here, please don't amenate me.

14:54.160 --> 15:01.000
Of course, most of us are familiar with this form of DNA, the double helix.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.720
This structure was first proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, two names which

15:05.720 --> 15:08.080
are often associated with it.

15:08.080 --> 15:13.080
Of course, the truth is that the discovery of the DNA double helix was really the result

15:13.080 --> 15:19.600
of a concerted effort on the part of many talented researchers over many decades.

15:19.600 --> 15:26.120
In 1869, Friedrich Miescher first isolated DNA from the nuclei of cells.

15:26.120 --> 15:31.640
It was this biological source which prompted him to name it nucleon, a name which was later

15:31.640 --> 15:36.800
revised to DNA to better reflect its chemical composition.

15:36.800 --> 15:42.480
Russian researcher Phoebus Levine was able to identify the individual components of DNA,

15:42.480 --> 15:46.520
including the sugars, phosphates, and bases which comprised it.

15:46.520 --> 15:51.760
But he lacked the necessary tools to properly explain exactly how each of these pieces came

15:51.760 --> 15:56.400
together to form a structure for DNA.

15:56.400 --> 16:02.920
In the 1940s, Erwin Chargaff developed a method for isolating the bases from DNA samples,

16:02.920 --> 16:08.080
and he found that the number of cytosine bases in any given sample very closely matched the

16:08.080 --> 16:10.760
number of guanine bases.

16:10.760 --> 16:17.520
He also determined that the number of adenine bases closely tracked that of thymine.

16:17.520 --> 16:22.560
In the 1950s, the X-ray crystallography lab of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at

16:22.560 --> 16:26.440
King's College finally reached a milestone in genetics.

16:26.440 --> 16:32.120
They were able to use a technique called X-ray diffraction to determine the spatial arrangement

16:32.120 --> 16:37.000
of atoms within the DNA molecule.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.160
In the end, it was Watson and Crick, however, who made it to press first with their model

16:41.160 --> 16:45.360
of the double helix, earning them their place in history.

16:45.360 --> 16:50.720
What Watson and Crick proposed explained every observation to date.

16:50.720 --> 16:58.240
The sugar, the phosphate, and the base molecules found by Levine were all accounted for.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.720
And equal amounts of purine and pyrimidine bases from Chargaff's experiments were also

17:02.720 --> 17:05.280
easily explained.

17:05.280 --> 17:09.560
Even the crystallography data from Wilhelm and Franklin's labs, as well as their own,

17:09.560 --> 17:15.440
all clearly showed that this helical structure held them all together.

17:15.440 --> 17:21.240
The key to putting it all together was that the two bases, adenine and thymine, when held

17:21.240 --> 17:30.960
in place by the proposed helix, form a network of hydrogen bonds, causing them to pair up.

17:30.960 --> 17:36.360
And in cytosine, they form a similar set, but this time with three hydrogen bonds, when

17:36.360 --> 17:39.720
placed on adjacent strands.

17:39.720 --> 17:44.640
So these base pairs, and their noncovalent interactions, which we now call Watson-Crick

17:44.640 --> 17:50.320
pairs, are what hold the two strands of DNA together in this anti-parallel alignment with

17:50.320 --> 17:51.320
one another.

17:51.320 --> 17:56.160
That's right, the double helix in your DNA is held together by little more than a few

17:56.160 --> 17:58.160
hydrogen bonds.

17:59.160 --> 18:03.240
Okay, in the human genome, it's about seven or eight billion hydrogen bonds for every

18:03.240 --> 18:05.960
strand of DNA.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.160
But there's even more interaction going on within those base pairs.

18:10.160 --> 18:16.040
The pi systems of neighbors stack with one another, creating a strong contributing dispersion

18:16.040 --> 18:21.440
force between their electron clouds, which holds them together even more.

18:21.440 --> 18:25.960
And this interaction has been successfully targeted as a site for anti-tumor drugs.

18:26.360 --> 18:32.760
See, they can slip in between adjacent bases in rapidly growing cancer cells, and this causes

18:32.760 --> 18:38.160
kinks in their DNA strands, inhibiting their ability to replicate and grow.

18:41.160 --> 18:46.040
DNA is a very exciting structure to study in and of itself, but in recent decades, research

18:46.040 --> 18:50.760
has gone well beyond simply characterizing this fascinating structure.

18:50.760 --> 18:55.720
Ingenious molecular biologists and chemists have devised new applications using the understanding

18:55.720 --> 19:00.520
of DNA given to us by all those who came before.

19:00.520 --> 19:05.360
Probably the most well-known of these is the art of DNA profiling, identifying an individual

19:05.360 --> 19:10.080
and linking them to even the smallest hair, skin, or fluid sample, usually for the purpose

19:10.080 --> 19:11.240
of forensics.

19:11.240 --> 19:17.520
Now there's a common misconception that the sheer size of the human genome makes DNA fingerprinting

19:17.520 --> 19:22.640
statistically irrefutable, and this is because some believe that it involves characterizing

19:22.640 --> 19:27.520
the entire genome of an individual and comparing it to yet another entire genome from a sample

19:27.520 --> 19:29.480
found elsewhere.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.200
But this is not the case.

19:31.200 --> 19:36.520
It can't be, since DNA testing was used long before Ventracompleted the human genome in

19:36.520 --> 19:37.520
2000.

19:37.520 --> 19:44.720
Now the truth is that a DNA fingerprint is a bit less reliable, but only slightly so.

19:44.720 --> 19:51.480
See, some of the DNA which makes us human is very similar from one person to the next.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.960
In particular, the portions of DNA which code for proteins, sometimes called coding

19:55.960 --> 19:59.400
DNA, is highly similar.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.080
But not all DNA codes for proteins.

20:02.080 --> 20:07.000
In fact, much of it is used as a structural support which holds the coding pieces of the

20:07.000 --> 20:13.360
sequence in their proper place or performs other non-coding functions.

20:13.360 --> 20:19.120
These structural support regions of DNA are sometimes called junk DNA.

20:19.120 --> 20:24.280
This is an unfortunate choice of language, because without it the genes which your body

20:24.280 --> 20:28.480
expresses to keep you alive wouldn't function properly, so this hardly sounds like junk

20:28.480 --> 20:29.980
to me.

20:29.980 --> 20:35.920
Nonetheless, the exact sequence in size of these regions is not as crucial as those comprising

20:35.920 --> 20:41.240
coding regions, and nature knows this, so she lets us get away with greater variability

20:41.240 --> 20:45.240
in these regions of our DNA.

20:45.240 --> 20:49.720
Now there are several methods for what is commonly referred to as DNA fingerprinting,

20:49.720 --> 20:53.920
and all of them focus on non-coding regions of DNA.

20:53.920 --> 20:59.160
In all of the techniques a special process called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR,

20:59.160 --> 21:04.200
is used to induce a DNA sample to replicate, creating a huge number of copies of these

21:04.200 --> 21:08.160
regions from just a small original sample.

21:08.160 --> 21:13.920
We call this process amplification, and this is why just a vanishingly small physical sample

21:13.920 --> 21:19.360
is all that is needed for this kind of technique.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.920
In early methods, a special enzyme known as a restriction enzyme was then added to the

21:23.920 --> 21:26.040
amplified mixture.

21:26.040 --> 21:32.160
The restriction enzyme cuts the amplified DNA, but only at very specific points defined

21:32.160 --> 21:37.040
by a sequence about a half a dozen or so bases long.

21:37.040 --> 21:43.680
This hydrolysis creates a set of fragments whose sizes are unique to an individual.

21:43.680 --> 21:48.660
The fragments are then analyzed using a technique known as gel electrophoresis, which uses an

21:48.660 --> 21:53.560
electrostatic potential to drag pieces of DNA through a thick gel.

21:53.560 --> 21:59.680
This sorts the fragments by size, producing a pattern which is ostensibly unique to the

21:59.680 --> 22:03.320
individual.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.760
More modern testing involves the selective amplification of non-coding regions of DNA

22:07.760 --> 22:12.240
from specific sequence starts, allowing us to bypass the use of a restriction enzyme

22:12.240 --> 22:13.800
altogether.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.520
But the essential concept remains the same.

22:16.520 --> 22:21.400
The statistical likelihood of the number and size of the fragments created by your so-called

22:21.400 --> 22:28.160
junk DNA and mine is vanishingly small.

22:28.160 --> 22:32.280
Another game-changing use found for DNA is in the production of proteins for chemical

22:32.280 --> 22:34.560
research and as medical therapies.

22:34.560 --> 22:38.840
We'll be discussing proteins in detail in our next lecture, but for now I want to focus

22:38.840 --> 22:43.760
on just one of them, called human insulin.

22:43.760 --> 22:49.920
Human insulin is a relatively small protein, but it is crucial to proper blood sugar management.

22:49.920 --> 22:54.700
And adults with type 2 diabetes suffer from an inability to produce the insulin needed

22:54.700 --> 22:59.520
to properly manage this critical solute in their blood.

22:59.520 --> 23:04.440
For decades, sufferers had to inject themselves with solutions of insulin taken from the pancreas

23:04.440 --> 23:10.000
of pigs, which is a great solution for most of the population, but a small variation in

23:10.000 --> 23:16.640
the pig version of insulin elicited an allergic reaction in a small fraction of patients.

23:16.640 --> 23:21.520
So it would be much better if we could offer perfect copies of human insulin for therapies

23:21.520 --> 23:24.400
like this.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.840
Enter DNA in the world of microbiology.

23:27.840 --> 23:32.400
For the past few decades, patients requiring insulin therapy get not the pig version of

23:32.400 --> 23:37.160
the protein, but an exact copy of human insulin, and it doesn't come from the pancreas of a

23:37.160 --> 23:38.680
human either.

23:38.680 --> 23:44.560
See, scientists take the DNA sequence, which codes for human insulin, and they insert it

23:44.560 --> 23:48.800
into the DNA sequence of E. coli bacteria.

23:48.800 --> 23:53.720
Now don't panic, this is a non-pathogenic strain of the bacteria, and it's dead long

23:53.720 --> 23:56.920
before the therapy is actually conducted on a person.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.320
See, the bacterial DNA is modified in three important ways.

24:02.320 --> 24:07.720
First, the native genes in the bacteria, which code for enzymes that chew up foreign materials,

24:07.720 --> 24:09.840
are removed.

24:09.840 --> 24:15.160
Second, the gene coding for the desired protein is then inserted.

24:15.160 --> 24:19.920
And third, a special trigger is placed right next to that gene that's been inserted.

24:19.920 --> 24:26.760
And in the presence of the proper signaling molecule, this trigger will induce the bacteria

24:26.920 --> 24:32.240
to express a huge quantity of that inserted gene.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.400
With no protective enzymes to clean up the huge quantity of protein being created, the

24:36.400 --> 24:39.040
bacteria are utterly helpless.

24:39.040 --> 24:44.760
They express and express and express until eventually they're not much more than microscopic

24:44.760 --> 24:47.360
bags of human insulin.

24:47.360 --> 24:52.320
And these bags are then broken open, and their contents collected for use in human insulin

24:52.320 --> 24:53.320
therapy.

24:53.880 --> 24:57.840
Now I'll bet you never thought you'd see the day when E. coli would be an asset to

24:57.840 --> 24:59.360
human health.

24:59.360 --> 25:04.840
In truth, it already has been for decades.

25:04.840 --> 25:09.880
The sensational impact that our understanding of DNA has on society makes it a central topic

25:09.880 --> 25:12.800
on any lecture covering nucleic acids.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.880
But I don't want you to fall into the trap of thinking that DNA and RNA are the only

25:16.880 --> 25:23.160
way that these powerful little molecules drive biological processes.

25:23.160 --> 25:28.480
Adenosyn, for example, is not only one of the four nucleotides used to produce RNA, but

25:28.480 --> 25:32.720
it's also one of the body's energy storage vehicles.

25:32.720 --> 25:38.280
When sugars are oxidized in cells, some of the energy produced is used to produce adenosyn

25:38.280 --> 25:43.240
triphosphate, which contains three phosphate ester groups attached to the five prime carbon

25:43.240 --> 25:46.520
of the nucleotide.

25:46.520 --> 25:51.160
The phosphate ester bonds are somewhat unstable, and that should be immediately evident from

25:51.160 --> 25:55.600
the concentration of all that negative charge in such a small space.

25:55.600 --> 25:59.400
So breaking just one of them can release a considerable amount of energy, not only as

25:59.400 --> 26:03.480
a result of hydrating a phosphate, but also relieving the clash of charges.

26:03.480 --> 26:11.720
In the process, about 31 kilojoules per mole or about 7.3 kilocalories per mole is released.

26:11.720 --> 26:17.680
Among other things, this ATP to ADP conversion serves as a quick source of stored energy

26:17.680 --> 26:19.760
for muscle contraction.

26:19.760 --> 26:24.480
This is the process which many athletic supplements claim to target, most notably the wildly

26:24.480 --> 26:26.800
successful supplement creatine.

26:26.800 --> 26:32.680
Now, creatine is used as a vehicle in the body to transport phosphate, which is transferred

26:32.680 --> 26:37.360
to ADP by an enzyme called creatine kinase.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.920
It's this function that some believe gives creatine supplementation the ability to increase

26:41.920 --> 26:46.360
endurance during exercise.

26:46.360 --> 26:50.280
Whether creatine supplementation improves physical performance significantly is still

26:50.280 --> 26:52.120
a matter of some debate.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.400
But what is inarguable is that it generates hundreds of millions of dollars of annual

26:56.400 --> 27:07.840
sales in the U.S. alone, and it's all based on its ability to phosphorylate ADP.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.680
So let's summarize.

27:09.680 --> 27:16.080
In this lecture, we dug deep into the structure of some familiar biopolymers, RNA and DNA.

27:16.080 --> 27:21.200
We looked at the structure of ribose and its beta-D-pheronose form, which makes up part

27:21.200 --> 27:24.160
of the backbone of RNA.

27:24.160 --> 27:30.480
We saw how four different aglaicones attached to this ring lead to the four RNA nucleosides,

27:30.480 --> 27:37.520
which we call cytosine and uredine, the pyrimidine-based ones, and adenine and guanine, the purine-based

27:37.520 --> 27:41.000
nucleosides.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.880
Then we took a look at the phosphate ester linkage, which starts with the 5-prime carbon

27:44.880 --> 27:48.800
of a nucleoside, making it a nucleotide.

27:48.800 --> 27:53.080
When connected to another nucleotide through its 3-prime hydroxyl, we have the makings

27:53.080 --> 27:59.320
of RNA, the molecule responsible for translating the genetic code into proteins.

27:59.320 --> 28:03.080
After that, we considered the source of that genetic code, DNA.

28:03.080 --> 28:08.360
We saw how DNA is tailored to provide a long-lasting informational template by the removal of the

28:08.360 --> 28:14.120
2-prime hydroxyl group from ribose to slow hydrolysis, and by replacement of uracil with

28:14.120 --> 28:18.920
thymine to provide a system which can be easily repaired when cytosine is damaged by

28:18.920 --> 28:22.920
deamination.

28:22.920 --> 28:27.240
We saw how the double helix was discovered, and how it explained so much about the previous

28:27.240 --> 28:31.680
90 years of observations by geneticists and chemists.

28:31.680 --> 28:36.040
Next we looked at how DNA can be used as a substitute for fingerprinting, providing

28:36.040 --> 28:40.600
a much more easily left and much more accurately matched identifier for victims and perpetrators

28:40.600 --> 28:42.920
of crimes.

28:42.920 --> 28:47.280
We also saw how genetics has given us a way to use DNA to manipulate the biochemistry

28:47.280 --> 28:53.160
of bacteria, exploiting their biochemistry to create therapeutic agents for humans.

28:53.160 --> 28:58.240
And finally, we looked at how nucleotides themselves can serve as energy storage units

28:58.240 --> 29:00.120
in living systems.

29:00.120 --> 29:06.920
Specifically, we saw how the conversion from ATP to ADP releases a large amount of energy,

29:06.920 --> 29:11.440
which the body can use for muscle contraction, and how creatine and creatine phosphate can

29:11.440 --> 29:14.800
help to reload this reaction so it can be used again.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.000
This prompts athletes around the world to munch down grams of this organic compound

29:19.000 --> 29:22.840
on a daily basis.

29:22.840 --> 29:27.720
In our next lecture, we will concern ourselves with the downstream end of biology's central

29:27.720 --> 29:30.280
dogma, proteins.

29:30.280 --> 29:33.960
We will learn about the structure of amino acids and how they come together, both in

29:33.960 --> 29:38.840
biological systems and in the lab, to create the powerful enzyme catalysts that I've described

29:38.840 --> 29:40.360
to you in this lecture.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.320
I'll see you then.
