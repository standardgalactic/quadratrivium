0	15760	Today, I'm going to show you how to do the impossible.
15760	20840	Okay, it's a little bit dramatic, but not entirely inaccurate.
20840	26240	Now what would you say if I told you that I know how to deprotonate an alkane?
27200	34160	Now remember, the hydrogens of an aliphatic alkane, like the hydrogens in a molecule of ethane, for example,
34160	41840	are the single weakest acids of any compound that we've studied to date, with a pKa of somewhere around 60.
41840	46240	Now that's literally trillions of times less acidic than alkenes,
46240	50960	which are themselves trillions of times less acidic than alkynes,
50960	55680	which are an extraordinarily weak acid in their own right.
55760	64720	But if we could deprotonate an alkane, just imagine what a powerful nucleophile the resulting carbanion would be.
64720	69440	It's a tempting target, isn't it? But how do we do it?
69440	74240	So if we were to have a go at creating such a motif using proton transfer,
74240	79440	we would need a base whose conjugate acid has a pKa of at least 60.
79440	84560	But what would such a base be? Right, the only option would be deprotonated alkane,
84560	88560	so we're right back at our original problem.
88560	92320	Okay, you've got me here. This is a little bit of a trick question.
92320	99680	It really is just about impossible to deprotonate an alkane under any kind of sensible laboratory conditions.
99680	105120	But there is a class of compounds which can be made to act like carbanions.
105120	111120	In order to do this, we have to abandon the safety and simplicity of the first few rows of the periodic table.
111200	115680	We have to use a remarkable marriage between the usual suspects of organic chemistry,
115680	122400	like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and a newcomer to our discussion, metals.
122400	130480	Today we're going to investigate a small slice of a field known as organometallic chemistry.
130480	138080	Now, before I continue, I need to advise you that we're only going to look at a very small set of organometallic compounds and reactions.
138080	143040	Organometallic chemistry is used in a wide variety of applications, as we'll soon see,
143040	147200	and it's a science worthy of its own graduate level course when considered in its entirety.
150160	155120	Organometallic chemistry as a proper science got its start in a familiar place,
155120	159920	the lab of Alexander Butlarov at the University of Kazan in 1800s Russia.
161520	166080	Butlarov had noticed that dialkyl zinc reagents, or chemicals containing
166080	171040	two organic alkyl groups bonded directly to a zinc atom through their carbons,
171920	176880	could be used to produce alcohols from ketones by transferring their alkyl group
176880	178960	to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.
180560	185760	No doubt excited about the prospect of developing a new method for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds,
186480	190480	Butlarov passed this project on to his protege, Alexander Zetsiv.
190880	197760	Zetsiv was able to apply his chemistry to several new substrates, but always with limited success.
198880	203680	These zinc-based reagents proved to be unpredictable and difficult to work with,
203680	207680	and as the sun set on Zetsiv's career, he seemed no closer to developing
207680	210800	reliable methods or rules for their use in synthesis.
211840	216000	It would appear that this particular line of research was destined for obscurity.
216800	225280	Then, in 1900, a young French graduate student by the name of Victor Grignard
225280	229440	blew the lid off of organometallic chemistry when he devised a powerful,
230240	235840	versatile, and adaptable organometallic reagent for use in the reliable production
235840	239200	of carbon-carbon bonds, which had eluded Butlarov and Zetsiv.
239920	246320	Grignard's story is truly inspirational for anyone struggling with their schooling.
247360	250800	He took a long and winding road through his college education,
250800	253680	and after starting as a secondary education student,
253680	258880	he failed to pass a standardized math examination, which landed him in the military for a short time.
260160	264240	When he returned from his service, he managed to move ahead with his education,
264240	268080	ultimately finding himself working in the lab of Philippe Barbier
268080	271760	at the University of Lyon in France in the late 1890s.
274800	280640	It was there, in Barbier's lab at Lyon, conducting experiments for his doctoral dissertation
280640	285760	that Grignard acted on a hunch, replacing the zinc from the only widely known class
285760	291520	of organometallics of the day with what he believed would be more reactive magnesium.
292480	296880	One of his first reactions was the combination of isoamyl bromide
297440	300240	with magnesium followed by carbon dioxide.
301520	306080	And the reaction produced what Grignard himself described as, quoting here,
306080	311840	a colorless liquid, distinctly of acidic character, with an odor of perspiration,
311840	313440	and at the same time of butter.
316400	319360	So it sounds like Grignard was really suffering for his science,
319440	323840	having chosen the reaction which produces the fragrance reminiscent of sweaty butter.
325200	330320	Nonetheless, I'm sure he was glad that he did, since his work not only earned him his doctorate,
330320	333200	but one half of the Nobel Prize 12 years later.
333920	339520	His co-recipient was his countryman Sabatier for his metal-catalyzed hydrogen addition reactions.
343680	348320	So let's take a look at a Grignard reaction. In fact, one of the original Grignard reactions
348320	350160	conducted by Victor Grignard himself.
352720	356800	Now this is a bit of an oversimplification, but it all holds true what's going on.
357840	363040	Victor Grignard started with the reagent isoamyl bromide, which is an alkyl halide.
363600	368720	To this he added magnesium. So when mixed with magnesium, isoamyl bromide
369680	375360	creates this new compound where the magnesium has been inserted between the carbon and bromine atoms.
376320	382640	So the consequence of this is, we placed our metal next to a carbon.
383600	388080	Now here's where organometallic chemistry really starts to differ from what we're used to seeing.
389280	395840	Magnesium has a very low electronegativity. And because of that, it creates a very strong
395840	402080	dipole with the negative end pointed towards the carbon. So this very high electron density
402080	407520	near the carbon to which the magnesium is bonded makes it act more like a carbon ion.
408320	413520	So we can think of it as being this even though we know that this species is very difficult to generate.
414880	422080	So Grignard mixed this Grignard reagent which acts like a carbon ion with carbon dioxide,
422720	427520	which has a very electrophilic carbon, the only carbon in the molecule of course.
428480	434240	So when we combine a very powerful nucleophile which acts like a carbon ion with a very good
434240	439280	electrophile such as carbon dioxide, we should all be well aware of what's going to happen next.
440400	447760	Nucleophilic attack creates a new carbon-carbon bond. And acidifying gives us our final product,
448400	454960	isocoprolic acid or isoamyl acid. Of course when Grignard made it, his reagent was not a
455040	459840	carbon ion but an alkyl magnesium bromide reagent, which means that we also have to
459840	465760	account for the magnesium in the bromine. Now what happens to them during the nucleophilic attack
465760	472080	is a bit complicated and case specific. But at the end of the reaction, the byproduct is magnesium
472080	479840	hydroxy bromide. So here we can see one of the driving forces behind the Grignard reaction.
480800	488160	Notice that what started as a neutral magnesium atom is now a magnesium 2 plus ion with a full octet.
489680	495680	So powerful is the desire for magnesium to have that octet that it can be used to drive carbon-carbon
495680	503200	bond formation. Grignard continued his research and discovered that his new nucleophile could be
503200	510240	used reliably to produce acids from carbon dioxide, secondary alcohols from aldehydes,
511840	519760	and also tertiary alcohols from ketones. In fact, Grignards are extremely versatile offering not
519760	529040	only ways to make alcohols and acids but also aldehydes from amides, tertiary alcohols from esters,
529040	534960	and many, many other reactions. It seems that when Grignard reagents are involved,
534960	538160	it's pretty much open season on anything with a carbonyl group.
541520	546480	But there is much more to the Grignard reaction. Easy though it is to run, there are certain
546480	551280	special considerations which must be taken to ensure its success, two in particular.
551280	561280	First, the Grignard reagent itself is only stable in ether solvents like diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.
563040	568960	Second, the reaction mixture has to be kept extraordinarily free of protic solvents including
568960	574880	water. So let's consider each of these two restraints individually then collectively.
575040	583840	One of the great limitations of Grignard reactions is that alkyl magnesium halide reagents
583840	591120	can only form in ether solvents. But why is this? The answer lies in the ability of solvents to
591120	597200	coordinate metals. Now what I mean by this is that the solvent must have oxygen atoms with
597200	602880	lone pairs which can stabilize the Grignard by donating electrons to form a stabilizing
602880	612000	metal oxygen interaction in solution. That alkyl magnesium halide motif is so polar that it needs
612000	617120	a solvent which will be able to arrange its dipole beneficially to interact with the positive
617120	623600	charge density at the magnesium. For this purpose ether solvents are just the ticket.
625120	629840	Nonpolar solvents like hexanes or benzene are not capable of forming these kinds of
629840	633440	stabilizing interactions so they are clearly out as a solvent.
636560	642640	So Grignard reagents are polar. They're really polar. We get that. So why can't we use more
642640	647840	polar solvents like ethanol to dissolve them for reactions? Certainly ethanol has enough
647840	655040	polar oomph to get this reagent to form in solution, right? Well it does but with one devastating caveat.
656000	663920	Unlike ether, ethanol is protic and has a pKa of about 17. Remember, Grignards react like
663920	673360	carbon ions whose conjugate acid has a pKa of about 60. So a Grignard reagent might form an ethanol
673360	678960	for just a split second before reacting with that ethanol to form ethoxide and a hydrocarbon.
679920	684480	Clearly this is not a good way to make a Grignard. Now ethers like diethyl ether
684480	689520	and tetrahydrofuran are special because they strike a balance between their ability to
689520	696080	solvate a Grignard with their inability to react with it. And this is why they have been the preferred
696080	703760	solvent for this sort of reaction from 1900 right up until today. But using ether and THF
703760	711840	tetrahydrofuran isn't enough because these solvents are slightly polar. So ether can dissolve a small
711840	719040	bit of water itself. In fact, when left opened a bottle of ether will absorb about 1.5% of its
719040	726000	own mass in water from the atmosphere. So a bottle of ether left open by a careless colleague or
726000	730720	even simply one which has been opened and closed enough times to allow a small amount of air into
730720	740080	it can contain enough water to effectively ruin a Grignard synthesis. Our solution to this is to use
740160	746560	ether which has been chemically dried before use. And we accomplish this through the use of inorganic
746560	752960	drying agents like magnesium sulfate or a special kind of material called molecular sieves which
752960	757760	act like little mineral sponges absorbing the water from the ether and trapping it as a solid
757760	766560	complex which we can simply filter or decant to separate. Grignard reagents are an incredibly
767040	771920	versatile tool for attaching new carbons to electrophiles. So let's take a moment and summarize
771920	778320	just a few of the tools in the Grignard toolbox and their limitations. First, Grignards are made
778320	784560	using alkyl halide and magnesium metal mixed in an ethereal solvent. But they're not limited to
784560	791280	aliphatic R groups. Commonly used Grignards include unsaturated groups also like allyl
791280	797600	magnesium bromide and phenyl magnesium bromide. Grignard reagents provide a way to
797600	802640	access the kind of reactivity we would expect to get from an aliphatic carbanion without the
802640	808320	fuss of having to deprotonate one of the least acidic hydrogens known to man, the alkane CH bond.
810880	814080	Grignards can be reacted with carbon dioxide to form organic acids,
814640	819520	with aldehydes to form secondary alcohols and with ketones to form tertiary alcohols.
820480	826000	They can attack secondary imines to form secondary amides with varying degrees of branching.
827760	832960	Carbonyl compounds with leaving groups like acid chlorides attached to the carbon can undergo
832960	838240	multiple attacks by Grignard reagents, resulting in the addition of two alkyl groups giving us
838240	845840	an alternate route to make secondary or tertiary alcohols. So far today we've discussed the use
845840	851440	of metals to activate hydrocarbons and turn them into nucleophiles. Of course, organometallic
851440	856560	chemistry is far more varied and complex as a subject than just this small window on the science
856560	862240	would appear to imply. Organometallics have found their first few applications in the world of
862240	867920	organic synthesis, but their real potential cannot be appreciated until we take a look at another one
867920	876720	of their uses, catalysis. The use of organometallics harkens back to our old friend Sabatier, who
876720	881680	developed the technique for hydrogenating fats using platinum metal and who incidentally shared
881680	888160	the Nobel Prize with Victor Grignard. In modern laboratories, the reduction of alkenes to
888160	894880	alkanes is still a widely used technique, but the heterogeneous nature of Sabatier's method
894880	901520	leaves a lot to be desired. Hydrogenating double bonds at the surface of a solid catalyst may work
901520	908720	well on industrial scales, but in the laboratory a reaction which takes place in solution is far
908720	917520	more desirable. If we had access to a homogeneous catalyst, one which could be dissolved in
917520	923040	organic solvents along with substrates, we could run reactions much more efficiently and cleanly
923040	929840	in the lab, wasting less reagents and amplifying our yields. But the problem with this is that
929840	934880	metals themselves are not generally soluble in the kinds of solvents that one would use to dissolve
934880	943440	an alkene. But in 1966, a British chemist by the name of Jeffrey Wilkinson published a paper
943440	950320	outlining a way to solubilize a large transition metal like rhodium by bonding it to organic
950320	959600	molecules which we call ligands. These ligands are specially designed to be strong Lewis bases
959600	965360	which donate stabilizing electron pairs to the metal ion, forming a complex which gives it the
965360	970400	solubility characteristics of the ligands while retaining the catalytic activities of the metal.
972080	976400	Wilkinson's work is generally regarded as the seminal work in the field of organometallic
976400	981360	chemistry. His discoveries in this field launched an age of investigation into metal
981360	988400	ligand interactions that continues to this day in labs around the world. Wilkinson's work
988400	992640	has inspired the creation of some really exciting and exotic looking complexes.
993520	997120	You'll see extensions of his work in such life-changing compounds as
997120	1003040	contrast reagents used for MRI imaging. The magnetic properties of many large metals make
1003040	1009600	them useful as tools to enhance the sensitivity of MRI imaging machines. But the problem is
1009600	1015200	that most heavy metals are highly toxic by themselves or don't accumulate in the necessary
1015200	1020800	tissues for them to be useful. The gadolinium ion is one perfect example of this.
1023280	1029680	Now when gadolinium is in its plus three state, it's a powerful atomic-sized magnet
1030640	1035520	and its presence is easily detected by such complex magnetic instruments as the MRI you
1035520	1042400	may see in a hospital. Unfortunately the gadolinium itself is very toxic and doesn't accumulate well
1042400	1050640	where we need it. So one solution to this problem is to complex metal ions with organic ligands
1050640	1056160	which render them far less toxic and also can cause them to selectively accumulate in areas
1056160	1062720	of interest in the body assisting in the imaging process. A classic example of this is the complex
1062720	1070480	of gadolinium-3 which is marketed under the trade name Dota-REM. Now gadolinium itself is an f-block
1070480	1077840	metal and its three plus ion contains seven electrons filling its f-sub shell or its outermost
1077920	1085120	sub-shell. Now electrons like their space so those seven outermost electrons in the f-block
1085120	1091600	of or in the f orbitals of gadolinium are unpaired and this gives it a tremendously powerful
1091600	1098240	magnetization. So this tiny little ion of gadolinium is producing an extremely powerful
1098240	1106000	magnetic field but only at atomic distances. Now Dota-REM is an ingenious way to exploit the
1106000	1111600	magnetic properties of gadolinium ions like this without dealing with toxicity issues and
1111600	1118080	solubility problems. Now this is accomplished using a complex organic ligand which looks like this.
1119840	1127120	Now we call molecules with large rings of many atoms like this one macro cycles and the key to
1127120	1133040	Dota-REM's safety and efficacy is not only this macrocyclic ligand which sits on top of the metal
1133680	1140640	but it allows it to attach its carboxylates around the edges. So these nitrogens and carboxylates
1140640	1147920	contain lone perelectrons and regions of dense negative charge which coordinate to the gadolinium
1147920	1155920	three ion. So this forms a cage around the ion preventing it from reacting with anything as it
1155920	1161760	circulates in your bloodstream and the ligands also have the effect of changing the solubility
1161760	1167120	characteristics of the complex presenting an organic phase instead of an ionic phase
1168000	1176000	and this helps the Dota-REM accumulate in tumor cells. Now the final piece of the puzzle is this
1176000	1182000	last little bit of space on the bottom which is complexed to the oxygen of a water molecule.
1183520	1188080	So we place our water molecule under there you can see how close it is to the protected gadolinium
1188080	1196480	ion. The proximity of the water molecule to that gadolinium three makes it very easy to detect
1196480	1203200	using an MRI machine and physicians can then use MRI techniques to look for the magnetic effects
1203200	1210160	of the gadolinium three on the water molecule inside the patient thereby helping them locate
1210240	1218720	an image problem areas. Now not to be outdone by modern chemists nature herself has also devised
1218720	1224400	ways to use organic molecules which help not just humans but all other known species to get the
1224400	1228480	benefits of the chemistry of metals while coping with their inherent toxicities.
1231120	1237040	So let's take a look at a subunit of the structure of human hemoglobin it's a pretty big molecule
1237040	1244880	isn't it but if I remove all the protein atoms we see that leftover is a large cyclic ligand
1244880	1251360	known as a porphyrin and this porphyrin coordinates an iron atom in the center from four planar
1251360	1257920	positions. This metal ligand complex is commonly called heme and is the namesake of the oxygen
1257920	1264560	carrying protein hemoglobin. Now free iron is toxic in the blood but it's the coordination
1264560	1270000	of these four nitrogen atoms and also two histidines which come in from the protein itself
1270640	1277440	which give this molecule its life-sustaining ability to bind transport and release oxygen in the body
1277440	1284400	without being toxic to us. Now the heme ligand not only plays a role in oxygen carrying ability
1284400	1291600	of hemoglobin but its highly conjugated structure also makes it highly colored. Now when the iron
1291600	1296960	with the iron in place rather the heme takes on a familiar deep red color that we associate with
1296960	1305040	oxygenated blood but when physical trauma causes cells in the body to rupture and die the exposed
1305040	1312000	heme from their hemoglobin has to be cleaned up and this is done by enzymes which first break open
1312000	1319200	the ligand and this breaking of the ring forms a new compound known as biliverdin. It's a dark
1319200	1327280	green colored compound. The biliverdin is then further reduced into a compound known as bilirubin
1327280	1333200	which is yellow in color and this is the process of cleaning up a porphyrin ligand and it's also
1333200	1338480	what we commonly associate with the process of bruising. So the colors that you see underneath
1338480	1344320	the skin are actually the free heme from the traumatized cells being cleaned up by your own body
1344320	1351280	but nature's gone far beyond just using iron ions and porphyrin ligands to get jobs done.
1352160	1360400	Another great example is hemosyanin. Now rather than hemoglobin hemosyanin still transports oxygen
1360400	1366000	does this in crustaceans crabs and lobsters those sorts of animals but it does so using two copper
1366000	1371920	ions coordinated directly to a protein matrix which gives these lobsters crabs and other marine
1371920	1378080	animals a very different blood chemistry than mammals. So in this case the protein itself
1378080	1384400	is acting as the ligand for the copper ions which carry oxygen. Let's look at one more example
1385360	1394400	vitamin B12. Now vitamin B12 includes a compound called cobalamin and as the name implies cobalamin
1394400	1401120	has a cobalt ion complex in its center. Now this vitamin is used in the body to conduct
1401120	1406160	essential functions including synthesis of folic acid and again it's all dependent on having the
1406160	1415600	ligand in place to coordinate that metal. So nature one ups the organic chemists once again
1416320	1421360	having devised ligands far more complex than those of Wilkinson's catalysts or even dotarem
1422000	1425840	and they're capable of conducting much more powerful directed chemistry.
1426400	1432240	But why stop at one metal? Yet another of nature's chemists who continues to embarrass us all is the
1432240	1437760	nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria which live in the root nodules of legumes like soy.
1439440	1445440	The molecule that they produce which allows them to fix nitrogen is a protein called nitrogenase
1446080	1452400	and it contains not just one metal ion but multiple clusters of them in complex with sulfur atoms.
1453200	1458080	Scientists have discovered and characterized two different forms of nitrogenase both of which
1458080	1464880	rely on iron to function, one of them exclusively and another one in concert with molybdenum.
1466880	1472080	Now even though these metalloprotein structures have been well known for decades their ability
1472080	1477280	to accomplish the same reaction at room temperature and pressures that Haber could only
1478240	1483040	accomplish at extremely high pressures and temperatures remains unexplained even today.
1484800	1488080	And when someone finally unlocks the secret to the chemistry of these large
1488640	1494080	powerful organometallic molecules the impact it will have on the world food supply
1494080	1497680	is likely to be as great as cold fusion would be for the power industry.
1501760	1505360	So today we started with one of Butler-Rov's projects in the 1800s.
1505680	1511360	We took a look at how he and Zetzev conducted some of the very first organometallic experiments.
1513040	1518160	Then we spent some time covering the reaction developed by Victor Grineard in 1900 which bears
1518160	1523360	his name and won him the Nobel Prize and also breathed new life into the floundering science
1523360	1531040	of organometallic chemistry. We talked about how his alkyl magnesium halides had the properties
1531120	1537920	of carbanions including strong nucleophilic character and extreme basicity. We covered how
1537920	1543040	this nucleophilic character makes no carbonyl safe in the presence of a Grineard leading to a
1543040	1547040	large library of potential substrates which can be used in conjunction with them.
1549600	1555120	We saw how Jeffrey Wilkinson is usually regarded as the father of modern organometallic chemistry
1555120	1560400	having devised a method to get rhodium and platinum of Sabatier's heterogeneous catalysts
1560400	1564560	into solution making them more effective homogeneous catalysts.
1566400	1570720	We then advanced on Wilkinson's ideas and took them into the biological realm seeing how
1570720	1577280	compounds like dota rem could get highly magnetic but extremely toxic gadolinium ions
1577280	1581120	safely into the bloodstream of cancer patients where they can help to detect tumors.
1581680	1586800	Finally, we indulged in Mother Nature a bit more and took a look at some pretty representations of
1586800	1593040	metal-containing proteins like hemoglobin and hemocyanins, mitrogenases and some vitamins
1593040	1598000	all of which carry out spectacularly focused chemistry in one way or another helping to
1598000	1605360	sustain the lives of those creatures that use them. We've come a long way from the simplest of
1605680	1614400	organic compounds, methane, to organometallics the size of nitrogenase. We've nearly run the gamut
1614400	1622000	of molecular size but there is one more class of organic compound to consider, the undisputed king
1622000	1627680	of molecular size, polymers, and they're the last class of organic compounds on our list.
1629040	1633760	Next time we're going to take a look at some world-changing polymers, how they were discovered,
1634320	1639200	how they're made, and how their size and modular composition make them an extremely
1639200	1644640	versatile class of compounds. I'll see you then.
