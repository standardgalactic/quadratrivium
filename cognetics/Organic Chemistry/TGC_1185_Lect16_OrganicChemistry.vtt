WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.120
Well, last time I gave an unfair amount of attention to beer when we had our lecture

00:16.120 --> 00:18.240
on aldehydes and ketones.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.440
So in this lecture, I'm going to try to give wine its due attention.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.960
Now most of us know the conversion of grapes into wine introduces new flavors and smells.

00:27.960 --> 00:33.680
And we also know that as wine ages, its flavor profile and bouquet are expected to change,

00:33.680 --> 00:40.400
usually for the better at first with flavors mellowing and pleasing aromas intensifying.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.320
Now the complexity of wine starts with the many chemical processes which take place

00:44.320 --> 00:46.280
during fermentation.

00:46.280 --> 00:52.400
One of these is the formation of new pleasant smelling organic compounds called esters.

00:52.400 --> 00:57.880
Esters and also organic acids contain a functional group or motif that we can look at here on

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
our hologram.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.360
So let's pull that up now.

01:00.360 --> 01:05.800
Now the motif that defines these two classes of compounds has a carbonyl, which would be

01:05.800 --> 01:10.440
a carbon double bonded to an oxygen, just like we saw in aldehydes and ketones.

01:10.440 --> 01:15.360
But the carbonyl carbon is also bonded to an sp3 oxygen.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.280
So this motif is distinct from our ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and ethers in the sense

01:21.280 --> 01:27.400
that it combines more than one oxygen atom into a single organic motif.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.440
Now we can see this motif in compounds, which give wine some of its pleasing aromas.

01:32.440 --> 01:38.920
For example, this molecule is pentyl acetate, and it has the aroma of pears.

01:38.920 --> 01:44.000
But if we change a little bit of the R groups attached to this motif, we get ethyl butyrate,

01:44.000 --> 01:51.480
which is reminiscent of pineapple, or octyl acetate, which is more of an orange like aroma.

01:51.480 --> 01:57.200
So you can see that they all contain the same internal structure with the carbonyl and the

01:57.200 --> 01:59.040
sp3 oxygen.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.600
But what's changing here is the identity of the attached R groups.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.440
But the complexity doesn't stop there.

02:04.440 --> 02:09.960
See, over time, esters and others like them can interconvert chemically inside the bottle.

02:09.960 --> 02:14.280
And this creates a changing mixture, which stimulates your nose and your palate differently

02:14.280 --> 02:21.080
through time, making the experience that a wine offers change as the years go by.

02:21.080 --> 02:26.720
Now another type of compound, which can affect the flavors of wines, are organic acids, and

02:26.720 --> 02:31.060
they share a very similar structure to esters.

02:31.060 --> 02:36.040
So let's go back to that motif we just looked at, where we have a carbonyl to which there

02:36.040 --> 02:39.120
is also bonded an sp3 oxygen.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.400
Now keeping this motif in mind, see if you can find it in the following molecules.

02:43.400 --> 02:49.760
This is tartaric acid, which is responsible for giving wine a sort of tart flavor.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.720
But if we change the molecule up, we get malic acid.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.880
And malic acid is actually the flavor of green apples.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.280
We can change the structure slightly again and get lactic acid, which is responsible

03:02.280 --> 03:07.920
for more of a milky flavor in mouthfeel in wines.

03:07.920 --> 03:13.360
So just like esters, these acids are formed, consumed, and even interconverted as the contents

03:13.360 --> 03:20.120
of a bottle of wine age, making the same vintage taste different from one year to the next.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.520
So with a little bit of time, organic chemistry can improve that bottle of wine that you so

03:24.520 --> 03:29.120
carefully sought out during your last visit to Napa.

03:29.120 --> 03:33.640
But an overly protective connoisseur might hold that bottle a little bit too long with

03:33.640 --> 03:36.520
disastrous consequences.

03:36.520 --> 03:41.520
See wine's a complex mixture of many classes of organic compounds, including quite a bit

03:41.520 --> 03:43.920
of the alcohol ethanol.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.280
Now I venture to say that most of us already knew that much, but what you may not realize

03:48.280 --> 03:53.040
is that in addition to all those pleasant tasting and smelling components, every wine

03:53.040 --> 03:58.400
bottle also has a sinister gang of microbial chemists at work in it.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.400
Microbes like this one, called acetobacter.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.160
Now acetobacter quickly set up residents in grapes when they're still in the vine.

04:07.160 --> 04:14.120
And they're practically impossible to remove, and they simply love to drink your wine.

04:14.120 --> 04:20.000
So the growth of these bacteria is held at bay by the careful exclusion of vital oxygen

04:20.000 --> 04:24.360
and the addition of some sodium metabysulfite.

04:24.360 --> 04:30.500
Sodium metabysulfite is a flavorless inorganic material which slowly decomposes into antibacterial

04:30.500 --> 04:36.360
sulfur dioxide under acidic conditions, inhibiting microbial growth while not particularly affecting

04:36.360 --> 04:39.080
the flavor of the wine.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.920
But slowly with time and just a little bit of oxygen permeating the seal of the bottle,

04:43.920 --> 04:50.120
acetobacter eventually overwhelms the preservative and metabolically converts the wine's ethanol

04:50.120 --> 04:53.760
into acetic acid for energy.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.840
This process destroys the flavor profile that the vinter works so tirelessly to create

04:58.840 --> 05:04.960
and demotes your favorite bottle of wine to the ranks of what we commonly call wine vinegar.

05:04.960 --> 05:10.760
Now we've already considered the oxidation of ethanol to ethanol also known as acid aldehyde.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.960
This is a process which chemists perform on the bench and which you perform in your own

05:13.960 --> 05:17.120
bloodstream after a night on the town.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.440
Today, among other things, we're going to take a look at the next step in this oxidation

05:21.440 --> 05:28.160
process, that of acid aldehyde to acetic acid.

05:28.160 --> 05:33.680
Now all of these compounds, the complex esters and acids that form that perfect bottle, as

05:33.680 --> 05:39.200
well as the acetic acid, which ultimately causes its devise, are members of a subset

05:39.200 --> 05:44.720
of organic compounds which contain not one, but two oxygen atoms.

05:44.720 --> 05:50.080
But these two types of compounds don't find their only home in the beverage industry.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.720
Carboxylic acids are a primary component of compounds that we come into contact with every

05:53.720 --> 06:00.160
day, including many detergents like the loric acid you might find in your shampoo bottle,

06:00.160 --> 06:06.280
the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen, and the commonly used food preservative benzoic

06:06.280 --> 06:09.080
acid.

06:09.080 --> 06:14.560
Esters include compounds like isoamyl acetate, the fragrance and flavor component of bananas,

06:14.560 --> 06:19.480
and also, coincidentally, a signaling hormone which is released from the stinger of an attacking

06:19.480 --> 06:22.080
bee to call for backup.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.880
So I'm guessing this means that beekeepers aren't particularly fond of banana flavored

06:25.880 --> 06:28.920
anything, especially on a work day.

06:28.920 --> 06:34.400
Now esters also find use in the drug industry in a cleverly designed class of compounds

06:34.400 --> 06:40.960
known as pro-drugs, which include heart medications, antivirals, and more.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.440
Because they're at the end of the line in many natural oxidative processes, simple

06:45.440 --> 06:50.280
carboxylic acids were discovered very early in the history of organic chemistry.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.120
So some of them have common names which will actually serve as the basis for their more

06:54.120 --> 06:58.880
modern IUPAC substituent prefixes, so let's take a look at those now.

06:58.880 --> 07:03.240
Let's start just by looking at the four simplest carboxylic acids.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.560
The simplest of all is formic acid.

07:05.560 --> 07:10.400
This takes its name from the Latin word for ant, because it was first isolated from the

07:10.400 --> 07:14.680
venom of fire ants.

07:14.680 --> 07:20.200
Another common carboxylic acid is acetic acid, which gets its name from the Latin word for

07:20.200 --> 07:24.680
acid itself, because this was the very first compound which was characterized which had

07:24.680 --> 07:28.360
these properties.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.840
Next is propionic acid.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.960
Propionic acid takes its name from the Greek, meaning first fat.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.640
This is because it was the first organic acid which was isolated which wouldn't dissolve

07:39.640 --> 07:41.840
in water.

07:41.840 --> 07:46.600
And finally, the next largest would be butyric acid, which gets its name because it was first

07:46.600 --> 07:49.720
isolated from butter.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.720
Now you can see the commonalities here in all of these structures.

07:52.720 --> 07:59.880
They all contain the essential carbonyl group, to which is bonded an sp3 oxygen.

07:59.880 --> 08:04.360
And there's one more crucial part of the structure which makes them carboxylic acids.

08:04.360 --> 08:09.920
That is that they have a hydrogen attached to that sp3 oxygen.

08:09.920 --> 08:15.720
So this is the structural motif which makes carboxylic acids carboxylic acids.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.400
So now that we have a better understanding of the structures of carboxylic acids and

08:19.400 --> 08:23.560
how some of them are named, let's take a look at some esters of similar size and you'll

08:23.560 --> 08:29.760
probably notice quite a few of these names reproducing themselves.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.520
Take the example of the simplest possible ester, methylformane.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.360
Notice the name, formate.

08:35.360 --> 08:42.040
It gets that name because our ester contains an R group which is simply one carbon, methyl,

08:42.040 --> 08:46.040
and it also has this carbonyl carbon which is by itself.

08:46.040 --> 08:50.920
So one carbon sort of gets this prefix form a lot of the time.

08:50.920 --> 08:55.120
So methylformate is a natural choice for the name.

08:55.120 --> 09:01.920
Very similarly we have ethylacetate which takes the acetate name from the two carbons

09:01.920 --> 09:06.520
that are in the carbonyl containing portion of the structure.

09:06.520 --> 09:11.560
Next is propylpropionate and just like that butylbutyrate.

09:11.560 --> 09:16.000
Now it's not necessary for both sides of the ester to have the same number of atoms as

09:16.000 --> 09:19.880
they do in my examples here, for example 4 and 4, 3 and 3.

09:19.880 --> 09:23.560
They could just as easily be a mixture of two different chain lengths.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.400
But the nomenclature system would stay basically the same.

09:27.400 --> 09:33.920
And what defines them all is the presence of a carbonyl group attached to an sp3 oxygen

09:33.920 --> 09:43.640
but this time the sp3 oxygen contains that second R group rather than a hydrogen.

09:43.640 --> 09:48.400
So let's take a look at how we name acids and esters from an IUPAC perspective as opposed

09:48.400 --> 09:50.080
to their traditional names.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.160
We're going to use the rules that we have devised before for many other classes of

09:54.160 --> 09:59.160
organic compounds but in the case of acids we always want to be sure that the carbonyl

09:59.160 --> 10:04.080
carbon is included in the parent chain because it's a functional group.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.800
We always want to give it the lowest number for the same reason and we'll name our parent

10:07.800 --> 10:14.440
compound using the suffix oic acid to indicate the presence of this functional group.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.400
So let's work an example here.

10:16.400 --> 10:21.000
Let's try to name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.120
First thing I'm going to do is find my organic acid group here it is.

10:25.120 --> 10:30.240
And then I'm going to label the longest attached carbon chain which I haven't done yet.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.240
Did you catch this?

10:31.240 --> 10:35.520
There's a longer chain so I have to use this one as my parent.

10:35.520 --> 10:40.960
So this will be a pentanoic acid because it's a five carbon chain terminating in an

10:40.960 --> 10:44.440
organic acid functional group.

10:44.480 --> 10:50.160
I have one substituent with a single carbon so this is a methyl substituent.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.920
And again because the carboxylic acid is a functional group it receives priority in

10:53.920 --> 10:55.480
numbering.

10:55.480 --> 11:00.040
So I'll number my parent chain in this way one to five in my example here from right

11:00.040 --> 11:02.600
to left.

11:02.600 --> 11:09.160
Now I can construct my name using the standard rules three methyl one pentanoic acid but

11:09.160 --> 11:14.080
because the organic acid necessarily terminates a chain see it has two bonds to oxygen here

11:14.080 --> 11:18.480
one bond to oxygen here leaving only one bond to go to the chain.

11:18.480 --> 11:27.200
It's really not necessary to include the one so we omit this three methyl pentanoic acid.

11:27.200 --> 11:32.360
The IUPAC nomenclature of esters is similar but there's one very important change and

11:32.360 --> 11:38.560
that is that we have to remember that there is an R group attached to an oxygen now and

11:38.560 --> 11:43.360
that oxygen won't have an address because it's not part of the parent carbon chain.

11:43.360 --> 11:49.120
So that sp3 oxygen now becomes an address in and of itself otherwise we'll be following

11:49.120 --> 11:55.040
the same essential nomenclature rules ultimately naming it a carboxylate.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.400
Let's do an example.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.840
Let's name this ester.

12:01.840 --> 12:06.080
Again we want to first find the functional group and the parent carbon chain which would

12:06.080 --> 12:11.200
include the carbonyl so I've highlighted that here in orange.

12:11.200 --> 12:17.360
Now I have a butanowate because I have four carbons but I now have an ethyl substituent

12:17.360 --> 12:22.400
on the sp3 oxygen rather than simply a hydrogen.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.720
I also of course have this chloro group out here on the parent carbon chain now remember

12:26.720 --> 12:33.480
the substituent on the sp3 oxygen always gets priority in the naming so in this case

12:33.480 --> 12:38.840
I'll number my chain and I'll move the ethyl to the front of the name followed by my three

12:38.840 --> 12:43.400
chloro for the substituent followed by my butanowate.

12:43.400 --> 12:51.440
So this is ethyl three chloro butanowate.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.280
So now that we've talked a little bit about nomenclature let's move on and think about

12:54.280 --> 12:57.720
the properties of acids and esters.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.640
Specifically let's take a look at a carboxylic acid here propionic acid and we'll break

13:01.640 --> 13:05.080
its structure down and see if we can use that to explain some of the observations that we

13:05.080 --> 13:08.800
make when we work with it in the laboratory.

13:08.800 --> 13:14.880
Now propionic acid has carbon oxygen double bond with a dipole right here a carbon oxygen

13:14.880 --> 13:19.600
single bond dipole here and also an OH dipole here.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.000
So there are a number of polar bonds in this molecule which means that it's going to have

13:23.000 --> 13:25.120
very high polarity.

13:25.120 --> 13:32.840
It's also got oxygens with lone pair electrons and a very important OH motif.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.680
This means that it is not only a hydrogen bond acceptor but can also be a hydrogen bond

13:36.680 --> 13:38.000
donor.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.520
So one molecule of propionic acid can easily create hydrogen bonds to another molecule

13:43.520 --> 13:45.240
of propionic acid.

13:45.240 --> 13:51.160
This leads to relatively high boiling points and means that acids tend to be either very

13:51.160 --> 13:56.400
low volatility liquids or usually even solids around room temperature.

13:56.400 --> 14:03.960
Now by comparison esters like this methyl acetate have the carbon oxygen double bond

14:03.960 --> 14:09.800
dipole and actually two CO single bond dipoles but you notice that even though they have

14:09.800 --> 14:16.720
all these polar bonds within the motif that they are lacking one very important piece

14:16.720 --> 14:23.520
of the motif that we saw previously and that is there's no OH motif there's no OH bond

14:23.520 --> 14:24.760
here.

14:24.760 --> 14:29.360
That means that even though this methyl acetate can be a hydrogen bond acceptor through its

14:29.360 --> 14:35.040
oxygens it has no way of donating a hydrogen and that means that with another methyl acetate

14:35.040 --> 14:40.520
molecule they really can't interact in this way and what this means is that esters tend

14:40.520 --> 14:45.680
to have lower boiling points than do their similar sized carboxylic acids.

14:45.680 --> 14:50.040
So notice here that methyl acetate's boiling point is closer to that of pentane a hydrocarbon

14:50.040 --> 14:54.120
of similar size than it is to propionic acid.

14:54.120 --> 15:00.400
So this allows us to explain in some ways why it is that esters seem to be so important

15:00.400 --> 15:05.120
in the aromas of wines whereas we see that acids tend to be more important toward the

15:05.120 --> 15:07.200
flavors of wines.

15:07.200 --> 15:14.840
It's a simple question of volatility you can't smell that which doesn't vaporize.

15:14.840 --> 15:18.000
So let's survey all the boiling points from some of the oxygen containing compounds we've

15:18.000 --> 15:20.040
looked at so far.

15:20.040 --> 15:24.760
When we do we can see which types of bonds within the motif are most important to increasing

15:24.760 --> 15:26.960
boiling points.

15:26.960 --> 15:31.760
Notice that if I take pentane with no oxygens at all I get the lowest boiling point of all

15:31.760 --> 15:36.840
but that simply adding sp3 oxygens or even carbonyls that can't hydrogen bond to other

15:36.840 --> 15:41.120
molecules of the same kind I have only a modest increase in boiling point.

15:41.120 --> 15:46.800
For example an ether, methyl acetate, butanol and methyl ethyl ketone.

15:46.800 --> 15:51.400
But as soon as I introduce that OH group there allowing these molecules to hydrogen bond

15:51.400 --> 15:56.760
to other molecules of the same type we see a drastic rise in the boiling points and therefore

15:56.760 --> 16:01.840
we see a very different type of chemical behavior as well as physical behavior.

16:01.840 --> 16:07.120
Now another very important difference between carboxylic acids and esters is their acid base

16:07.120 --> 16:09.120
behavior.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.920
Carboxylic acids get their name of course because they have an acidic hydrogen but they're

16:12.920 --> 16:17.480
also amphoteric being ever so slightly basic.

16:17.480 --> 16:22.280
So let's take a look at a carboxylic acid acting as a base for a moment.

16:22.280 --> 16:27.560
Here is acetic acid a very simple carboxylic acid which has a carbonyl oxygen which is

16:27.560 --> 16:34.200
at least in theory capable of donating an electron pair to form a new bond to a proton.

16:34.200 --> 16:39.560
Now when it does this it creates this very unstable looking species but this very unstable

16:39.560 --> 16:44.240
looking species also has resonance stabilization.

16:44.240 --> 16:48.820
Not a lot but just enough to make it possible.

16:48.820 --> 16:53.120
So what we're dealing with is the equilibrium between the acid and a conjugate base with

16:53.120 --> 16:57.320
this very slight resonance stabilization but which is otherwise not very favorable looking

16:57.320 --> 16:58.840
structure.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.840
So it has a pKa of around negative seven.

17:01.840 --> 17:07.560
This is a very strong acid right here a protonated carboxylic acid has acid strengths that begin

17:07.560 --> 17:11.160
to rival things like hydrochloric acid some of the stronger mineral acids that we know

17:11.160 --> 17:15.440
of but they can form under extreme conditions.

17:15.440 --> 17:21.880
Of course carboxylic acids are much better at acting as acids and in that case they lose

17:21.880 --> 17:29.480
their acidic hydrogen which is the OH to form a resonance stabilized carboxylate.

17:29.480 --> 17:35.600
This is a fairly stable anion and therefore the pKa of a neutral carboxylic acid is somewhere

17:35.600 --> 17:36.600
around five.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.080
Now think about that compared to an alcohol with a pKa of around sixteen or seventeen

17:41.080 --> 17:47.960
so we're talking about something that's millions of times more acidic.

17:47.960 --> 17:52.400
Esters on the other hand although they are still considered as amphoteric can act as

17:52.400 --> 17:54.480
a base in very much the same way.

17:54.480 --> 17:58.440
Again my carbonyl oxygen here has lone pair electrons which you can use to form a new

17:58.440 --> 18:06.520
bond and again create this resonance stabilized but somewhat unstable looking conjugate acid.

18:06.520 --> 18:12.880
So in this case the pKa of our protonated esters it rivals that of our protonated carboxylic

18:12.880 --> 18:17.840
acids at about negative seven but the real difference comes when we try to look at the

18:17.840 --> 18:20.880
acidity of a neutral ester.

18:20.880 --> 18:26.640
In this case there is no OH to be deprotonated so instead the most acidic hydrogen is here

18:26.640 --> 18:31.640
one bond away from our carbonyl motif.

18:31.640 --> 18:37.240
Now to deprotonate this we have to rely again on resonance stabilization to make it possible

18:37.240 --> 18:42.680
but even this resonance stabilization doesn't make our deprotonated ester even remotely

18:42.680 --> 18:46.840
as stable as a deprotonated carboxylic acid.

18:46.840 --> 18:52.560
Consequence of this is that we have an acid, well not an acid, an ester which has a pKa

18:52.560 --> 18:55.560
of about twenty five.

18:55.560 --> 19:01.560
Now carboxylic acids are the end of the line as oxidation of primary alcohols goes.

19:01.560 --> 19:05.720
They can be produced using our now familiar aqueous chromic acid reaction in which one

19:05.720 --> 19:13.280
round of oxidation produces an aldehyde followed by hydration and a second round of oxidation.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.320
You may remember that last time we learned pyridinium chlorochromate or PCC could be

19:18.320 --> 19:23.760
used to halt ethanol oxidation at the acid-aldehyde stage, indeed it could do this for any primary

19:23.760 --> 19:25.400
alcohol.

19:25.400 --> 19:30.840
But if we instead wanted to continue oxidation to the extreme and reach a carboxylic acid

19:30.920 --> 19:36.640
we can treat that primary alcohol with aqueous chromic acid and in this way not only would

19:36.640 --> 19:42.280
a primary alcohol like ethanol be oxidized to an aldehyde like ethanol but it would then

19:42.280 --> 19:49.080
be oxidized again to ethanoic acid which we commonly know as acetic acid.

19:49.080 --> 19:53.760
But carboxylic acids don't have to be created from starting materials that have oxygen in

19:53.760 --> 19:54.760
them.

19:54.760 --> 20:00.160
Now certain alkenes can also be oxidized to form acids using a suitable oxidizing agent

20:00.160 --> 20:02.400
as well.

20:02.400 --> 20:07.080
Consider for example 2-butene which can be reacted with potassium permanganate under acidic

20:07.080 --> 20:11.840
conditions to produce two molecules of acetic acid.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.280
This reaction takes place to an intermediate which we would call a viscinal dial and the

20:16.280 --> 20:21.880
viscinal dial quickly splits under acidic conditions to form two carboxylic acids, in

20:21.880 --> 20:24.840
this case two molecules of acetic acid.

20:24.840 --> 20:31.920
So we sometimes refer to this technique as oxidative cleavage of a double bond.

20:31.920 --> 20:35.560
No discussion of carboxylic acids and esters is complete without mentioning one of the

20:35.560 --> 20:40.920
most prolific chemists of the 1800s and someone whose contributions to the science we've

20:40.920 --> 20:43.480
already begun to explore in earlier lectures.

20:43.480 --> 20:49.200
I'm speaking of Hermann and Milfischer, a revered German chemist whose work on carbohydrates

20:49.200 --> 20:53.720
will be one of the highlights of our lecture on that topic.

20:53.720 --> 20:58.080
Now far from being just a carbohydrate chemist, Fischer was driven to synthesize many of the

20:58.080 --> 21:03.560
small biologically relevant molecules we encounter on an almost daily basis.

21:03.560 --> 21:08.880
These include caffeine found in coffee and tea and the theobromine found in chocolate.

21:08.880 --> 21:14.320
He's also well known for developing a technique for producing an ester from a carboxylic acid

21:14.320 --> 21:21.200
under very mild reaction conditions, a reaction which bears his name to this day.

21:21.200 --> 21:26.720
This reaction called the Fischer esterification is a condensation reaction, meaning that it

21:26.720 --> 21:29.720
forms water as a byproduct.

21:29.720 --> 21:35.240
It relies on a strong mineral acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid.

21:35.240 --> 21:40.760
Now just like ketone and aldehyde carbonyls, in this protonated state the carbon of a carboxylic

21:40.760 --> 21:46.800
acid becomes significantly electrophilic and can be attacked by even weak nucleophiles

21:46.800 --> 21:50.160
like a neutral alcohol.

21:50.160 --> 21:54.680
This attack forms a tetrahedral intermediate, which can take on two different tautomeric

21:54.680 --> 22:00.840
states, one in which the attacking alcohol oxygen is protonated and one in which a hydroxyl

22:00.840 --> 22:04.720
oxygen of the original acid is protonated.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.760
So the departure of an alcohol from this original tautomer would constitute a simple

22:08.760 --> 22:11.800
reversal of the first step.

22:11.800 --> 22:17.120
But if instead a water can depart from the second tautomer, thereby you get a protonated

22:17.120 --> 22:23.560
ester, which quickly loses the catalytic proton to become neutral again.

22:23.560 --> 22:27.840
So one of the great benefits of Fischer esterifications when compared to other methods of the day

22:27.840 --> 22:31.960
is that none of the reagents are sensitive to water, notoriously difficult substance

22:31.960 --> 22:35.040
to exclude from organic reactions.

22:35.040 --> 22:39.880
But this benefit comes at a cost, that the reaction is an equilibrium, which only very

22:39.880 --> 22:42.920
slightly favors product formation.

22:42.920 --> 22:48.640
So Fischer esterifications usually require the use of one reagent in extremely high concentrations

22:48.640 --> 22:53.640
to ensure that the other is almost completely converted.

22:53.640 --> 22:58.840
Now in yet another twist, the nearly equal energies of the reactants and products means

22:58.840 --> 23:03.880
that we can turn the Fischer esterification reaction around, reversing the roles of product

23:03.880 --> 23:05.760
and reactant.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.360
So we can exploit Le Chatelier's principle and turn a Fischer esterification into an

23:10.360 --> 23:15.640
ester hydrolysis, simply by changing the solvent from alcohol to water.

23:15.640 --> 23:24.320
The product of this reaction should be a nearly complete conversion of ester to acid.

23:24.320 --> 23:28.320
So let's take a look at an interesting ester that you may have already encountered and

23:28.320 --> 23:29.320
not even known it.

23:29.320 --> 23:34.120
There's a popular antiviral drug that's on the market today, it's called Tamiflu.

23:34.120 --> 23:38.760
And Tamiflu itself contains an ester motif, and it's part of a very interesting class

23:38.760 --> 23:42.160
of compounds called prodrux.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.520
This is a molecule called Oseltamivir.

23:45.520 --> 23:51.480
Now Oseltamivir, you'll notice, has an ester motif.

23:51.480 --> 23:56.120
Here's another molecule that's very similar, called Oseltamivir carboxylic, which I've

23:56.120 --> 24:00.160
drawn as a carboxylic acid, but could just as easily have been drawn in its deprotonated

24:00.160 --> 24:02.520
state.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.080
What's interesting about these two molecules is the properties that they have.

24:06.080 --> 24:12.040
So it turns out Oseltamivir, when you swallow it, about 80% of that molecule gets from your

24:12.040 --> 24:13.640
GI tract into your bloodstream.

24:13.640 --> 24:18.800
This is a pretty good delivery for a drug molecule.

24:18.800 --> 24:25.300
Whereas Oseltamivir carboxylate is only about 5% absorbed, meaning that for every 20 molecules

24:25.300 --> 24:28.840
of this that you swallow, only one of them ultimately makes it all the way into your

24:28.840 --> 24:29.840
bloodstream.

24:29.840 --> 24:34.240
Now here's another interesting factoid.

24:34.240 --> 24:39.040
Oseltamivir does absolutely nothing to help you get over the flu.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.720
Whereas Oseltamivir carboxylate does.

24:42.720 --> 24:47.240
It actually binds to the capsids of viruses and thereby sort of prevents them from adhering

24:47.240 --> 24:51.400
to the cell so that they can inject their RNA into their damage.

24:51.400 --> 24:55.080
But remember, Oseltamivir carboxylate is not absorbed into your bloodstream where it could

24:55.080 --> 24:56.400
help you.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.040
So are we, is all lost here?

24:58.040 --> 25:02.040
Is there no reason to continue looking at or working with either one of these molecules?

25:02.040 --> 25:03.800
I don't think so.

25:03.800 --> 25:09.320
They differ by, again, only one functional group, this ethyl ester and this carboxylic

25:09.320 --> 25:10.480
acid.

25:10.480 --> 25:20.720
But we know how to convert one into the other so we can exploit the properties of both molecules.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.960
This is the way that Tamiflu works.

25:22.960 --> 25:27.300
Oseltamivir is put into a pill or capsule which a patient swallows.

25:27.300 --> 25:31.020
This molecule reaches the patient's GI tract where it is transferred into the bloodstream

25:31.020 --> 25:37.580
very efficiently but where it also can't do anything to help fight a viral infection.

25:37.580 --> 25:43.860
But in your bloodstream naturally is water and also enzymes from your liver which specialize

25:43.860 --> 25:48.540
in hydrolyzing this bond in the same way that a fissurist verification would.

25:48.540 --> 25:54.380
So once this molecule is already in your bloodstream, your body converts it from the ethyl ester

25:54.380 --> 25:56.780
into the carboxylic acid.

25:56.780 --> 26:01.820
Oseltamivir carboxylate can now do its job having been delivered as a different molecule

26:01.820 --> 26:03.380
altogether.

26:03.380 --> 26:08.580
So this strategy constitutes what we call a pro-drug and you'll find uses of them in

26:08.580 --> 26:12.620
many different therapies, not just antivirals.

26:12.620 --> 26:17.420
So we know that esters can be chemically broken down to acids by enzymes in our body or in

26:17.420 --> 26:21.700
a beaker using aqueous acid as an a fissurist verification.

26:21.700 --> 26:26.300
But there's yet another method available for hydrolyzing esters which was in use long before

26:26.300 --> 26:28.180
beakers even existed.

26:28.180 --> 26:35.100
See, soap making is a process nearly as old as or possibly even older than recorded history

26:35.100 --> 26:39.940
with the first credible historical sources of these recipes being on a Babylonian tablet

26:39.940 --> 26:43.940
which is nearly 5,000 years old.

26:43.940 --> 26:50.100
So early soap makers deserve credit as some of the first, albeit unwitting, organic chemists

26:50.100 --> 26:52.900
of the human race.

26:52.900 --> 26:56.820
The traditional making of soap uses a reaction which accomplishes nearly the same result

26:56.820 --> 27:02.340
as an acidic ester hydrolysis reaction, but it does so irreversibly and with remarkable

27:02.340 --> 27:05.220
ease and efficiency.

27:05.220 --> 27:10.900
You may recall that animal fats and vegetable oils contain compounds known as triacylglycerides.

27:10.900 --> 27:15.540
We've already seen how Sabatier in his contemporaries toyed with the saturation of these alkyl chains

27:15.540 --> 27:18.820
using hydrogenation reactions.

27:18.820 --> 27:23.260
But triacylglycerides are useful for much more than just a food source.

27:23.260 --> 27:28.540
When the ester bonds are broken in these molecules, several useful compounds can result, including

27:28.540 --> 27:32.340
those used in soap.

27:32.340 --> 27:37.580
So instead of relying on the acidity to increase the electrophilicity of an ester, suponification

27:37.580 --> 27:42.460
relies on the removal of a proton from water to produce a stronger nucleophile in the form

27:42.460 --> 27:44.900
of hydroxide.

27:44.980 --> 27:49.500
This is easily accomplished even in ancient times by allowing rainwater to percolate through

27:49.500 --> 27:53.740
wood ashes, which creates a material known as lye.

27:53.740 --> 27:58.860
Modern chemists would probably call this potassium hydroxide.

27:58.860 --> 28:05.660
The hydroxide from lye is a much better nucleophile than water, and it attacks the carbonyl of

28:05.660 --> 28:10.300
neutral esters easily to form a tetrahedral intermediate.

28:10.300 --> 28:15.660
Just as with the acidic mechanism, this intermediate is now faced with two options, lose a hydroxide,

28:15.660 --> 28:23.900
go back to starting materials, or lose an alkoxide as it recovers its carbonyl bond.

28:23.900 --> 28:29.060
So now we can see the secret to the irreversibility of suponification and why it's so easy to

28:29.060 --> 28:31.580
run this reaction to completion.

28:31.580 --> 28:36.460
The final step in the mechanism involves the transfer of a proton from the resulting carboxylic

28:36.460 --> 28:44.100
acid, the pKa of about 5, to the byproduct alkoxide, which has a conjugate acid pKa of

28:44.100 --> 28:47.300
about 16.

28:47.300 --> 28:52.700
With pKa values this drastically different, clearly the proton transfer is not only fast,

28:52.700 --> 28:57.820
but irreversible, and the products obtained are alcohol and the carboxylate salt of an

28:57.820 --> 29:00.540
organic acid.

29:00.540 --> 29:05.540
This carboxylate salt is no longer reactive and can be isolated from the resulting glycerol,

29:05.540 --> 29:09.580
so our soap preparation is complete.

29:09.580 --> 29:12.940
But suponification is not limited to the hydrolysis of fats.

29:12.940 --> 29:17.660
It can be used to disassemble a range of esters into carboxylates and alcohols, and so it

29:17.660 --> 29:26.260
gives us yet another tool to break down practically any small organic ester that we desire.

29:26.260 --> 29:27.740
I think it's time now.

29:27.740 --> 29:32.060
We've finally amassed a substantial arsenal of techniques for the inner conversion of

29:32.060 --> 29:38.180
hydrocarbons, alkyl halides, and oxygen-containing compounds that we can begin to appreciate

29:38.180 --> 29:43.220
and participate in a synthetic design problem.

29:43.220 --> 29:49.300
So let's pretend that we're chemists attempting to synthesize adipic acid, a dicarboxylic

29:49.300 --> 29:53.780
acid used frequently in the manufacture of nylon.

29:53.780 --> 29:59.060
But let's simplify this problem and say we have only cyclohexanol and other common inorganic

29:59.060 --> 30:01.100
reagents to work with.

30:01.100 --> 30:06.860
Now your instinct might be to begin by considering cyclohexanol and all the different compounds

30:06.860 --> 30:13.420
one could make from it, then consider how each of those might be modified.

30:13.420 --> 30:18.980
But even our small arsenal of techniques leads to a hopelessly complex diagram of potential

30:18.980 --> 30:22.860
reactions which could take us far too long to consider.

30:22.860 --> 30:27.340
Not only that, but a typical lab will have an inventory of reagents, all of which could

30:27.340 --> 30:29.700
be considered as starting materials.

30:29.700 --> 30:34.840
So the number of permutations of reactions grows so rapidly that it becomes absolutely

30:34.840 --> 30:36.340
overwhelming.

30:36.340 --> 30:37.500
So is all hope lost?

30:37.500 --> 30:39.940
Well, of course not.

30:39.940 --> 30:43.980
Just like solving a maze can be much simpler if you start from the destination and work

30:43.980 --> 30:50.420
backwards, so can a synthesis puzzle be better attacked in that way?

30:50.420 --> 30:56.660
One way which chemists attack this is to use a technique that we call retro-synthetic analysis.

30:56.660 --> 31:01.940
So if we turn our attention from the starting material to the product and ask ourselves

31:01.940 --> 31:10.460
what could I make this material from, usually we find just a few realistic possibilities.

31:10.460 --> 31:15.940
Contemplating the reaction in this way, in reverse, it's called retro-synthetic analysis.

31:15.940 --> 31:23.220
And often block arrows are used to distinguish this kind of analysis from a forward synthesis.

31:23.220 --> 31:30.260
For example, adipic acid can be produced in a single step using only two of our techniques,

31:30.260 --> 31:40.420
either the oxidation of a dialdehyde or the oxidative cleavage of a cyclic alkene.

31:40.420 --> 31:45.380
Now let's take a look at these two and ask ourselves how might we prepare these potential

31:45.380 --> 31:46.380
intermediates?

31:46.380 --> 31:51.900
Well, the needed dialdehyde could be produced by oxidation of a corresponding diol, but

31:52.020 --> 31:56.340
we're two steps along our retro-synthesis and this product isn't looking much like

31:56.340 --> 31:58.860
our available starting material, is it?

31:58.860 --> 32:03.340
Ah, but cyclohexene shows promise.

32:03.340 --> 32:09.100
It more closely resembles the starting material because of the six-membered ring that it has.

32:09.100 --> 32:13.980
Now a quick survey of methods for preparing alkenes reminds us that we can prepare them

32:13.980 --> 32:19.780
by elimination reactions involving the appropriate alcohol under acidic conditions.

32:19.780 --> 32:25.540
So what appears to be an overwhelming synthetic problem is now solved in just a few short

32:25.540 --> 32:31.220
steps using retro-synthetic analysis.

32:31.220 --> 32:36.180
So today we concluded our tour of oxygen-containing compounds by covering carboxylic acids and

32:36.180 --> 32:37.900
esters.

32:37.900 --> 32:44.740
We discussed how both of these motifs contain an sp3 oxygen connected to a carbonyl carbon.

32:44.740 --> 32:49.540
How carboxylic acids stand alone among compounds we've looked at so far and how acidic they

32:50.300 --> 32:55.500
are and how replacement of that acidic hydrogen converts the motif to what is known as an ester

32:55.500 --> 33:02.180
with drastically different solubility, volatility, and acid-base properties.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.060
We took a look at two ways to prepare carboxylic acids.

33:05.060 --> 33:11.060
First, by the oxidation of aldehydes with chromic acid, emulating the action of acetylbacter,

33:11.060 --> 33:15.260
and second we saw how they can be prepared by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with

33:15.260 --> 33:19.300
hot potassium permanganate.

33:19.300 --> 33:23.700
Then we took a look at the Fischer's Derrification, which allows us to produce esters from an organic

33:23.700 --> 33:27.100
acid and an alcohol.

33:27.100 --> 33:31.300
We also saw how this process can be reversed to get the acid and alcohol back in a process

33:31.300 --> 33:34.540
called acid hydrolysis.

33:34.540 --> 33:39.020
We discussed how enzymes in your body can accelerate the same process in your bloodstream,

33:39.020 --> 33:42.940
prompting medical researchers to use esters frequently in a class of pharmaceuticals

33:42.940 --> 33:48.180
known as pro-drugs, including products like Tamiflu, which have significantly improved

33:48.180 --> 33:53.660
bioavailability over the active compound alone.

33:53.660 --> 33:58.420
Next we covered saponification, an age-old process in which a strong hydroxide solution

33:58.420 --> 34:01.860
is used to promote hydrolysis of esters.

34:01.860 --> 34:05.460
This process is most well-known for its use in the production of soap products, but is

34:05.460 --> 34:08.580
applicable to a wide range of organic reactions.

34:08.580 --> 34:14.100
And finally, we were introduced to a technique known as retro-synthetic analysis, in which

34:14.100 --> 34:18.740
we navigate a synthetic problem backwards in order to minimize the number of reactions

34:18.740 --> 34:22.340
that we have to consider.

34:22.340 --> 34:26.380
As we close the book on oxygen-containing motifs, we'll move forward and add yet another

34:26.380 --> 34:29.780
highly influential element to our discussion.

34:29.780 --> 34:33.300
Nitrogen is next on our tour of common functional groups.

34:33.300 --> 34:33.860
I'll see you then.
