0	18120	So, we're now knee-deep in what I like to call the alphabet soup segment of the course,
18120	22480	where every few lectures we introduce a new element to the train wreck of lines, letters
22480	24080	and dots on the screen.
24080	29200	I make no mistake, there are many players in the organic chemistry game, but there are
29200	34720	just a few which make up the vast majority of the science, and with just two more lectures
34720	39720	to go, we're on the downslope of our short tour, so hang in there.
39720	45440	Now, nitrogen, it's been a player in the chemistry of life since day one, playing an
45440	49720	integral role in the makeup of our simplest organic compounds which came together to create
49720	55240	the spark of life on the early Earth some three billion years ago.
55240	59680	And the biological relevance of nitrogen is evident today, in the experience we get when
59680	62680	we happen on a piece of rotten flesh or spoiled meat.
62680	68520	See, some of the earliest discovered nitrogen-containing compounds received very unappetizing names
68520	71680	like cadaverine and putrassine.
71680	76240	This is a testament to the first source from which they were isolated, and of course to
76240	80120	the smell that they produced.
80120	85200	No discussion of nitrogen is ever complete without the mention of one name in particular,
85200	89960	it's Haber, and you may remember from our lecture on drawing chemical reactions that
89960	95600	Haber was a German chemist working in Germany during the first part of the 20th century.
95600	99800	As one of the more eccentric personalities in the history of organic chemistry, Haber's
99800	105640	famous or infamous for making some very dubious choices about how to pursue and apply the science
105640	107880	of chemistry.
107880	111560	But whatever you may think of as politics, there is one incontrovertible fact that we
111560	113800	can all agree on.
113800	119120	Haber may be responsible for the single, most influential chemical development of the 20th
119120	124680	century, and possibly of all human history, the Haber-Bosch process which allows us to
124680	130240	convert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into ammonia.
130240	134120	You might also remember that I mentioned in a previous lecture, Haber's process for
134120	139400	converting nitrogen to ammonia isn't technically an organic reaction at all, since it lacks
139400	141760	the involvement of carbon.
141760	146200	But by the end of today, I think you'll begin to see why organic chemists owe so much to
146200	150640	this inorganic reaction that we've adopted Haber as one of our own.
150640	158040	In short, the product of his reaction, ammonia, is one of the primary entry points for nitrogen
158040	161520	into the field of synthetic organic chemistry.
161520	165360	Just as certain plants use ammonia from this process as a nutrient to build the organic
165360	171080	molecules they need to live, so do organic chemists often use ammonia to introduce nitrogen
171080	175440	into organics in the laboratory.
175440	179520	Nitrogen is a key element in the structures of many critical commercial materials.
179520	184560	From explosives to fertilizers to polymers, nitrogen is frequently present and almost
184560	190840	just as frequently irreplaceable in the process of creating certain essential goods.
190840	195120	It can be found in a host of organic compounds with diverse applications.
195120	200640	Being a key player in compounds is different and versatile as the explosive nitroglycerin,
200640	206600	the powerful antibiotic vancomycin, and even the proteins making up 20% of the mass in
206600	210280	your own body.
210280	216920	Today we will begin our short survey of nitrogen-containing compounds with a look at amines, amines,
216920	222720	and nitriles, compounds containing only nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen.
222720	226280	Next time we'll bring oxygen back to this dance, but for now let's just concentrate
226280	232760	on the simplest possible classes of nitrogen-containing molecules.
232760	237520	Now I hope I have convinced you that nitrogen is worth taking a look at if not a smell of,
237520	242360	but let's take a look at nitrogen-containing compounds now.
242360	249440	Nitrogen itself has an electron configuration of 1s2, 2s2, 2p3.
249440	253800	So nitrogen's valence shell will be filled when it shares 3 covalent bonds with other
253800	255680	atoms.
255680	261080	This makes nitrogen quite an interesting structural twist, since unlike oxygen, in
261080	268040	its sp3 hybridization state, it can perpetuate chains and can also bear one additional functional
268040	271440	group or substituent.
271440	276520	So the library of nitrogen-containing motifs can get unwieldy pretty quickly.
276520	281480	So let's focus on just the simplest of all these groups to start, those consisting of
281480	286000	only one nitrogen atom bonded to one or more hydrocarbons.
286000	290880	Let's begin with an sp3 nitrogen.
290880	296200	As you can see from this structure, the sp3 nitrogen contains enough electrons to make
296200	301600	three different covalent bonds, but also keeps a lone pair for itself.
301600	306520	The presence of that lone pair means that the three bonds to other atoms are actually
306520	311440	about 109.5 degrees from one another, maybe ever so slightly closer because of the presence
311440	315280	of pushing down from that lone pair of electrons, but in general we can think of them as being
315280	319520	about the same as any other tetrahedral center.
319520	325480	Now if we instead think about a nitrogen which contains a single bond and a double bond, what
325480	330720	we get is a nitrogen in which the lone pair is pushing down on those bonds as well, and
330720	336200	therefore even though there are only two bonded substituents, the angle is closer to 120 degrees
336200	338400	than we might think, it's not 180.
338400	340720	So let's put that one away.
340720	345480	Now let's take a look at one of our nitrogen atoms, but in this case one that is in the
345480	347840	sp hybridized state.
347840	354160	Now in this hybridized state we can have only one bond, excuse me, to our nitrogen and that
354160	355760	is a triple bond.
355760	360080	So in this case the triple bond to our nitrogen leaves the lone pair dangling on the end and
360080	364720	leaves our substituent, whether it's an alkyl substituent or a nitrogen, pointing directly
364720	366920	in the other direction.
366920	372440	Now this means that the family of simple nitrogen-containing compounds is much larger and more complex
372440	374320	than oxygen.
374320	379000	So we now have to consider not just how our heteroatom can terminate or perpetuate a chain,
379000	383800	but also how it can potentially modify that chain, introducing branching in ways that
383800	388600	oxygen simply can't.
388600	393760	So let's start our survey of nitrogen-containing compounds by considering the simplest of all
393760	395720	the amine functional group.
395720	402720	Now an amine functional group is defined as one containing a carbon-nitrogen single bond.
402720	408960	So three examples are here, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine.
408960	413440	You notice that in each case the nitrogen atom indicated in blue is singly bonded to
413440	421320	at least one other hydrocarbon, otherwise we would end up with an ammonia molecule.
421320	426360	Now when a single R-group is attached, we call this a primary amine.
426360	432120	When there are two, a secondary amine, and three, a tertiary amine.
432120	438040	This is our basic method of classifying this kind of molecule.
438040	441160	But it's not enough to simply call them primary, secondary, and tertiary.
441160	446640	We need a nomenclature system which will allow us to identify specific amine molecules, and
446640	449040	we rely on IUPAC for this.
449040	453800	We'll be naming these amines in exactly the same way as we would most other molecules
453800	456680	with one very important change.
456680	460080	Not only will we be doing the usual of finding our longest continuous chain with the functional
460080	464480	group and giving the lowest possible number to the carbon varying the functional group,
464480	469800	but we're going to have a new address of n for the substituent that's bonded to the
469800	472600	actual amine functional group.
472600	476000	Let's take a look at an example.
476000	478800	Let's say we wanted to name this amine.
478800	482480	But we'd go through our usual IUPAC system in which we find the functional group and
482480	486480	the longest attached chain indicated here in orange.
486480	489960	So this would be a pentanamine.
489960	494080	It has a single methyl substituent, and we'll give it an address based upon the location
494080	497120	of the functional group, which is the NH2.
497120	501800	So we would number our parent hydrocarbon in this way, thereby giving the lowest number
501800	509480	to the functional group and giving us the name three methyl, one, and tannamine.
509480	513880	As another example, let's try a secondary amine and see how that affects the name.
513880	520200	In my secondary amine, I have, again, my hydrocarbon parent here in orange.
520200	523120	You'll notice that in this case, my functional group is not at the end of the chain, but
523120	525480	that's okay.
525480	528400	So I have a butanamine.
528400	533320	My butanamine also has an ethyl group attached to its amine nitrogen.
533320	537760	So the ethyl group will get a special address indicated not by a number, but by the letter
537760	540080	n.
540080	548240	So in this case, after numbering my chain, I find that I have an n-ethyl-2-butanamine.
548240	556720	I've now unambiguously named this particular isomer of this particular secondary amine.
556840	560600	What makes amines so different from other compounds is the types of properties that
560600	563960	their polarity and their hydrogen bonding gives them.
563960	568880	When we think about primary and secondary amines, we see that they have Cn dipoles, but that
568880	575080	they also have a very important NH bond, which gives them not only another dipole, but also
575080	581320	gives them the ability to be not only the H bond donor, but also an H bond acceptor.
581320	585880	So just like carboxylic acids, these amines, when they're primary and secondary, have
585880	590280	the ability to hydrogen bond to other molecules of the same kind.
590280	596480	Now, what we find in the case of tertiary amines, however, is that although they contain plenty
596480	603760	of dipoles, making them polar molecules, that they have no NH bonds, therefore they can
603760	606680	only act as hydrogen bond acceptors.
606680	612160	So if we place a trimethylamine molecule next to another trimethylamine molecule, they can't
612160	616760	interact in the same way as their primary and secondary counterparts.
616760	621360	And what this means is that they tend to have much lower boiling points than do primary
621360	624040	and secondary amines, as we can see here.
624040	629640	Now, aside from their volatilities and their ability to hydrogen bond to one another, amines
629640	633560	are most well known in the organic lab as bases.
633560	639000	And the reason that we use them as bases is that the nitrogen, of course, has that special
639000	646120	lone pair right there, which is able to pick up an H+, forming its conjugate acid.
646120	651000	If we consider using methylamine first as an acid, we see that we have to make something
651000	656040	called an amide anion, which is extremely unstable.
656040	663200	So the amide anion not being so stable, the pKa of neutral methylamine is about 35.
663200	669560	And when we reach pKa this level, we tend to think of things as being not acidic at all.
669560	675480	But what methylamine can do instead is use the nitrogen as a base, picking up a proton
675480	679640	from elsewhere, and becoming a methyl ammonium ion.
679640	685460	Now, the methyl ammonium ion is actually fairly stable, and that leads to a pKa of this conjugate
685460	687840	acid of about 11.
687840	692600	So when we mix methylamine into many different organic reactions and organic systems, they
692600	697880	have a strong tendency to accept protons and act as a base.
697880	702560	Okay, so let's talk a little bit about how amines are made.
702560	704440	And I have to admit this again.
704440	709440	When it comes to organic synthesis, the human race has been vested time and time again by
709440	712140	single-celled organisms.
712140	717000	Just as was the case in the synthesis of acid aldehyde, acetic acid, and other oxygen-containing
717000	722280	compounds, it would seem that an extra three billion years of practice afforded to microorganisms
722280	729240	has made them far more prolific at synthesizing nitrogen-containing compounds, too.
729240	734800	Our best natural resource or best natural source for nitrogen-containing organics comes from
734800	740560	the rhizobia bacterium, which live in the root nodules of legumes.
740560	744960	So have you ever driven or walked past a cornfield one year, only to see a field of
744960	749920	soy plants in it the next, and maybe wondered why the farmer suddenly had a change of heart
749920	752160	over which crop to plant?
752160	757720	Well, there's actually far more to the change in crop selection than the whim of a farmer.
757720	763680	You see, corn is very taxing on soil, draining it of nutrients, including nitrogen, and
763680	769360	leaving even the best fertilized fields too depleted to support a following year's crop.
769360	775760	The solution to this problem is crop rotation, in which soybeans and their nitrogen-fixing
775760	781000	stowaways are given a season to grow before their root systems are tilled under to replenish
781000	783880	the nitrogen content of the soil.
783880	788160	So once again, we find ourselves depending on the synthesis skills of these micron-sized
788160	794160	chemists to help us better our quality of life.
794160	799000	But organic chemists aren't cyanobacteria, we're people, and we work in labs.
799000	803360	So let's take a look now at some of humanity's rather clumsy attempts to duplicate this amazing
803360	805720	feat.
805720	809400	Amines are the simplest starting point from which Haber-Bosch ammonia can be injected
809400	812120	into the organic chemistry realm.
812120	816960	And one very simple method used to accomplish this is the direct alkylation of ammonia using
816960	821640	a familiar compound, alkylchlorides.
821640	827000	You see, ammonia is a fairly good nucleophile, and it can be coarsed to react by an SN2 reaction
827000	832720	with a primary or methyl alkyl halide, like this ethylchloride.
832720	839480	When mixed, a nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place, generating a primary amine and
839480	842560	one mole of hydrochloric acid.
842560	845640	So here we run into a potential problem.
845640	851920	Notice that the product amine is also nucleophilic, and in theory can react with yet another
851920	856920	alkyl halide to form a secondary amine, which could then again react to form a tertiary
856920	859400	amine.
859400	864360	So it's rather easy to make a tertiary alkyl amine by direct alkylation, just use a very
864360	867120	large excess of the alkyl halide.
867120	871880	And conversely, we can force the reaction system in the direction of primary alkyl amines
871880	876960	by using a large excess of ammonia, limiting the chances that an already formed primary
876960	884600	amine will productively collide with another alkyl halide before they're all consumed.
884600	889320	But this requires a very large excess of ammonia, and even though his process has helped to
889320	894360	make ammonia relatively abundant and inexpensive, I don't think Fritz Haber would be very happy
894360	898400	with us wasting his hard-earned fixed nitrogen like that.
898400	904320	And Rhizobia is probably already having a pretty good laugh at our expense anyway.
904320	908680	So the solution to this problem, not being mocked by bacteria, but the synthetic problem
908680	913800	at hand, was actually worked out well ahead of Haber's time by one of his countrymen,
913800	915920	Sigmund Gabriel.
915920	920760	Gabriel used what we commonly refer to as a protecting group, to temporarily render
920760	926680	two sites on ammonia unreactive, then restore them to their original state only after the
926680	930480	alkylation was complete.
930480	935800	Gabriel used a compound called thalamine, in place of ammonia, activating it with potassium
935800	940760	hydroxide to create a more nucleophilic thalamide ion.
940760	946840	This ion attacks the alkyl halide much like ammonia would, this time forming an N-alkyl
946840	949480	thalamide intermediate.
949480	954720	But notice that there are no more NH protons to lose, which is a requirement for the reaction
954720	958920	to proceed beyond the first alkylation.
958920	964680	Now after this step, a molecule known as hydrazine is used to remove that protecting group.
964680	969040	Notice that hydrazine contains two potentially nucleophilic nitrogens.
969040	974040	Gabriel also probably noticed that the thalamide motif has two electrophilic carbonyl carbons.
974040	976320	Now that's no coincidence.
976320	983440	The hydrazine first attacks one carbonyl, and then the next, forming a very stable by-product
983440	989840	thalamide hydrazide and our primary amine.
989840	994000	So we've seen that direct alkylation is an easy way to make tertiary amines, and that
994000	997560	primary amines can be made using thalamine.
997560	1001080	Amine groups like that are called the Gabriel synthesis.
1001080	1003560	But what about secondary amines?
1003560	1007520	They can't be favored by stoichiometric control, meaning adding lots of one reagent or the
1007520	1012600	other, nor can they be favored using the Gabriel synthesis because that would be a very difficult
1012600	1014280	modification.
1014280	1017240	So what do we do?
1017240	1022360	The simplest solution to this problem is a technique known as reductive amination.
1022360	1027360	In this reaction, a primary amine, formed by direct alkylation, the Gabriel synthesis
1027360	1034600	or some other means, is reacted with a ketone or an aldehyde under acidic conditions.
1034600	1039360	Now under these conditions, an N-substituted amine is formed.
1039360	1043840	Once this amine intermediate is formed, the product is reduced using a very familiar reagent
1043840	1047080	to us, lithium aluminum hydride.
1047080	1051400	This adds hydrogen across the double bond, producing a secondary amine.
1052160	1057600	In the case of ketones, a branched alkyl group is obtained, whereas with aldehydes, we get
1057600	1060000	a straight chain secondary amine.
1060000	1064880	Okay, so now that we've gotten to know amines a little bit, let's take a look at nitrogen
1064880	1068280	containing compounds with double bonds, or imines.
1068280	1073920	As I just mentioned, imines are defined as those compounds which contain CN double bonds.
1073920	1075760	So I've highlighted those for you here in yellow.
1075760	1080160	Notice that each of these compounds has a carbon double bonded to a nitrogen.
1080160	1084280	Now having this carbon double bonded to a nitrogen means that they'll behave somewhat
1084280	1090960	similarly to their carbonyl brethren, ketones and aldehydes, meaning that we can have either
1090960	1098480	nothing bonded to the carbonyl or we can have one R-group bonded or two R-group bonded.
1098480	1103280	When we have no R-groups on the carbon of it, we call it a formimine.
1103280	1109240	When one R-group is present on the doubly bonded carbon, we call this compound an aldimine.
1109240	1115600	When we have two, we call this type of compound a ketamine, not to be confused with ketamine,
1115600	1119760	the horse tranquilizer, which is a completely different type of compound.
1119760	1125080	Now, imines are most easily synthesized by the reaction of ammonia, or primary amine
1125080	1130960	with ketones and aldehydes, using a strong non-nucleophilic mineral acid like sulfuric
1130960	1132360	acid.
1132360	1136880	In this situation, the nitrogen acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl, which
1136880	1143640	causes one of the amine protons to tautomerize into what we call a beta-hydroxyamine.
1143640	1150320	Finally, a second tautomerism occurs, leading to departure of a water molecule and formation
1150320	1151840	of the imine.
1151840	1157400	Of course, having a double bond, imines can always be reduced to their analogous amines
1157400	1162600	using lithium aluminum hydride or palladium on carbon or similar chemistry.
1163120	1169040	Just as we previously did to create a secondary amine, so can a linear primary amine be made
1169040	1172400	by the reduction of a primary aldamine?
1172400	1177840	Branched primary amines can be prepared from reduction of primary ketamines.
1177840	1183600	Linear secondary amines can be prepared from secondary aldamines and branched secondary
1183600	1188200	amines from secondary ketamines.
1188200	1193040	But imines are so much more than just intermediates in the synthesis of amines.
1193040	1197560	They hold their own as a commercially useful class of materials.
1197560	1201920	You see, imines have the ability to do something that no other functional group we've yet
1201920	1204480	looked at can accomplish.
1204480	1211080	They can be used to connect two large pi systems together through resonance.
1211080	1216720	Let's take a look at a reaction that's actually quite famous.
1216760	1223440	I'm going to react two molecules of aniline with two different isomers of the molecule
1223440	1224800	toluidine.
1224800	1231560	Now, when I do this under oxidative conditions, I get a compound that looks like this called
1231560	1232560	mauveine.
1232560	1239360	Now, mauveine has two imine groups highlighted here.
1239360	1243160	But what's really interesting about these imine groups is that they're not isolated,
1243160	1244480	they're in resonance.
1244480	1247440	They have pi systems on both sides.
1247440	1252760	So if I think about this mauveine molecule as more of its resonance hybrid, I notice
1252760	1257520	that there's a very large region of delocalized pi electrons.
1257520	1263160	And as we're going to see in some future lectures, when we have large regions of pi electrons
1263160	1267560	that can move like this in resonance, we tend to have compounds that can absorb visible
1267560	1268560	light.
1269240	1275920	Now, mauveine was first synthesized in 1856 by a British student named William Henry Perkin.
1275920	1281680	Now, like so many other groundbreaking products, it wasn't design synthesis, but it was actually
1281680	1282680	an accident.
1282680	1289320	See, Perkin was trying to oxidize aniline using an oxidizing agent called potassium dichromate.
1289320	1296040	Now, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how fond you are of the color purple,
1296040	1301880	his dichromate was contaminated with toluidine, and his synthesis resulted in a thick black
1301880	1304280	mess of material.
1304280	1309640	A disappointed Perkin set to cleaning the black sludge from his flask with alcohol only
1309640	1315760	to find that the resulting solution was a beautiful, brilliant shade of purple.
1315760	1320720	Perkin quickly sorted out the puzzle of the beautiful purple compound, developing a synthesis
1320720	1324160	which launched the synthetic dye industry.
1324160	1328680	His discovery proved so influential that the American branch of the society of chemical
1328680	1333520	industry has made him the namesake of their highest professional award, conferring the
1333520	1337960	first one to Perkin himself on the 50th anniversary of his discovery.
1337960	1343520	So, this is just one more anecdote proving that sometimes an accident and keen powers
1343520	1348520	of observation are all it takes to make it to the top in science.
1348520	1355440	Now, let's turn our attention to the simplest compounds containing an SP hybridized nitrogen,
1355440	1358920	known as nitrials.
1358920	1365800	So, nitrials contain an SP nitrogen, which means that it's likely to contain a triple
1365800	1367040	bond.
1367040	1372600	Now, when we have CN triple bonds like these, there are really only two possible structural
1372600	1373600	approaches.
1373600	1378200	One is to have a hydrogen attached as the fourth bond to carbon.
1378200	1381520	The other is to have an R-group.
1381520	1387400	When the attached motif is a hydrogen, we call this molecule cyanic acid.
1387400	1392520	If instead the carbon that's triply bonded to the nitrogen contains some kind of R-group,
1392520	1396840	we call this class of compounds a nitrile.
1396840	1406040	Now, nitrials are weakly acidic, but HCN, hydrocyanide, or hydrocyanic acid rather, is
1406040	1412160	actually much more acidic than any other nitrile because its hydrogen is bonded directly to
1412160	1415600	the carbon which bears the CN triple bond.
1415600	1421040	So, removal of this hydrogen creates what we call a cyanide ion, which I'm sure we're
1421040	1423080	all familiar with hearing.
1423080	1428240	This is the ion that actually is generated in your bloodstream when you inhale hydrogen
1428240	1434000	cyanide gas as you might if you were in an execution chamber several decades ago.
1434000	1439520	The ion is actually resonance stabilized and therefore gives HCN a pKa of around 9,
1439520	1443320	which means that at physiological pHs, it can actually give up a small amount of these
1443320	1447720	protons leading to the lethal cyanide ion.
1447720	1453480	Now, acetylnitrile and other nitriles, on the other hand, don't have a hydrogen bonded
1453480	1457080	directly to the carbon of the nitrile group.
1457080	1461960	And so, although they can lose these protons and form a resonance stabilized conjugate
1461960	1467920	base, because it's not directly on the carbon bearing the electron withdrawing nitrogen,
1467920	1473720	the pKa of compounds like this is actually significantly reduced, about 25.
1473720	1479440	Now, hydrogen cyanide, of course, is special among nitriles because its pKa allows it to
1479440	1483880	dissociate partially at physiological pH conditions.
1483880	1488600	This means in your bloodstream, if you were to ingest or in some other way take in hydrogen
1488600	1491720	cyanide, there would be a small amount of this ion.
1491720	1497140	Now, the ion cyanide is a powerful binder to certain proteins involved in the electron
1497140	1504280	transport chain, which our bodies use to process energy and stay alive.
1504280	1510360	But cyanide ion is not only very toxic, it's also very nucleophilic, and it interacts strongly
1510360	1512720	with certain metals too.
1512720	1516800	And this prompts many chemists to brave this potentially lethal compound in pursuit of their
1516800	1518440	chemical goals.
1518440	1526160	For example, cyanide was, and in some cases still is, used as an agent to extract gold
1526160	1529600	from low-grade ore.
1529600	1536120	Cyanide and gold form a strong complex known as orosionine, and this complex is far more
1536120	1541560	water soluble than gold itself, and the gold can be leached from rock using strong solutions
1541560	1543760	of cyanide in water.
1544320	1549160	Naturally, this process has to be very carefully monitored, controlled, and of course, its
1549160	1552440	byproducts thoroughly treated before disposal.
1552440	1557240	So it would seem that only the lure of something as precious as gold could convince a person
1557240	1559920	to work with this deadly compound, right?
1559920	1565160	Well, maybe organic chemists live for danger, because we also use cyanide to produce a much
1565160	1571360	larger nitrile compound from primary and secondary alkyl halides in a simple SN2 reaction.
1571360	1576360	Using cyanide as a nucleophile, carbon chains can be conveniently extended by one carbon
1576360	1578720	creating larger nitriles.
1578720	1583400	And these nitriles have many uses, including as an alternative to the Gabriel synthesis
1583400	1589680	to manufacture primary amines without concern of oversubstituting the product.
1589680	1596720	For example, ethyl bromide plus a cyanide ion leads to a compound known as propane nitrile,
1596720	1602720	which can be easily converted into propanamine with H2 and platinum catalyst.
1602720	1608800	Of course, having pi bonds to their heteroatoms means that nitriles can also be thought of
1608800	1613240	as being similar to carbonyls, just like their immune cousins.
1613240	1617720	And they tend to have a very electrophilic nitrile carbon, and so they're susceptible
1617720	1620920	to a nucleophilic attack at that location.
1620920	1625720	So we can design synthesis in which the electrophilic nitrile carbon is attacked, leading to strategies
1625720	1631960	to create many of the other functional groups that we've discussed so far.
1631960	1636160	Probably the most familiar use of the term nitrile is in reference to functional groups
1636160	1641800	used in certain rubber products, the best example being nitrile examination gloves.
1641800	1647920	See, the polymer used to produce nitrile rubber is created from a reaction using acrylonitrile
1647920	1649920	as one of its starting materials.
1649920	1654360	And we're going to take a closer look at this process later on in the course.
1654360	1657880	But the result of this process is a polymer, which is decorated with repeating nitrile
1657880	1663960	groups, giving it greater resistance to oils than natural rubber latex.
1663960	1669040	Of course, another benefit of nitrile latex is that it's prepared completely synthetically,
1669040	1674000	and therefore it contains no plant material like natural rubber latex does.
1674000	1678440	And this is why nitrile products don't fall prey to the same allergy-related issues as
1678440	1683360	natural rubber latex.
1683360	1687800	So today we injected a whole new element into our thinking about organic chemistry,
1687800	1690080	the element nitrogen.
1690080	1696680	We discussed how crucial nitrogen is to many biological molecules, both small and large,
1696680	1701280	and the length to which Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch were willing to go to get fixed nitrogen
1701280	1704680	in the form of ammonia.
1704680	1709840	We talked about how nitrogen typically has three bonds, making it structurally diverse
1709840	1714360	as an atom, and giving it geometric complexity in the second row of the periodic table that's
1714360	1718040	only exceeded by that of carbon.
1718040	1723560	We also talked about the simplest of nitrogen-containing compounds, amines, and how they're classified
1723560	1727120	as primary, secondary, and tertiary.
1727120	1731280	We saw how primary amines can be made using the Gabriel synthesis.
1731280	1735400	Secondary amines can be made by the reduction of amines produced by amination of ketones
1735400	1737120	and aldehydes.
1737120	1741640	And we also saw how tertiary amines can be easily made by the direct amination of alkyl
1741640	1745160	halides.
1745160	1749640	We touched on the structure and classification of amines, in which the nitrogen contains
1749640	1752600	a pi bond to an adjacent carbon.
1752600	1758560	We discussed how primary and secondary, ketamines, and aldehydes can be formed from ketones and
1758560	1762280	aldehydes using ammonia or primary amines.
1763040	1767840	And finally, we considered nitrials, in which two pi bonds are present.
1767840	1772880	We looked at the simplest and most well-known of these nitrials, hydrogen cyanide, which
1772880	1777440	can be deprotonated to create a potent toxin that's also a good nucleophile in the form
1777440	1780680	of cyanide ion.
1780680	1785320	We talked about how cyanide ion can be used to produce larger nitrials by us in two reactions,
1785320	1787920	with primary and secondary alkyl halides.
1788640	1792920	And finally, we saw how, in a second step, these nitrial products can be converted into
1792920	1797960	compounds with a host of other functional groups.
1797960	1801880	Next time, we're going to bring oxygen back to the discussion and look at some functional
1801880	1807920	groups which contain both nitrogen and oxygen, from biopolymers to artificial sweeteners
1807920	1808920	to explosives.
1808920	1810840	It should be a wild ride.
1810840	1811840	I'll see you then.
