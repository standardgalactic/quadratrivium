00:00.000 --> 00:17.360
In the latter part of the 1830s, a desperate businessman by the name of Charles Goodyear

00:17.360 --> 00:19.720
was near the end of his rope.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.840
Having already failed in the hardware business in Philadelphia, he had turned his attention

00:23.840 --> 00:29.000
to a newly available material from Brazil called rubber.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.960
Like many other entrepreneurs at his time, Goodyear believed that this pliable, moldable

00:33.960 --> 00:39.240
substance had enormous potential to be put to work in a number of potentially profitable

00:39.240 --> 00:40.240
applications.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.200
But there were some problems.

00:44.200 --> 00:50.880
Despite its usefulness in waterproofing applications, rubber itself was very soft, pliable, and

00:50.880 --> 00:56.760
tended to deform plastically, meaning that once pulled or otherwise misshapen, it retained

00:56.760 --> 00:58.000
the new shape.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.000
Now Goodyear had worked with natural rubber for about a half a decade, seeking out ways

01:03.000 --> 01:06.880
to strengthen it so that it could be used to produce objects which could be molded into

01:06.880 --> 01:14.240
a desired shape, but would then retain that shape across a great range of conditions.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.320
As seems to usually be the case with great discoveries, Goodyear's breakthrough was reached

01:19.320 --> 01:21.520
quite by accident.

01:21.520 --> 01:26.680
There are several variations of the story, but the most inspirational is this.

01:26.680 --> 01:31.560
Being nearly bankrupt, Goodyear had attempted to remove paint from one of his rubber samples

01:31.560 --> 01:33.520
for reuse.

01:33.520 --> 01:38.200
To do this, he tried using nitric acid.

01:38.200 --> 01:42.880
He noticed that after removing the paint with nitric acid, the properties of his rubber

01:42.880 --> 01:46.080
sample had changed.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.160
He realized then that treatment with various other materials might alter the structure

01:51.160 --> 01:58.400
of rubber, or even become incorporated into it, changing its properties for the better.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.720
Now Goodyear wasn't much of a chemist, so he had to rely on blind trial and error to

02:02.720 --> 02:06.040
concoct his modified rubber materials.

02:06.040 --> 02:14.240
Being readily available and inexpensive, one of the modifiers he tried was elemental sulfur.

02:14.240 --> 02:19.120
Now as the story goes, Goodyear walked into the general store in the town of Woburn, Massachusetts,

02:19.120 --> 02:20.760
where he was then living.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.800
It was then that he accidentally dropped a sample of his latest sulfur-treated rubber

02:24.800 --> 02:28.320
concoction onto a pot-bellied stove.

02:28.320 --> 02:36.040
In the ensuing charred mess, he noticed that some of that material's properties had changed.

02:36.040 --> 02:40.040
Goodyear later worked out a more controlled process for producing the material he had

02:40.040 --> 02:43.400
first observed in the aftermath of his accident.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.560
And he finally settled on a method for production by steam-heating a mixture of natural rubber

02:48.640 --> 02:50.840
with sulfur.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.840
His new material was first used by his brother-in-law to induce the then sought-after ruffles in

02:55.840 --> 03:00.400
the fabrics of men's shirts.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.880
Now it turns out that Goodyear wasn't only limited in his chemistry skills.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.320
He didn't fare too well in the world of business either.

03:08.320 --> 03:12.960
Goodyear managed to obtain an American patent for his new material, but he failed to seize

03:12.960 --> 03:15.960
the same opportunity in the British market.

03:15.960 --> 03:21.480
It was an English entrepreneur and a competitor of Goodyear's by the name of Thomas Hancock,

03:21.480 --> 03:26.120
who reverse engineered his invention from one of Goodyear's own samples and obtained

03:26.120 --> 03:28.120
the British patent.

03:28.120 --> 03:33.400
Shortly thereafter, one of Hancock's associates coined the term vulcanized rubber, naming

03:33.400 --> 03:36.680
the material for the Roman god of fire.

03:36.680 --> 03:42.120
Perhaps some would say that Hermes, Roman god of thieves, would have been a better namesake.

03:42.120 --> 03:47.600
So vulcanized rubber became not just a world-changing material from which many durable rubber products

03:47.600 --> 03:53.600
could be made, but also one of the first artificially modified polymers in human history.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.440
Polymers are defined as a very large set of molecules consisting of repeating units

04:01.440 --> 04:03.960
known as monomers.

04:03.960 --> 04:09.640
We've already looked at some biologically relevant polymers, including DNA, RNA, proteins

04:09.640 --> 04:11.720
and starches.

04:11.720 --> 04:16.080
But Goodyear's invention is noteworthy because it may have represented the first semi-synthetic

04:16.080 --> 04:18.960
polymer created by man.

04:18.960 --> 04:24.000
But it wasn't long after that that German apothecary by the name of Edward Simon managed

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
to create a substance with similar properties, not by modifying an existing natural polymer,

04:30.000 --> 04:36.520
but from individual molecules of styrene, he treated to induce polymerization.

04:37.360 --> 04:42.720
Now, by no fault of his own, Simon lacked the insight to fully understand what he had

04:42.720 --> 04:44.480
just done.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.560
He only knew that heating styrene led to a material with properties very similar to

04:48.560 --> 04:50.400
rubber.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.560
This observation went largely unnoticed.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.640
To those who did notice, the simplest explanation was that he had created a conglomerate of

04:57.640 --> 05:03.640
small molecules held together in aggregates by intermolecular forces.

05:03.640 --> 05:08.600
After all, the creation of a covalent molecule with thousands upon thousands of atoms was

05:08.600 --> 05:10.280
not a reasonable explanation.

05:10.280 --> 05:14.120
That could never happen, right?

05:14.120 --> 05:20.160
It was nearly a century later that Simon's countryman, Hermann Staudinger, finally elucidated

05:20.160 --> 05:22.760
the structure of Simon's creation.

05:22.760 --> 05:27.960
It took some outside-of-the-box thinking to finally understand Simon's material.

05:27.960 --> 05:33.200
Staudinger finally postulated publicly that the heated styrene molecules had reacted with

05:33.200 --> 05:37.320
themselves to create immense molecules of great size.

05:37.320 --> 05:43.320
Staudinger's initial efforts to reach this idea, or to research this idea, were met with

05:43.320 --> 05:45.720
remarkable skepticism.

05:45.720 --> 05:50.040
He found it difficult to secure the support of his colleagues, who all believed rubbers

05:50.040 --> 05:56.640
were aggregates of small molecules stuck together by some messy non-covalent force.

05:56.640 --> 06:01.560
Even the eminent Hermann M. L. Fisher went on record against Staudinger's theories.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.280
But Staudinger stood fast, and it's a good thing that he did.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.800
His theory proved true.

06:07.800 --> 06:14.280
And having fought the good fight to prove it, he received his Nobel Prize in 1953.

06:14.280 --> 06:21.240
Ultimately, it was realized that styrene molecules had been joined together through their vinyl

06:21.240 --> 06:26.560
groups, creating carbon chains with hundreds or even thousands of atoms.

06:27.560 --> 06:32.320
With the benefit of 100 years of additional insight, and his willingness to continue supporting

06:32.320 --> 06:37.880
his theory in the face of substantial opposition, Staudinger's theory of polymers, which he

06:37.880 --> 06:42.840
referred to as macromolecules, ultimately had proven true.

06:45.200 --> 06:50.800
Since the days of Staudinger's work, a tremendous amount of attention has been poured into understanding,

06:50.800 --> 06:54.560
designing, and creating useful polymers.

06:54.560 --> 06:59.680
From the tires on your car, to the man-made fibers in some clothing, to medical equipment,

06:59.680 --> 07:04.880
body armor, food packaging, and even more, the importance of synthetic polymers to our

07:04.880 --> 07:09.920
modern lifestyles simply cannot be overstated.

07:09.920 --> 07:15.280
So in this lecture, we're going to take a short survey of polymer chemistry, how polymers

07:15.280 --> 07:20.080
are designed, how they're made, and a few ways in which they've changed the world.

07:20.080 --> 07:27.880
Synthetic polymers are classified in more than one way, but a typical method is to

07:27.880 --> 07:31.480
distinguish them based upon how they're prepared.

07:31.480 --> 07:35.960
From this perspective, most polymers fall into one of two general classes.

07:35.960 --> 07:42.240
Addition polymers, also called chain growth polymers, or condensation polymers, sometimes

07:42.240 --> 07:44.920
called step growth polymers.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.560
So let's take a look at each of those classes one at a time.

07:48.560 --> 07:54.600
The first class of polymers based upon their synthesis are addition polymers, also called

07:54.600 --> 07:56.440
chain growth.

07:56.440 --> 08:01.120
Now any polymer will be constructed from a set of small molecules known as monomers.

08:01.120 --> 08:07.520
Now I've represented my monomers here as simply these red objects that are going to do the

08:07.520 --> 08:14.040
chemistry that we would expect of a molecule, which is very small, but is a monomer.

08:14.040 --> 08:18.040
To this, we're going to add another type of molecule called an initiator.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.840
That's because in the case of addition polymers, my individual monomers are not reactive in

08:22.840 --> 08:25.160
and of themselves.

08:25.160 --> 08:29.240
But in the presence of an initiator, my monomer can react.

08:29.240 --> 08:34.480
And only when attached to the chain will that new monomer become reactive again, sequestering

08:34.480 --> 08:38.240
more and more of the monomer to the chain.

08:38.240 --> 08:43.620
In short, addition polymers grow from one end to the other in a fashion much like this.

08:43.620 --> 08:48.300
So their sizes are very predictable and very easy to manipulate.

08:48.300 --> 08:54.220
A classic example of an addition polymer are those formed from alkene subunits, trading

08:54.220 --> 08:59.660
less stable pi bonds for the new sigma bonds which link them together.

08:59.660 --> 09:06.340
The first entirely synthetic polymer, polystyrene, falls into this class of compounds.

09:06.340 --> 09:13.380
The process of creating addition polymers consists of three phases, the initiation, the propagation,

09:13.380 --> 09:14.380
and the termination.

09:14.380 --> 09:21.340
In the case of polystyrene, polymerization reaction can be initiated when a sample of

09:21.340 --> 09:28.900
styrene is heated in the presence of just a small amount of benzoil peroxide.

09:28.900 --> 09:34.860
Now the heat causes the benzoil peroxide to dissociate into two phenyl radicals, a process

09:34.860 --> 09:39.720
encouraged by the loss of carbon dioxide gas.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.380
In the second step, propagation.

09:42.380 --> 09:47.460
As each monomer encounters the reactive radical at the end of a chain, a new sigma bond is

09:47.460 --> 09:52.380
formed homogenically, meaning one electron from each side.

09:52.380 --> 09:56.140
This regenerates the radical at the end of the lengthening chain and perpetuates the

09:56.140 --> 09:58.140
reaction.

09:58.140 --> 10:05.020
In the case of polystyrene, this process repeats itself several thousand times before the third

10:05.020 --> 10:08.900
phase, termination takes place.

10:08.900 --> 10:14.400
In termination, either two growing radicals react with one another or something of that

10:14.400 --> 10:20.200
like forming one last sigma bond which will ultimately consume the radicals without generating

10:20.200 --> 10:24.160
a new one.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.280
Addition polymers are very attractive targets for commercial materials because their properties

10:28.280 --> 10:33.520
can be turned or tuned by controlling the overall size of the macromolecules produced

10:33.520 --> 10:35.840
in the chain growth reaction.

10:35.840 --> 10:40.540
For example, the size of the polystyrene polymer molecules can be controlled simply

10:40.540 --> 10:46.980
by altering the relative amount of benzoil peroxide initiator which is added.

10:46.980 --> 10:52.460
Relatively fewer benzoil peroxide molecules means fewer growing chains.

10:52.460 --> 10:56.740
And because growth can only take place at the end of an initiated chain, one expects

10:56.740 --> 11:00.940
to obtain longer polymers in this kind of scenario.

11:01.840 --> 11:06.760
Additionally, fewer growing chains means less likelihood that two growing chains will encounter

11:06.760 --> 11:09.160
one another in a termination step.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.960
Some other examples of addition polymers include polyethylene used in plastic bottles formed

11:13.960 --> 11:18.040
by the addition of ethene monomers to one another.

11:18.040 --> 11:23.520
Polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, most well known as a substitute for metal plumbing pipes,

11:23.520 --> 11:28.960
is assembled in a similar reaction using vinyl chloride monomers.

11:28.960 --> 11:36.900
Even the once popular cookware coating Teflon is formed by polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene.

11:36.900 --> 11:41.580
Now let's take a look at the second class of polymers, condensation polymers, also

11:41.580 --> 11:45.620
sometimes called step growth polymers.

11:45.620 --> 11:52.260
This has become a very popular class of polymers because they're relatively easy to make.

11:52.260 --> 11:57.980
Condensation polymers form, again, through conjoining, more than one, obviously, monomers,

11:57.980 --> 12:01.000
we want long chains, so we need lots and lots of monomers.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.080
But in the case of condensation polymers, each monomer itself is reactive without any

12:06.080 --> 12:08.520
initiator necessary.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.400
So in the case of condensation polymers, rather than having an initiator dictate when and

12:13.400 --> 12:21.320
where monomers can join together, my monomers can really join together anywhere at any time.

12:21.320 --> 12:27.860
So in this case, I have a growing set of ever larger and larger polymers forming as my

12:27.860 --> 12:32.160
monomers become dimers, which can condense with other monomers or dimers, and so on and

12:32.160 --> 12:33.680
so on.

12:33.680 --> 12:38.980
But you'll notice that in this process, I get a wide variety of lengths in my polymers

12:38.980 --> 12:40.480
as they grow.

12:40.480 --> 12:45.880
So although condensation polymers are very easy to make, they are very difficult to control

12:45.880 --> 12:48.800
from a polymer length standpoint.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.600
Now generally, condensation polymers differ from addition polymers in that their growth

12:53.600 --> 12:59.580
is not driven by trading of pi bonds for sigma bonds, but by the formation of small molecule

12:59.580 --> 13:03.740
byproducts like water or hydrochloric acid.

13:03.740 --> 13:10.260
A perfect example of this is the formation of nylon-6, in which molecules of 6-aminohexanoic

13:10.260 --> 13:16.980
acid are joined together in a reaction which produces not only an amide union between monomers,

13:16.980 --> 13:22.420
but also a molecule of water as a byproduct.

13:22.700 --> 13:27.400
So far in this lecture, I've shown examples of polymerization reactions in which only

13:27.400 --> 13:33.960
one type of monomer is used, leading to very simple, repeating structures of that monomer.

13:33.960 --> 13:40.440
Make no mistake, polymers like polystyrene, PVC, and nylon-6 are extremely valuable and

13:40.440 --> 13:42.440
useful materials.

13:42.440 --> 13:48.040
But we can significantly increase the complexity and therefore the tuneability of polymers

13:48.040 --> 13:52.280
if we use more than one monomer in the process.

13:52.300 --> 13:56.900
When we use more than one monomer to create a polymer, we call the class of compounds

13:56.900 --> 13:59.180
created copolymers.

13:59.180 --> 14:03.620
So the examples I'm going to show here are using only two different monomers, but we

14:03.620 --> 14:09.420
could just as easily have three or four or any number of different monomers.

14:09.420 --> 14:13.980
Now copolymers can be constructed using either one of our two major mechanisms for building

14:13.980 --> 14:19.260
a polymer, so they're not necessarily chain growth or step growth polymers.

14:19.260 --> 14:22.920
But what is true is that when I have a collection of monomers like this one where I have indicated

14:22.920 --> 14:28.360
one monomer in red and one monomer in blue, they can combine in several different geometric

14:28.360 --> 14:34.080
relationships, each of which can lead to a polymer with different properties.

14:34.080 --> 14:38.360
Possibly the simplest example of this is what we would call an alternating copolymer, in

14:38.360 --> 14:44.160
which each monomer is spaced with two of the other monomers around it, so red, blue, red,

14:44.160 --> 14:48.240
blue, red, blue, all the way across.

14:48.240 --> 14:53.340
The second arrangement would be what we would call a random copolymer, in which the order

14:53.340 --> 15:00.700
of each monomer within the overall chain is completely statistically random.

15:00.700 --> 15:05.980
A third potential arrangement is what we call a block copolymer.

15:05.980 --> 15:11.740
In a block copolymer, long stretches of a certain type of monomer exist, which are then

15:11.740 --> 15:19.240
punctuated by long stretches of the other monomer or monomers within the copolymer.

15:19.240 --> 15:24.800
And as one last example of a type of structure that copolymers can form, we have something

15:24.800 --> 15:31.160
called a graft copolymer, in which one of the monomers serves to form the backbone while

15:31.160 --> 15:36.120
the other decorates that backbone by branching away from it.

15:36.120 --> 15:41.660
So an alternating polymer that we're familiar with is produced when vinyl chloride and

15:41.660 --> 15:47.860
vinylidine chloride react in a radical chain growth polymerization.

15:47.860 --> 15:54.040
In this reaction, monomers add in an alternating order, with vinyl chloride monomers reacting

15:54.040 --> 15:59.880
at initiated vinylidine termini and vinylidine chloride monomers reacting at initiated vinyl

15:59.880 --> 16:03.420
chloride termini.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.340
The result is an alternating polymer called saran.

16:07.340 --> 16:11.620
This is the polymer used to make the very popular food wrap which bears its name.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.500
Isn't that remarkable?

16:13.500 --> 16:18.620
Just one additional chlorine atom on every other monomer unit, and we go from PVC, which

16:18.620 --> 16:26.220
is used in plumbing, to saran wrap, which is very flexible and is used as a food wrap.

16:26.220 --> 16:32.140
But alternating polymers can just as easily be produced using condensation polymerizations.

16:32.140 --> 16:40.660
One example of this is the polymer nylon 6-6, not to be confused with nylon 6.

16:40.660 --> 16:50.700
Nylon 6-6 is prepared using equal parts of adipic acid and 1-6 hexane diamine.

16:50.700 --> 16:56.180
By producing nylon in this way, the orientation of alternating amide bonds is reversed from

16:56.180 --> 16:58.780
those in nylon 6.

16:58.780 --> 17:04.060
In fact, it would be more accurate to say that the amide bonds in nylon 6 are reversed

17:04.060 --> 17:10.340
since nylon 6-6 was actually the first of these to be prepared and patented by DuPont

17:10.340 --> 17:13.100
in 1935.

17:13.100 --> 17:18.740
The development of the homopolymer nylon 6 by BASF was an attempt to produce a material

17:18.740 --> 17:24.900
with similar properties, which didn't infringe on DuPont's intellectual property.

17:24.900 --> 17:30.460
In fact, both of these polymers were a huge success and are still used today as the backbone

17:30.460 --> 17:38.020
for some of the most modern materials produced by both companies.

17:38.020 --> 17:44.100
Random copolymers are produced by mixing monomers, but unlike alternating copolymers, growing

17:44.100 --> 17:49.580
random copolymers can incorporate any of the monomers in any order, leading to a statistically

17:49.580 --> 17:53.740
random distribution of monomers in the molecule.

17:53.740 --> 18:00.300
An example of a random copolymer is polybutyrate, which is a polyester compound, built from

18:00.300 --> 18:03.180
two distinct subunits.

18:03.180 --> 18:07.020
The distinction here is that these subunits are randomly oriented throughout each polymer

18:07.020 --> 18:09.620
strand.

18:09.620 --> 18:13.860
But what's really special about polybutyrate isn't how it's made, but the fact that its

18:13.860 --> 18:17.420
ester bonds make it fully biodegradable.

18:17.420 --> 18:22.860
Plastic bags and wraps produced from this flexible, random copolymer are completely deconstructed

18:22.860 --> 18:27.820
by moisture and microbes in the ground, making it a popular choice for disposable items of

18:27.820 --> 18:32.260
this kind.

18:32.260 --> 18:35.820
One of the more exciting advances in more recent decades has been the development of

18:35.820 --> 18:41.700
block copolymers, which aim to exploit the best properties of more than one polymer by

18:41.700 --> 18:46.940
linking together large regions of each, which we call domains.

18:46.940 --> 18:53.180
For example, the block copolymer SBS is used in many modern applications, including tires

18:53.180 --> 18:55.820
and running shoe soles.

18:55.820 --> 19:02.460
SBS stands for polystyrene butadiene styrene.

19:02.460 --> 19:09.060
So in a single molecule of this block copolymer, a domain of polybutadiene is sandwiched in

19:09.060 --> 19:14.780
between two polystyrene domains.

19:14.780 --> 19:20.580
The polystyrene blocks give this polymer great toughness, while the polybutadiene domain

19:20.580 --> 19:26.180
becomes softer under high temperature conditions, allowing the material to be more easily moldable

19:26.180 --> 19:28.660
like softer rubbers.

19:28.660 --> 19:32.900
The result is a material which behaves more like a plastic at high temperature, but more

19:32.900 --> 19:38.820
like vulcanized rubber when cooler, a perfect recipe for manufacturing tires.

19:38.820 --> 19:44.420
I think Mr. Goodyear would be proud.

19:44.420 --> 19:50.540
Our fourth class, graft copolymers, are characterized by a uniform backbone polymer which is decorated

19:50.540 --> 19:56.420
by strands of a different polymer attached covalently along its length.

19:56.420 --> 20:01.260
In many cases, graft copolymers can be designed to have certain properties of both polymers

20:01.260 --> 20:03.420
which make it up.

20:03.420 --> 20:09.660
For example, long polysaccharides like cellulose onto which other polymers are grafted.

20:09.660 --> 20:13.700
This has the effect of producing a very large molecule with the properties of those smaller

20:13.700 --> 20:22.140
grafted polymers, but retaining the biodegradability of the cellulose backbone.

20:22.140 --> 20:27.220
And while we're back on the subject of Mr. Goodyear, let's take a look back at his creation,

20:27.220 --> 20:29.780
knowing what we do now about polymers.

20:29.780 --> 20:34.460
Natural rubber is a somewhat complex mixture created by trees to defend themselves from

20:34.460 --> 20:36.540
wood-eating insects.

20:36.540 --> 20:41.820
It has quite a few minor components, but the big player in its chemical properties is this.

20:41.820 --> 20:49.020
A polyisoprene macromolecule made on long, unsaturated hydrocarbons, making it very thick

20:49.020 --> 20:53.220
and insoluble in water.

20:53.220 --> 20:57.820
Now the problem in Goodyear's days is that these polyisoprene macromolecules are only

20:57.820 --> 21:03.580
held together by intermolecular dispersion forces stemming from their electron clouds.

21:03.580 --> 21:06.300
So let's look at this.

21:06.300 --> 21:11.060
These forces are enough to make the molecule viscous, but they can be overcome.

21:11.060 --> 21:18.540
So when I pull on my natural rubber molecules, they can slide back and forth on one another.

21:18.540 --> 21:24.620
Now what Goodyear had accomplished by the addition of sulfur was to cross-link the polymer molecules

21:24.620 --> 21:27.180
with covalent bonds to sulfur.

21:27.180 --> 21:30.500
So let me pull that polymer back together here.

21:30.500 --> 21:36.980
So some of these pi bonds within the rubber were replaced by a sulfur bridge.

21:36.980 --> 21:41.820
So we'll put in a few sulfur bridges, and now let's pull on that polymer again and see

21:41.820 --> 21:43.340
if it deforms.

21:43.340 --> 21:48.940
I can deform the polymer, but as soon as I release it, it snaps back into place.

21:48.940 --> 21:53.700
This is because of the bridging solfers.

21:53.700 --> 21:58.260
So the presence of these cross-links is what gives vulcanized rubber its toughness and

21:58.260 --> 22:03.140
ability to retain its shape, exactly what you would hope for in a product like an automobile

22:03.140 --> 22:04.700
tire.

22:04.700 --> 22:10.060
It also, unfortunately, makes the material very difficult to deconstruct, meaning that

22:10.060 --> 22:15.700
vulcanized rubbers are very difficult to recycle.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.260
Now this is the reason that tire yards exist.

22:18.260 --> 22:23.980
For many decades, non-biodegradable, non-recyclable vulcanized rubber tires were simply piled

22:23.980 --> 22:28.260
up in huge tire yards with no obvious fate.

22:28.260 --> 22:32.640
Today we do our best to reuse vulcanized rubber by cutting or chipping it into smaller pieces

22:32.640 --> 22:35.980
for use in paving projects and other applications.

22:35.980 --> 22:40.580
But melting and reforming vulcanized rubber is simply not possible.

22:40.580 --> 22:50.120
So truly recycling a tire by making it into another tire is not a viable strategy.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.480
Yet another common polymer motif is polycarbonates.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.360
These polymers are found in materials as tough and rigid as bulletproof glass, and as soft

22:59.360 --> 23:02.820
and supple as commercial water bottles.

23:02.820 --> 23:08.420
Both of these products are made from the condensation of carbonic acid with bisphenol A to form

23:08.420 --> 23:10.700
an alternating copolymer.

23:10.700 --> 23:16.060
Recently, concern has arisen over the possibility that these polymers can hydrolyze back into

23:16.060 --> 23:21.060
their starting materials over time, leaching bisphenol A into the water or beverage that

23:21.060 --> 23:24.420
they contain.

23:24.420 --> 23:29.180
The reason for so much concern is mounting evidence that bisphenol A imitates estradiol

23:29.180 --> 23:33.800
in the body, potentially causing developmental or reproductive problems in those who are

23:33.800 --> 23:37.240
exposed to it.

23:37.240 --> 23:43.120
Some studies suggest that BPA is less than one-tenthousandth as powerful of a hormone

23:43.120 --> 23:48.320
as estradiol is, suggesting that this whole controversy may be overblown.

23:48.320 --> 23:54.480
Still, we simply don't know what the long-term effects of exposure to low levels of BPA might

23:54.480 --> 23:57.040
do.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.940
No one is sure exactly what the risks are, but one thing is undeniable.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.260
Many people are sufficiently wary of BPA that they are willing to purchase products

24:05.260 --> 24:13.700
labeled BPA-free without giving much thought to what's actually in the product.

24:13.700 --> 24:18.580
The polymers industry has responded to these concerns by offering BPA-free plastics with

24:18.580 --> 24:20.820
a great deal of fanfare.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.700
Sounds great, doesn't it?

24:22.700 --> 24:27.720
So what they don't tell you is that most of these products are still polycarbonates,

24:27.720 --> 24:35.760
which are simply made using molecules like bisphenol S or bisphenol F in place of bisphenol

24:35.760 --> 24:39.160
A in an analogous reaction.

24:39.160 --> 24:44.560
Now if there is concern over a molecule like bisphenol A imitating estradiol, something

24:44.560 --> 24:50.560
tells me it's only a matter of time until bisphenol S, F, and others come under similar

24:50.580 --> 24:57.340
scrutiny, putting us right back where we were before.

24:57.340 --> 25:01.980
One last hot button plastics issue that you may have heard of is the use of compounds

25:01.980 --> 25:05.100
called phthalates.

25:05.100 --> 25:10.100
Phthalic acid is a small organic diacid which looks like this.

25:10.100 --> 25:14.900
It's easily esterified with a number of aliphatic alcohols to produce small molecules called

25:14.900 --> 25:17.780
phthalates.

25:17.780 --> 25:23.000
Phthalates like this dibutal phthalate are sometimes added to polyvinyl chloride to soften

25:23.000 --> 25:28.800
the plastic enough to make it useful over a wider range of applications.

25:28.800 --> 25:35.080
Now plasticizers work by disrupting the packing of polymer chains, in this case in the PVC,

25:35.080 --> 25:38.000
thereby softening it.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.160
That new car smell that so much of us enjoy is caused by these plasticizers escaping the

25:43.160 --> 25:48.780
newly prepared plastics into the air.

25:48.780 --> 25:55.280
Now it's worth mentioning that polyethylene tetrothalate, commonly called P-E-T-E, is

25:55.280 --> 26:00.700
used in food packaging and does not contain isolated phthalate molecules at all.

26:00.700 --> 26:06.580
The phthalate portion of P-E-T-E's name refers to the monomer which is condensed in the prepared

26:06.580 --> 26:08.220
polymer.

26:08.220 --> 26:13.220
So in this case the phthalate is locked securely in the matrix of this non-biodegradable plastic

26:13.220 --> 26:16.240
where it can't easily be released.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.680
So P-E-T-E doesn't release phthalates into the environment even though phthalate is in

26:20.680 --> 26:26.760
its name and PVC very often does release phthalates even though the term phthalate is nowhere to

26:26.760 --> 26:31.360
be found in its name.

26:31.360 --> 26:37.240
So in this lecture we grazed the surface of nearly 200 years of synthetic polymer chemistry.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.260
Starting with the accidental vulcanization of rubber by Charles Goodyear during a clumsy

26:41.260 --> 26:45.100
moment in 1830s Massachusetts.

26:45.100 --> 26:50.740
We talked about the two major classes of polymerization reactions, addition and condensation, also

26:50.740 --> 26:58.940
called chain growth polymerization and step growth polymerization respectively.

26:58.940 --> 27:04.380
We saw how chain growth usually involves the reaction of alkene subunits with an activated

27:04.400 --> 27:09.120
growing polymer chain until termination takes place.

27:09.120 --> 27:14.640
Specifically we took a look at radical polymerization which is initiated by the dissociation of

27:14.640 --> 27:20.200
a small bit of benzoyl peroxide to initiate chain growth.

27:20.200 --> 27:25.160
By contrast condensation polymers tend to proceed with the formation of small molecules

27:25.160 --> 27:30.960
as monomers, dimers, trimmers, tetramers and more and condense with one another forming

27:30.980 --> 27:36.980
ever larger chains until the reagents are exhausted.

27:36.980 --> 27:42.060
We then took a different view on polymers, classifying them not based upon the reaction

27:42.060 --> 27:48.180
which makes them, but the morphology of the polymer chains themselves, including homopolymers

27:48.180 --> 27:53.300
and the many layers of complexity added when copolymers come into play.

27:53.300 --> 27:59.060
We saw the alternating copolymer saran and the random copolymer polybutyrate, both of

27:59.080 --> 28:05.080
which blend monomers closely together, usually forming a polymer with totally new properties.

28:05.080 --> 28:12.080
Then we considered how graft copolymers and block copolymers can preserve certain properties

28:12.080 --> 28:17.480
of each homopolymer from which they are derived, helping chemists to design polymers perfectly

28:17.480 --> 28:20.480
suited to an intended application.

28:20.480 --> 28:25.960
Finally, we looked at a few recent concerns regarding popular polymers, including the

28:25.960 --> 28:31.860
estrogen emulating bisphenol compounds used in polycarbonates and the use of plasticizers

28:31.860 --> 28:35.260
like phthalates.

28:35.260 --> 28:40.780
Of course what we saw in this lecture is just a small slice of polymer chemistry, a field

28:40.780 --> 28:46.660
made incredibly diverse by not only the vast library of monomers and linking motifs, but

28:46.660 --> 28:51.380
by the sheer titanic size of the molecules involved.

28:51.380 --> 28:56.380
So macromolecules bring us to a fitting end to our survey of organic compounds in their

28:56.380 --> 28:59.120
reactions.

28:59.120 --> 29:04.360
In our next few lessons, we're going to focus not on how new compounds are made and put to

29:04.360 --> 29:08.960
use, but on how they are identified.

29:08.960 --> 29:13.000
Organic chemists use a very special set of techniques to be their eyes as they navigate

29:13.000 --> 29:18.400
the long and sometimes complex road to an effective synthesis, and no organic chemistry

29:18.400 --> 29:21.780
course is complete without it.

29:21.780 --> 29:25.220
We'll begin to develop an understanding of the techniques that have been used to verify

29:25.220 --> 29:28.500
so much of the information that I've already given you.

29:28.500 --> 29:33.300
From identifying specific functional groups, to discerning regioisomers and enantiomers

29:33.300 --> 29:39.740
of small molecules, to determining full protein structures, spectroscopy is the tool that lets

29:39.740 --> 29:42.660
us observe the fruits of our labor in the lab.

29:42.660 --> 29:46.660
It's an exciting science in its own right, and it will be the topic of our next few lectures.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.160
And I'll see you for those soon.
