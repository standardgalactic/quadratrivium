1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,980
So last time we took a look at how benzene rings were first discovered, the debate over

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,580
their structure, and exactly why they possessed such an unusual stability.

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,740
The benzene ring is a pervasive motif in organic chemistry, not only because of its stability,

4
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,520
but also for its complex, yet predictable and controllable reactivity.

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,500
As we discussed previously, benzene is an aromatic compound.

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,060
In fact, it's the structural basis for aromatic compounds, though how they got this name is

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,180
something of a mystery since only some of them have strong or pleasing odors.

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,260
Nonetheless, this moniker has stuck with benzene in its derivatives for nearly two centuries.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,540
Now, as an aromatic, the pi electrons in a benzene ring are not nearly as susceptible

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,220
to undergoing addition reactions as their non-aromatic counterparts.

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,260
We discussed how heats of hydrogenation are evidence of just how stable benzene rings

12
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,020
really are in the face of addition reactions, which require them to sacrifice their aromaticity.

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,940
But what about substitution reactions?

14
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,540
Is it possible to entice benzene to react in such a way that one of its six-ring hydrogens

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,620
can be replaced with a more complex functional group of our choosing without sacrificing

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,820
its aromaticity?

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,940
The answer to this question is yes, and one of the most frequently employed pathways to

18
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,500
accomplish this is electrophilic aromatic substitution.

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,580
During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the science of organic chemistry was booming

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,060
in both Europe and America.

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,420
Many names with which we are familiar today were hard at work during this time period,

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,700
devising new ways to make and break chemical bonds in a useful fashion.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,380
One such chemist was Adolf von Beyer, who in 1873 was working at the University of Strasbourg

24
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,380
in Germany.

25
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,180
Now, Beyer was supervising a graduate student by the name of Othmar Zeidler, whose graduate

26
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:15,100
project included the synthesis of a substituted benzene compound known as Dichlorodifenyltrichloroethane,

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,620
DDT for short.

28
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,340
Zeidler's synthesis of his compound was accomplished using chlorobenzene and chloral, under acidic

29
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,420
conditions.

30
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,260
Under these conditions, the two chlorobenzene rings are joined by substituting the chloral

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,500
for hydrogens in the parallel location on each ring.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,860
Zeidler's synthesis in 1873 was largely viewed as an academic exercise.

33
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,740
Neither he nor his revered mentor, Beyer, had any idea that this compound would ultimately

34
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,380
alter the course of human history some seven decades later.

35
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,700
See, it was only during and after World War II that the insecticidal properties of DDT

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,860
were discovered and applied with breathtakingly effective results.

37
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,620
The Swiss chemist, Paul Mueller, is credited with later discovering and documenting, and

38
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,620
also obtaining Swiss patents for, the insecticidal use of this compound, after which the US government

39
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,580
tested and used the compound to combat infectious diseases abroad.

40
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,860
You see, DDT was such a powerful, broad spectrum and long-lasting insecticide that its use could

41
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,500
eradicate entire populations of disease-carrying insects, so efficiently that the disease they

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,900
carried was eliminated as well.

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,740
This includes a notable quelling of a typhus outbreak in Naples in the dead of winter.

44
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,140
Until that time, such insect-borne epidemics could only be combated by bearing down and

45
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,980
waiting for spring.

46
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,020
Additionally, there are many examples in which DDT was used to wipe out malaria completely

47
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,060
in confined populations.

48
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,780
Shortly after the conclusion of World War II, the US government began to allow commercial

49
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,620
use of DDT for pest control and domestic crop production.

50
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,220
Clearly, DDT had changed the world.

51
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,100
In the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony speech for Dr. Mueller, Professor G. Fisher noted of

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,740
Mueller's discovery, quoting here,

53
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,900
At requisite insecticidal dosages, it is practically non-toxic to humans and acts in very small

54
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,220
dosages on large number of various species of insects.

55
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,700
Furthermore, it's cheap, easily manufactured, and exceedingly stable, unquote.

56
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,740
Clearly, in 1948, the scientific community was riding high on the success of this newly

57
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,740
discovered use of DDT.

58
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,940
Unfortunately, the stability and long-lasting effects of DDT also proved to be its undoing.

59
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,620
DDT lasted so long in the environment that it could be transmitted from insects to fish,

60
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,660
and from fish to birds, where it had the unintended effect of inhibiting calcium production in

61
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,340
those birds.

62
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,700
This caused them to produce eggs with thinner shells than normal,

63
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,700
and many bird species, most notably birds of prey like eagles,

64
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,060
osprey and hawks, suffered tremendous population declines due to the presence of DDT in their

65
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,420
food sources.

66
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,620
In 1962, environmentalist and Johns Hopkins University-trained marine biologist,

67
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,860
Rachel Carson, published the book Silent Spring.

68
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,620
This book is considered one of the seminal works in modern environmentalism,

69
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,580
and it spends a great deal of its time on the U.S. agricultural industry's use of DDT

70
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:44,100
as a prime example of how rampant use of such compounds can lead to environmental disaster.

71
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:51,060
It was only in 1972, just shy of a century after its first synthesis, and three decades

72
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,420
since its implementation as an insecticide, that the U.S. banned the use of DDT in agricultural

73
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,100
applications.

74
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:06,020
Today, it only finds use in emergencies as a vector control agent to prevent the spread of disease.

75
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,260
So why am I telling you this story?

76
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,660
Well, because it's a shining example of how organic chemistry can change the world,

77
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,940
both for the better and for the worse.

78
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,420
The synthesis of DDT is also a shining example of an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction,

79
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,340
the topic of today's lesson.

80
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,420
Today, we will build on our understanding of the structure of benzene by investigating this

81
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,820
very useful class of reactions.

82
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,340
We'll investigate the general mechanism by which it takes place.

83
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,580
We'll discuss how other reagents often need to be activated to make them reactive enough

84
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,780
to entice the substantially stabilized benzene ring to react with them.

85
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,260
We'll learn about just a handful of the many modifications that we can make to benzene.

86
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,900
And finally, we'll consider how already modified benzene's can be further modified to produce

87
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,580
some of those orthometa and paraisomers that we talked about last time.

88
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,420
Electrophilic aromatic substitution is so named because the newly attached motif starts out as

89
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,140
an electrophile, unlike nucleophilic substitution in which the newly added group is nucleophilic.

90
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,540
So let's begin by looking at a reaction coordinate diagram for the reaction of benzene

91
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,580
and a generic electrophile. Here, I'm just going to use E plus to identify the electrophile,

92
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,740
but we'll soon look at some real examples.

93
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,700
Recall that even though they're in an aromatic system, the pi electrons of benzene are still

94
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,620
not held as tightly as most sigma bonding electrons. And although it takes an extraordinarily

95
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,220
electrophilic reagent to coax them into attacking, it can be done.

96
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,460
When an adequately electrophilic reagent is added to benzene, the pi electrons of benzene

97
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,380
simply can't resist attacking, and in doing so, they generate a tetrahedral center adjacent to

98
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,860
a resonance stabilized carbocation. We call this intermediate a sigma complex because we

99
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,740
have traded two of our pi electrons to make a new sigma bond to the electrophile.

100
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,460
Clearly, even with the newly formed more stable sigma bond, the sigma complex is a much higher

101
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,900
energy than the starting material. And this is mainly because the ring has lost its aromaticity

102
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,860
and the associated stability that comes from that aromaticity.

103
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,660
Under conditions like this, the intermediate will immediately begin to look for ways to dispense

104
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,740
with the positive charge of the carbocation and recover its aromaticity. Naturally, the simplest

105
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,220
way to remove the newly acquired positive charge is to lose a proton to the solvent,

106
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,180
but which proton exactly will be lost? We'll take a look at that tetrahedral center we generated

107
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,020
in the first step. If we remove one of the substituents about this center in a heterogenic bond

108
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,220
cleavage, we can repopulate the aromatic ring using the bonding electrons which were holding

109
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,060
that substituent in place. Removal of the electrophile would produce an uninteresting result

110
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,500
since we'd simply return to the starting materials. But what if instead we remove the proton on the

111
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,420
same tetrahedral center? A molecule of solvent or another weak base is usually all it takes

112
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,780
to abstract that proton, leading to a return to aromaticity and therefore stability,

113
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,220
while leaving the new benzene electrophile bond intact. Our substitution reactions complete.

114
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,540
Zeidler's synthesis of DDT relied on this mechanism to couple two molecules of chlorobenzene

115
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,540
to a compound known as chloral. He was able to substitute chloral for one of the ring hydrogens

116
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,580
of chlorobenzene, creating an intermediate which substituted for yet another ring hydrogen

117
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,580
on a second molecule of chlorobenzene. This somewhat complicated use of electrophilic

118
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,420
aromatic substitution will make more sense to us as we continue through the lecture.

119
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,420
As simple as our electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism seems,

120
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,780
getting such a reaction started can be complicated because it requires a species so

121
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,660
electronegative, so hungry for electrons that it can compensate for the temporary loss of

122
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,420
aromaticity during the reaction's first step. Indeed, the key to successful substitution

123
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,940
is to generate an adequately electrophilic substitution reagent. Now remember what makes

124
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,860
a good electrophile, high positive charge density, and the ability to accept electrons to form a new

125
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:36,660
bond. Back to Zeidler's synthesis of DDT, chloral itself is not electrophilic enough to react with

126
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,260
the aromatic electrons of chlorobenzene, and this is why he added a small amount of sulfuric acid to

127
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,740
his reaction. Sulfuric acid is strong enough to protonate a carbonyl group like that of chloral,

128
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,740
increasing the electrophilic character of its carbonyl carbon. It's this protonated carbonyl

129
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,420
species which is key to starting the reaction, which ultimately produced his history-changing compound.

130
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,380
Over the past two centuries, many researchers have devised ways to substitute benzene using

131
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,060
many familiar functional groups. Now three of these groups we'll discuss today. Those are

132
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:22,500
nitration, halogenation, and alkylation. In all three of these cases, simply mixing benzene with,

133
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,500
say, nitric acid, molecular bromine, or an alkyl halide will not achieve the desired reaction.

134
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,940
We need to find ways to make each of these three reagents even more electrophilic than they already

135
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,580
are. So let's look at how each of these three can be accomplished one by one.

136
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,620
Nitration of benzene is typically achieved by adding a bit of sulfuric acid to the mixture.

137
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,220
The purpose of the sulfuric acid is to protonate the nitric acid. That's right,

138
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,380
nitric acid is going to act as a base. And this may sound crazy, but sulfuric acid is extremely

139
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,580
strong, with a pKa of about negative two. Strong enough that it can protonate just a small amount

140
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:10,580
of nitric acid and get the process started. Once protonated, nitric acid can lose a water molecule

141
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,100
to form a species known as nitronium. The electron cloud around the nitronium is similar to that of

142
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,980
carbon dioxide, but it has a central nitrogen atom instead. Now, that extra proton in the nucleus

143
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,140
of nitrogen means that the nitrogen now has a plus one charge associated with it. And this dense

144
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,860
region of positive charge, complete with oxygen atoms ready to accept pi electrons as the attack

145
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,740
occurs, is all that it takes to make an effective electrophile for nitration.

146
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:46,740
This reaction can be used to produce nitrobenzene, which is frequently used as an organic solvent,

147
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,060
but it can also be used to create a number of very useful products. Let's take a look at one now.

148
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,660
Let's nitrate a compound called phenol using the same strategy that we just discussed.

149
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,420
This is the structure for phenol. It's benzene with a hydroxyl group attached

150
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,380
and is very easily obtained from coal tar extracts. So this compound was available to

151
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:17,700
chemists working in the early 1800s. If we add to that sulfuric acid H2SO4 with the sulfur atom

152
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,020
indicated here in yellow and nitric acid HNO3, the nitrogen atom in the center here in blue,

153
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,900
we can expect to generate a nitronium electrophile. Now, all of these materials have been readily

154
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,540
available for quite some time, so this was a very simple reaction to run very early in the

155
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,460
history of organic chemistry. Our sulfuric acid is going to transfer its proton to the nitric acid.

156
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,860
Even if only a small amount does this, it's enough to get the reaction started.

157
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,020
The product of this is our protonated nitric acid and a hydrogen sulfate anion,

158
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:59,940
the conjugate base of H2SO4. Now, once protonated, the nitric acid can lose this water functional

159
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:07,780
group, generating the nitronium ion and a water byproduct. As the reaction proceeds, the nitronium

160
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,940
ion is attacked by the phenol and forms that new sigma bond to create the sigma complex.

161
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,900
But we've lost our aromaticity now and we have a carbocation instead.

162
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,020
So to relieve this loss of aromaticity, in this case I'm going to show water

163
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,420
taking the proton from the tetrahedral center, which is in back here just behind the carbon,

164
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,580
and in doing so it will reestablish aromaticity, having left behind the newly attached nitro group.

165
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,620
So we've completed one round of nitration of phenol,

166
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,940
but it doesn't have to stop there. There are four more hydrogens on the ring,

167
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,780
and in the case of nitronium and the case of phenol, they react so well together that using a

168
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,380
little bit more nitric and sulfuric acid can result in this compound, a trinitro phenol

169
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:07,220
known as picric acid. Now picric acid is noteworthy because it's a chemical cousin of trinitrotoluene

170
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:14,340
or TNT, but it was easier to make, was discovered much earlier, and believe it or not, has an even

171
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:20,980
higher explosive yield. No community can attest better to the explosive power of picric acid

172
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,900
than the community of Halifax Nova Scotia, which was devastated by an immense blast from a French

173
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:34,340
cargo ship carrying this wartime munition in 1917. After colliding with another ship in the bay,

174
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,820
the French ship Mont Blanc caught fire, prompting the crew to evacuate the ship.

175
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,620
The resulting blast when the cargo detonated has been estimated at a force equivalent to about

176
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,940
three kilotons of TNT, creating a one mile wide swath of complete and utter destruction.

177
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,940
Now that yield is about one-fifth the explosive yield of the nuclear bomb which destroyed Hiroshima

178
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,060
nearly 30 years later at the end of World War II. This is a true testament to the

179
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,700
reactivity of nitro groups and what they can bring to organic compounds. As the aromatic

180
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,500
stabilization of benzene is clearly dramatically overwhelmed by the instability of the three

181
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,100
nitro groups which are introduced to it by this method. Halogenation of benzene is another useful

182
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,780
synthetic process, but again one which cannot be achieved simply by mixing benzene and molecular

183
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:30,500
halogens like chlorine. In this case inorganic complexes like aluminum-3 chloride or iron-3

184
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,860
chloride are used to induce a strong dipole in the molecular halogen bond.

185
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,820
This method of chlorination is so effective that when taken to extremes all six hydrogens from a

186
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:52,980
benzene can be substituted with chlorine producing hexachlorobenzene. Now this halogenated hydrocarbon

187
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,620
is a powerful antifungal agent which was used in the 1940s 50s and 60s to protect wheat crops

188
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,260
before its use was discontinued over, you guessed it, environmental concerns.

189
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,620
The same type of catalyst can be used to enhance the dipole of an alkyl halide to produce an alkylation.

190
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,620
Now alkylated benzene compounds produced in this way can be used to make such useful products as

191
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:24,740
synthetic detergents. And there's a long library of catalysts and tricks to attach a wide variety

192
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,020
of functional groups to benzene, but we're going to conclude our discussion with these three examples

193
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,780
and as I continue through the remainder of the lecture I'll try to use these three for

194
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,740
demonstration purposes, but keep in mind that the huge range of modifications are possible.

195
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:51,060
So we've taken a look at what happens when we substitute just one hydrogen on a benzene ring,

196
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,500
like its nitration, and when we substitute all of its protons like we did using chlorine and

197
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,660
aluminum-3 chloride catalyst. In cases like these only one possible isomer of the intended product

198
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:08,980
exists, but we also took a look at picric acid which has some but not all of the hydrogens

199
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,300
around its aromatic ring substituted, and this presents a new consideration. The isomer that

200
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:23,140
I showed you in the slide has three nitrates at the two, four, and six positions, but why not this

201
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:31,460
isomer, right, two, three, four, or maybe this isomer, three, four, five. Now you can see the

202
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,060
issue that we're facing here. Once a substituent has been placed on the ring the remaining hydrogens

203
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:43,540
are no longer equivalent. We have two ortho, two meta, and one para positions around the ring.

204
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,060
So we must now ask ourselves if the second substitution will take place preferentially

205
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:54,180
at one of these positions, or will we get a statistical mixture of all three possibilities.

206
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,260
This consideration is well illustrated by Zeidler's successful DDT synthesis. I say successful in the

207
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:09,380
sense that he was able to modify two chlorobenzines only at their para positions. If his electrophilic

208
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,860
aromatic substitution methodology caused substitutions at random locations around the ring we would

209
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,820
expect that any given sample of chlorobenzine molecules should produce a mixture of products

210
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:31,540
which are 40% ortho, 40% meta, and only 20% para. Moreover, the chances of a second substitution

211
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:37,860
occurring at the para position are again 20%, leaving a paltry 4% of the final product in the

212
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:45,060
preferred configuration. Yet when Zeidler's synthesis is performed the desired regioisomer

213
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:51,300
is the major product that's obtained. So how did it come to be that chlorobenzine selectively

214
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:58,900
undergoes electrophilic substitution at its para position? We call this tendency for a reaction

215
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,740
to occur at one particular position among several similar positions, regiospecificity.

216
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,500
Functional groups attached to benzene rings alter not only the reactivity of the ring,

217
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:17,540
but the regiospecificity of subsequent additions as well. Now recall we noted earlier that there

218
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:23,620
are three different positions available to react in a substituted benzene ring, two ortho, two meta,

219
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,060
and one para. So based on this distribution one might expect that, for example,

220
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,900
brominating in nitrobenzene molecule would yield a mixture of products which is 40% ortho,

221
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:42,740
40% meta, and 20% para substituted. Yet when we conduct this reaction we find that this

222
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,500
distribution of products is rarely the case. In fact, we usually find a preponderance of one

223
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,500
product with just a small amount of the others. So how does this preference to substitute at a

224
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,300
particular location on the ring happen? Well the answer lies in the stability of the sigma complex

225
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:07,620
intermediates of all three reaction pathways. So let's start by analyzing the three possible

226
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,740
pathways for the electrophilic aromatic substitution of a chlorobenzene molecule.

227
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,300
Notice that when an electrophile finds itself at the meta position we see an intermediate form

228
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,740
in which re-resonance contributors can form, all of which look very similar to those in a simple

229
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,940
benzene ring undergoing substitution. However, when an electrophile attaches to the para position

230
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,140
or the ortho position of the ring something interesting happens. We can draw a fourth resonance

231
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,180
contributor and you may recall from our earlier discussions on resonance that more resonance

232
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:48,740
contributors means a more stable species. And we can rely on something called Hammond's Postulate

233
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,180
which tells us that a more stable intermediate and a rate limiting step leads to a faster reaction.

234
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,260
So plotting reaction coordinate diagrams for the three possible products of any electrophilic

235
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:08,740
substitution of chlorobenzene might look something like this. With the meta intermediate being similar

236
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,420
in energy to the substitution of benzene but the ortho and para intermediates being lower in energy

237
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,060
thus lowering the activation energies of the pathways for those two products.

238
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,260
So we have successfully demonstrated why the meta position of chlorobenzene is less reactive than

239
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,100
the ortho in the para positions. In fact, chlorine is part of a class of substituents which we call

240
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,580
ortho-paradirectors. However, we've not yet explained exactly why the para position is

241
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:45,380
substituted more than the ortho in this case. This requires that we look to our second consideration,

242
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,140
ring activation and deactivation.

243
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,100
See the second consideration here is that the already attached group may withdraw or

244
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,780
donate electron density to the ring. Reducing electron density within the ring makes it less

245
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,980
likely to attack. Since doing so would only increase the magnitude of the charge generated on the

246
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,060
intermediate. Conversely, donating additional electron density to the ring would be expected

247
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:18,340
to activate the ring and make it even more reactive. One of the traits which makes chlorine and

248
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,740
bromine so interesting in this reaction type is that they withdraw electrons from the ring

249
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,900
inductively. This means that the electronegativity of chlorine causes it to pull electrons out of

250
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:35,460
the ring through bonds like current through a wire. And unlike resonance which has the effect

251
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,500
of causing charges to jump every other atom, inductive effects attenuate with distance.

252
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,580
So this gives us an explanation for the strong preference for the para substitution over ortho.

253
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,940
The higher positive charge on the ortho atoms of chlorobenzene simply makes them less likely

254
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,220
to attack an electrophile and take on even more positive charge.

255
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,540
If we turn our attention to the synthesis of DDT one more time, we now understand how Zyla was able

256
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,300
to produce the specific isomer he wanted. The chlorine substituent on his starting material

257
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,420
directed the chloral substitution to the para position, ensuring that the proper structural

258
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:19,220
isomer was obtained. Not only that, but the newly attached chloral group quickly dehydrates under

259
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:27,620
acidic conditions to produce a new electrophile. This deactivates the already attached ring,

260
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,980
discouraging additional substitutions, while simultaneously encouraging a second chlorobenzene

261
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:41,380
to attack, leading to the product DDT. The final product of Zydler's synthesis can be

262
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,140
thought of as two disubstituted rings bearing deactivating substituents. So the desired product

263
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:54,500
forms in great abundance with very limited byproduct formation. So now that we understand

264
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,140
how substituents can affect the sites on which substituted benzenes are modified in electrophilic

265
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,740
aromatic substitutions, let's take a quick look at some common motifs and how they affect reactivity.

266
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,100
Activating ortho-para directors include groups such as the amine group of aniline,

267
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,500
the hydroxyl group of phenol, and the methoxy group of anisol.

268
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,100
Groups like these have the ability to donate electrons to the ring by resonance.

269
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,300
Deactivating ortho-para directors include halogens like fluorine, chlorine and bromine.

270
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,700
These groups direct by donating electrons in resonance, but deactivate because of the strong

271
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:45,140
dipole they create in the carbon halogen bond. Finally, we have deactivating metadirectors,

272
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:52,020
such as nitrates, carboxylic acids and aldehydes, which all draw electrons strongly by resonance.

273
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,740
Now notice that all of these groups contain a heteroatom two bonds away from the ring,

274
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,900
while all of our activators contain the heteroatom adjacent to the ring. That's not a coincidence.

275
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:09,620
Now the true utility and importance of directing effects on synthesis can be seen in this simple

276
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:16,660
illustration. The bromination of nitrobenzene produces mainly meta-bromonitrobenzene,

277
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:23,460
owing to the metadirecting nitro group. Yet the nitration of bromobenzene produces mainly

278
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,660
para-bromonitrobenzene, owing to the ortho-paradirecting bromogroup. So in this case, the order in

279
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,860
which I carry out my substitutions on the benzene has a direct effect on the product that I obtain.

280
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,700
Now let's consider the activating effects of substituents and how they can affect a synthetic

281
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,900
outcome as well. A one-to-one mixture of benzene and chlorine with a small amount of aluminum

282
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:55,540
chloride catalysts should produce a quantitative or complete conversion to chlorobenzene, owing

283
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,300
to the deactivating nature of the chloro groups. Since chlorobenzene itself is less reactive than

284
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,100
benzene, we don't expect much of the chlorinated product or rather we don't expect much of the

285
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,980
dichlorinated product to form. Yet a one-to-one mixture of benzene with ethyl chloride and

286
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:20,260
catalytic aluminum chloride produces a mixture of benzene, ethyl benzene, diethyl benzene isomers,

287
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:26,420
and even some triethylbenzene. Now the reason for this is that the alkyl groups are activating,

288
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,620
so as a small amount of ethyl benzene forms in the reaction mixture, its increased reactivity

289
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,820
means that its conversion to diethylbenzene will outpace alkylation of the remaining starting

290
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,580
material. In situations like this, we have to turn to some tricks to achieve a single alkylation.

291
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,700
For example, using a huge excess of benzene in order to dilute the electrophile to the point

292
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,220
at which two alkylations on a single molecule becomes very unlikely.

293
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,420
Today we have investigated the ability of electrophiles to substitute themselves for ring

294
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,020
hydrogens of benzene molecules. We've discussed how the resonance stabilization of the resulting

295
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,700
transition state makes it possible to entice a ring to give up its aromaticity, even if only for

296
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,540
an instant while the modification is occurring. We've looked at ways to generate electrophiles,

297
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,820
including acidification of substrates like nitric acid and chloral, as well as the use of a Lewis

298
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,860
acid catalyst like aluminum III chloride to activate halogens and alkyl halides.

299
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,220
And finally, we considered the effect of having a substituent already attached to the ring.

300
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,140
We saw how substituents like amine, hydroxyl, and methoxy groups, which donate electrons to the

301
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:49,300
ring, activate an ortho-paradirect. How substituents like aldehydes and nitrates,

302
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,540
which withdraw electrons from the ring by resonance, deactivate and metadirect.

303
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,300
And we also considered how the high electronegativity of halogens gives them the very unusual

304
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:07,300
property of deactivating while ortho-paradirecting. And of course, along the way, we considered how

305
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,820
all of these factors combined in a simple, highly efficient synthesis of a remarkably stable

306
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:19,060
molecule. A molecule with such powerful biological activity that it not only changed the world,

307
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,340
but ultimately the way that humans think about how we interact with the world.

308
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:29,700
Powerful chemistry indeed. Speaking of biological systems, in the next few lectures,

309
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,860
we're going to take our organic chemistry knowledge to the interface between chemistry

310
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:40,660
and biology. As we investigate the large, complex molecules of life, including carbohydrates,

311
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,820
nucleic acids, proteins, through the eyes of an organic chemist. I'll see you then.
