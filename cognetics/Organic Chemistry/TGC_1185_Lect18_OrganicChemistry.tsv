0	16560	Last time, we discussed Fritz Haber's quest to find a way to turn essentially unreactive
16560	19800	nitrogen from the air into ammonia.
19800	24760	But because our discussion was limited only to compounds of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen,
24760	29160	I stopped sort of explaining exactly what it was that Haber intended to do with this
29160	30160	ammonia.
30160	35560	You see, it wasn't simply ammonia that Haber was ultimately after.
35560	40160	He was trying to fuel a war machine, and a war machine needs artillery.
40160	46600	Now, you've probably heard of gun-cotton, nitroglycerin, dynamite, and TNT.
46600	50640	But what you may not have been aware of is that they all contain very similar organic
50640	56960	motifs, which combine both nitrogen and oxygen with organics to form compounds of extremely
56960	59160	high reactivity.
59160	64680	Today, we will take a look at these and other materials which contain both nitrogen and
64680	65680	oxygen.
65680	71560	Now, long before Haber's day, it was known that a material commonly called saltpeter,
71560	76480	known by chemists as potassium nitrate, was a naturally occurring mineral resource and
76480	81160	a crucial ingredient in the manufacture of gunpowder.
81160	85760	As early as the first century AD, the Chinese had discovered that saltpeter had medicinal
85760	90280	properties, and that it could be used to treat heart and circulatory ailments.
90280	93880	It was much later discovered that saltpeter decomposes in the body to form a substance
93880	99200	known as nitric oxide, which is the source of this therapeutic value.
99200	104520	Evidence from the 8th century AD indicates that by then, far eastern cultures had repurposed
104520	109880	saltpeter, using it in combination with sulfur and charcoal to create what is known today
109880	113760	as gunpowder.
113760	118400	Other civilizations independently made this discovery at different times in history,
118400	121680	and the exact year of its introduction to Europe is unclear.
121680	126960	But what is clear, however, is that by the 17th century, saltpeter was so valued for
126960	133520	this application that in England there existed a government post known as saltpeter.
133520	138440	Those charged with this post were given carte blanche authority to dig anywhere in the kingdom,
138440	143000	even through the floors of homes in search of this commodity.
143000	148200	All they needed was a shovel and a hunch.
148200	152160	By the 20th century, the ridiculous degree of authority given to these pedermen had long
152160	157160	faded in England, but usable nitrogen was still being dug up elsewhere by ambitious
157160	160880	European and American entrepreneurs.
160880	165440	Saltpeter from as far away as the Atacama Desert of South America was being mined and
165440	170880	shipped back to Europe and the Americas as a source of fixed nitrogen.
170880	177000	But in the early 1900s, Haber's process made ammonia abundant, low-cost, and best of all
177000	182920	prepared on-site in a factory from readily available materials and catalysts.
182920	187280	All that needed to be done was to convert the ammonia into its oxidized form, like that
187280	188840	found in saltpeter.
188840	192560	All we had to do to do this was burn it in oxygen.
192560	197480	So the nitrogen oxides produced from this can be hydrated to form nitric acid, the crucial
197480	203520	ingredient in the formation of many modern explosives.
203520	208400	So today we'll discuss a few functional groups which contain both nitrogen and oxygen.
208400	211440	We'll see how different combinations of these elements lead to some of the most reactive
211440	216360	substances known to man, and also to some of the motifs essential to the function of
216360	218360	life as we know it.
218360	228600	So let's get started.
228600	232840	So Haber's contribution was the starting material for the synthesis of, among other
232840	235640	things, nitric acid.
235640	238840	This is accomplished with relative ease.
238840	243640	Oxidation of the ammonia to nitrogen oxides like NO2 is carried out, and after this, bubbling
243640	249120	the nitric oxide gases through water produces nitric acid.
249120	253720	The importance of nitric acid in the field of explosives was realized much earlier than
253720	255760	Haber's time.
255760	262080	One day in 1846, according to legend, German Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schoenbein
262080	266840	spilled a bit of nitric acid on a table where he was working.
266840	272800	After wiping up the spill with a cotton apron, he hung the apron on a stove door to dry.
272800	277980	After drying, the apron suddenly and vigorously burst into flames.
277980	282560	One can only imagine what went through Schoenbein's head at that exact moment.
282560	286600	But after extinguishing the fire and carefully considering what had happened, Schoenbein
286600	292160	realized that it was the combination of nitric acid and the carbohydrate fibers in his apron
292160	297600	which had led to the formation of the explosive material.
297600	301640	We'll closely look at the structure of carbohydrates in a few lectures, but for now I want you
301640	303680	to focus on this.
303680	310040	These very interesting functional groups decorating this long polymer, it's the colorful nitrogen
310040	311520	and oxygen containing groups there.
311520	314880	They're quite different than anything we've seen so far, aren't they?
314880	320040	Now, these functional groups are called nitrate esters, and they aren't present in the naturally
320040	322800	occurring plant fibers.
322800	327280	You may notice that the arrangement of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the nitrate ester groups
327400	333520	makes it impossible to draw a resonance contributor in which all atoms have zero charge.
333520	336880	This makes these groups very unstable.
336880	341160	Add the fact that all the oxygen needed for combustion is already present in the nitrate
341160	348160	ester group, and you have one very explosive substance.
348160	355160	Now, this is a very exciting time for me in the course.
355160	361160	We've already discussed the accomplishments and stories of about a half-dozen Nobel laureates,
361160	364160	and before we're done, we're going to meet many more.
364160	369160	In this lecture, however, the nitrate ester gives me the perfect segue into the story
369160	374160	of the man who founded the prize himself, Alfred Nobel.
374160	380160	You see, Nobel's story is one of a very explosive compound called nitroglycerin.
380160	385160	It can be made from glycerin, which is easily obtained from the soap-making process.
385160	392160	Now, it was originally synthesized by a man named Ascanio Sobrero, and Sobrero realized
392160	398160	that he could take glycerin and react it with nitric acid, three equivalents to be exact,
398160	404160	and that when he did this, the OH groups of the glycerin would be replaced by a new functional group,
404160	406160	these nitrate esters.
406160	412160	So our nitrates come in, displacing water, and creating nitroglycerin.
412160	416160	Now, Sobrero realized immediately how dangerous nitroglycerin could be,
416160	420160	and in fact, even after he created it and had published about it,
420160	425160	he continued to lobby against its use in mining and war applications.
425160	429160	And Sobrero's unwillingness to advance this particular compound in those applications
429160	435160	left an opening for another very opportunistic individual, Alfred Nobel.
435160	441160	Nobel was a contemporary of Sobrero who took up the mantle of finding a way to stabilize nitroglycerin enough
441160	445160	to use it as an explosive for those applications.
445160	450160	He discovered that by adding a little bit of sawdust that he could stabilize the nitroglycerin long enough
450160	454160	and well enough to form it into sticks, he could then develop blasting caps
454160	458160	and other methods of detonating these sticks of dynamite.
458160	462160	And of course, this made him a great deal of money.
462160	467160	See, Nobel realized the addition of that adsorbent like sawdust had a stabilizing effect,
467160	470160	and the adsorbent nitroglycerin could be wrapped in paper,
470160	475160	formed into sticks, and triggered with some of Nobel's other inventions.
475160	480160	So his invention made the packaging and transport of this high explosive simple and safer,
480160	485160	leading to its rapid adoption worldwide in mining and military applications.
485160	491160	So the invention of dynamite seemed to be Nobel's inevitable legacy.
491160	494160	Having secured the U.S. patent for his dynamite invention,
494160	498160	Nobel had become extremely wealthy as a result of this product.
498160	502160	And in 1895, Nobel officially changed the name of the company
502160	507160	and in 1895, Nobel officially changed his will for the last time,
507160	512160	designating nearly all of his massive estate to establish a prize
512160	516160	to be conferred upon those who, as Nobel himself put it,
516160	522160	during the preceding year shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.
522160	528160	Nobel's endowment hasn't only survived but thrived for over the past century.
528160	532160	This come to represent the pinnacle of human achievement in not only the sciences,
532160	536160	but in medicine, literature, and economics as well.
544160	548160	A somewhat more stable functional group containing both nitrogen and oxygen
548160	551160	is the nitrate functional group.
551160	556160	Compounds containing this group are collectively referred to as nitro compounds.
556160	561160	Probably the most famous nitro compound is TNT, or Trinitrotoluene.
561160	564160	And we will take a look at this and how its compounds like it
564160	568160	are made in our electrophilic aromatic substitution lecture.
568160	572160	But for today, we'll concern ourselves with some simpler aliphatic nitrates
572160	575160	and how they react.
575160	578160	Most commercially relevant nitro compounds are synthesized
578160	584160	by reacting small hydrocarbons with nitric acid at very high temperatures.
584160	587160	This reaction is complex, proceeding through radicals
587160	590160	and usually producing mixtures of nitrated compounds.
590160	597160	But these compounds are of such great value that we frequently overlook this inefficiency.
597160	601160	One particularly useful application of the nitro group in synthesis
601160	605160	is that it can be used as a sort of non-nucleophilic placeholder
605160	608160	for the nucleophilic amine functional group.
608160	612160	This can significantly uncomplicate a synthesis.
612160	616160	Now, at the end of a synthesis, the nitro group can be converted into an amine
616160	619160	simply using familiar hydrogen and metal catalyst chemistry
619160	624160	that was developed by Sabatier.
624160	630160	A classic example of this technique is in the synthesis of Novocaine.
630160	632160	So let's start with the molecule Novocaine
632160	634160	and apply a retro-synthetic analysis to it
634160	639160	and see if we can design a technique for synthesizing it.
639160	644160	Now, I can make Novocaine using a compound called aminobenzoyl chloride
644160	647160	and the appropriate nucleophile.
647160	650160	Now, the aminobenzoyl chloride I've shown here
650160	653160	can be prepared from a compound called aminobenzoyl acid
653160	655160	which is readily available commercially
655160	658160	and is probably on the shelf in the laboratory right now.
658160	661160	So my retro-synthetic analysis looks pretty good so far,
661160	664160	but let's run our analysis forward
664160	667160	and see if it really gives us what we think we're going to get.
667160	670160	The first step of my proposed synthesis involves the nucleophilic attack
670160	675160	of the OH from aminobenzoyl acid on vinyl chloride.
675160	678160	This reaction should lead to my intermediate
678160	683160	which I can then expose to another nucleophile to diethyl-aminoethanol
683160	686160	which will give me my product, right?
686160	688160	Well, not quite.
688160	690160	There's an unfortunate caveat here
690160	692160	and that is that the amine that I'm hoping will tag along
692160	695160	is actually potentially reactive as well.
695160	697160	Remember, NH2 can be a nucleophile.
697160	699160	It has a lone pair of electrons.
699160	703160	So this step of my synthetic analysis was faulty.
703160	708160	But I have the tool I need to get around this problem now.
708160	712160	I can take my proposed synthesis and modify it in one very simple way.
712160	715160	Instead of using the NH2 or amine group,
715160	718160	I'm going to use an O2 or nitrate
718160	721160	which is completely non-nucleophilic.
721160	724160	So having replaced those with my nitrates,
724160	728160	I can now rest assured that that promiscuous reaction will not occur.
728160	730160	And at the end of my synthesis,
730160	734160	I can simply use rainy nickel to conduct a reduction
734160	739160	thereby changing that nitrate into the amine group I originally wanted.
739160	742160	So it's acted as a placeholder through the entire synthesis
742160	744160	at the end of which I finally make my modification,
744160	746160	giving me the desired product.
746160	750160	So this would be a successful synthesis of Novocaine.
755160	761160	Now, so far today we've looked at nitrate esters and nitrates,
761160	764160	both of which contain nitrogen-oxygen bonds,
764160	769160	and not so coincidentally both of which can be used to make high explosives.
769160	772160	But there are other organics which contain both of these elements joined,
772160	776160	not directly to one another, but through one or more carbons.
776160	780160	And when we make this very subtle structural change,
780160	783160	we find ourselves making molecules which have a very different
783160	785160	but equally versatile chemistry
785160	789160	and can be used safely and reliably in organic synthesis.
789160	792160	When a carboxylic acid motif is connected to an amine group
792160	795160	via at least one intervening carbon,
795160	799160	we call the resulting molecule an amino acid.
799160	803160	Amino acids will be the star of the show in our lecture on proteins,
803160	806160	where we will consider their biological role.
806160	808160	But since they meet the criterion for this lecture as well,
808160	810160	having both oxygen and nitrogen,
810160	813160	I thought we would give them a little bit of attention here.
816160	821160	Amino acids combine an acidic carboxylic acid group with a basic amine group.
821160	825160	And so they're often found in a state in which the acid is deprotonated,
825160	827160	but the amine is protonated.
827160	829160	We call species like this,
829160	832160	ones with a positive and negative charge in separate regions,
832160	834160	zwitter ions.
835160	838160	The most famous group of amino acids are, of course,
838160	842160	the 20 amino acids used by your body and all other living systems
842160	846160	to produce proteins and enzymes which moderate our biochemistry.
847160	850160	Notice that all of them share a common amino acid motif,
850160	854160	one in which the two groups are separated by one carbon,
854160	857160	and we call these alpha-amino acids.
859160	864160	But amino acids can have more than one carbon separating their acid-base groups.
864160	868160	Two carbons in between produces a beta-amino acid,
868160	872160	and three carbons leads to a gamma-amino acid,
872160	876160	the simplest of which is gamma-amino-butyric acid.
877160	879160	Now, this is a powerful neurotransmitter
879160	882160	and an integral part of your central nervous system.
882160	888160	Gamma-amino-butyric acid often abbreviated GABA plays a role in neurotransmission
888160	891160	by activating a very large protein complex
891160	895160	which allows chloride ions to cross neuronal cell walls.
897160	899160	So when GABA binds to this protein complex,
899160	903160	it allows the flow of chloride ions which reduces the chance of neurons firing,
903160	906160	and so it has a sedative effect.
908160	911160	This natural biological effect is also part of the mechanism of action
911160	913160	of a number of sedatives and hallucinogens,
913160	917160	like the muskimol found in certain types of wild mushrooms.
918160	921160	See, muskimol imitates GABA in the brain,
921160	927160	over-activating the GABA receptor proteins, causing an exaggerated state of sedation.
927160	931160	So in this case, the extract of your mushroom is acting just like the neurotransmitter
931160	933160	that you naturally produce.
941160	945160	Yet another pervasive motif in organic chemistry containing oxygen and nitrogen
945160	947160	is the amide functional group.
947160	952160	And you may think of an amide as a carboxylic acid or ester with an sp3 nitrogen
952160	954160	rather than an sp3 oxygen.
954160	957160	The lower electronegativity of the amide nitrogen
957160	960160	means that they're significantly less acidic than organic acids,
960160	966160	having a pKa somewhere around 25 compared to 5 for a typical organic acid.
968160	971160	Primary amides have an NH2 group
971160	975160	and can be synthesized from carboxylic acids by reaction with ammonia gas.
975160	980160	In this case, a favorable proton transfer forms carboxylate and ammonium,
980160	985160	which are heated to drive off water as a byproduct of the amide bond formation.
985160	989160	It's this condensation reaction which forms our primary amide.
992160	995160	Primary amides are named using the R group prefix,
995160	998160	followed by an amide suffix.
998160	1002160	For example, this two-carbon primary amide is called ethanamine.
1004160	1007160	Just as carboxylic acids are similar to esters,
1007160	1011160	varying only by replacement of the acidic hydrogen with an R group.
1011160	1016160	So primary amides can be changed into secondary and tertiary amides,
1016160	1020160	in which one or both hydrogens are substituted with an R group as well.
1022160	1024160	When there are R groups present,
1024160	1028160	we name them as substituents of the parent primary amide.
1028160	1033160	For example, this is N-methylethanamine,
1033160	1037160	and this is NN-dimethylethanamine.
1038160	1041160	You may see these names shortened by dropping the N designation
1041160	1045160	and simply calling them methylethanamide and dimethylethanamide.
1047160	1050160	Amides are a very interesting motif in and of themselves,
1050160	1053160	as we'll see when we cover proteins and peptides in a few lectures.
1053160	1056160	But for now, let's take a look at a few reactions
1056160	1060160	in which amides can be converted into some other familiar functional groups.
1067160	1070160	In addition to being a biologically relevant structural motif,
1070160	1075160	amides give us a useful alternative to the direct amination route to create amines.
1076160	1079160	You'll recall that amines can be synthesized easily
1079160	1083160	in the R groups of alkyl chloride substrate, our primary or secondary.
1083160	1086160	But an SN2 reaction is essentially impossible
1086160	1090160	when the alkyl halide substrate is tertiary.
1090160	1094160	So we're left wondering how we might create something like t-butylamine,
1094160	1098160	in which the amine nitrogen is attached to a tertiary carbon.
1099160	1104160	If we were to try to do a direct amination of t-butyl bromide or t-butyl chloride,
1104160	1108160	we expect a preponderance of the elimination product to form
1108160	1110160	if anything forms at all.
1112160	1115160	One solution to this problem is the Hoffman rearrangement
1115160	1119160	named for German chemist August Wilhelm von Hoffman.
1120160	1125160	Now Hoffman discovered that primary amides could be converted into amines
1125160	1128160	by reaction with a molecular halogen like chlorine or bromine
1128160	1132160	and an aqueous base like sodium hydroxide solution.
1133160	1137160	This reaction works even if the adjacent carbon is tertiary.
1138160	1142160	So let's go through this reaction using t-butyl amide, molecular bromine,
1142160	1145160	and aqueous sodium hydroxide.
1145160	1149160	Under these conditions, just a small amount of the amide is deprotonated,
1149160	1154160	forming a nucleophilic species which attacks the bromine molecule.
1154160	1157160	So you can already see the important difference here.
1157160	1160160	The R groups are already attached to the nucleophile,
1160160	1164160	not the substrate, in the initiating event of the reaction.
1165160	1171160	This process forms an N-bromo amide, which is deprotonated a second time.
1171160	1173160	Now this is where the magic happens.
1173160	1178160	The bromide group is displaced from the amide nitrogen in an alkyl shift.
1178160	1183160	This effectively reverses the carbon and nitrogen ordering in the chain,
1183160	1186160	creating what we call an isocyanate.
1188160	1192160	Hydroxide ion then catalyzes the conversion of isocyanate
1192160	1195160	to a motif known as a carbamic acid.
1196160	1201160	Carbamic acid is essentially just a carboxylic acid bonded directly to a nitrogen rather than a carbon.
1202160	1207160	And carbamic acids have a strong tendency to decarboxylate under basic conditions,
1207160	1209160	leading to an amine.
1209160	1216160	So we've used the Hoffman rearrangement starting with t-butyl amide to produce t-butyl amine.
1223160	1228160	Perhaps the most interesting chemistry involving amides is they're used to link together dimers
1228160	1232160	and short oligomers, meaning a short chain of a few subunits,
1232160	1237160	of amino acids to form some consumer goods with which you might be very familiar.
1237160	1239160	Let's look at one right now.
1239160	1243160	This is a molecule of the artificial sweetener aspartame.
1243160	1249160	Aspartame consists of essentially three subunits linked by hydrolyzable bonds.
1250160	1254160	One of them is an amide bond indicated here.
1254160	1258160	The other linkage is actually an ester bond formed here.
1259160	1265160	So if we take a look at the aspartame molecule as a whole and then break it down into these three subunits,
1265160	1269160	we see that we have essentially what is a condensed methanol,
1269160	1272160	a condensed amino acid phenylalanine,
1272160	1276160	and aspartic acid, another amino acid.
1277160	1281160	So what this means is that when you ingest or consume aspartame,
1281160	1284160	this is the molecule that gives you the sweet taste.
1284160	1289160	But what happens to it once it's past your lips and tongue and into your digestive system?
1289160	1293160	Well, when it reaches your digestive system, and particularly your bloodstream,
1293160	1300160	it's exposed to a great deal of water and enzymes from your liver which break it down.
1300160	1303160	Your body recognizes that this molecule isn't natural,
1303160	1306160	that it's a foreign compound that needs to be removed.
1306160	1311160	And it does this using water to hydrolyze the two connective bonds.
1311160	1314160	When it does this, we get three different species.
1314160	1319160	An aspartic acid, a phenylalanine, and a methanol.
1322160	1325160	Now there's always some discussion about that methanol
1325160	1327160	because there's always a few folks who wonder,
1327160	1330160	does that methanol constitute a danger to my health?
1330160	1333160	After all, if I eat our drink aspartame,
1333160	1336160	and it hydrolyzes and becomes, at least in part, methanol,
1336160	1341160	am I not leaving myself open to potentially developing blindness?
1341160	1344160	Well, the answer lies in quantity.
1344160	1348160	So let's look at an aspartame molecule one more time.
1348160	1352160	Aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than sugar.
1352160	1356160	Now that means that in order to make a soda, that's a diet soda,
1356160	1359160	as sweet as its non-diet alternative,
1359160	1362160	we've got to use only about 200 milligrams of aspartame.
1362160	1366160	That's enough to make your soda as sweet as 40 grams of sugar.
1366160	1369160	That's about 10 teaspoons.
1369160	1374160	So let's take some water and hydrolyze 200 milligrams of aspartame
1374160	1376160	and see if the content of your diet soda
1376160	1379160	is enough to generate a worrisome amount of methanol.
1379160	1384160	All right, our hydrolysis reaction takes place.
1384160	1386160	And when we run our calculation,
1386160	1388160	what we find is that 200 milligrams of aspartame
1388160	1392160	is only enough to make about 90 milligrams of aspartic acid,
1392160	1395160	112 milligrams of phenylalanine,
1395160	1398160	and 22 milligrams of methanol.
1398160	1401160	Now if you're one of just a few percent of the population
1401160	1405160	who has a condition which allows you or doesn't allow you
1405160	1409160	to metabolize phenylalanine properly, you may have an issue.
1409160	1412160	We call this condition phenylketonuria.
1412160	1415160	But if you're like everyone else and can actually metabolize this,
1415160	1418160	then your only real health concern is the methanol,
1418160	1421160	and you get 22 milligrams per soda.
1421160	1424160	So to put that much methanol into perspective,
1424160	1427160	let's take a look at some other stuff that we might put into our bodies.
1427160	1431160	It turns out that your diet soda actually has less methanol,
1431160	1434160	or produces less methanol in your bloodstream,
1434160	1437160	than grape juice, wine, or tomato juice.
1437160	1440160	Depending on storage conditions, it can be considerably more.
1440160	1443160	And yet, those of us who love to eat tomatoes
1443160	1445160	don't seem to have any problems with our vision.
1445160	1450160	So the diet soda being bad for your vision is actually a myth.
1450160	1453160	It simply doesn't produce enough methanol to be toxic.
1457160	1459160	So let's review today's lecture.
1459160	1462160	Today we took a look at some slightly more complex functional groups,
1462160	1465160	involving both nitrogen and oxygen.
1465160	1469160	We started with nitrate esters, a very unstable functional group
1469160	1473160	which can be produced by reacting nitric acid with alcohols.
1473160	1477160	We saw how materials from cotton fibers to glycerin,
1477160	1479160	collected during soap making,
1479160	1484160	can be turned into highly flammable and even explosive material by this reaction.
1486160	1488160	We also explored nitro compounds,
1488160	1490160	most notably trinitrotoluene,
1490160	1493160	which is another widely used explosive material.
1493160	1496160	But nitro groups themselves are not nearly as unstable
1496160	1498160	as their nitroester counterparts,
1498160	1502160	and so many stable examples of these compounds can be prepared
1502160	1507160	and reduced to amines using hydrogen gas and metal catalysts.
1507160	1509160	We took a quick look at amino acids,
1509160	1513160	in which amine and carboxyl functionalities are on the same molecule
1513160	1515160	but are isolated from one another,
1515160	1519160	producing molecules which can undergo an intramolecular proton transfer
1519160	1522160	to form what's known as a zwitterion.
1522160	1525160	We saw how the amide functional group can be prepared
1525160	1528160	by heating a carboxylic acid in the presence of ammonia,
1528160	1532160	driving off water to push the reaction forward.
1532160	1534160	Starting from this structural motif,
1534160	1540160	Hoffman was able to devise a strategy to form primary amines with substantial branching,
1540160	1545160	a feat which cannot be accomplished by the direct amination of alkyl halides.
1546160	1550160	Finally, we saw how amino acids can be joined together through an amide bond,
1550160	1554160	like that in the popular artificial sweetener aspartame,
1554160	1558160	and how the acid hydrolysis of this amide bond can spell trouble
1558160	1563160	for phenyl ketoneurics who can't properly metabolize and remove the resulting phenylalanine,
1563160	1568160	but is highly unlikely to cause vision problems in the general population.
1570160	1575160	We've reached the end of our five lecture series on functional groups containing nitrogen and oxygen,
1575160	1579160	but our study of molecular structure isn't yet over.
1579160	1584160	Over the next three lectures, we're going to bring back an old friend, alkenes.
1584160	1588160	But this time, we'll be considering what happens when entire systems of double bonds
1588160	1592160	are linked together to form some very special molecules.
1592160	1594160	I'll see you then.
