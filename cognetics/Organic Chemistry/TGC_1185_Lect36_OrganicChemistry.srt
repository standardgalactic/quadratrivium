00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,880
Welcome to our closing lecture on organic chemistry.

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,320
The final lecture of this course is bittersweet for me, but it's also exciting for me to

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,300
think about how much you've learned and that you are now ready to take that knowledge

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,160
with you out into the world.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,600
We spent 35 lectures exploring the definition of organic chemistry, the theories upon which

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,120
it is built, and many examples of how organic chemistry as a science has touched our lives

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,440
and steered our history as a species.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,240
It's unlikely that Lavassier and Buller ever dreamed that simply by challenging historical

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,320
ideas that they would help to start 300 years of experimentation, which would ultimately

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,120
lead us to where we are today, at the precipice of understanding the origins of our own existence.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,800
The scientists who follow them carry that understanding forward in ways which have improved

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,380
the lives of billions of people on the planet today, and countless more who will come after

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,880
them.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,120
So now that we understand and appreciate the contribution of these past researchers,

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,200
I think we've earned the right to have a little bit of fun.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,240
Let's turn our attention forward and dream about the future that will be created by

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,900
the scientists who stand on the shoulders of these giants, who helped us understand the

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,940
chemistry carbon-based compounds.

19
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,660
One of the most exciting frontiers in modern organic chemistry is its interface with other

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,900
scientific disciplines like biology, engineering, and earth sciences.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,020
So why not start there and ask the question, how might this interface help us create a

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,660
better world for ourselves in the coming decades?

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:01,500
If you'll pardon a pun, our understanding of the origins of life continue to evolve.

24
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,060
Even as the scientific community begins to get a handle on just how complex biological

25
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,940
systems can be, like those driving DNA translation or protein structure and function, we still

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,380
struggle with the simplest question of all, how did it all get started?

27
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,060
Even now, evidence of exactly how the first carbon-containing compounds blinked into existence

28
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,740
on earth is scarce.

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,820
Stanley Miller gave us some insight into how certain biological materials might form

30
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,980
under the conditions of the primitive earth's atmosphere some three billion years ago.

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,620
But there are those who believe that these molecules didn't form on earth at all.

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,700
There are those who think that life may have literally fallen to earth from outer space.

33
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,860
In 1969, a huge fireball rocketed across the Australian sky before separating into several

34
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,300
pieces and finally crashing to earth near the town of Merchison, Victoria.

35
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,900
This meteorite strike is unusual in three important ways.

36
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,940
First, it was witnessed so there's no debating its extraterrestrial origins.

37
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,360
Second, it was rather large, delivering more than 100 kilograms of material to the surface

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,900
of the earth.

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,980
And finally, the most fascinating characteristic of this meteorite is that it appears to have

40
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,100
carried with it a buffet of organic compounds which is hard to believe.

41
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,840
As spectroscopic techniques continue to advance, the Merchison meteorite has been analyzed from

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,860
time to time, always with new and interesting results.

43
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,020
In 2010, for example, a group of researchers attempted to extract organic compounds from

44
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,420
freshly broken samples of the Merchison.

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,940
Now careful chromatographic separation of the extracts, analyzed by mass spectrometry

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,900
and NMR spectroscopy techniques, revealed that the meteorite contained not just a few,

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,580
but thousands or even tens of thousands of different small organic molecules all encased

48
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,420
within it.

49
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,840
Of course, the implication here is that just like the meteorite, which is unquestionably

50
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,800
an authentic space rock, those molecules which were trapped within its matrix must have fallen

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,360
from space.

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,280
So this brings up new questions.

53
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:31,920
If the Merchison results are accurate, just how did these compounds get there?

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,000
Even more tantalizing evidence of extraterrestrial organics has been collected in recent decades

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,840
as organizations like NASA launch sophisticated probes in telescopes like the Spitzer Space

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Telescope.

57
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,000
The Spitzer operated in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, and it looked

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,520
at interstellar space through infrared eyes, sensing absorptions caused by organic molecular

59
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,400
vibrations occurring tens or even hundreds of thousands of light years away or more.

60
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,560
Perhaps not surprisingly, in light of the Merchison meteorite results, Spitzer indeed

61
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,960
found not only evidence of carbon, but specifically of sp3 hybridized carbon.

62
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,160
A clear absorbance at 2900 wave numbers was reported when the telescope was pointed at

63
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,640
interstellar space.

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,920
That's an absorption corresponding to the CH bond vibrations one would find in a typical

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,080
organic compound.

66
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,800
The implication?

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,160
That organic carbon does indeed exist in abundance in regions of space which harbor little else.

68
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,480
It would seem that even the void of deep space may harbor the seeds of life.

69
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,440
So the more we search, the more we seem to find evidence that organics can spontaneously

70
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,480
form, not only on Earth, but elsewhere in the universe, potentially seeding the cosmos

71
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,920
with life.

72
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,600
Yet another curiosity which scientists are still trying to address is this.

73
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,000
All life on Earth that we know of uses L, or left-handed, amino acids as the principal

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,620
constituent of the proteins of life.

75
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,360
That means that even though we may think of ourselves as being achiral at the macroscopic

76
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:28,280
level, we are in fact not symmetrical when we look at ourselves through molecular eyes.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,600
For example, the amino acids and proteins making up the skin and muscle in your arms

78
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
are all of one-handedness.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,720
So if you could look at your right index finger and your left index finger with atomic resolution,

80
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,400
they would in fact not be reflections of one another.

81
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,280
So at the molecular level, you are chiral.

82
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,040
Yet every reliable source of data on abiologically synthesized organics, from those formed in

83
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,200
Miller's primitive Earth experiment, to the interstellar stowaways on the Merchison

84
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:09,880
meteorite, suggests that racemic mixtures of these compounds are created in natural processes.

85
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,960
This leads us to two important questions.

86
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,360
First, why L amino acids?

87
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,280
The molecular machinery which our bodies use to create proteins and enzymes we need to

88
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,680
live are chiral themselves, so it makes sense that we should use all of one-handed amino

89
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,240
acid or the other.

90
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,840
So clearly, nature had to make a choice early on.

91
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,360
Left-handed biochemistry or right-handed biochemistry?

92
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,200
But is there any real difference between our biochemical world and its mirror image?

93
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,120
Is there some quantum mechanical effect that we don't understand perfectly which dictated

94
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
that choice?

95
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Or was it a cosmic coin toss that led us to be composed of L amino acids instead of D?

96
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,520
This question was effectively answered in the early 1990s, when the labs of Stephen Kent

97
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,320
at Scripps Research Institute created a right-handed version of a naturally occurring left-handed

98
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,240
protein, HIV protease.

99
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,560
Kent used modified techniques pioneered by Bruce Merrifield to create a perfect mirror

100
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,620
image of that protein.

101
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,440
He then tested it for activity against mirror images of its normal substrates, finding that

102
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,720
the chemical activity of his right-handed protein was identical in every way to the left-handed

103
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,080
version.

104
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,040
This closed the book on the question of handedness in the chemistry of life.

105
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,600
Racemic sources of material which led to our left-handed biochemistry should be equally

106
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,200
capable of seeding right-handed biochemistry.

107
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,600
So if we ever do make contact with extraterrestrial carbon-based life forms, it would appear

108
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,400
that there's a 50% chance that their biochemistry will be not exactly the same as our own, but

109
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,520
rather a perfect reflection of our own.

110
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,340
But Kent's research opened up a whole new vein of inquiry.

111
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,600
Now that we know that D amino acids can be used to create enzymes with every bit as much

112
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,920
power to promote highly specialized chemistry, researchers are trying to develop new therapeutics

113
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,760
made from those D amino acids.

114
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,160
It may be that someday these mirror images, which previously had no use in biology, or

115
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,920
little use in biology, will find use in the hands of humans who can not only rationally

116
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,440
design them, but produce them in laboratories for use as medicines, chiral catalysts and

117
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,800
more.

118
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,960
When humans sought to take to the air and fly, birds and their wings were an obvious

119
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,080
inspiration for the design of early aircraft.

120
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,160
In fact, evidence of working bird-shaped gliders may date as far back as ancient Egypt.

121
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,040
Now, scientists call this kind of design strategy one of observing the properties of natural

122
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,640
systems and applying them to engineering, bio-mimicry.

123
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,600
And we've been doing this for a very, very long time.

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,040
And just as the designs of some planes, trains and boats have been inspired by nature, as

125
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,040
we learn more and more about the biomolecular world, scientists, more and more, turn to

126
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,320
the biological for inspiration in their designs of useful compounds.

127
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,880
This may one day help us to accomplish similar chemistry to the molecules of life, but with

128
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,800
smaller compounds which are more easily obtained and whose properties are more easily adjusted

129
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,240
and tuned than their larger biological counterparts.

130
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,040
We call this practice of imitating the function of biological molecules, biomimetic chemistry.

131
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,720
And it may provide the springboard that we need to create small molecules with the exact

132
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
chemical properties that we need to accomplish a number of tasks.

133
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,360
Take the example of oxygen transport and storage.

134
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,560
Our bodies and those of many other animals rely on hemoglobin to bind, transport and

135
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,040
release oxygen within our bodies so that our cells have the oxidizer that they need to

136
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,040
carry out cellular respiration and give us life-sustaining chemical energy.

137
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Hemoglobin consists of four proteins bound together in a quaternary structure which supports

138
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,400
four organometallic heme molecules.

139
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,840
It's here at the iron atom within the heme that oxygen binds when it is present in great

140
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,920
abundance, like in the air that enters our lungs.

141
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,800
Now that oxygen is then released in environments which are lower in oxygen concentration like

142
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,400
the tissues of our body where it's most needed.

143
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,040
The elegant balance of binding and releasing oxygen is mediated by the protein itself which

144
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,120
affects solubility and tunes the chemistry of the heme so that it grabs oxygen with striking

145
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,880
efficiency in the lungs, then transports it through the blood and releases it at just

146
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,280
the right time as well.

147
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,960
So proteins in a way are nature's organic chemists, tinkering with the properties of

148
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,240
small molecules and asserting an influence over how they behave.

149
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Well, that sounds a lot like something that humans are learning to do for themselves,

150
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,400
doesn't it?

151
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,440
So can we abandon the large protein and substitute the knowledge that we've gained over the

152
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,800
past two centuries to create other molecules which can imitate the properties of hemoglobin?

153
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,360
Researchers at the University of Leeds think so.

154
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,720
They successfully synthesized what they called porphyrin-chord hyperbranched polymers which

155
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,880
have oxygen binding properties, very similar to hemoglobin, but can be easily created in

156
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,600
a laboratory.

157
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,240
Looking at the structure of a porphyrin-chord hyperbranched polymer, it's easy to see where

158
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,560
the inspiration came from for this compound.

159
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,280
It's also easy to see how someday compounds like this one might offer a non-biological

160
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,080
oxygen carrier for use in medical applications like surgery.

161
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,320
An artificial blood like this would all but eliminate concerns over disease transmission

162
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,120
or incompatible antibodies associated with human blood transfusions.

163
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,680
With available polymer arms which could be modified to achieve almost any solubility,

164
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,080
oxygen binding affinity, or other property that we need, we might even see compounds

165
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,920
like this in use one day, colonizing new planets.

166
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,240
The tenuous Martian atmosphere, for example, has a very small amount of oxygen in it naturally.

167
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,760
Now, solutions of biomimetic oxygen carriers might someday be used to extract that small

168
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,600
amount of oxygen from outside of a structure, pumping it back inside the building where

169
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:57,120
it's released, essentially creating a building which breathes so that its occupants can too.

170
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,280
But our ability to imitate life goes far beyond creating small mimetic molecules.

171
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,240
Remember that Ken was able to construct not only working copies of HIV protease from L-amino

172
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,680
acids but from D-amino acids as well.

173
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,280
This shows that even large biomolecules can be created abiologically and then used to

174
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,160
enhance or even create biological systems.

175
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,960
Yet another exciting advancement was made by scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute

176
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,240
in 2010.

177
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,440
This is when they reported that they had chemically synthesized a genome of over one million base

178
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:43,280
pairs, then substituted that DNA for the native DNA in a bacteria.

179
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,800
In this proof-of-concept experiment, the researchers made just a few small changes between the natural

180
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,120
DNA of the bacteria and their synthetic form, targeting regions of the genome which were

181
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,440
known to act as structural supports rather than those coding for specific proteins.

182
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,280
Now, such a simple change was enough that it could be detected in the cells which had

183
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,400
accepted the transplant without compromising the viability of those cells.

184
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,680
So the genetic deck was stacked in favor of success in this experiment.

185
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,640
Still, this achievement will no doubt take us to the next level of biomolecular engineering,

186
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,640
as it demonstrates clearly and effectively that the molecular machinery of life is modular

187
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,200
and can be transplanted from one cell to another.

188
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,040
This experiment shows it with enough understanding and cautious, dedicated effort, genetic material

189
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,960
and the cellular machinery which uses it can be mixed, matched and altered to produce

190
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,000
any biochemistry that we desire.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,040
Someday we may even create entire cells from nothing more than chemicals on a lab bench

192
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,280
using organic reactions which are available to us today.

193
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,520
Just imagine what these cells might be designed to accomplish.

194
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,840
We could literally synthesize self-replicating microscopic production plants for fixed nitrogen

195
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,800
with nitrogenase activity many-fold more powerful than rhizobia.

196
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,440
We could create super red blood cells to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood used

197
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
in transfusions.

198
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,400
Imagine vast pools of photosynthetic bacteria of our own design, harvesting light and converting

199
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,680
it into biomass or even energy faster and better than any living thing ever has.

200
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,560
All to the benefit of mankind.

201
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,600
The possibilities are truly limitless and the inspiration for it all harkens back to

202
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,720
that day in 1828 when Voler accidentally created urea on his lab bench and realized that mastering

203
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,760
the chemistry of carbon didn't require any mystical vital force but careful study and

204
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,640
application of the scientific method.

205
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,920
I'd also like to challenge you with one of humanity's major environmental concerns.

206
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,260
We spend a lot of time looking at how chemists build upon carbon scaffolds to make organic

207
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,480
compounds with new structures and properties.

208
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,440
And we saw how some of the major entry points for carbon into organic chemistry include

209
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,280
the hydrocarbons isolated from fossil fuels which can be halogenated to make reactive

210
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,760
substrates for substitution and elimination reactions.

211
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,640
We discussed how biological systems can also bring carbon into the organic world.

212
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Science convert carbon dioxide into biomass which makes its way through the food chain

213
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,120
where it's used by organisms to produce all of the necessary chemicals to exist, some

214
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,880
of which are extracted from those living systems by opportunistic chemists like Justice von

215
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,040
Liebig.

216
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,560
But what about the exit point for carbon from organic chemistry?

217
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:54,080
It's a fair question, it's actually a very good question.

218
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,560
As our activities as humans concentrates carbon in our fuels and biomass, we have to ask

219
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,240
the question, where does that carbon go when we're done with it?

220
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,000
Carbon containing compounds contain a great deal of chemical energy.

221
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,680
And whether we are burning fuels or using foods for respiration, a large amount of the

222
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,820
organic material in the world is destined to become carbon dioxide.

223
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,880
And although it isn't particularly pleasant to think about when humans and other creatures

224
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,920
are done with their biomass for good, decomposition naturally releases much of their carbon as

225
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,680
CO2 as well.

226
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,880
Now that might not sound like a big problem, after all carbon dioxide's a gas so it's

227
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,640
just carried away by the atmosphere, right?

228
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,400
Well not quite.

229
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,120
We know from our discussions on spectroscopy just how powerful an IR absorber the carbon

230
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,600
oxygen double bond can be because the vibrations of those very polar bonds in the molecule

231
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,280
give it a strong absorption.

232
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,800
Recall also from Sir William Herschel's experiments that when objects absorb infrared

233
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,680
light, they tend to heat up.

234
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,120
So carbon dioxide acts as what we call a greenhouse gas, absorbing radiated heat from

235
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,880
the Earth's surface leading to climate change when it's not properly balanced.

236
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,480
This has led to a global movement to devise ways to store and use carbon dioxide in ways

237
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,280
which prevent its release into the atmosphere.

238
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,040
For example, the U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that 2.4 billion metric tons

239
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,000
of industrially produced CO2 could be stored by injecting it into subsurface structures

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,360
like unminable coal seams where it can become adsorbed to the surface of the underground

241
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,400
deposit.

242
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,880
The concern here is that there are other gases already bound to coal in seams like these,

243
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,800
most notably methane.

244
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Obviously, those who advocate this method are betting on irreversible strong binding

245
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,640
of carbon dioxide to subsurface structures like the carbon-rich coal deposits of coal

246
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,120
seams, binding so strong that hopefully it can displace methane.

247
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,720
Now, could such an idea work?

248
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,040
Well, there's a good chance that it would, but it depends on how well each environmental

249
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,760
gas absorbs to the stationary coal phase relative to its tendency to vaporize.

250
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,720
In complex geological systems like these, the overall composition and chemical behavior

251
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,000
of formations can be tricky to predict, so we don't know the best method for sequestering

252
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,680
CO2 until we try and see the results.

253
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,200
Just remember, it's all about those partitioning coefficients.

254
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:43,960
So, organic chemistry may change the world we live in, but it may also play a pivotal

255
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,560
role in getting us off of that world someday very soon.

256
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,720
There are those who estimate that the Earth's current population of seven billion people

257
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,680
would not be naturally sustainable.

258
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,680
That without chemical advancements like the Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation,

259
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,440
global famine would already have ensued.

260
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,600
Yet, the global population continues to expand, pressing ever closer to the nine billion or

261
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,520
so that could be fed using modern technologies.

262
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,960
But what then?

263
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,160
When we've completely exhausted the ability of our planet to provide for us, even with

264
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,680
some assistance from science, what's next?

265
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,160
Well, even if we one day master the chemistry of nitrogen fixation, there will still come

266
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,480
a day when there simply isn't enough land to feed every mouth on the planet.

267
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,760
The natural next step is that we look beyond the Earth for places to live.

268
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,280
We continue to expand our knowledge and carry our species into the reaches of the solar

269
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,120
system and eventually the cosmos.

270
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,240
To do so, at least to get started, will require that we take with us everything and every

271
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,760
one that a colony might need to survive transport to and establishing that colony on a new celestial

272
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,680
body.

273
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,680
But that leads to a number of logistical questions, not the least of which is, how do we get that

274
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,520
much material off of the Earth and into space?

275
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,400
That's a valid question.

276
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,240
See with current rocket technology, it costs thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars

277
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,400
just to get one pound of material into orbit around the Earth.

278
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,320
So step one of colonizing space is to find a cost-effective way to escape the gravity

279
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,280
of Mother Earth.

280
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,240
Now there are many possible approaches to this challenge.

281
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,160
And one very interesting proposal is the construction of a so-called space elevator, which would

282
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,360
consist of a line which reaches from the equator of the Earth to an altitude of about 36,000

283
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,880
kilometers, the altitude at which a geostationary orbit is obtained.

284
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,160
Of course, building a tower more than 40,000 times the height of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai

285
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,480
presents some obvious structural challenges.

286
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,360
It's unlikely that any such structure could support its own weight.

287
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,400
One proposed solution to this problem is to use a structure which is supported not

288
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,840
by compression but by tension, constructing a cable with a counterweight reaching so far

289
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,560
into space that its center of mass is above 36,000 kilometers and its overall length is

290
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:24,040
about 100,000 kilometers so that it's held taut under its own momentum as it turns with

291
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
the Earth.

292
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,340
Now, using a cable like this, a mechanical climber could simply move up the cable, taking

293
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,260
its payload of people and supplies to the necessary altitude to escape Earth's gravity

294
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,220
and reach outer space.

295
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,020
Now, estimates are that a device like this, though profoundly expensive to build, once

296
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,460
operating could lower the cost of delivering material into space by more than tenfold.

297
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,540
So it would cost just a few hundred dollars per pound to reach orbit, instead of the thousands

298
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,860
or even tens of thousands of dollars that are currently required.

299
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,980
So in order to construct this modern marvel, a cable about 100,000 kilometers in length

300
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,340
would have to be produced.

301
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,820
Now, let's think about that for a moment.

302
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,140
That's more than twice the circumference of the Earth, nearly a quarter of the way to

303
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,060
the moon.

304
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:20,300
But to build a cable that long which can withstand the tension produced by its orbiting counterweight,

305
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,040
we're going to have to find the lightest, most durable material with the greatest tensile

306
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,180
strength to weight ratio ever developed.

307
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,860
And the front runner for that material is carbon nanotubes.

308
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,180
Under one proposal, nanotubes several meters in length could be woven together into a rope,

309
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,300
creating the longest man-made object in human history and providing us with that cable that

310
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,180
we need to make the space elevator a reality.

311
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,420
Now, this may seem like an insurmountable target, a three meter long nanotube, especially

312
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,380
when you consider that that rivals the length of a completely extended strand of human DNA.

313
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,660
But researchers have reported recently that they've managed to create single nanotubes

314
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,060
with lengths approaching that necessary mark needed to form the proposed cable.

315
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,740
So it would seem that soon the only thing standing in the way of a space elevator will

316
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,180
be our own imagination, and about 20 billion dollars.

317
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,180
Now, if this project ever takes place, it would be a fitting application for these allotropes

318
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,580
of carbon.

319
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,220
The same element which makes up the scaffold of the molecules of life on Earth will also

320
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:34,740
make up the scaffold of the vehicle which we use to propel that life forward into outer space.

321
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,100
So our day dreaming about the role of organic chemistry in surmounting the challenges faced

322
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,440
by humanity in coming generations is coming to an end.

323
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,540
But just because our time together is up doesn't mean that your time with organic chemistry

324
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,540
has to be over.

325
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:56,020
If you found the last 36 lectures gratifying, I encourage you to carry your knowledge forward

326
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,500
and use it as a basis on which to learn from other chemists.

327
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,380
You now have all the tools necessary to read and digest current chemical literature created

328
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,940
by researchers in the field, intended for those with an interest in the science of organic

329
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,780
chemistry.

330
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,100
Countless university and public libraries subscribe to such prestigious professional journals

331
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,180
as Science, Nature, and the Journal of the American Chemical Society, as well as more

332
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,020
focused organic chemistry journals like the Journal of Organic Chemistry and Tetrahedron.

333
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,100
I strongly advise you to search out these publications and others like them.

334
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,140
There are a window into the incredible accomplishments being achieved every day by those toiling

335
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,260
in the lab hoping to develop the next great catalyst like Sabatier or find a new way to

336
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,580
isolate vital compounds like Tzvet.

337
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,580
Perhaps they want to mathematically decrypt the kinetics of reactions like Ingold or decipher

338
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,900
the function of a critical biomolecule the way McKinnon did.

339
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,380
And you now have the tools you need to join in on the conversation.

340
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:06,020
It has been my distinct privilege to help you get started on what I hope will be a lifelong

341
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,780
journey exploring and appreciating the rich and beautiful chemistry which breathes life

342
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,020
into our planet, the chemistry of molecules based on carbon.

343
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,900
Thank you for joining me.
