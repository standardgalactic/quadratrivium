0	14600	It's happened to us all at one time or another.
14600	18320	You sneak down to the kitchen in the dark in the middle of the night for a late night
18320	23840	snack and just as you're about to reach for that last cupcake on the counter, the lights
23840	26520	flip on.
26520	31560	Through your dilated pupils flooded with light, struggle to make out the image of your wife.
31560	34060	Arms folded, foot tapping.
34060	38720	Of course, your pupils quickly constrict in an attempt to limit the amount of light reaching
38720	42960	the receptors in the back of your eye, but it's already too late.
42960	47440	The torrent of photons has done its damage, and you seem to suffer the ill effects of
47440	50880	the overexposure for the next 10 or 20 minutes.
51880	57360	Have you ever wondered what's going on inside your eyes in situations like this?
57360	61360	And aside from the conundrum of why your wife doesn't want you to enjoy that last delicious
61360	67120	morsel before bed, there's also the mystery of why it takes so long to recover your normal
67120	71960	vision after she springs her trap.
71960	76640	The answer to this riddle lies in the structure and behavior of pie bonds and the molecules
76640	83440	responsible for vision, and its alkenes and alkynes, hydrocarbons sharing the same structural
83440	89960	feature as the receptors in your eyes that are the topic of today's lecture.
89960	96040	Now you should recall from our lecture on bonding that the first bond between any two atoms
96040	101120	in organic chemistry is almost always a sigma bond.
101120	106880	The electrons in these bonds occupy an area along the internuclear axis, so they can rotate
106880	113160	like the axle of a car without any meaningful energetic input.
113160	116000	But pie bonds are very different.
116000	120480	During the formation of double and triple bonds, the second and third bonds have to find a
120480	125560	different region of space to inhabit, one which still screens the two nuclei from one
125560	130400	another but doesn't occupy the space directly between them since the original sigma bond
130400	134720	electrons already have claimed to that space.
134720	142480	So pie bonds form as a consequence of side-on overlap of unhybridized atomic P orbitals.
142480	147820	The shape of the P orbitals allows them to overlap in a region above and below the internuclear
147820	149520	axis.
149520	154560	This leads to two distinct differences between pie bonds and sigma bonds, and we've discussed
154560	159440	both of these consequences in earlier lectures, but they bear repeating here.
159440	167200	The first is that double and triple bonds can't rotate freely the way single bonds can.
167200	171700	Rotation of the bond would require that the pie bond be broken completely, leaving only
171700	175360	the remaining sigma bond intact, restoring the rotation.
175360	179840	I can then stop the rotation and restore my pie bond.
179840	183440	Now the second is that pie bonds are weaker than sigma bonds.
183440	188200	Being located in a less centralized molecular orbital means that pie electrons tend to be
188200	192940	held less tightly in the resulting bonding orbital.
192940	198000	This means that less energy is required to break a pie bond.
198000	202280	And when we test the overall bonding energy, we see that a carbon-carbon single bond requires
202280	209080	about 348 kilojoules of energy to break one mole of those bonds.
209080	214120	When we look for a carbon-carbon double bond energy, we see that it requires about 614
214120	218160	kilojoules to break a mole of these bonds.
218160	222320	Assuming of course that the sigma bonds in both of these motifs are of similar energy,
222320	228400	we can easily calculate that it requires about 266 kilojoules to break a mole of pie bonds,
228400	233780	compared to 348 kilojoules for a similar number of sigma bonds.
233780	238920	This means that it's possible to break just a pie bond of a double bond while leaving
238920	243560	the sigma bond intact, if the proper energy is provided.
243560	251840	So the atoms can be kept connected even while free rotation is temporarily restored.
251840	257200	Pie bonds make up the second and third pair of electrons in double and triple bonds respectively.
257200	262400	Yet there's no such thing as a quadruple bond in introductory organic chemistry.
262400	263800	So why is this?
263800	268560	Well, the reason is rooted in the geometry of P orbitals.
268560	274320	Now that pie bonds are formed by the side-on overlap of P atomic orbitals, and this naturally
274320	281880	requires that the orbitals be aligned parallel and adjacent to one another.
281880	284800	So let's take another look at that double bond.
284800	289680	In this case, double bonds are made from one sigma bond and one pie bond, having that pie
289680	293040	bond above and below the inter-nuclear axis.
293040	298320	So the bond angles around these atoms that are involved in the pie bond is about 120
298320	300120	degrees.
300120	304920	If I add a triple bond, I need a region of space to put a new P orbital overlap, so I
304920	310640	can put my two P orbitals which overlap, moving into and out of the plane of the screen here.
310640	317400	So I have yet another pie bond, and now bond angles of 180 degrees among all the atoms.
317400	323400	But a quadruple bond in this case is impossible, because that last P orbital is not aligned
323400	328440	in such a way that the end-on overlap can be achieved.
328440	334360	So it's physically, geometrically impossible to obtain the orbital alignments required
334360	337440	to form a carbon-carbon quadruple bond.
337440	342240	So as far as we're concerned in this course, a quadruple bond to a carbon is just as great
342240	350680	an offense as an expanded octet would be for a carbon atom with five bonds.
350680	356120	Now hydrocarbons, like alkanes, consisting of only sigma bonded hydrogen and carbon atoms
356120	358920	are called saturated hydrocarbons.
358920	363880	Conversely, those hydrocarbons which contain pie bonds are sometimes collectively referred
363880	368560	to as unsaturated hydrocarbons.
368560	373160	This reference is born from the fact that each time I introduce a pie bond to a hydrocarbon,
373160	378760	I have to remove two substituents from the molecule to accommodate it.
378760	382880	Introduction of a double bond here requires that I remove two hydrogens, and a triple
382880	385720	bond requires that I remove four.
385720	393960	So alkanes are saturated with hydrogens, but there are hydrocarbons which are not.
393960	399680	So at the most basic level of organization, I have saturated hydrocarbons, which are also
399680	405880	called alkanes, and two classes of unsaturated hydrocarbons, those with a double bond, which
405880	412200	we call alkenes, and those with a triple bond, which we call alkynes.
412200	416560	So now we understand the geometries of multiple bonds and the classes of hydrocarbons they
416560	419360	create a little bit better.
419360	423960	Let's continue our discussion by considering the simplest possible hydrocarbon containing
423960	431320	a double bond, ethene, also known by its more common name, ethylene.
431320	435160	Ethylene is a naturally occurring alkene and a plant hormone which is critical to the
435160	439040	ripening process and a number of fruits and vegetables.
439040	443920	It's also the single most produced organic molecule in the world, valued for its use
443920	450640	as a synthetic starting material, as well as for its amazing power to ripen foodstuffs.
450640	457360	We take a look at the structure of ethylene, we see that it has a single pi bond.
457360	462200	Propylene contains an extra carbon, but still a single pi bond.
462200	468080	And butylene would be one containing four carbons with one pi bond.
468080	472840	But when we reach butylene, we have to consider the fact that there are different isomers
472840	474600	which can form.
474600	478200	So here I have what I call alpha butylene in which the double bond is at the end of
478200	484280	the molecule, but with four carbons introduced, it's now possible to make beta butylene.
484280	491080	In fact, beta butylene can exist in one of two stereoisomers, cis beta butylene or trans
491080	493600	beta butylene.
493600	497400	They all have the same empirical molecular formula.
497400	506520	So ethylene is C2H4, propylene is C3H6, and my butylenes are C4H8, or a generic formula
506520	512000	of CNH2N, where N is an integer number.
512000	518920	Now moving on to alkynes, the simplest of all alkynes is acetylene.
518920	524440	Now this is a standalone alkyne, there's only one kind like it itself, and that's because
524440	529920	acetylene has hydrogens attached, remember chain terminating hydrogens, attached to both
529920	533640	of the carbons involved in the triple bond.
533640	539560	Whereas the next most complex would be methyl acetylene, and this particular molecule would
539560	545240	be called a terminal alkyne, because one side of the triple bond is continued by another
545240	550720	R group or another bond to carbon, whereas one end of it is terminated and capped off
550720	553800	by that hydrogen.
553800	559000	The final example I'm going to show you here is dimethyl acetylene, in which we have what
559000	564320	we call an internal alkyne, because both of the carbons involved in the triple bond are
564320	567880	bonded to other carbons themselves.
567880	575640	Now the formula for these compounds are C2H2, C3H4, and C4H6.
575640	580360	So though they don't have identical empirical formula, they do follow a mathematical formula
580360	588920	of CnH2n-2.
588920	593920	So far in this lecture we've discussed a few simple hydrocarbons which have pi bonds.
593920	599400	I've used common names to refer to a few simple alkenes and alkynes, but just like any other
599400	605840	class of compounds, there's an IUPAC system which can be used to name them as well.
605840	610760	The presence of weaker and therefore more reactive pi bonds gives alkenes and alkynes
610760	614240	a special place among motifs in nomenclature.
614240	619760	We call them functional groups rather than substituents, and as functional groups they
619760	623600	receive special attention in IUPAC nomenclature.
623600	628320	So these and all other functional groups are indicated not at the beginning of a molecule's
628320	632480	name like substituents are, but rather at the end.
633160	637800	Alright, so let's begin by giving some simple IUPAC names to some of the simplest possible
637800	641120	alkenes and alkynes.
641120	643600	Let's start with ethene.
643600	648880	So named because it has two carbons, hence the eth prefix, and a double bond giving it
648880	652280	the ene suffix.
652280	656760	If I instead have a triple bond between two carbons, I call my molecule eth-ine.
656880	663000	Again, eth for two carbons, i-ine indicating that they're separated by a triple bond.
663000	670840	Now, adding another carbon to this gives me propene and propine.
670840	676720	I can continue adding carbons to my unsaturated hydrocarbons to get butene, but when I get
676720	681200	to this point, again I have four atoms so I have to consider isomerism.
681200	686360	So in this case I use an IUPAC convention to designate the location of the double bond
686440	691280	by giving the number of the first carbon in the chain containing that double bond.
691280	696800	So since in this case my double bond is at the end of the chain, I'll call this one butene
696800	703640	or bute-one-ine as the IUPAC conventions have changed in the 1990s and you'll hear them
703640	707280	used both ways, both the old and the new.
707280	710760	Similarly, we can look at an alkyne the same way.
710760	715160	With four carbons we need to designate the location of the triple bond in this example
715160	720280	it's at the end so this is one butene or bute-one-ine.
720280	727520	And then moving on, I have two butene which actually has multiplisomers and I can also
727520	733760	place my triple bond in the center giving myself two butene or bute-two-ine.
733760	739800	But as the size of alkenes and alkynes grows and the number and complexity of their substituents
739800	744640	increases, using a common nomenclature system just isn't going to take care of the job
744640	745640	anymore.
745640	749280	So we have to switch over to IUPAC.
749280	755840	So let's try a few IUPAC rules out on alkenes and alkynes keeping in mind that the pi-bonds
755840	759840	are not substituents but functional groups so we're going to have to change our rules
759840	762360	a little bit to treat them specially.
762360	767880	Now here's an alkyne, let's try to name this using our IUPAC rules considering the following
767880	768880	changes.
768880	773560	The functional group must have the lowest possible number regardless of other substituents and
773560	777940	also we're going to end our parent compound with ene or ein depending on whether it's
777940	780680	a double or triple bond.
780680	788080	So in our first example, we have a carbon chain with one, two, three, four, five, six
788080	789080	atoms total.
789080	796280	It may not be readily apparent because remember the bond angles in alkynes are 180 degrees.
796280	800360	So our parent compound is highlighted in orange.
800360	806040	The alkyne is here between these two carbons.
806040	810720	So this is going to be a hexine molecule.
810720	816840	Now my hexine molecule has a methyl substituent because there's one carbon here, methyl is
816840	819640	the name of that substituent.
819640	825600	And I can number my chain one of two ways either from left to right which puts the methyl
825600	832120	at two and my alkyne at four since we use the lowest numbered carbon that contains that
832120	839320	pi bond or we can number from right to left which would give a two and a five.
839320	843840	Now even though it gives overall higher numbers, I'm going to choose the numbering system that
843840	848760	gives the lowest number to the functional group because it gets priority.
848760	855080	So I'm going to name this compound five methyl to hexine.
855080	856080	Let's try one more.
856080	858240	How about this alkyne?
858240	861240	Well step one is to find the longest chain.
861240	865200	Well the longest chain in the whole molecule is here but there's a problem with that.
865200	868640	It doesn't contain the functional group.
868640	873320	So I can't use this six carbon chain instead I'll have to use this six carbon chain or
873320	878040	excuse me this five carbon chain, one, two, three, four, five.
878040	882240	Even though it's smaller it contains the pi bond.
882240	886000	So this is going to be a pentene molecule.
886000	893760	My pentene molecule has an ethyl substituent with two carbons and again numbering my parent
893760	899920	hydrocarbon giving the pi bond the lowest possible number will give me this numbering
899920	906040	scheme where my lowest numbered carbon in the pi bond is one and the number of the carbon
906040	908680	bearing the ethyl group is two.
908680	917360	So this will be a two ethyl one pentene.
917360	922200	Now we've already looked at how both structural isomerism and stereoisomerism is possible in
922200	928240	alkenes meaning that a wide variety of alkyne structures is possible with just a few carbon
928240	930440	and hydrogen atoms.
930440	935040	These resulting isomers can and often do have differing chemical properties which are of
935040	936920	interest to us.
937920	943200	No discussion on the topic of alkenes is complete without a mention of two of the most influential
943200	946440	chemists in the development of their understanding.
946440	951200	Vladimir Markovnikov and Alexander Zetsev.
951200	956160	Markovnikov and Zetsev were contemporaries studying under another great chemist, Alexander
956160	961280	Butlerov in the Russian system in the 1870s.
961280	964640	These two shared a striking number of commonalities.
964640	969040	Both had entered the Russian university system as students of economics.
969040	975120	Both were wooed to a career study in chemistry by the revered chemist Butlerov and both made
975120	979960	some of their greatest contributions to the field of chemistry by uncovering rules dictating
979960	984280	reactivity and stability involving alkenes.
984280	989200	Now final similarity, one which may have had the greatest influence on their careers was
989200	996600	their unabashed mutual disdain and burning desire to one up one another.
996600	1001320	The origins of their personal conflicts are lost to history, but however strained their
1001320	1005760	personal relationship might have been, the field of organic chemistry undoubtedly benefited
1005760	1007560	from it.
1007560	1012120	The resulting rivalry drove them to make discoveries about some of the most basic tenets governing
1012120	1014520	the chemistry of alkenes.
1014520	1019160	As our course progresses, we will learn rules bearing the names of both of these great inventories.
1020200	1028680	With respect to stability of alkenes, Markovnikov believed that less substituted alkenes like
1028680	1032360	this one butene were more stable.
1032360	1037000	While Zetzev held the opposing view that the more substituted alkenes isomer, like two
1037000	1041040	butene, would be more stable.
1041040	1045520	It may seem like a minor point to quibble over, but at the time the science of organic chemistry
1045520	1047800	was just beginning to blossom.
1047800	1052800	So both men knew that the answer to such a question would have a monumental bearing on
1052800	1057600	our understanding of the most fundamental tenets of organic chemistry.
1057600	1062640	Greatness was at stake, and both men knew it.
1062640	1067200	In this crucial debate, it was Zetzev who proved victorious when he published a paper
1067200	1070080	in 1875.
1070080	1074200	We already have the tools needed to make his prediction for ourselves.
1074200	1078640	You may remember that we discussed hyperconjugation previously, how adjacent alkyl groups can
1078640	1081920	interact favorably with p orbitals.
1081920	1087840	Well, just like radicals, alkenes have p orbitals.
1087840	1093000	And because of that, if there are adjacent r-groups which have their bonding orbitals
1093000	1099600	aligned with that pi system, the electrons from the adjacent bond can participate with
1099600	1104400	the pi electrons, giving a larger system through which they can move.
1104400	1110160	And we all know that when you extend the region through which electrons can move, you increase
1110160	1115760	the stability of the species.
1115760	1121240	Now Zetzev used an alcohol dehydration reaction, which we're going to look at in a future lecture,
1121240	1127240	to demonstrate that alkenes of higher substitution are indeed more stable.
1127240	1130960	Zetzev needed to use this system because, frankly, it was one of the very few understood
1130960	1133040	reactions in his day.
1133040	1139920	But this part of the story is going to have to wait for another lecture.
1139920	1144760	Modern chemists can much more easily verify Zetzev's conclusions.
1144760	1151880	Today we often compare the stability of unsaturated hydrocarbons using the technique of calorimetry.
1151880	1155920	Remember that in a calorimetry experiment, a reaction is allowed to run to completion
1155920	1159440	in a closed, well-insulated vessel.
1159440	1163560	And the temperature of the contents is then monitored.
1163560	1167640	On completion of the reaction, the amount of chemical potential energy gained or lost
1167640	1172320	by the reacting molecules is proportional to the temperature change of the surroundings
1172320	1174720	within the calorimeter.
1174720	1180040	Take our example of the two structural isomers of butene, the simplest alkene to have both
1180040	1182720	structural isomers and stereoisomers.
1183720	1189480	It's obvious that one butene is unique from two butene, and that one butene has only a
1189480	1195520	single stereoisomer because one of its alkene carbons has two hydrogen substituents.
1195520	1200920	Two butene, however, can exist in two different stereoisomeric states.
1200920	1205480	But which of these three isomers is most stable, and how can we tell?
1205480	1210280	If we want to compare the relative stability of several related alkenes, we can simply
1210320	1215560	convert samples of each molecule into their saturated counterparts in a calorimeter using
1215560	1220680	a reaction known as hydrogenation.
1220680	1226920	Hydrogenation is a process which saturates alkenes and alkynes using hydrogen gas.
1226920	1232760	Essentially we're trading two hydrogen atoms for each pi bond in the starting material.
1232760	1237180	We investigate the details of how and why this reaction happens during our lecture on
1237180	1242440	addition reactions, but for now let's just focus on the starting materials in the products.
1242440	1246060	Take a look at all three hydrogenation reactions.
1246060	1252500	They all start with one mole of alkene, one mole of hydrogen, and end with the exact same
1252500	1256300	product, butane.
1256300	1261500	Because the only difference among the reactions is the identity of the alkene, any difference
1261500	1266500	in the amount of heat released in the reaction must be a reflection of the differences in
1266500	1269440	the free energies of those alkenes.
1269440	1275100	In other words, hydrogenation of less stable alkenes releases more heat, causing a greater
1275100	1279980	temperature change in the calorimeter.
1279980	1283960	Conducting our simple calorimetry experiment gives us great insight into the factors affecting
1283960	1285980	alkene stability.
1285980	1291740	An equal quantity of one butene releases more heat when hydrogenated, which validates Zetzev's
1291740	1293480	rule.
1293480	1298480	We also see that not only is Zetzev's rule validated, but the geometric arrangement
1298480	1305320	of larger substituents also appears to affect stability somewhat, with E2 butene being more
1305320	1310360	stable than Z2 butene.
1310360	1316280	The difference in stability between the E and Z isomers is usually attributed to sterics,
1316280	1322200	that is, the physical proximity of substituent electron clouds in the molecule, placing two
1322200	1328760	larger alkyl substituents closer to one another as in the Z isomer, causes a natural repulsion
1328760	1335120	which is not present when those substituents are at opposition in the E isomer.
1335120	1341120	Not surprisingly, internal alkenes also prove more stable than their external counterparts.
1341120	1346040	So we see the same trend that Zetzev would predict for internal and terminal alkenes,
1346040	1353840	though the linear geometry of these compounds precludes any geometric isomerism.
1353840	1358160	So let's return now to our introductory story.
1358160	1362640	What goes on chemically when your eyes are overexposed to light?
1362640	1367160	Or for that matter, when your eyes are exposed to normal levels of light?
1367160	1373000	The rods and cones in your eyes contain specific molecules which interact with light.
1373000	1376920	We call molecules like this chromophores.
1376920	1383320	The chromophore responsible for your vision is called retinol, and it looks like this.
1383320	1388840	Now retinol has a number of alkene groups, all of which we know from our earlier calorimetry
1388840	1396280	data should be most stable when in the trans or E configuration.
1396280	1402560	But the retinol in your eyes has one double bond in the cis or Z-confirmation.
1402560	1407400	It's locked in this way because of the pi bond on the 11th carbon of the chain.
1407400	1414320	So this 11-cis retinol wants to be all trans retinol, but it can't get there without some
1414320	1417500	help.
1417500	1421440	The help comes in the form of photons, light.
1421440	1426440	When a photon of appropriate energy strikes the retinol molecule, breaking just the pi
1426440	1434400	bond on the 11th carbon, sterics calls the C11-C12 bond to rotate before re-establishing
1434400	1439320	the pi bond in the more stable trans configuration.
1439320	1445320	This change in the shape of retinol, promoted by absorption of light, induces a conformational
1445320	1448800	change in a protein to which it's bound.
1448800	1453920	And this starts a cascade of electrochemical signaling which your brain ultimately interprets
1454000	1458260	as vision.
1458260	1464000	An enzyme known as retinol isomerase then resets the alkene bond in retinol to the higher
1464000	1470340	energy, 11-cis-confirmation, making it ready to detect light again.
1470340	1475680	This process takes a little bit of time, which explains why it becomes difficult to see for
1475680	1480400	several minutes after exposure to a very bright light.
1480400	1484440	So the light sensors in your eyes are really just an elegant application of the concepts
1484440	1489800	we've been discussing in this lecture.
1489800	1495280	So I hope we can all agree now that structural and stereoisomerism make alkenes very interesting
1495280	1496960	to us.
1496960	1500540	Now it's time for alkynes to take the spotlight.
1500540	1505160	We know from the geometry of a carbon-carbon triple bond that alkynes are not capable of
1505160	1510200	that kind of stereoisomerism that makes alkenes so fascinating.
1510200	1513200	But it doesn't make them uninteresting.
1513200	1520080	Alkines have properties all their own which make them interesting to organic chemists.
1520080	1523480	One very interesting property of alkynes is their acidity.
1523480	1528240	Now it should be evident that internal alkynes don't have a very acidic proton since all
1528240	1533280	of their hydrogens are on sp3 carbons, just like an alkane.
1533280	1540360	The pKa of a terminal alkyne however is about 26, which may seem like a very weak acid and
1540360	1543280	in fact it is.
1543280	1549320	But compared to the acidity of alkenes with the pKa of 44 and of alkenes whose pKa is
1549320	1555440	about 60, alkynes start to look like a pretty acidic compound.
1555440	1561560	So at a pKa of 26, terminal alkynes are weak acids in the overall scheme of things but
1561560	1565840	they are rock stars of acidity among hydrocarbons.
1565840	1570680	In fact there are just a few bases available to us in the laboratory, albeit very strong
1570680	1576240	ones which are capable of deprotonating terminal alkynes.
1576240	1581320	Most notable of these is the amide ion, the conjugate acid of ammonia, which has a pKa
1581320	1583480	of about 35.
1583480	1585800	Easy to work with, no.
1585800	1588400	But available, yes.
1588400	1593640	So what's the source of the acidity in compounds like acetylene or propyne?
1593640	1598440	The answer is that alkyne carbons are sp hybridized.
1598440	1604360	Now heterolytically breaking the CH bond means that both bonding electrons will go to the
1604360	1606540	carbon.
1606540	1614240	This means that the hybrid orbital into which the bonding electrons go has about 50% s-character
1614360	1621360	as opposed to about 33% s-character for an alkene and 25% s-character for an alkane.
1624480	1629000	S orbitals hold their electrons tighter and closer to the nucleus than dupi orbitals of
1629000	1631360	the same principal energy level.
1631360	1637760	So a more s-character in a hybrid orbital means a more stable lone pair in that orbital.
1637760	1643560	And a more stable conjugate base means a more acidic conjugate acid.
1643560	1648800	These deprotonated alkynes are remarkably reactive compared to neutral hydrocarbons.
1648800	1653240	And we'll see in a few lectures how these deprotonated alkynes can prove very useful
1653240	1659480	reagents in the synthesis of other organic compounds.
1659480	1664000	So far we've concerned ourselves with relatively simple, straight and branched alkenes and
1664000	1666000	alkynes.
1666000	1671440	But just as alkenes can be cyclic, so can alkenes and alkynes.
1671440	1675960	In fact, we already saw an example of this during our discussion of chirality when we
1675960	1681800	analyzed the stereochemistry of limony.
1681800	1686640	Cyclic alkenes and cyclic alkynes follow many of the same rules as cyclic alkenes, but with
1686640	1688640	two important considerations.
1688640	1693960	First, just like with linear and branched hydrocarbons, the presence of the pi system
1693960	1698640	usually makes them much more reactive than similar alkane counterparts.
1698640	1705720	Second, the inclusion of a double bond with sp2 carbons and angles of about 120 degrees
1705720	1711080	or a triple bond with sp carbons in a bond angle of about 180 degrees can significantly
1711080	1715240	affect the ring strain of a cyclic hydrocarbon.
1715240	1718920	Just take the example of cyclohexane.
1718920	1724160	If we add a pi bond making cyclohexane, we create a molecule with bond angle strains
1724160	1729240	forced upon it by the presence of four coplanar atoms from the alkene motif.
1729240	1734480	Nonetheless, there are many examples of this motif in nature, including our familiar limony
1734480	1738960	from the rinds of citrus fruits.
1738960	1744560	Cyclicization of small alkenes also has the important effect of stabilizing the cis isomer.
1744560	1748840	Recall that when we looked at linear alkenes, we saw how heats of combustion demonstrate
1748840	1754680	that the trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer.
1754680	1760160	But in the case of cyclohexane, the trans isomer is impossible to make.
1760160	1764080	So I've built a model here, including six atoms.
1764080	1769720	And within these six atoms, I placed a single double bond here, one double bond.
1769720	1777120	Now if I cyclize this with a cis double bond, I have a pretty good, pretty stable looking
1777120	1778400	model here.
1778400	1781960	Maybe not quite as good as cyclohexane, but pretty close.
1781960	1787800	But what happens if I try to convert this double bond from a cis into a trans?
1787800	1793320	Well in the case of a six-membered ring, I'm going to break my model kit.
1793320	1797920	Notice how badly distorted this double bond is just to accommodate what I've attempted.
1797920	1803440	It's essentially impossible to create this structure.
1803440	1807920	In fact, in order to be able to create such a structure, a cyclic alkene that is in the
1807920	1811360	trans confirmation requires at least seven atoms.
1811360	1815200	Now here I have eight so that I don't break two model kits on one day.
1815200	1821600	Again, very, very easy to create a cis alkene that looks fairly stable.
1821600	1831520	But if I try to make the trans alkene, although I can, definitely doesn't look like a very
1831520	1832840	happy molecule.
1833840	1835840	Clearly there's additional ring strain.
1835840	1841720	Many of my bonds are in poor bond angles and I've had to develop some new clashes from
1841720	1844880	eclipsing interactions as well.
1844880	1850680	So in the case of seven, eight, nine, or ten atoms, we can make the trans but not very
1850680	1851680	stable.
1851680	1859320	In fact, we have to get all the way to eleven atoms before we reach the point where a trans
1859320	1862000	isomer is actually more stable once again.
1862800	1866480	When we reach eleven atoms, we have enough conformational flexibility that my double
1866480	1870760	bond in the trans configuration is tolerated very well.
1870760	1875520	I can find lots of good stable conformations, which give it lots of room, and I don't break
1875520	1878520	the double bond and I can reuse it later.
1882120	1883640	Now take your model kit.
1883640	1886040	Try to make cyclohexine.
1886040	1891080	The 180 degree bond angle in the alkyne part of that system makes it almost geometrically
1891080	1894440	impossible for this molecule to exist.
1894440	1899920	I say almost because the carbon-carbon triple bond of an alkyne is about 20 percent shorter
1899920	1903240	than a typical carbon-carbon single bond.
1903240	1908600	Now this means that cyclohexine can theoretically exist and it probably does form as a high
1908600	1914000	energy intermediate in certain reactions, but it can't be isolated and bottled like
1914000	1918560	it's cyclohexene and cyclohexane cousins.
1918560	1921760	Of course larger cyclic alkynes do exist.
1921760	1926640	Cyclo-octyne for example is the smallest cyclic alkyne which is stable enough to be prepared
1926640	1928640	and collected.
1930720	1936080	So in this lecture we investigated how pi bonds change the chemistry of hydrocarbons.
1936080	1940640	We took a look at how the geometry of the orbitals involved results in a weaker bond
1940640	1946440	than their sigma-conner parts, but which restricts rotation about carbon-carbon bonds and also
1946440	1950240	carbon-carbon triple bonds.
1950240	1956320	We discussed alkenes, hydrocarbons containing double bonds, as well as alkynes, hydrocarbons
1956320	1958540	containing triple bonds.
1958540	1963200	We saw how these double and triple bonds are reactive and therefore are treated with higher
1963200	1967720	priority in nomenclature than the simple alkyl substituents.
1967720	1972960	We call these higher priority reactive motifs functional groups.
1972960	1977560	We took a look at one of the great chemistry rivalries of all time, that between Markovnikov
1977560	1982660	and Zetzev over trends in the stability of alkenes.
1982660	1986840	We investigated how their work led to our understanding of trends in stability among
1986840	1993640	various regio and stereoisomers of the same molecular formula.
1993640	1999160	We took a look at how the function of a biologically relevant molecule, retinol, is tied to these
1999160	2005520	trends in stability, that the spontaneous conversion of retinol from 11 cis to all trans
2005520	2011120	conformations takes place when a photon temporarily breaks the associated pi bond.
2011120	2017560	Next, we covered the unusual acidity of terminal alkynes and how the presence of a hydrogen
2017560	2023520	on an SP-hybridized carbon is a rare structural feature which makes alkynes much more acidic
2023520	2026120	than ordinary hydrocarbons.
2027120	2032440	Finally, we investigated the effect of pi bonds on cyclic structures and how their presence
2032440	2038400	can not only introduce cis transisomerization, but also chirality.
2038400	2044000	We also saw how a clash of personalities in 1870s Russia led to a race to understanding
2044000	2049560	alkene chemistry, which in turn helps us to arrive at a better understanding of the molecular
2049560	2052520	mechanism of vision employed in modern medicine.
2052920	2055320	We've had quite a journey this lecture.
2057320	2061680	Next time, we will introduce a new class of atoms to the structural mix when we expand
2061680	2067200	our inventory of compounds to include the halogens, fluorine, fluorine, bromine and
2067200	2071800	iodine in a class of compounds called alkyl halides.
2071800	2072800	I'll see you then.
