0	16600	Over our last few lectures, we've considered some of the techniques that organic chemists
16600	21000	use to characterize organic compounds in their structures.
21000	28200	Specifically, we've looked at UV-visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, polarimetry, and continuous
28200	31120	wave NMR spectroscopy.
31120	35640	Now all of these techniques were developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have
35640	40100	no doubt contributed significantly to developing the basis for our understanding of organic
40100	43000	chemistry.
43000	48600	But in many cases, most notably the case of NMR, these techniques are not locked in time.
48600	54600	They've been relentlessly expanded, improved upon, and even supplemented with newer techniques
54600	60600	for identifications, just a few of which we're going to explore today.
60600	65680	Now last time we explored the technique pioneered by Isidore Rebe and his contemporaries in the
65680	68520	middle of the 20th century.
68520	72840	Specifically we discussed the phenomenon of resonance and how factors like shielding
72840	80760	and magnetic coupling can all affect the resonance behavior of specific protons within a sample.
80760	85920	Today we will apply all of these principles and more as we investigate modern NMR spectrometers,
85920	90840	which cannot only collect these spectra faster and more precisely, but are fundamentally
90840	94400	different in the way which they do so.
94400	98400	Several advances in technology have led to the development of what's called the pulsed
98400	100880	NMR technique.
100880	104240	First and foremost is the development of superconductors.
104240	109520	See all modern high-field spectrometers use a superconducting magnet to generate an extremely
109520	116840	high applied field, which helps us to achieve better resolution in the spectrum.
116840	121680	Keeping these superconducting magnets cold is critical to their function, so spectrometers
121680	127720	contain a series of concentric vacuum-walled compartments called duers.
127720	133080	There's an exterior duer filled with liquid nitrogen and an interior duer containing liquid
133080	137240	helium and the superconducting magnet itself.
137240	142600	The liquid helium keeps the magnet itself at four kelvins, that's colder than the dark
142600	144400	side of the moon.
144400	151960	Meanwhile, just inches away from it is the organic sample at room temperature.
151960	157920	The second advancement which opened the door to the pulsed NMR method is computer technology.
157920	162600	The detector in NMR is more often called a receiver, because the response it creates
162600	168280	is not a spectrum, but rather a raw data set which has to be manipulated by a computer
168280	170720	before it can be used.
170720	177000	So these two technologies, the superconducting material development and computing power advancement,
177000	182000	have allowed us to use this very effective technique to do so much more with NMR than
182000	187240	could ever have been done in rabies day.
187240	191600	As we try to explain the pulsed NMR method, we're going to rely on all the knowledge that
191600	193880	we've gained in the previous lecture.
193880	198320	That in the presence of a magnetic field, protons align their dipoles in the parallel
198320	204200	alpha spin state or the anti-parallel beta spin state, and that the populations of these
204200	209600	two states is governed by the Zeeman splitting.
209600	213400	Zeeman splitting is the energy difference between the alpha and beta states and can
213400	219280	be calculated using the field strength at the nucleus and the gyromagnetic ratio.
219280	224960	But to really understand pulsed NMR will require us to acknowledge two additional principles.
224960	232080	First, when an individual atomic dipole aligns itself with external magnetic field lines,
232080	237680	the two are not actually perfectly parallel.
237680	242440	You see the dipole processes about the applied field, much like this gyroscope, which I'm
242440	258280	about to wind up so that we can see this for ourselves.
258280	260520	So you can clearly see what's going on here.
260520	265300	Let me quiet it down a bit for you so we can discuss.
265300	271240	So the axis of that gyroscope was processing about the axis of the Earth's gravitational
271240	274400	field, which is oriented straight up and down.
274400	278920	Now just as that gyroscope would process, say, slower in the reduced gravity of the
278920	284880	moon but faster in the higher gravity of Jupiter, so will the magnetic dipole of a nucleus
284880	291400	process slower in a weaker field and faster in a stronger one.
291400	296560	The frequency of this procession is known as the Larmore frequency, which is exactly
296560	300320	the same as the resonance frequency for a given nucleus.
300320	305080	So we can calculate the Larmore frequency for a given proton using the same equation
305080	310400	relating it to the gyromagnetic ratio and effective field.
310400	312000	Our second consideration.
312000	318400	In a large collection of similar nuclei, the vector sum of all dipoles within the system
318400	324280	will in fact be aligned with the applied field because of the dispersion of the rotating dipoles
324280	328680	and the slight excess of the alpha spin state in the group.
328680	337400	And it's the net magnetization, which is the source of the pulsed NMR signal.
337400	341800	So let's set the stage for our first pulsed NMR experiment.
341800	343560	First we need to get our bearings.
343560	350240	So let's define a coordinate system such that three axes, x, y, and z, are present.
350240	355200	The z-axis will be aligned with the applied magnetic field lines and therefore also with
355200	358880	the net magnetization of the sample.
358880	363480	Now what makes pulsed NMR so fundamentally different from the continuous wave experiment
363480	364480	is this.
364480	366960	There's no continuous wave.
366960	372840	There is simply the magnetization generated by the protons within the sample.
372840	379160	So they rely on a hard pulse of radio energy containing a very broad range of frequencies.
379160	384680	This type of pulse electromagnetically pushes the net magnetization downward into the x,
384680	386440	y plane.
386440	391520	Now in my example, I've placed the magnetization along the x-axis.
391520	396800	But just as soon as that hard radio frequency pulse is removed, the magnetization wants
396800	400120	to return back to its original orientation.
400120	403120	But here's the catch, its path is not straight.
403120	411160	Instead, it processes about that z-axis at its Larmore frequency as it relaxes.
411160	417440	It's this procession which is the basis for the raw data collected in a pulsed NMR experiment.
417440	420680	But just how is this frequency measured?
420680	427280	Well, consider first the analogy of a lighthouse with the beacon of light rotating at a given
427280	428840	rate.
428840	433440	If an observer stands at a fixed location and watches that lighthouse beacon rotate
433440	436840	over a given period of time, what will they observe?
436840	441400	Well, they'll observe the intensity of the beam first diminishing as the source rotates
441400	446960	away, and then intensifying as it sweeps back in the observer's direction.
446960	452520	And this process will continue for as long as that beam rotates.
452520	458400	If we were to plot this intensity as a function of time, we would expect to observe a trigonometric
458400	463040	function, specifically a cosine wave.
463040	468520	So a Fourier transform of this function should transform my cosine function into the time
468520	471640	domain into a single peak in the frequency domain.
471640	476840	Now, a modern NMR spectrometer works on a similar principle, listening with the radio
476840	482400	antenna which produces an alternating current in response to the rotation of the magnetic
482400	484680	vectors in the sample.
485680	489360	Now, where this analogy breaks down is the fact that the magnetization of our sample
489360	494240	not only rotates, but also relaxes back to its original orientation.
494240	500480	So the x, y vector component of this magnetization is not only rotating, but also weakening as
500480	502840	the experiment progresses.
502840	507280	And this produces a decaying AC current at the detector.
507280	513360	It's a plot of that decaying AC current intensity versus time, which is the raw data produced
513360	515400	by the spectrometer.
515400	523320	And we call this the free induction decay, or FID for short.
523320	527680	So now that we understand how a spectrometer collects information about the Larmore frequency
527680	532280	of a collection of protons, I want to show you how we convert this information into something
532280	537760	more useful to us, like a completed NMR spectrum, the likes of which we saw last time in the
537760	540680	continuous wave experiment.
540680	546240	So let's begin by looking at a raw data set for a pulsed NMR experiment known as a free
546240	548560	induction decay.
548560	553900	On my horizontal axis will be time, because I'm in the time domain, and my vertical axis
553900	557800	will be the intensity of the AC current.
557800	561600	So I expect to see something like this.
561600	565120	Now what's interesting about this particular data set is that it's so simple that I can
565120	567040	interpret it without transforming it.
567040	568920	So let's do that first.
568920	573840	There are really only two different frequencies embedded within this particular free induction
573840	575800	decay.
575800	580720	One frequency, which is rather fast, frequency A, so the amount of time for one oscillation
580720	583960	to take place here is very short.
583960	589040	But if you look carefully, frequency A is embedded on top of a larger, longer frequency
589040	590400	here.
590400	593760	This would be frequency B.
593760	596720	So my data set contained two frequencies.
596720	601280	Now NMR data sets for actual samples can contain dozens or even hundreds of different
601280	606640	frequencies all superimposed on one another, so it's not always quite this easy.
606640	612600	And to solve that problem, we use a mathematical operator known as the Fourier transform.
612600	616960	The Fourier transform is very complex, and we won't cover in detail today exactly how
616960	621120	it's done, but what's important here is the outcome.
621120	627040	If I Fourier transform my data set, I alter the time domain and start looking at my data
627040	629880	instead in the frequency domain.
629880	636320	So my higher frequency, frequency A, is somewhere down here in the downfield region of my continuous
636320	643160	wave experiment, whereas a longer frequency or a lower frequency like frequency B would
643160	646760	be somewhere up here in my upfield region of the spectrum.
646760	652160	So we actually plot our data with higher longer frequencies at the left-hand side of
652160	658200	our plot, which might seem a little bit counterintuitive, but remember, this is the same type of information
658200	661720	that's included in a continuous wave experiment.
661720	667280	So to be sure that we can compare spectra collected in, say, the year 2014 with spectra
667280	673120	collected in the 1950s, we alter the axis in such a way that our frequencies are sort
673120	676740	of reversed from what we would expect.
676740	679620	So let's move on to another technique.
679620	686020	In 1895, a new class of electromagnetic radiation was discovered by German physicist
686020	688780	Wilhelm Rundgen.
688780	693140	Rundgen immediately realized the significance of his discovery and published his findings
693140	699540	the same year, referring to the uncharacterized radiation only as x-rays.
699540	703700	Rundgen was not the only one who saw potential in his new discovery, either.
703700	709820	He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics, in fact, the first one ever in 1901, just six
709820	714340	years after his discovery.
714340	719420	But it would be a decade after Rundgen's Nobel Prize award that one of the most impactful
719420	722820	applications of x-rays would be developed.
722820	728740	English physicist William Lawrence Bragg, working in collaboration with his father, opened
728740	733220	up this entirely new part of the electromagnetic spectrum to the art of identifying organic
733220	739420	molecules when he developed a technique to elucidate the structure of crystalline materials
739420	743340	using x-rays.
743340	748020	Bragg and his father had recognized that crystalline materials had a peculiar effect on x-rays as
748020	750020	they interacted.
750020	755620	There's a scattering effect caused by the electron cloud of each atom in the solid substance,
755620	760240	producing a spherical, diffracted wave of the same wavelength as the one which first came
760240	763060	into the crystal.
763060	768580	Now in a crystalline material, the atoms or ions are spaced regularly and evenly, creating
768580	774100	planes of evenly spaced positions capable of creating these spherical waves which propagate
774100	775100	out.
775100	779700	Now to give you an idea of how we can use this to get information about structure, I'm
779700	784280	going to show you a very simple relationship between just two atoms.
784280	787820	Each atom is represented here by one of my blue spheres.
787820	792460	So in the left case example, my two atoms are closer together in space than are the two
792540	794340	on the right side.
794340	799420	So how can I use x-rays to get information about the distances between these two?
799420	801980	Well, the key is in the scattering.
801980	805780	So if I have a coherent x-ray beam which in this case is going to be coming in from the
805780	811460	left hand side of my monitor and striking these atoms, their electron clouds respond
811460	813660	by emitting a spherical wave.
813660	817700	And that spherical wave has a very well-defined wavelength, exactly the same as the incident
817700	818940	light.
818940	823500	So let's create, in this case since it's on a two-dimensional surface, circles but
823500	827180	they'll represent the spherical waves that are created during diffraction.
827180	832740	Now the pattern looks pretty complicated, doesn't it?
832740	836100	But it's actually not as complicated as you may think.
836100	839660	Now x-rays have the ability to expose photographic film.
839660	845460	So if I place a photographic plate in a certain proximity to my crystal, only those locations
845500	850660	where the propagating spherical waves interfere with one another constructively, should I
850660	852820	see exposure?
852820	857540	So in this case, I expect to see a pattern of spots developing along my film where there
857540	861780	is constructive interference causing those spherical waves to continue propagating through
861780	864540	space.
864540	869540	Now let's do the same experiment but on my atoms that are spaced farther apart.
869540	875020	Again, my spherical waves propagate and in some places interfere constructively and in
875020	877020	others destructively.
877020	883180	But if I place my photographic plate at the same distance and do the same analysis, look
883180	884260	what's happened.
884260	888620	The spatial relationships of the exposures on my film have changed.
888620	894380	So by analyzing the patterns that result from this diffraction phenomenon, we can back-calculate
894380	897940	the spatial arrangement of atoms within a crystal and structure.
897940	902060	This is the principle on which x-ray diffraction works.
902060	905740	Now understanding how the diffraction patterns develop and actually observing them is always
905740	911620	challenging for students, in part because our eyes can't see x-rays, but our eyes can
911620	913380	see visible light.
913380	919100	And while the distances between atoms are so small that they require x-rays to resolve,
919100	924540	we can create little gadgets that we use in the classroom, in the laboratories, to show
924540	926820	a diffraction pattern using visible light.
926820	930620	I'm going to do that for you right now, so to help you out, I need to dim the lights.
931180	935140	Alright, I'm going to begin by showing you a dot from my laser pointer.
935140	936540	Not very exciting, is it?
936540	937660	But it's coherent light.
937660	940620	It's light of a single wavelength.
940620	945020	And when that light interacts with a grating, which is spaced somewhere around the wavelength
945020	949980	of that light, I can cause that light to diffract just like the x-rays do within a crystal.
949980	955380	For example, this is a diffraction pattern for a relatively simple grating.
955380	959820	And depending upon the spacing and the geometry of the separations, the striations and the
959820	966500	slides I'm using, I can create different patterns using just one laser pointer.
966500	970780	And encoded within these patterns is all the information about the geometry within the
970780	973500	striations in the slides.
973500	979140	In fact, with a little bit of practice and the right kit, I can show you the exact structure
979140	983300	that Rosalind Franklin and Watson and Crick saw when they characterized the structure
983300	985500	of DNA for the very first time.
985500	990380	This in fact contains all the symmetry elements of a DNA double helix.
990380	993540	It's a pretty amazing trick, isn't it?
993540	999140	All of those different patterns created using just a single beam of coherent red light and
999140	1003660	some special slides, which you can't quite tell by looking at them, but they contain
1003660	1008980	striations that are just a few hundred nanometers wide and therefore interact with that visible
1008980	1014060	light in a very similar fashion to the way that the atoms within a crystal interact with
1014060	1017460	X-rays.
1017460	1022380	So by shining a beam of X-rays on a crystal, then exposing a photographic film to the diffracted
1022380	1028700	waves, a circular pattern like those we just saw with visible light can be obtained.
1028700	1032860	Encoded within this image are all the angles of these symmetry planes within the crystal
1032860	1034860	that produce them.
1034860	1041300	Now, in 1913, Bragg and his father famously published a paper detailing the crystal structure
1041300	1044340	of diamond by X-ray diffraction.
1044340	1048620	This structure is special because it proved for the first time that carbon was in fact
1048620	1055380	a tetrahedral atom in its SP3 hybridized state, just as chemists had suspected for decades.
1055380	1064220	And for that contribution, Bragg and his father shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915.
1064220	1068180	X-ray diffraction has since been used to validate many structural theories, including some of
1068180	1071500	those offered by chemists long before its creation.
1071500	1076180	A great example of this is the concept of aromaticity and anti-aromaticity.
1076180	1081460	It validated Kikuli's benzene ring with Robert Robinson's six evenly spaced carbon atoms
1081460	1085780	about a symmetrical six-membered ring.
1085780	1089540	It also has been used to test Huckel's rule for aromaticity and anti-aromaticity using
1089540	1095900	cyclo-octotetraene, which clearly has a puckert to the ring and also clearly has two different
1095900	1103020	carbon-carbon bond lengths within the ring because of its anti-aromaticity.
1103020	1107220	In recent years, it has helped to produce many of the amazing protein and DNA models
1107220	1111600	which we used in the associated units of this course, including the remarkable potassium
1111600	1116260	channel protein structures which won Roderick McKinnon and his Nobel Prize.
1116260	1121820	In short, X-ray crystallography may be the most powerful structural determination tool
1121820	1125660	ever invented.
1125660	1129500	Our final technique in this lecture will be mass spectrometry.
1129500	1135220	Now we call this technique spectrometry rather than spectroscopy because unlike the other
1135220	1140300	techniques that we've discussed so far, in mass spectrometry we're not measuring the
1140300	1142940	direct interaction of light with matter.
1142940	1147820	See, mass spectrometers were first developed to help us better characterize the structure
1147820	1154260	of atoms, but modern mass spectrometers are used more commonly in a variety of applications.
1154260	1158100	They find use in criminal forensics labs, searching for the residue of gunpowder or
1158100	1162060	the metabolites of illegal drugs.
1162060	1165100	Anyone who's traveled through the American airport system in recent decades has almost
1165100	1169700	certainly seen a security agent swab the baggage or clothing of a traveler inserting that swab
1169700	1173820	into a small device and then waiting for a result before allowing that passenger to pass
1173820	1174820	on.
1174820	1179820	Well, the device that they're using is a mass spectrometer, searching for trace amounts
1179820	1184460	of chemicals used in the creation of explosives.
1184460	1189740	Modern mass spectrometers even have the ability to help us sequence sophisticated proteins,
1189740	1196680	characterize DNA and learn more about complex biomolecular systems too.
1196680	1201300	The influential analytical technique was first developed by British scientist Sir Joseph
1201300	1205340	John Thompson in the first decade of the 20th century.
1205340	1209700	Thompson was already a prolific physics researcher, having won the 1906 Nobel Prize
1209700	1213420	for his discovery of the electron a decade earlier.
1213420	1216980	Now you might think that reaching such a pinnacle of scientific achievement would mean that
1216980	1222780	Thompson would relax and enjoy his acclaim, but most researchers with the passion, talent
1222780	1227980	and determination required to win the Nobel Prize are not the kind to rest on even such
1227980	1232940	a high laurel, and Thompson was no exception.
1232940	1236700	As he continued his research into subatomic particles, Thompson turned his attention to
1236700	1243060	the nucleus of the atom, seeking any clue of the existence of subatomic particles there.
1243060	1247220	He found what he was looking for when he was able to create a beam of ionized neon gas
1247220	1249260	in his lab.
1249260	1253620	He aimed that beam at a piece of photographic paper, passing it through a magnetic field
1253620	1255060	to get it there.
1255060	1260100	And Thompson knew that when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences
1260100	1265900	a force which is dependent on its charge and velocity, but not on its mass.
1265900	1270460	So basically the field pushes all ions moving through it with equal force.
1270460	1275980	So naturally he expected to see all of his neon ions being deflected to the same extent,
1275980	1281340	striking the photographic paper in the same exact spot.
1281340	1284740	But what he saw was different and remarkable.
1284740	1287980	Two different spots formed on the developed paper.
1287980	1292900	So Thompson had observed neon atoms behaving as if they had two different masses.
1292900	1296300	He had proven the existence of elemental isotopes.
1296300	1301060	Atoms of the same element, different atomic masses.
1301060	1305820	The only logical explanation for his observation was that atomic nuclei must be made up of
1305820	1310380	something smaller than themselves.
1310380	1314780	But mass spectrometry is useful for much more than the study of atomic structure.
1314780	1318500	In the past half century it has become a favorite technique of chemical researchers
1318500	1323100	and forensics laboratories because of its amazing ability to identify unknown compounds
1323100	1326860	quickly and efficiently.
1326860	1330900	So let's get busy exploring a simple mass spectrometry experiment using an organic
1330900	1332660	compound.
1332660	1336460	For this discussion I'll be using a rather simple molecule, pentane, and describing
1336460	1340220	the most basic of mass spectrometry techniques.
1340220	1344540	The mass spectrometry experiment is extremely sensitive and requires that we generate a
1344540	1347740	high energy, very reactive species.
1347740	1352380	So the experiment has to take place in a really high vacuum.
1352380	1356620	This basically ensures that frequent collisions of our analyte ions with others or with atmospheric
1356620	1359380	gases are avoided.
1359380	1363740	Now inside of a typical mass spectrometer, the pressure is about the same as it is on
1363740	1368260	the outside of the International Space Station.
1368260	1375100	There are three main components to a mass spectrometer, an ionizer, a mass analyzer,
1375100	1377220	and a detector.
1377220	1383780	As the name implies, the ionizer is responsible for creating a beam of gas phase ions.
1383780	1388700	These ions then pass through a mass analyzer, which modifies their motion using an applied
1388700	1390580	magnetic field.
1390580	1396780	Finally, the ions collide with the detector placed such that only ions taking a specific
1396780	1401340	trajectory will strike it.
1401340	1405260	So step one for our pentane molecule is the ionization process.
1405260	1411300	In our example, we're going to use electron impact ionization as the ionization technique.
1411300	1415100	This method involves passing the gas phase pentane molecules through a beam of high
1415100	1417140	energy electrons.
1417140	1421980	And as this happens, occasionally an electron strikes a pentane molecule, knocking an electron
1421980	1425540	out of its cloud.
1425540	1429820	This process generates a radical cation of pentane.
1429820	1434820	Something like this would most likely never form in a lab bench, but in a high vacuum
1434820	1441220	being bombarded with electrons, we can expect to see some pretty strange things.
1441220	1445720	If the pentane survives the ionization process, it moves to a magnetic field which is carefully
1445720	1450500	shaped to deflect ions in a known direction.
1450500	1457020	Singly charged ions like ours moving through a field will experience a force.
1457020	1462340	Since force equals mass times acceleration, the acceleration or curvature of the ions
1462340	1466580	path is inversely proportional to its mass.
1466580	1472420	And because all moving singly charged positive ions experience the same force in our field,
1472420	1478060	we can say that more massive ions are deflected to lesser extents.
1478060	1483220	So knowing the mathematics governing the physics of deflection, we simply increase or decrease
1483220	1488740	the strength of the magnetic field until the detector indicates a hit.
1488740	1493960	So when using only monovalent ions, meaning ions with a single charge, we expect to see
1493960	1499820	just one peak for pentane at a charge to mass ratio of 72.
1499820	1503580	There will also be a few smaller peaks produced by the natural abundance of deuterium and
1503580	1510740	carbon-13 in our sample, so those will weigh 73, maybe even 74.
1510740	1515180	But this mass spectrum wouldn't be as useful as I led you to believe, would it?
1515180	1518900	After all, how many different organic compounds are there with a mass of 72?
1518900	1519900	There's plenty.
1519900	1527180	Just for a start, how about the three geometric isomers of n-pentane, isopentane and neopentane?
1527180	1531860	So how is it that mass spectrometry is so useful for identification when so many molecules
1531860	1534900	share the same molecular mass?
1534900	1539380	The answer lies in a phenomenon we initially neglected, which takes place during the ionization
1539380	1540780	process.
1540780	1546060	So let's rewind and look at our experiment one more time.
1546060	1550220	So let's set a few tenets before we continue our discussion here.
1550220	1553980	All mass spectrometry experiments require some kind of ionization.
1553980	1558180	Now the type that I'll talk about today isn't the only kind, but it's called electron impact
1558180	1563020	ionization, and it's very popular for use in small organic molecules.
1563020	1567780	And in this technique, a high-energy electron is going to impact a molecule and knock another
1567780	1573180	electron out of the cloud in a sort of game of molecular billiards.
1573180	1580820	So as a cartoon representation, here I have a gas-phase molecule, and my gas-phase molecule
1580820	1582700	has an electron cloud.
1582700	1586420	And I'm going to strike one of the electrons from that cloud with a high-energy electron
1586420	1590660	from outside the molecule.
1590660	1593460	Not pleasant for the molecule.
1593460	1600380	But what it does is relieve it of one electron, generating a cation with an unpaired electron,
1600380	1602380	which is a very unstable species.
1602380	1603900	So they don't always survive.
1603900	1605500	In fact, they rarely survive.
1605500	1608100	In many cases, they break apart.
1608100	1613020	And when they do so, most often, the charge and the radical or the unpaired electron
1613020	1617820	go the separate ways.
1617820	1623020	OK, so let's get out of the cartoon world here and look at a real molecule, pentane.
1623020	1624020	One more time.
1624020	1627620	We're going to ionize this with electron impact.
1627620	1631540	So my pentane has an electron cloud, which is depicted here in motion, and I have an
1631540	1637740	incoming high-energy electron, which strikes one and then ejects it from the electron cloud.
1637740	1641540	I've created a radical cation.
1641540	1644260	But remember, radical cations are very unstable.
1644260	1646380	And in the case of pentane, there can be a fragmentation.
1646380	1650220	I'm going to draw my fragmentation occurring here at one of the terminal carbon-carbon
1650220	1652980	bonds.
1652980	1658100	What takes place most often is a homolytic bond cleavage, which means the two electrons
1658100	1661940	go in different directions.
1661940	1664780	And when this happens, the bond breaks.
1664780	1670140	But not only that, but my radical and my positive charge go to separate sides of that broken
1670140	1675220	molecule or that broken ion.
1675220	1682300	So in this example, I've created a methyl radical and a butyl cation.
1682300	1686180	And the relative stabilities of these ions and radicals is what's going to dictate how
1686180	1690620	many of them form in my experiment.
1690620	1694420	So let's take a quick moment here and finish out our day by looking at what we expect to
1694420	1697900	be the mass spectrum of pentane.
1697900	1703460	The mass of pentane, or m over z as we report it, because z is a factor of charge, but remember,
1703460	1705620	our process only creates charges of 1.
1705620	1709380	So my m over z can be thought of as a mass.
1709380	1712380	I have my molecular ion with a mass of 72.
1712380	1715820	But I also can expect there to potentially be fragments involved in the breaking of the
1715820	1717940	terminal bond.
1717940	1725980	When this happens, I can get two possible pairs, a methyl radical and primary cation or a primary
1725980	1728020	radical and a methyl cation.
1728020	1733340	In these cases, the masses of the ions generated are 57 and 15 respectively.
1733340	1740820	Similarly, I could have the internal carbon-carbon bond break, generating another two pairs.
1740820	1745460	But notice that this time, the two pairs that are generated are both primary, so a primary
1745460	1750140	radical and a primary cation, slightly more stable than the others.
1750140	1754820	So my peaks at m over z of 43 and 29 are expected to be a little bit larger.
1754820	1760780	In fact, that's exactly what we see in the mass spectrum of pentane using this method.
1760780	1765980	We see a mass spectrum in which the peaks at 29 and 43 are larger than those at 15,
1765980	1770220	57, and even at 72.
1770220	1773580	We also see a little bit of those isotope peaks in there.
1773580	1779100	So here we have smaller peaks for the ions that are generated along with radicals that
1779100	1781460	are of lower substitution.
1781460	1784860	We see larger peaks when there's greater substitution.
1784860	1787860	And again, in this case, the molecular ion itself is one of the smallest peaks in the
1787860	1789620	spectrum.
1789620	1794380	So if we continue thinking about our simple example of pentane, by comparing its fragments
1794380	1799700	and their abundance with those produced in isopentane and neopentane, we can find clear
1799700	1806260	and predictable differences which enable us to discriminate between their mass spectrum.
1806260	1810780	Of course, hydrocarbons are not the only compounds with this molecular mass.
1810780	1815100	Consider acrylic acid, also 72 atomic mass units.
1815100	1818540	Its molecular ion is the same mass as that of pentane.
1818540	1820340	But look at its fragmentation pattern.
1820340	1822780	It's quite different, isn't it?
1822780	1828460	So it's clear from the masses of the fragments that ions created by loss of a hydroxyl group,
1828460	1835300	loss of a carboxylic acid group, and also by loss of a vinyl group are all present.
1835300	1841220	So this example shows very clearly how not the molecular mass but the fragmentation pattern
1841220	1846860	is the key to much of the utility of this technique.
1846860	1850220	We've all probably heard the amusing story of a person making the unfortunate decision
1850220	1855020	to eat a poppy seed bagel before a urinalysis drug screening, only to be told afterward
1855020	1858380	that they've tested positive for heroin use.
1858380	1863140	The situation has been explored by such popular programs as mythbusters and parodied on popular
1863140	1866140	comedy programs like Seinfeld.
1866140	1871900	If the MS used in the urinalysis is so powerful and accurate, how then can it be defeated
1871900	1875700	by something as simple as a poppy seed?
1875700	1877740	The answer is actually quite simple.
1877740	1883580	And it's a perfect illustration of the limitation of spectroscopy and spectrometry in general.
1883580	1889980	You see, morphine and heroin only differ in structure by the presence of two acetyl groups.
1889980	1895100	Now these acetyl groups are added to the naturally occurring morphine from poppy seeds by a
1895100	1901500	sterification with acetic and hydride, a technique which we explored in our estrus module.
1901500	1905620	Now of course the seed from mature flowers is needed, and I'm leaving out a few important
1905620	1910100	details from the process in the hopes of avoiding a visit from the United States DEA after this
1910100	1912220	taping.
1912220	1916660	But where the story comes to bear on the limitations of spectrometry is this.
1916660	1922100	Once injected a fraction of the heroin molecules are slowly hydrolyzed back into morphine by
1922100	1924820	enzymes in the user's blood.
1924820	1929060	The resulting morphine is modified and further broken down in the liver.
1929060	1933380	And finally these metabolites are eliminated from the user's system winding up in their
1933380	1936180	urine.
1936180	1941700	Many drug urinalysis techniques use mass spectrometry to search for the metabolic byproducts of heroin
1941700	1946860	which are practically identical to those of morphine which is present naturally in poppy
1946860	1952100	seeds used in the food industry.
1952100	1956380	This is a fantastic example of the utility of even the most powerful instruments can
1956380	1961260	be not only a function of the technology, but of the human element as well.
1961260	1966300	In short, no spectral analysis is ever complete without careful contemplation on the part
1966300	1969740	of the researcher.
1969740	1974140	So let's summarize the last of our spectroscopic techniques.
1974140	1978980	Today we looked at pulsed NMR and how modern technology allows us to use superconducting
1978980	1985220	magnets and radio receivers to measure the larmor frequency of spin one half nuclei.
1985220	1990020	This reproduces the information from a continuous wave experiment, but in a miniscule fraction
1990020	1993340	of the time.
1993340	1997740	We touched on x-ray crystallography and how scattering of these high energy rays by the
1997740	2002780	electron clouds of highly ordered atoms leads to a pattern of interference in the scattered
2002780	2008980	light and this pattern can be used to back calculate that regular arrangement.
2008980	2013500	We viewed a few of these structures and discussed how this technique has been used to validate
2013500	2017420	many of the structural theories which preceded it.
2017420	2022100	Then we took a look at mass spectrometry and we saw how ionization, mass analysis and
2022100	2027300	detection systems work and specifically how electron impact generates the molecular
2027340	2033700	ions and fragment ions, how a magnetic field is used to deflect each ion to a detector
2033700	2039420	which generates an electrical current when struck by ions.
2039420	2043980	We discussed how the identity and abundance of fragments in the spectrum can be used to
2043980	2048740	deduce the structure of compounds analyzed even when multiple candidates have the same
2048740	2051100	molecular mass.
2051100	2055020	And finally we had an object lesson in the human element of identifications and how we
2055020	2060220	must always remember that these techniques have their limitations.
2060220	2064660	So we finished our short survey of techniques used for identifying organic compounds once
2064660	2067620	they've been made or extracted in the labs.
2067620	2072020	But we have yet to really discuss how we can achieve high levels of purity, the levels
2072020	2075540	of which are necessary to use some of these spectroscopic techniques.
2075540	2080260	We're going to broach this subject in our next lecture when we start by discussing how
2080340	2085380	to get the purest possible sample using a technique known as recrystallization.
2085380	2086900	I'll see you for that talk next time.
