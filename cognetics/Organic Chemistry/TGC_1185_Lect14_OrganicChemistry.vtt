00:00.000 --> 00:19.360
In 1540, a German botanist by the name of Valerius Cordus isolated a substance produced

00:19.360 --> 00:23.360
when ethanol was mixed with sulfuric acid.

00:23.360 --> 00:29.280
Uncertain of what he'd created, Cordus simply named his creation Sweet Oil of Vitriol after

00:29.280 --> 00:34.360
the common name for sulfuric acid at the time, Oil of Vitriol.

00:34.360 --> 00:38.640
In his time, Cordus had no way of knowing what a powerful and useful molecule he had

00:38.640 --> 00:42.640
managed to create.

00:42.640 --> 00:49.240
Three centuries later, on March 30, 1842, American physician Crawford Williamson Long

00:49.240 --> 00:55.720
demonstrated the anesthetic effects of the very same molecule that Cordus had created.

00:55.720 --> 01:00.600
In doing so, he effectively changed the practice of surgery forever.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.760
Of course, I'm talking about ether, a compound with such a huge impact on the practice of

01:05.760 --> 01:12.800
modern medicine that National Doctors' Day is marked on March 30 in the United States.

01:12.800 --> 01:19.900
Today, ether has been replaced by safer alternatives in medicine, but it finds wide use as an industrial

01:19.900 --> 01:22.680
solvent and in fuel blending.

01:22.680 --> 01:28.400
More than just a useful medicine, ether is also an example of one of today's star compounds,

01:28.400 --> 01:33.040
those containing oxygen.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.960
We spend a great deal of time so far looking at the structures, properties and reactions

01:36.960 --> 01:41.320
of just a small slice of the organic compound arsenal.

01:41.320 --> 01:46.800
Specifically, we've investigated hydrocarbons, those compounds containing only hydrogen and

01:46.800 --> 01:54.120
carbon, and alkyl halides, in which a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine heteroatom is

01:54.120 --> 01:57.680
present in place of a hydrogen.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.080
Oxygen's made a cameo as nucleophiles and substitution and as bases in elimination,

02:03.080 --> 02:10.680
but oxygen-containing species have a much greater utility and versatility in organic chemistry.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.880
Today we're going to take a quantum leap forward, introducing this heteroatom to the

02:14.880 --> 02:21.440
mix in earnest, looking at examples of oxygen-containing functional groups which find use as reagents,

02:21.440 --> 02:26.160
solvents, catalysts and everyday commercial products.

02:26.160 --> 02:32.760
This atom is present in acids, bases, explosives, medicines and countless other relevant organic

02:32.760 --> 02:33.760
compounds.

02:33.760 --> 02:40.280
It's in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the foods we eat and so much more.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.080
Clearly, oxygen deserves some attention.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.760
So before we start to explore oxygen in the context of organic compounds, let's quickly

02:48.760 --> 02:53.600
review its characteristics as an element.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.640
Oxygen is element number 8 on the periodic table, so it has a ground state electron configuration

02:58.640 --> 03:04.040
of 1s2, 2s2, 2p4.

03:04.040 --> 03:09.040
Now this of course means that oxygen has a strong tendency to form two covalent bonds

03:09.040 --> 03:15.360
to complete its octet, either two bonds in an sp3 hybridized state with bond angles of

03:15.360 --> 03:24.720
approximately 109.5 degrees, or as a double bond in an sp2 hybridized state.

03:24.720 --> 03:32.080
In either case the oxygen atom will have two lone pairs of electrons to complete its octet.

03:32.080 --> 03:37.040
So far, the only heteroatoms that we've significantly explored are halogens, which tend to form

03:37.040 --> 03:40.640
only one bond to complete their octet.

03:40.640 --> 03:45.760
This means that for halogens, reacting is almost always requiring that the halogen be

03:45.760 --> 03:50.800
removed from or added to a chemical scaffold.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.920
But the two bonds that oxygen can form allow it to remain connected to an organic scaffold

03:55.920 --> 04:02.400
by one bond as it reacts with the other, making its chemistry much richer and even more useful

04:02.400 --> 04:06.240
than that of halogens.

04:06.240 --> 04:12.920
So let's begin by considering compounds containing a single sp3 hybridized oxygen atom.

04:12.920 --> 04:18.840
So what went on in that flask that fateful day in 1540 when Cordis mixed ethanol with

04:18.840 --> 04:20.560
sulfuric acid?

04:20.560 --> 04:25.160
Well, he converted one oxygen containing compound into another.

04:25.160 --> 04:31.120
Specifically, he converted an alcohol into an ether.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.680
So let's start our day off by considering alcohols.

04:34.480 --> 04:38.400
I'm going to show you some common aliphatic alcohols, meaning those that only contain

04:38.400 --> 04:42.320
saturated hydrocarbons as their scaffold.

04:42.320 --> 04:49.240
We can start with the simplest of all, methanol, with the formula CH3OH.

04:49.240 --> 04:55.440
One additional carbon gives us ethanol, with the formula C2H5OH.

04:55.440 --> 05:02.480
And I can continue adding carbons to my scaffold, giving N-propanol and N-butanol as the next

05:02.480 --> 05:03.800
two in line.

05:03.800 --> 05:09.120
Now, it probably won't surprise you to know that the boiling points of these compounds

05:09.120 --> 05:12.640
increase as I increase the number of carbons in the chain.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.880
This is analogous to what we would see for alkanes, for example.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.360
So as I add additional carbons to my alcohol, I increase its boiling point and therefore

05:21.360 --> 05:24.200
give it a greater tendency to be a liquid.

05:24.200 --> 05:29.360
Just as with alkanes, when we reach a certain critical number of carbons, in this case three

05:29.880 --> 05:32.600
We can form structural isomers.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.960
Now there are only two structural isomers of three carbon-containing compounds.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.560
Those would be propanol and isopropanol.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.200
So I'm going to show you instead the structural isomers of four carbon alcohols, because they

05:45.200 --> 05:48.280
get a little more interesting at that point.

05:48.280 --> 05:52.680
We've already learned about N-butanol, which has a four-carbon, linear chain with a hydroxyl

05:52.680 --> 05:54.920
group attached.

05:54.920 --> 05:59.960
But I can arrange these carbons in a different type of way to create a new structural isomer.

05:59.960 --> 06:05.440
For example, I can create isobutanol by placing a branch in the chain near the other side

06:05.440 --> 06:09.360
of the molecule away from the functional group.

06:09.360 --> 06:14.760
If I instead branch that chain at a location adjacent to the functional group, I create

06:14.760 --> 06:20.320
something called sec-butanol, which is short for secondary.

06:20.320 --> 06:27.160
I can branch it even further and create tert-butanol, which of course is short for tertiary.

06:27.160 --> 06:31.840
So all of these alcohols have exactly the same molecular formula, but clearly have different

06:31.840 --> 06:33.760
arrangements of atoms.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.920
And this has an effect on their boiling points as well.

06:36.920 --> 06:42.080
Again, N-butanol has a primary carbon and a straight chain.

06:42.080 --> 06:46.280
Isobutanol has a primary carbon bearing its hydroxyl on a branched chain.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.100
Sec-butanol with a secondary on an otherwise straight chain and tert-butanol, which is as

06:51.100 --> 06:54.240
branched as I can possibly get.

06:54.240 --> 06:59.480
So knowing what we do about how branching affects the volatility of organic compounds,

06:59.480 --> 07:04.040
we can predict, and we would be right, that the boiling point trend of these four isomers

07:04.040 --> 07:06.360
of isobutanol is as follows.

07:06.360 --> 07:13.720
T-butanol is the lowest, followed by sec-butanol, isobutanol, and finally, N-butanol having

07:13.720 --> 07:18.840
the highest boiling point of all.

07:18.840 --> 07:23.720
The IUPAC nomenclature of alcohols follows the usual system, keeping in mind that the

07:23.720 --> 07:27.040
alcohol is treated as a functional group.

07:27.040 --> 07:32.460
So for example, if I were going to name this compound, by IUPAC, I would first have to

07:32.460 --> 07:34.440
identify the parent compound.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.600
The parent hydrocarbon is here.

07:36.600 --> 07:42.840
One, two, three, four carbons bearing the functional group.

07:42.840 --> 07:46.040
So this is going to be a butanol molecule.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.960
I have a single substituent in the form of a methyl group.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.560
So all that's left now is to number my parent chain in such a way that my functional group

07:54.560 --> 07:57.200
gets the lowest possible number.

07:57.200 --> 08:02.560
So I have this numbering scheme available, and I have this numbering scheme here.

08:02.560 --> 08:08.680
Naturally I'm going to choose the scheme which gives my hydroxyl group an address of one.

08:08.680 --> 08:15.200
So I construct my name using these elements, and I get three methyl, one butanol.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.360
Let's do another one.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.840
Here's an alcohol that has a halogen as a substituent.

08:21.840 --> 08:27.480
Again, I need to find my parent carbon chain which contains the hydroxyl bond.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.080
Here it is.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.120
Five carbons containing the bond to the OH group.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.280
So this is going to be a pentanol molecule.

08:37.280 --> 08:42.120
My substituent is a chlorine, so this is a chloro group.

08:42.120 --> 08:47.440
And again, I will address my carbon chain starting with one end and giving the lowest

08:47.440 --> 08:49.800
number to the functional group.

08:49.800 --> 08:55.480
In this case that means putting a two on my alcohol group and a four on my chloro group

08:55.480 --> 09:00.760
which gives me the name four chloro, two pentanol.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.960
So now that we've taken a look at alcohols, let's switch gears a little bit and look at

09:04.960 --> 09:09.120
ethers so that we can try to understand their differences in their properties and how they

09:09.120 --> 09:11.720
are interconverted.

09:11.720 --> 09:16.420
The simplest possible ether is dimethyl ether, and you should immediately notice what makes

09:16.420 --> 09:21.880
it different from the alcohol examples in the previous slides, that the oxygen does not

09:21.880 --> 09:24.680
contain a bond directly to hydrogen.

09:24.680 --> 09:30.840
Instead, it's bonded to two different R groups, in this case both methyl.

09:30.840 --> 09:36.200
So this has a formula of CH3OCH3.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.880
I can extend one of those R groups to a longer chain and get what we would call ethyl methyl

09:39.880 --> 09:43.400
ether, which has this formula.

09:43.400 --> 09:52.320
And I could extend the other chain even further to get diethyl ether, which has this formula.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.840
But those common names of ethers get unwieldy just like any other organic compound as they

09:55.840 --> 09:57.240
get larger and larger.

09:57.240 --> 10:01.960
So as usual, the IUPAC has stepped in with some nomenclature rules.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.680
But in the case of ether, since there's no hydrogen attached directly to the oxygen,

10:06.680 --> 10:09.240
we don't treat it as a functional group.

10:09.240 --> 10:14.080
Instead, we treat the ether motif as what we would call an alkoxy group.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.580
This is best shown by example.

10:16.580 --> 10:19.160
So let's name this compound.

10:19.160 --> 10:24.720
Remembering that I have an ether here because my oxygen is connected to two distinct R groups.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.620
This is not going to be a functional group, but rather a substituent.

10:28.620 --> 10:35.520
So the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule I have here is five carbons long.

10:35.520 --> 10:40.440
And I have, in this case, a pentane, which contains two different substituents.

10:40.440 --> 10:47.960
Those substituents are the chloro, shown here, and the ethoxy substituent, which constitutes

10:47.960 --> 10:49.320
my ether.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.960
But because it is a substituent and not a functional group, it no longer gets that

10:54.960 --> 10:57.560
special priority in numbering.

10:57.560 --> 11:03.360
So I would number my chain from the left-hand side to give the lower number two to the alphabetically

11:03.360 --> 11:05.760
first chloro group.

11:05.760 --> 11:16.160
So in this case, I'm going to call my compound two chloro for ethoxypentane.

11:16.160 --> 11:22.040
Just for fun, let's do the diethyl ether that Cortis created back in the 1500s.

11:22.040 --> 11:26.360
In this case, it may seem funny, but my parent chain is going to be relatively small compared

11:26.360 --> 11:28.000
to the rest of the molecule.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Here it is.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.480
Two carbons long is the longest possible continuous chain of carbon atoms that I can find.

11:34.480 --> 11:38.800
And of course, the substituent would be the entire ethoxy group.

11:38.800 --> 11:43.360
So we would name this, under IUPAC rules, ethoxyethane.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.600
No address is needed in this case, because whether it's on one carbon of the ethane or

11:47.600 --> 11:51.240
the other, that's always going to be my number one carbon.

11:51.240 --> 11:56.080
And in cases like this, where there's no ambiguity, we frequently drop the address out of the

11:56.080 --> 11:58.400
substituent's portion of the name.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.440
Now another property that we should discuss is the hydrogen bonding characteristics of

12:02.440 --> 12:05.480
alcohols and ethers.

12:05.480 --> 12:09.600
Let's do this by looking first at the structure of alcohol.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.760
Here's our molecule of ethanol, with which we're fairly familiar.

12:13.760 --> 12:18.080
It has an OH bond, which should have a fairly strong dipole with a negative end near the

12:18.080 --> 12:22.480
oxygen and a positive end near the hydrogen.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.680
It also has a carbon-oxygen polar bond, which should have some positive charge density near

12:26.680 --> 12:32.280
the carbon, which bears the hydroxyl, and again, some negative charge on the oxygen.

12:32.280 --> 12:37.120
So overall, this particular molecule has a net molecular dipole.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Furthermore, when it is near another molecule of ethanol, it can form an extra type of intermolecular

12:44.000 --> 12:47.640
interaction known as a hydrogen bond.

12:47.640 --> 12:54.880
Whenever I have an OH, NH, or FH bond in a functional group, there's a potential that

12:54.880 --> 13:00.080
the electronegative oxygen, fluorine, or nitrogen atom can share its lone pairs for

13:00.080 --> 13:07.200
just a split second with the hydrogen from another molecule of the same type.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.880
When this interaction takes place, it's fairly strong compared to a lot of other intermolecular

13:11.880 --> 13:14.280
forces and so we give it a special name.

13:14.280 --> 13:19.800
We call it hydrogen bonding, or H bonding, and it is this hydrogen bonding that can occur

13:19.800 --> 13:26.600
between two different molecules of ethanol that give it such a high boiling point.

13:26.600 --> 13:31.600
If instead we compare how ethers look, we see that ethers have polar bonds in the form

13:31.600 --> 13:36.360
of two different carbon-oxygen bonds, one here, one here.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.080
So there is a little bit of polarity to this molecule.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.880
Now those dipoles are almost pointed opposite to one another, so they cancel out a great

13:42.880 --> 13:47.540
deal, but what's even more important here is that there's no potential for hydrogen

13:47.540 --> 13:54.320
bonding in ether, and that's because the oxygen contains the lone pairs necessary, but there's

13:54.320 --> 13:58.900
no polar hydrogen like there is here in my ethanol molecule.

13:58.900 --> 14:04.360
So ethers make great solvents for dissolving compounds like ethanol, but they don't adhere

14:04.360 --> 14:09.800
well to one another, and this translates to a lower boiling point.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.720
So here we have an ethane compared to a methyl ether and an ethanol boiling point, and you

14:14.720 --> 14:19.800
can see clearly that hydrogen bonding interaction is enough to make up almost a hundred degrees

14:19.800 --> 14:22.000
difference worth of boiling point here.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.720
So this is a very important, very fundamental intermolecular force that we always have to

14:26.720 --> 14:28.760
be mindful of.

14:28.760 --> 14:36.160
To last property, let's talk about the acidity of alcohols and ethers.

14:36.160 --> 14:42.400
Now the alcohol has this OH, which is a polar bond containing a hydrogen, so we expect it

14:42.400 --> 14:45.360
to act as an acid, albeit a weak one.

14:45.360 --> 14:51.400
To form an alkoxide conjugate base, we have a pKa of about 16.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.600
So on the grand scheme of things, alcohols aren't terribly acidic, but they're certainly

14:55.600 --> 15:00.360
much more acidic than, for example, alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, all of which we've looked

15:00.360 --> 15:03.040
at so far.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.840
But alcohols can also act as a base.

15:06.840 --> 15:12.000
When they accept a proton at that group, they form a species known as an oxonium ion.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.320
Now, oxonium ions have a lot of positive charge density right near an electronegative element,

15:18.320 --> 15:22.360
so they're not very stable, and they tend to give up that proton very rapidly, giving

15:22.360 --> 15:26.000
them a pKa of about negative 2.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.360
So in this case, alcohols can act either as very weak acids, releasing a proton, or very

15:31.360 --> 15:33.800
weak bases, accepting a proton.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.400
And we call this property amphoterism.

15:37.400 --> 15:44.120
So ethanol, like all aliphatic alcohols, is amphoteric.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.080
But what about ethers?

15:46.080 --> 15:48.200
Let's look at the structure of ether.

15:48.200 --> 15:52.200
Remember, we have that electronegative oxygen there with lone pairs, so there's a potential

15:52.200 --> 15:54.080
here for some acid-base chemistry.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.640
But there's no acidic proton.

15:55.640 --> 16:00.780
In fact, the most acidic proton on ether, in this case dimethyl ether, would be one

16:00.780 --> 16:05.560
of the six protons that it has on the adjacent methyl groups, which would have a pKa of somewhere

16:05.560 --> 16:06.960
around 50.

16:06.960 --> 16:13.560
Now, from a practical perspective, when pKa's become this prohibitively large, we just say,

16:13.560 --> 16:16.920
now this is not an acid at all.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.960
But it can act as a base.

16:18.960 --> 16:24.080
Just as the oxygen in alcohol can accept a proton, so can this oxygen in ether accept

16:24.080 --> 16:29.700
a proton via one of the two lone pairs, creating a protonated ether which has a pKa of around

16:29.700 --> 16:32.580
negative 3.5.

16:32.580 --> 16:36.800
So in the case of ethers, we're not dealing with amphoterism, we're simply dealing with

16:36.800 --> 16:41.440
a very weakly basic organic compound.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.360
Organic chemicals are used widely in organic chemistry, as both reagents and solvents.

16:45.360 --> 16:49.120
And I'm sure that most of us are familiar with the means by which most of the world's

16:49.120 --> 16:54.760
ethanol is prepared, fermentation of sugars by the bacterium Saccharomyces.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.160
This is just a fancy name for yeast.

16:57.160 --> 17:00.960
These little organic chemists are without equal when it comes to creating ethanol.

17:00.960 --> 17:05.640
But what about other, more complex alcohols?

17:05.640 --> 17:10.480
When larger, more complex alcohols are needed, we must often turn to the tools of organic

17:10.480 --> 17:12.720
chemistry to create them.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.600
There are many ways in which to do this.

17:14.600 --> 17:19.520
In fact, we already saw how they can be produced by nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides

17:19.520 --> 17:23.160
using hydroxide ions.

17:23.160 --> 17:28.120
There are many, many more, there are far too many in fact, to survey them all in this course.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.080
In fact, we're now just going to focus on how alcohols are produced using starting materials

17:32.080 --> 17:37.720
with which we're already familiar, alkenes, and a mechanism that we already understand,

17:37.720 --> 17:40.080
addition.

17:40.080 --> 17:44.120
To accomplish this, we'll discuss three types of reactions.

17:44.120 --> 17:50.320
Hydration of alkenes, a technique called oxymercuration demercuration, and one known as hydroboration

17:50.320 --> 17:52.480
and oxidation.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.960
Each of these reactions has specific advantages and challenges associated with them, and in

17:56.960 --> 18:03.080
many cases they will produce various structural isomers of the product alcohol.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.280
So let's begin with a special kind of addition reaction.

18:06.280 --> 18:11.160
This is a catalyzed hydration of a very simple alkene, like propene.

18:11.160 --> 18:18.920
As the name implies, we'll need three ingredients, an alkene, a mineral acid, and water.

18:18.920 --> 18:23.400
In order to complete our reaction, we'll need to acidify the sample using an aqueous solution

18:23.400 --> 18:28.080
of that mineral acid, being sure that it has a non-nucleophilic conjugate base, so we'd

18:28.080 --> 18:31.680
use something like phosphoric or sulfuric acid for this purpose.

18:32.680 --> 18:38.560
A strong acid like sulfuric acid protonates the alkene, but there are two possible carbocation

18:38.560 --> 18:41.760
which could form, primary and secondary.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.960
Of course, we know that hyperconjugation causes the secondary carbocation to be strongly

18:45.960 --> 18:50.360
favored, and it's one of the driving forces behind Markov and Kov's rule, and this reaction

18:50.360 --> 18:53.320
is no exception.

18:53.320 --> 18:58.000
Now if we follow the reaction with the isopropyl cation to completion, we see that our acid

18:58.000 --> 19:03.440
selection has produced a non-nucleophilic base, leaving only water to act as the nucleophile,

19:03.440 --> 19:06.960
attacking the carbocation and forming a new bond.

19:06.960 --> 19:11.120
So we've created that species known as an oxonium ion.

19:11.120 --> 19:16.080
Remember oxonium ions are very acidic, so they quickly lose that acidic proton to a molecule

19:16.080 --> 19:21.160
of solvent or to another alkene perpetuating the reaction.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.960
And if we evaluate the product obtained, we see that the extension of Markov and Kov's

19:24.960 --> 19:29.880
rule has held, with the added hydrogen on the less substituted carbon of the product

19:29.880 --> 19:33.680
and the hydroxyl group on the more substituted carbon.

19:33.680 --> 19:40.080
So if the goal of our synthesis is to convert an alkene into an alcohol without stereoselectivity

19:40.080 --> 19:46.480
and with obeying Markov and Kov's rule, acid-catalyzed hydration seems to be the ticket.

19:46.480 --> 19:51.120
But just as with all reactions involving carbocation, we have to be vigilant of the possibility

19:51.120 --> 19:55.120
for rearrangements in the intermediate.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.280
So how do we cope with this problem?

19:57.280 --> 20:01.200
It's an interesting question and one which no doubt vexed Markov and Kov.

20:01.200 --> 20:06.880
So this question was taken up by Carl Andreas Hoffman and Julius Sand in 1900.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.280
Hoffman and Sand were part of a burgeoning subclass of chemists practicing what is known

20:10.280 --> 20:12.720
as organometallic chemistry.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.480
And metals, though they're rare in organic chemistry, are present and can form bonds

20:16.480 --> 20:17.480
to carbon.

20:17.840 --> 20:22.080
It was a very interesting phenomenon that they were investigating.

20:22.080 --> 20:28.280
So the reaction that Hoffman and Sand developed involves the use of mercuric acetate, compound

20:28.280 --> 20:33.000
consisting of one atom of mercury bonded to two acetate groups.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.400
Hoffman and Sand realized that if this compound was used in place of a mineral acid to initiate

20:37.400 --> 20:42.600
the hydration of an alkene, no rearrangement took place.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.480
So as mercuric acetate is attacked by the alkene, the large mercury atom takes up residence

20:47.480 --> 20:52.200
between the two carbons of the pi system, much like our cyclic halonium ion discussed

20:52.200 --> 20:53.880
last time.

20:53.880 --> 20:59.000
Because of this, it cannot rearrange, that cyclic structure locks it down.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.240
Attack by the solvent takes place, and finally the organomercury group is reacted with an

21:03.240 --> 21:06.000
agent called sodium borohydride.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.880
The borohydride removes the mercuric group and replaces it with a hydrogen.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.880
So the use of this reagent allowed Hoffman and Sand to create the Markovnikov product

21:15.880 --> 21:20.360
in this hydration without suffering the effects of rearrangement.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.720
So we've seen how acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes leads to Markovnikov products with

21:24.720 --> 21:29.360
the potential for rearrangement, and we've seen how to produce the Markovnikov product

21:29.360 --> 21:36.400
while avoiding rearrangement by use of oxymercuration and subsequent demercuration with borohydride.

21:36.400 --> 21:40.600
But what if instead it were necessary to hydrate an alkene to produce the anti-Markovnikov

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
product?

21:41.600 --> 21:45.360
Well, we can accomplish this using boron trihydride.

21:45.360 --> 21:52.080
You see, what makes boron hydride so interesting is that boron has very low electronegativity,

21:52.080 --> 21:56.600
so low in fact that the hydrogen atoms of borotrihydride are at the negative end of the

21:56.600 --> 21:58.280
bond dipole.

21:58.280 --> 22:01.120
Very unusual.

22:01.120 --> 22:06.000
The unusual orientation of the bond dipole in boron trihydride causes it to interact with

22:06.000 --> 22:10.680
the pi system of the alkene in such a way that the hydrogen preferentially positions

22:10.680 --> 22:15.560
itself above the more substituted carbon.

22:15.560 --> 22:19.000
This point, we produce what's called an alkyl borane.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.160
And finally, the borane group is reacted with hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide to replace

22:24.160 --> 22:26.980
the borane with a hydroxyl group.

22:26.980 --> 22:32.400
This leads to the anti-Markovnikov hydration of an alkene, so this is an alcohol that's

22:32.400 --> 22:36.800
made with syn-stereochemistry.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.400
A final distinction between ethers and alcohols is the lack of an acidic hydrogen in ethers.

22:41.400 --> 22:46.520
Now, because ethers don't act as acids under common laboratory conditions, they find use

22:46.520 --> 22:53.400
much more frequently as solvents than as reagents, but they're critical materials nonetheless.

22:53.400 --> 22:57.120
So after everything that we've been through so far today, you're probably stealing yourself

22:57.120 --> 23:00.640
for a new round of complex mechanisms depicting synthesis of ethers.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.640
Well, I have some good news for you.

23:03.640 --> 23:08.400
You can relax a little bit because ethers can be synthesized using analogs of two of the

23:08.400 --> 23:13.760
three reactions that we just discussed, simply by substituting the desired alkyl group for

23:13.760 --> 23:16.160
the appropriate hydrogen.

23:16.160 --> 23:21.120
For example, instead of acid-catalyzed hydration to form 2-methyl-2-butanol, we can simply

23:21.120 --> 23:26.120
replace water with an alcohol leading to the corresponding sec-butyl ether.

23:27.120 --> 23:33.320
In a similar way, oxymercuration and demercuration in an alcohol solvent rather than water leads

23:33.320 --> 23:37.120
to a Markovnikov ether product without the rearrangement.

23:38.120 --> 23:43.680
Now, unfortunately, the complexities of the oxidation step in hydroboration and oxidation

23:43.680 --> 23:48.320
make it impossible to produce ethers from alkenes using this method.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.520
But there is a solution to this problem.

23:50.520 --> 23:55.000
It's not only the last reaction in our synthesis segment of the lecture, but the first in our

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
reactions segment.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.080
Although alcohols, and particularly ethers, are most frequently used as solvents in organic

24:03.080 --> 24:08.360
chemistry, there are situations in which alcohols can be reactants.

24:08.360 --> 24:12.680
The difference in the utility of these chemical cousins lies in their most obvious difference,

24:12.680 --> 24:15.680
the presence of an acidic hydrogen.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.640
Recall from earlier that I mentioned the most simple aliphatic alcohols have a pKa of about

24:19.640 --> 24:22.880
16, which makes them very weakly acidic.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.380
But acidic nonetheless.

24:24.380 --> 24:29.060
So in the presence of a suitably basic environment, alcohols can be deprotonated to form their

24:29.060 --> 24:31.940
conjugate bases, called alkoxides.

24:31.940 --> 24:35.740
So let's look at an example of the formation of an alkoxide.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.300
Here's an alcohol that we've already discussed, t-butanol.

24:38.300 --> 24:44.940
Now this has a pKa of about 16, so when placed in the presence of a reagent like sodium hydride,

24:44.940 --> 24:49.980
which presents or reacts as a hydride, we have a reaction take place.

24:50.380 --> 24:56.900
It's a proton transfer, in which the hydride removes the proton from that t-butanol.

24:56.900 --> 25:02.620
This produces t-butoxide ion, sodium ions, and a little bit of molecular hydrogen.

25:02.620 --> 25:09.780
But the molecular hydrogen, remember, has a pKa of about 35 compared to 16 for my t-butyl

25:09.780 --> 25:11.300
alcohol.

25:11.300 --> 25:16.260
So this reaction is highly favored, and not only that, the hydrogen gas effervesces and

25:16.260 --> 25:18.060
escapes into the atmosphere.

25:18.060 --> 25:21.020
Once it's gone, clearly the reaction can never go back.

25:21.020 --> 25:27.420
So this is a very effective way to make t-butoxide ions.

25:27.420 --> 25:31.860
We can use these t-butoxide ions in something called a Williams and Ether synthesis, in

25:31.860 --> 25:36.740
which the alkoxide is reacted with an alkyl halide of low substitution, something like

25:36.740 --> 25:39.500
methyl chloride.

25:39.500 --> 25:44.900
In this case we expect the alkoxide will attack the electrophilic carbon here of the methyl

25:44.900 --> 25:48.340
chloride displacing the chloride leaving group.

25:48.340 --> 25:53.660
So it proceeds through this intermediate state, where one bond is forming and the other breaking,

25:53.660 --> 26:02.340
and concludes with the formation of t-butyl methyl ether and a halide ion byproduct.

26:02.340 --> 26:06.540
Now Williams and Ether synthesis are very useful, but they're not always useful.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.900
We have to consider the substitution of the R groups on the ether.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.940
This is best shown by example.

26:11.940 --> 26:17.180
So here are three different ethers that we might want to make, di-t-butyl ether, t-butyl

26:17.180 --> 26:20.340
methyl ether, and ethyl methyl ether.

26:20.340 --> 26:26.220
So let's ask ourselves if we could form each one of these using a Williams and Ether synthesis.

26:26.220 --> 26:28.660
Let's start with di-t-butyl ether.

26:28.660 --> 26:32.320
There's only one combination of alcohol and alkyl halide which would lead to this particular

26:32.320 --> 26:39.740
ether, and because we're stuck using a tertiary substrate in what would be an SN2 reaction,

26:39.740 --> 26:41.580
this can't be done.

26:41.580 --> 26:46.620
So Williamson doesn't solve our problem of forming di-t-butyl ethers.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.620
What about t-butyl methyl ethers?

26:48.620 --> 26:52.860
Well, we can certainly accomplish it, and you know that I can because you've seen it

26:52.860 --> 26:58.820
in the previous slide, using methyl chloride, because methyl chloride is completely unsubstituted

26:58.820 --> 27:05.420
and therefore the back side of the carbon-chlorine bond is available for nucleophilic attack.

27:05.420 --> 27:11.140
But what about turning the tables and trying to use methyl alcohol and t-butyl chloride?

27:11.140 --> 27:16.060
Well, in theory this sounds good, but remember we have a tertiary substrate now in an SN2

27:16.060 --> 27:20.020
reaction, so this is going to be more of an elimination reaction setup and is not likely

27:20.020 --> 27:23.660
to form the ether that we want.

27:23.660 --> 27:29.180
Similar analysis for ethyl methyl ether leads to the conclusion that we could use ethanol

27:29.340 --> 27:36.940
and methyl chloride, which is a methyl substrate, or we could use methanol and ethyl chloride,

27:36.940 --> 27:40.500
because this involves a primary substrate.

27:40.500 --> 27:44.580
So as you can see, there are situations in which the Williamson ether synthesis is completely

27:44.580 --> 27:50.340
useless to us, situations in which it's useful to us as long as synthetic design is properly

27:50.340 --> 27:54.900
conducted, and others in which there are many different ways to make the same product using

27:54.900 --> 27:56.140
different reagents.

27:56.780 --> 28:01.340
But remember, alcohols are amphoteric, meaning they can also accept the proton to become their

28:01.340 --> 28:03.340
conjugate acid.

28:03.340 --> 28:09.660
So let's take a moment and think instead about that protonated oxonium ion.

28:09.660 --> 28:14.420
Protonation of an alcohol under various acidic conditions changes what would be a poor hydroxide

28:14.420 --> 28:19.300
leaving group into a much more stable water leaving group.

28:19.300 --> 28:24.300
That's right, what was the nucleophile and basic solution is instead the electrophilic

28:24.300 --> 28:28.380
substrate under acidic conditions.

28:28.380 --> 28:31.820
This is, in fact, what Cordus had unwittingly accomplished.

28:31.820 --> 28:36.900
By mixing ethanol with sulfuric acid, he created a situation in which a portion of the ethanol

28:36.900 --> 28:42.100
was protonated, and the remaining neutral alcohol molecules then attacked the oxonium

28:42.100 --> 28:47.060
ions, creating the diethyl ether he observed.

28:47.060 --> 28:52.220
Now because this reaction wasn't really optimized for SN1 or SN2, it's likely that he unwittingly

28:52.220 --> 28:57.060
produced a fair amount of ethylene as well, because this is the elimination product obtained

28:57.060 --> 29:00.220
when the dehydration of ethanol takes place.

29:00.220 --> 29:04.500
But in defensive Cordus, Christingold's work, which elucidated those mechanisms, was still

29:04.500 --> 29:10.020
about four centuries away from being performed, so I think we can forgive him for his suboptimal

29:10.020 --> 29:12.540
synthetic design.

29:12.540 --> 29:18.940
Nonetheless, alcohols in acidic solution are prone to substitution and elimination because

29:18.940 --> 29:23.460
of the stability of the water group which leaves oxonium ions.

29:23.460 --> 29:28.540
So alcohol functional groups can be turned into good substrates for substitution by altering

29:28.540 --> 29:32.660
the hydroxyl group to make it a better leaving group.

29:32.660 --> 29:37.460
Cordus used sulfuric acid to produce oxonium in which water is a leaving group, but many

29:37.460 --> 29:41.540
other strategies exist.

29:41.540 --> 29:47.820
For example, alcohols can be converted into chlorides using a reagent called thionylchloride.

29:47.820 --> 29:52.380
The thionylchloride is first attacked by the alcohol, producing an activated alcohol species

29:52.380 --> 29:54.940
known as a sulfonate ester.

29:54.940 --> 29:57.260
There's also a chloride ion made in this process.

29:57.260 --> 30:01.420
Now, the new leaving group is more stable than chloride ion, which can now attack the

30:01.420 --> 30:07.940
electrophilic center from the backside substituting it.

30:07.940 --> 30:12.260
Similar strategy can be used to brominate alcohols using phosphorus tribromide.

30:12.260 --> 30:17.220
This reagent produces a phosphonate ester and a bromide ion.

30:17.300 --> 30:21.180
The combination of alcohols with a reagent called tosylchloride also produces a better

30:21.180 --> 30:23.860
leaving group called a tosylate.

30:23.860 --> 30:28.220
And this strategy is used frequently to activate primary and secondary alcohols for use in

30:28.220 --> 30:32.180
SN2 reactions.

30:32.180 --> 30:36.100
So let's finish up the day by taking a look at our sucralose synthesis again.

30:36.100 --> 30:39.820
You'll recall that earlier we took a look at sucrose and asked ourselves how can we

30:39.820 --> 30:41.300
convert this into sucralose.

30:41.300 --> 30:45.220
And we concluded that we had to use an SN2 reaction and today we're going to finish

30:45.220 --> 30:51.220
that discussion by choosing the SN2 reaction reagents to make it happen.

30:51.220 --> 30:54.740
Now the way that this is done industrially is we first have to get rid of all these other

30:54.740 --> 31:01.500
hydroxyl groups here that we don't want reacting when we introduce the substitution reaction.

31:01.500 --> 31:05.700
This is done by placing something called an acetyl ester or an acetate group over the

31:05.700 --> 31:06.700
alcohols.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.620
We basically have masked them with a protecting group.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.020
Next, we run our reaction.

31:12.020 --> 31:16.620
In our case, we're going to use thionyl chloride followed by hydrochloric acid to quench the

31:16.620 --> 31:17.620
reaction.

31:17.620 --> 31:22.380
And when this is done, I'm going to substitute both of my primary alcohols for chlorines

31:22.380 --> 31:29.900
and I'm also going to substitute my secondary with inversion because I'm running SN2.

31:29.900 --> 31:33.940
The final step of my process, I'm going to remove the protecting groups that I placed

31:33.940 --> 31:36.780
on to mask the other hydroxyls.

31:36.780 --> 31:39.380
After doing that, I've arrived at the product.

31:39.380 --> 31:45.740
And this is actually how sucralose is produced industrially today for consumption.

31:45.740 --> 31:49.580
So let's take a few moments and summarize what we've covered today.

31:49.580 --> 31:54.660
We took a look at the atomic structure and bonding behavior of oxygen, how its electron

31:54.660 --> 31:59.140
configuration makes it most stable when it has two bonds, either as a pair of single

31:59.140 --> 32:03.300
bonds or as a double bond.

32:03.300 --> 32:08.580
We focused on the oxygen atom in sp3 hybridization states in which it has two lone pairs and

32:08.580 --> 32:14.260
two sigma bonds and how it leads to three possibilities, either two bonded hydrogens

32:14.260 --> 32:20.580
producing water, one alkyl group and one hydrogen producing an alcohol, or two bonded alkyl

32:20.580 --> 32:24.120
groups creating an ether.

32:24.120 --> 32:28.260
We discussed how alcohol groups have that special designation of functional group in

32:28.260 --> 32:33.740
IUPAC nomenclature and how their less reactive ether cousins don't enjoy the same distinction,

32:33.740 --> 32:40.820
instead being named as alkanes having alkoxy substituents.

32:40.820 --> 32:45.100
We covered techniques for synthesizing alcohols and ethers, including acid-catalyzed addition

32:45.100 --> 32:50.020
which results in Markovnikov products, but which are prone to rearrangement.

32:50.020 --> 32:53.980
We looked at how Hoffman and Sands solved the rearrangement problem with oxymercuration

32:53.980 --> 32:56.700
and demercuration.

32:56.700 --> 33:02.500
We also considered how one might make an anti-Markovnikov alcohol or ether product from alkenes

33:02.780 --> 33:07.860
using hydroboration and oxidation as the pathway.

33:07.860 --> 33:12.220
We took a look at the reactivity of alcohols and how their amphoteric nature makes them

33:12.220 --> 33:17.740
prone to act as electrophiles or substrates in acidic media, but as nucleophiles in extremely

33:17.740 --> 33:19.420
basic environments.

33:19.420 --> 33:24.180
Finally, we investigated a few methods of activating alcohols by converting their hydroxyl

33:24.180 --> 33:27.260
groups into more reactive leaving groups.

33:27.340 --> 33:33.380
Specifically, we looked at sulfonate esters, phosphonate esters, and tosylates.

33:33.380 --> 33:37.220
We saw specifically how sulfonate esters are employed in the synthesis of the sugar

33:37.220 --> 33:40.780
substitute sucralose.

33:40.780 --> 33:45.300
So there's no denying that alcohols and ethers are versatile solvents and reagents, but there's

33:45.300 --> 33:49.140
much more to the remarkable role of oxygen in organic synthesis.

33:49.140 --> 33:54.460
We'll cover even more of it next time, including a look at the role of oxygen-containing compounds

33:54.540 --> 33:58.940
and their chemistry in the aftermath of a night of enjoying a few cold beers.

33:58.940 --> 34:00.100
I'll see you then.
