00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
The field of industrial refrigeration has had obvious impacts on global economies, health,

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,200
and so much more.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,680
Just think about how many times in the past week you've reached for a medicine or a meal

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,240
which was not freshly prepared for you.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,800
The need to cool materials as a means of preserving them has been commonplace since

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,760
the beginning of recorded history.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,320
But for most of that recorded history, the cooling of foodstuffs was accomplished by transporting

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,980
ice and snow from higher elevations or by digging of cellars or other rudimentary methods.

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,360
In 1826, American Frederick Tudor founded a company shipping ice from the cold pond

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:57,160
waters of Massachusetts to regions as far away as the Caribbean, Europe, and even India.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,720
So high was the demand for this product in the 1800s and so lucrative was Tudor's enterprise

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,000
that he was famously able to ride out one additional business failure after another,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,160
relying on his sole thriving company to become the world's first and probably only ice magnate.

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,200
But transportation of ice isn't the oldest recorded method of cooling foodstuffs.

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,560
The people of India had discovered centuries before Tudor that the contents of clay pots

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,080
could be cooled by allowing the water to permeate into the clay of the containers and then placing

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,760
those containers outside to allow the water to evaporate from their surfaces.

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,160
You see, evaporation of a liquid means its conversion from the liquid state to the vapor

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:47,160
state and this process requires that heat be absorbed by that evaporating material.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,960
And the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, leads us to the conclusion that

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,760
any heat absorbed by evaporating material must be removed from the solid material left behind.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,440
So as water evaporates from the pots, the pots themselves are cooled.

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,680
This method of refrigeration is known as evaporative cooling.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,240
As you might expect, effective evaporative cooling requires that quite a bit of material

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,840
be converted from the liquid to the vapor state.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,240
And in the technique I just described to you, the coolant, which is water, vaporizes and

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
then is lost to the atmosphere.

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,240
If you want to cool again or any further, you have to get more liquid water and repeat

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
the process.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,880
But in 1835, an American inventor named Jacob Perkins patented a system in which vaporized

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,400
refrigerant was not allowed to escape, but was piped into a different region of an apparatus

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,600
where it was recondensed, allowing it to be pumped back into the cooling chamber and revaporized.

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,560
The vapor compression refrigeration system had been born.

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,440
Now, in 1835, Perkin had to use what was available to him as a refrigerant, highly flammable,

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,000
somewhat toxic, and rather expensive ether.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,920
Naturally, his invention was not viable competition for the ice shipping industry for these reasons.

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,160
Paying extra money for a refrigerator, which was somewhat likely to blow up, didn't seem

38
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,000
like a good investment to most people.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
But the engineers of this era didn't give up.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,440
And over the next century, experimentation with different refrigerants and compression

41
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,120
systems continued.

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,920
Still, none could provide safe, cost-effective, reliable cooling the way that imported ice

43
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,320
could.

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,680
But near the end of the 19th century, this changed with the introduction of a new class

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,800
of refrigerants called alkylhalides.

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,960
As the name implies, alkylhalides can be thought of as alkanes, in which one or more of the

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,400
hydrogen atoms has been replaced with a halogen.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,040
This is from column 7 of the periodic table containing fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
iodine.

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,400
Now, we've already seen ways in which a halogen can be introduced to a carbon-containing

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,000
scaffold via radical halogenation.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,880
And we've even performed an analysis on the chiral center of one of these compounds in

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,240
the form of Freon 151.

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:18,800
Today, we're going to see exactly why anyone would want to create such a compound.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,640
As you just saw, we commonly refer to simple alkylhalides as alkylfluorides, chlorides,

56
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,040
bromides, or iodides, depending on which halogen is attached.

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
Do not, however, let this fool you into thinking that the halogens are ionized as they are

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,560
in inorganic materials, like sodium chloride, for example, and table salt.

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,440
These are, in fact, covalently bonded to the carbon atom.

60
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,680
Now, in addition to classifying alkylhalides by which halogen is attached, organic chemists

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,200
frequently classify alkylhalides based upon the substitution of the carbon bearing the

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,440
halogen.

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,520
We call this atom the alpha carbon.

64
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,960
Now, if there are no other carbons attached to this alpha carbon, we call the compound

65
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,240
a methylhalide.

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,280
One alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon is a primary alkylhalide.

67
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,120
Two attached groups is a secondary, and three would be called a tertiary alkylhalide.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Now, when the exact identity of an alkyl group is not of consequence, we sometimes simply

69
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,880
use the abbreviation R to indicate a generic alkyl group is present.

70
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,240
So, the molecule commonly called propylchloride would be considered a primary alkylhalide

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,400
because of its single R group.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,080
Next is isopropylchloride, which has two R groups attached to the carbon bearing the

73
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
chlorine.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,360
So, this would be an example of a secondary alkylhalide.

75
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,480
And finally, here's a structure of the simplest tertiary alkylhalide, t-butylchloride.

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, from an IUPAC naming perspective, halogens are treated exactly as any alkyl substituent

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
would be, using the prefixes fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo to define them.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So, using the IUPAC naming convention, propylchloride becomes one chloropropane.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,520
Isopropylchloride becomes two chloropropane.

80
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,680
Antibutylchloride will be two chloro, two methylpropane.

81
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,360
Now halogens are much larger and more electronegative than hydrogen, and their presence on the molecule

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,400
has two important effects.

83
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,040
The first is related to the size of the halogen atoms.

84
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,560
The size of the halogen atoms has a profound effect on the boiling point of whichever methylhalide

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm dealing with.

86
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,640
So, here I've drawn for you some structures for all of the common methylhalides that we'll

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,440
encounter in this course.

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,480
I've also used methane here as a reference.

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,040
So, this is CH4.

90
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,640
But we can attach a fluorine in place of one hydrogen to create methylfluoride, a chlorine

91
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,720
to create methylchloride, etc.

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,280
And when we take a look at the boiling points of these compounds, there's a very clear and

93
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,920
obvious trend.

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,720
And that is that the larger the attached halogen atom is, the higher the boiling point of the

95
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,960
associated methylhalide will be.

96
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,760
And the reason for this is easier to see if I change these models from this ball and stick

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,040
format to what we call a space-filling model.

98
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,760
And the space-filling model is fairly clear to see that the electron cloud around methyliodide

99
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,160
is much larger than that around methylbromide, which is larger than chloride, etc., all the

100
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,960
way down to methane.

101
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,520
So, we're dealing with a situation where the polarizability increases as we add larger

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,960
and larger halides, causing their boiling points to increase as well as a result of stronger

103
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,480
dispersion forces.

104
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,520
Now let's take a look at another property of these alkylhalides, and that is the polarity

105
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,800
of the bond.

106
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,840
Now we know that halogens are more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen, so we expect that

107
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,840
a bond dipole will exist with some negative charge over here near the halogen and a bit

108
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
of positive charge on the associated alpha carbon.

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,320
But when we survey the bond dipoles of these common methylhalides, what we notice is that

110
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,520
fluorine actually has a slightly less polar bond with carbon than does chlorine.

111
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,640
Now, what's the reason for this?

112
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Right?

113
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,960
Didn't I just tell you not too long ago that fluorine is the most electronegative element

114
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
of all?

115
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,600
Well, the reason that the bond polarities are so similar among these alkylhalides is because

116
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,840
bond dipoles are also a function of the distance between the two atoms.

117
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,080
So I've got to consider the length of these bonds, which is easier to see in the ball-and-stick

118
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
model.

119
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,880
So even though fluorine is my most electronegative element of the bunch, it actually has the

120
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,840
shortest bond of any of the methylhalides.

121
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,000
And the consequence of these bond lengths is that they counteract that electronegativity

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,480
difference just a bit, and it's a fairly happy coincidence actually that most of these carbon-halogen

123
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,900
bonds have similar bond polarity, makes them a little bit more predictable from a reactivity

124
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
standpoint.

125
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,640
Okay, so we've already seen this slide in which we've compared the boiling points of

126
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,060
methylhalides as a function of how large the attached halogen is.

127
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,080
But it also stands to reason that with three additional positions on the alpha carbon,

128
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,080
that we should consider what happens when we add more than one halogen to our alkylhalide.

129
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,640
So let's do this using chlorine as an example.

130
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,840
Instead of just one chlorine as on methyl chloride, I can have two chlorines attached

131
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,200
to the alpha carbon in a compound called methylene chloride.

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,440
Three attached chlorines creates chloroform, and four creates a compound commonly known

133
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,000
as carbon tetrachloride.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,960
So if I look at the effect of adding additional chlorine atoms to my molecule as a function

135
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,240
of boiling points, it's very clear what's going on here.

136
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Methane itself has a very low boiling point of negative 161 degrees centigrade.

137
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,760
Adding a chlorine gives me methyl chloride rather with a boiling point of negative 24.

138
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,600
I get to methylene chloride with a boiling point of 40, and adding additional chlorines

139
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,480
continues to cause an increase in the boiling point to 61 and 77 degrees centigrade respectively,

140
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,520
all because of that extra electron cloud that's brought to each of these compounds by adding

141
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,040
additional chlorine atoms.

142
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,960
Now carbon tetrachloride is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure, and it was a popular

143
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,760
garment dry cleaning solvent in the late 1900s, but it's fallen out of favor recently

144
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,200
due to environmental and health concerns.

145
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,880
Perhaps ironically, its popular replacement, perchloroethylene, certainly does look very

146
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,400
similar, doesn't it?

147
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,320
Indeed, perchloroethylene is used in dry cleaning now, but it's currently under scrutiny for

148
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,080
its potential health and environmental impacts.

149
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,680
The first occurrence of alkyl halides in refrigeration was methyl chloride.

150
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,960
It was put into use near the beginning of the 20th century.

151
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,760
But methyl chloride's toxicity and flammability meant that a leaking refrigerator compressor

152
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
could easily spell disaster.

153
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,720
So methyl chloride shares many of the dangers that Perkins' original ether coolant did.

154
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,720
It would appear that alkyl halides just weren't destined for this application.

155
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,760
But near the end of the 1920s, a researcher by the name of Thomas Midgley Jr., working

156
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,440
for the Frigidaire Division of General Motors, devised a new alkyl halide compound.

157
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,960
Midgley's contribution was a method used to synthesize dichloro-difluoromethane.

158
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,280
And in doing so, he managed to create a compound with the useful physical properties he wanted,

159
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,240
but which was also not flammable or appreciably toxic.

160
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,560
Midgley and his contemporaries dubbed this class of refrigerants CFCs.

161
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,480
Lauded as a revolution in refrigeration technology, Midgley's creation became the gold standard

162
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,200
of refrigerants.

163
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,280
And before long, the era of mass-scale ice shipping was over, as thousands of refrigerators

164
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,360
worldwide were using and leaking these compounds into the atmosphere.

165
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,480
Now, we're all probably familiar with CFCs and the potentially calamitous environmental

166
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,480
effect they have in the upper atmosphere.

167
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,200
This may be one of chemistry's greatest ironies.

168
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,160
These compounds were designed to make life on the ground safer in the form of refrigerators

169
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,840
which won't poison or incinerate us.

170
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,280
But they ultimately began to produce a hole in the most vital protective layer of the

171
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,640
upper atmosphere, the Earth's ozone layer.

172
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,480
You see, Midgley's invention may have been much safer near the surface of the Earth,

173
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,880
but as those dense vapors from this propellant and refrigerant slowly migrate into the upper

174
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,560
atmosphere, they mingle with solar radiation and a naturally occurring layer of gas known

175
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,040
as ozone.

176
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,560
In the upper atmosphere, ozone forms and decomposes naturally in an equilibrium process,

177
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,400
absorbing dangerous UVC light from the sun as it does so.

178
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,520
What Midgley and his contemporaries couldn't possibly have predicted is that when freon

179
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,000
reaches this layer of the atmosphere and is exposed to high-energy UV radiation, one

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
of the carbon-chlorine bonds breaks.

181
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,920
This bond cleavage takes place in a homolytic process which is reminiscent of our radical

182
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,600
halogenation reaction like we might use to create freon.

183
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,320
But it divides the bonding electron pair between departing chlorine atoms and the carbon atoms

184
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,680
to which they're bonded.

185
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,760
Now the distinction here is that carbon-chlorine bonds are stronger than chlorine-chlorine

186
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,520
bonds, so higher-energy UV light is required.

187
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,360
So carbon-chlorine bonds which are regarded as generally stable at the Earth's surface

188
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,720
are anything but stable in the upper atmosphere where those high-energy photons are available.

189
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,680
And just like the photolysis of chlorine, this bond-breaking mechanism in freon creates

190
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,560
a very reactive radical chlorine atom with only seven valence electrons.

191
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,080
Now we see where we get into environmental trouble with CFCs.

192
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,000
We know from our free radical halogenation discussion just how reactive these chlorine

193
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,640
radicals can be.

194
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,560
But today it has a new partner to react with, ozone gas.

195
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,480
And chlorine radicals participate in the breaking down of ozone into molecular oxygen, producing

196
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,480
a molecule of chlorine monoxide.

197
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
And this chlorine monoxide then reacts with atomic oxygen which is also naturally present

198
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
in the stratosphere.

199
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,720
This produces another molecule of oxygen and very unfortunately regenerates that chlorine

200
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,480
atom.

201
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,680
So the chlorine radical generated by light-activated homolytic bond cleavage in the upper atmosphere

202
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,120
catalyzes the decomposition of protective ozone.

203
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,160
At the end of the process, the radical catalyst is reproduced and can move on to decompose

204
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,400
yet another molecule of ozone.

205
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,640
And in this way, a single chlorine radical can break down about 100,000 ozone molecules

206
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,400
before it's naturally consumed in a reaction with other atmospheric gases which are naturally

207
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,720
present.

208
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,240
This non-natural acceleration of ozone decomposition causes a decrease in overall ozone levels,

209
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,000
which allows potentially unsafe radiation to pass through the upper atmosphere reaching

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
the Earth's surface.

211
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,960
So the bad news here is that CFCs have disturbed the natural equilibrium between ozone production

212
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,420
and depletion in the stratosphere.

213
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:54,500
The good news is that equilibrium is a dynamic process and as those CFCs are naturally consumed,

214
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,980
the original equilibrium should re-establish itself, replenishing the ozone layer over

215
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,100
time.

216
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,580
Now there's little that we can do about the CFCs which have already been released into

217
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,900
the environment, but in order to avoid the negative effect of these chlorine radicals

218
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:16,220
on ozone, modern refrigerants have been designed without the use of carbon-chlorine bonds.

219
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,900
These new refrigerants are commonly called hydrofluorocarbons.

220
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,620
Now in a twist of fate, which we should probably expect by now, there are mounting concerns

221
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,540
today regarding the use of hydrofluorocarbons because of their ability to act as a greenhouse

222
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,860
gas, trapping reflected infrared light and contributing to global warming.

223
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,980
So after carcinogenic carbon tetrachloride, flammable and toxic methyl chloride, ozone

224
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,700
depleting CFCs and supergreen house hydrofluorocarbons, why do we keep turning to compounds like

225
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,460
alkyl halides for these applications?

226
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,060
The answer is, tune ability of alkyl halide volatility.

227
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,420
Their relative stability and our ability to methodically and predictably modify the boiling

228
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,100
points of these organic compounds has made them a very difficult option to abandon in

229
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,100
a number of applications, not the least of which is refrigeration.

230
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,820
Now, alkyl halides are also valued in synthetic organic chemistry for their balance of stability

231
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,180
and reactivity.

232
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,480
Many alkyl halides will keep in a bottle on a shelf for years, but can be converted into

233
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,800
other useful reagents in a matter of minutes or hours in the laboratory.

234
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,860
The key to this balance of stability and reactivity lies in the fact that carbon halogen bonds

235
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,380
are inherently fairly strong but polarized.

236
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,140
Average carbon fluorine and carbon chlorine bond enthalpies are actually similar to that

237
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,220
of carbon-carbon bonds.

238
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,340
Even carbon bromine bonds are quite strong.

239
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:59,260
This means that in the absence of other reagents, most alkyl halides have a long shelf life.

240
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,680
But unlike carbon-carbon bonds, carbon halogen bonds are polar.

241
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,200
The more electronegative halogen pulls those bonding electrons closer to itself, creating

242
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,320
that mild permanent charge separation across the bond.

243
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,240
And as you can see from our table, carbon fluorine, carbon chlorine, and carbon bromine

244
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,280
bonds are all very similar in polarity, since that less electronegative bromine has a longer

245
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,940
bond length, for example, and iodine's monstrous size isn't really enough to make up for its

246
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,320
lower electronegativity, making its bond just a little bit less polar than the others.

247
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,720
Now, more often than not, we find that chlorine and bromine strike just the right mix of bond

248
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,600
strength and polarity, so they're usually the go-to alkyl halides for the types of reactions

249
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,720
we'll soon consider.

250
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,140
Although so far we've examined some alkyl halides which contain many bonded halogen atoms,

251
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,720
exploited for their physical properties, synthetic organic chemists more frequently

252
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,280
like to use alkyl halides containing only one or just a few halogens so that subsequent

253
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,480
chemical reactions are more site-directed.

254
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,680
Furthermore, in the low pressure, high energy environment of the troposphere, radicals can

255
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,520
easily form, but they're far less common in the lab.

256
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,200
Organic chemists much more frequently rely on the tendency of halogens to accept the

257
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,360
full bonding pair in a process known as heterolytic bond cleavage.

258
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,280
Accepting both electrons from the bond produces a halide ion, which is more stable than a

259
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,620
halogen radical, and a positively charged hydrocarbon species also, which we call a

260
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,640
carbocation.

261
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,180
The tendency of this process to happen spontaneously in an alkyl halide is a result of two factors.

262
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:51,480
One is the stability of the halide ion, and the other the stability of the resulting carbocation.

263
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,100
So the key to predicting how a particular alkyl halide will react lies in being able

264
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:02,200
to understand the factors contributing to the stability of those two products.

265
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,720
Let's start by focusing on the halide ion.

266
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,640
Fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide.

267
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,140
They all have a single charge and a complete octet in their outermost energy level.

268
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,480
So they're all fairly stable from an octet rule perspective.

269
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,160
Yet there's a steady trend of increasing stability in this set of ions as we go from

270
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,080
smaller to larger.

271
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,980
So what's giving the iodide ion more stability than bromide, and bromide more than chloride?

272
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,540
The answer to the question comes in the form of a familiar topic, polarizability.

273
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,700
You'll recall that we discussed this concept when we talked about the volatility of these

274
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,180
compounds.

275
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,260
Iodine with five valence shells has a large electron cloud, which gives its electrons a

276
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,380
lot of freedom to move within that cloud.

277
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,700
This means that at any instant in time I might find a small region of greater electron density

278
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,680
here, and then later here, and then later yet over here.

279
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,280
So the negative charge of an iodide ion is distributed over a very large volume of its

280
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,920
electron cloud.

281
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,800
And remember that as a general rule, distributing charge means more stability.

282
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,040
Now let's take a look at bromide.

283
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,080
Bromide has a smaller cloud, but it still carries the same negative charge compared

284
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,720
to iodine.

285
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,420
So the negative charge of bromide is less distributed in a smaller volume of space,

286
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,620
making it less stable.

287
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,460
And this trend continues to chloride and ultimately fluoride, with negative charge density becoming

288
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,180
progressively more and more intense, resulting in less and less stable ions.

289
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:43,820
So in general, t-butyl iodide, more rapidly dissociates into a halide and carbocation,

290
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,280
and does t-butyl bromide, which does so faster than t-butyl chloride, which outpaces t-butyl

291
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,080
fluoride.

292
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,880
Next we have to take a look at the resulting carbocation and its substitution.

293
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,080
You see, carbocations contain a positively charged carbon atom, with only three bonds

294
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,040
to itself.

295
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,800
So the charged carbon has only six valence electrons, therefore it doesn't have a complete

296
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
octet.

297
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,620
Instead it has three coplanar sp2 hybridized orbitals bonded to either hydrogens or r-groups,

298
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,300
and a vacant p-orbital.

299
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:26,660
Now we observe in the lab that just like radicals and alkenes, the carbocations of higher substitution

300
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,980
are also more stable.

301
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,980
In other words, tertiary carbocations, having three r-groups like this t-butyl cation, form

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,040
more readily than do secondary carbocations like this isopropyl cation.

303
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Similarly, primary carbocations like ethyl cation are rarely ever seen in the laboratory.

304
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:55,360
And finally, methyl cations, which have no r-groups, are the least stable of all.

305
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,560
So what's the reason for this trend in carbocation stability?

306
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,480
Well the answer is a very familiar topic, hyperconjugation.

307
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,180
So to explain this, let me bring up the structure of a carbocation.

308
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:13,340
Remember carbocations have the three r-groups or hydrogens attached to them at 120 degree

309
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,500
angles within the plane, and the vacant p-orbital is oriented straight up and down.

310
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,300
So if one of the adjacent r-groups is in fact an alkyl group, there should be a carbon with

311
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,580
another bonding orbital adjacent to my empty p-orbital.

312
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,340
And it's the electron density from this bond to the adjacent carbon that can hop or slightly

313
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,200
share with that empty p-orbital.

314
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,960
And it's this crosstalk that distributes that charge and attenuates a little bit of

315
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,080
that positive charge right in the middle of the carbocation.

316
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,080
So if we enhance this effect by going from one to two to ultimately three r-groups,

317
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,760
we continually stabilize the charge as we add each group.

318
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,200
So the rate of formation of a carbocation by an alkyl halide has two important influencing

319
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
factors.

320
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,500
First it gets faster as the halogen gets larger, and second it gets faster as the carbocation

321
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,460
gets more substituted.

322
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,940
Now it should be emphasized here that this is a general rule and that there will be exceptions,

323
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,380
particularly when we start to consider the effect that solvents can have on reactions.

324
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,780
But for now this is a good general rule to get us started.

325
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,340
Now carbocations and species like them make regular appearances in many common reaction

326
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,620
mechanisms.

327
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,280
So it's worth shining the spotlight on them for a bit longer and showing you at least

328
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,480
one very unusual property of these species.

329
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,880
Their ability to rearrange one or more of their bonds to increase their stability.

330
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,480
Now we just finished discussing what a profound effect the substitution of a carbocation

331
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,480
can have on its stability, with tertiary cations being more stable than secondary and so on.

332
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,440
Now we're already gaining an understanding of molecules natural tendency to take on lower

333
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:06,460
energy forms through chemical processes, and carbocations are no exception to this rule.

334
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Carbocations sometimes can alter their own structure through a process known as rearrangement.

335
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,700
These rearrangements can take place in two ways, secondary meaning that they take place

336
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,540
after the formation of the carbocation, or concerted meaning that it takes place at the

337
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,140
same time that the carbocation forms.

338
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,960
They can take place by those two mechanisms, and they can also take place in two different

339
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,080
ways, one known as hydride shifts, and one known as alkyl shifts.

340
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
So let's take a look at some of those now.

341
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,680
The first type of shifts I'd like to show you is a secondary hydride shift.

342
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,520
So this will take place after the formation of a carbocation, and will involve, as you

343
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,120
can probably figure out, the movement of a hydrogen.

344
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,720
So I've drawn for you here a secondary carbocation, secondary because the carbon which holds

345
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,540
the charge is bonded to two R-groups, one I've actually designated as an R-group, and

346
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,460
the other I've expanded a bit so that you can see what's about to happen.

347
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,380
Now let's make a duplicate of this molecule here.

348
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,500
So I have a secondary carbocation, which is adjacent to a tertiary carbon, right?

349
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,140
One, two, and then three R-groups attached to the adjacent carbon.

350
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,380
So knowing that this is a tertiary carbon and this is a secondary carbon, this carbocation

351
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,720
would much rather have its charge on the adjacent carbon, and it's able to get it there using

352
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
something called a hydride shift.

353
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,120
Now in a hydride shift, this attached hydrogen and its bonding electrons will both migrate

354
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,160
to the adjacent carbon, and in doing so, it will relocate the positive charge to the

355
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,800
more substituted carbon.

356
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,640
So let's watch that happen.

357
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,040
The consequence of my hydride shift should be obvious.

358
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,900
I've made a tertiary carbocation.

359
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,580
So when we draw reactions as line angle structures, we might see a carbocation like this, but

360
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,620
when we continue to analyze the reaction, discover that the product seems to have formed

361
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,460
from a carbocation that looks like this.

362
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,540
And the reason for that is that a hydride shift has occurred to change my secondary

363
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,780
carbocation into a tertiary carbocation.

364
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,620
Another very commonly encountered carbocation rearrangement is known as a secondary alkyl

365
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,740
shift.

366
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,680
This has a tendency to occur in a secondary carbocation which has an adjacent quaternary

367
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
carbon.

368
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,960
You see now my adjacent carbon doesn't have a hydrogen at all, but rather has only r-groups

369
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,760
attached.

370
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,240
So this secondary carbocation, which would like to be tertiary, can't achieve that by

371
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,200
a hydride shift because there's just no hydrogen to shift.

372
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,320
And when this is the case, there's one other mechanism which can take place, and that is

373
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,860
that the entire alkyl group can shift, including its bonding electrons to the associated quaternary

374
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,460
carbon.

375
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,780
And when this process takes place, not only do I alter the location of the positive charge,

376
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,780
but I've actually retooled the entire carbon framework of this molecule.

377
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,460
Well, in this case a carbocation, but the resulting molecule.

378
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,860
So what this will look like in a line angle formula is if I have a carbocation which appears

379
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,400
to have a secondary carbocation adjacent to a quaternary carbon, I'll actually, usually,

380
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,040
see a product that looks as though it formed from this tertiary carbocation, and it's

381
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,440
the consequence of this alkyl shift.

382
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,080
The third type of secondary rearrangement that I'd like to talk about is called a ring

383
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,720
expansion.

384
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,400
And in a ring expansion, it's very similar to an alkyl shift.

385
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,440
The difference being that my carbocation is now adjacent to a strained ring in the form

386
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,620
of a cyclobutane.

387
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,940
And we know that cyclobutane contains a great deal of ring strain, or buyer strain.

388
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,980
And that it would rather be a five-membered ring than a four-membered ring.

389
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,180
And the presence of an adjacent carbocation gives it just that opportunity.

390
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,540
All we have to do is complete an alkyl shift, which sort of drags the rest of the ring along

391
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,620
with it.

392
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,740
And when that occurs, not only do I relocate the positive charge, but I also expand the

393
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,720
ring.

394
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,280
So I've turned my cyclobutane ring into a cyclopentane ring.

395
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,940
So again, when I'm working out a reaction and I see a carbocation which looks like this,

396
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,400
I should be thinking about products which might form from a carbocation which instead

397
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,480
looks like this.

398
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,520
Now, both hydride and alkyl shifts are not limited to secondary carbocations.

399
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,080
There's another class of these rearrangements, which we call concerted rearrangements, or

400
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,860
primary alkyl shifts.

401
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,980
And these take place in the example of isobutyl chloride.

402
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,780
If I were to suggest that the chloride ion can be formed from this molecule producing

403
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,860
a carbocation, you should be suspicious, because simply breaking the carbon-chlorine bond produces

404
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,060
a primary carbocation.

405
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,740
And we know that primary carbocation is almost never formed, because they're just not stable

406
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,100
enough.

407
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,500
But what if the adjacent hydrogen could shift not after the carbon-chlorine bond had broken,

408
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,440
but in concert with it?

409
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,200
We could bypass the primary carbocation completely, forming a tertiary carbocation through that

410
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,880
concerted rearrangement.

411
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,240
Of course, we can make the natural extension of this and suggest that a concerted alkyl

412
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,000
shift is possible, and molecules like 2, 2-dimethyl-1-chlorobutane as well.

413
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,240
All of these carbocation rearrangements can be either a supreme annoyance against which

414
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,980
we have to guard, or a clever trick used to devise ingenious pathways to desired products.

415
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,900
In either case, when they're possible, they have to be accounted for during synthetic

416
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,060
design.

417
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,900
Whether these processes are friend or foe, we'll see very soon that they can have a profound

418
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,460
impact on the outcome of a synthesis.

419
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,060
So let's review what we've discussed today.

420
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,820
We've defined alkyl halides, which can be thought of as hydrocarbons in which one or

421
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,760
more hydrogen atoms are replaced by a halogen substituent.

422
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,000
We examine both common and IUPAC systems for naming these compounds, and how halogens are

423
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,360
treated just like any other alkyl substituents in systematic nomenclature.

424
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,800
We talked about how the presence of larger, more polarizable halogen atoms decreases the

425
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,960
volatility of alkyl halides, allowing chemists like Midgeley to tune the physical properties

426
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,720
of refrigerants and advance the science of refrigeration, ultimately all but ending the

427
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,740
global ice shipping industry.

428
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,060
Finally we discussed a bit about the reactivity of alkyl halides, and we investigated how the

429
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,980
homolytic cleavage of carbon chlorine bonds adds a catalyst to the upper atmosphere of

430
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,980
the Earth, accelerating ozone depletion and threatening the environment.

431
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,500
And we also took a look at how carbon halogen bonds behave in solution in the lab, rather

432
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,660
than in the upper atmosphere.

433
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,620
How these alkyl halides are set up to undergo a heterolytic bond cleavage to produce halide

434
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,840
ions, and carbocation of varying stabilities depending on the size of the halide ion and

435
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,080
the substitution of the carbocation.

436
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,720
Finally we tackled the phenomenon of carbocation rearrangements.

437
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,520
We saw how these commonly formed reaction intermediates are most stable when their charged carbon

438
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,440
is more substituted.

439
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,800
And we even saw how they can alter their structures through hydride and alkyl shifts

440
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,100
and ring expansions in search of more stable states.

441
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,940
So now that we have a basic understanding of why and how alkyl halides can react, we're

442
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,140
ready to take it to the next level and start considering exactly what we can make from

443
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,540
this versatile class of starting materials by combining them with other reagents.

444
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,180
In the next few lectures we'll see how the breaking of a carbon halogen bond can be a

445
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,980
part of many different chemical reaction mechanisms, all of which can be used to produce a host

446
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,360
of useful compounds.

447
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,640
It's finally time to start designing a synthesis.

448
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,400
I'll see you next time.
