1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,780
For all the preaching that chemistry professors do about lab safety, it's amazing how many

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,480
advances have been made by those who ignored or broke those rules.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,360
As the powerful biological activity of certain small molecules has become more and more apparent,

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,880
one of the classic methods of analysis, tasting, has become an absolute taboo in the chemistry

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,880
lab.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,300
Yet, some great discoveries have been made by those who broke this very simple rule.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,580
Take the example of Ira Remsen, an American born researcher who had spent significant

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,800
time in Germany in the 1870s, studying some of the most advanced chemical techniques of

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
the day.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,520
Now, we're talking about the late 1870s, the same time as the boom of standard oil and

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,360
petroleum processing.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,320
So, when Remsen returned to America to found the chemistry department at Johns Hopkins

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,360
University, he chose to study products which could be extracted from coal tar, ostensibly

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,240
for use as fuels, building materials and other industrial applications.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,440
But Remsen's fate and the taste buds of his collaborator, Konstantin Fahlberg, took him

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,960
down a different path.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,440
One night, after a day in the lab, Fahlberg noticed that his hands were contaminated with

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,840
a sweet-tasting substance.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,600
It seemed that Remsen's laboratory had produced something remarkably sweet-tasting.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,120
A quick investigation revealed that the sweet substance is what we now call saccharin, the

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,480
age of the artificial sweetener had been born.

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,880
In the century and a half since Remsen's isolation of saccharin, artificial sweeteners

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,880
have proven to be a blessing and a curse to society.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,200
They clearly offer benefits in the reduction of calories in sweet foods and drinks.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
But at the same time, their overall effect on health is hotly debated and thoroughly

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,800
researched even today.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,720
These health concerns, along with free market competition, have led to the discovery and

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,160
development of a broad range of such sweeteners over time.

29
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,200
And early versions of these products, like saccharin and aspartame, look downright foreign

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,280
next to a molecule of sucrose, the molecule which they're all meant to mimic.

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,600
But newer options are more closely structurally related to sugar itself, like a molecule of

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
sucralose.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,880
Now, we're all familiar with the molecule sucrose, or at least what it does.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,480
We use it as a sweetener.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,560
Now, the artificial sweetener sucralose is actually synthesized directly from sucrose

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,760
as a starting material.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,240
In order to do this, I have to convert these three OH groups, or hydroxyl groups, into chloride

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,760
groups.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,360
Once this is done, I've constructed my sucralose and I'm ready to take it to market.

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,720
Now, sucralose costs a little bit more because it has to be synthesized in a lab from sucrose's

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
raw material.

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,300
So, it's going to be about 10 times as expensive to make.

43
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,800
But in addition to being non-caloric, it's also 600 times as sweet as sugar.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,440
Now, I'm not John Rockefeller, but I think I sense a good business opportunity here.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,640
So today, we're going to cross a very palpable threshold in the study of organic chemistry.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,080
Today, we're going to begin considering the fundamental mechanisms by which one compound

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,600
can become another.

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,600
We'll take the first few steps in our journey to understand exactly how it is at some of

49
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,040
the simpler molecules we've seen so far, and even more complex molecules like sucrose,

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,520
can be altered in a meaningful, targeted fashion using the knowledge that we've acquired since

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
the days of Woller's great accident.

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,680
Remember, he's the one that produced urea from inorganic substances giving birth to

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
the field of organic chemistry.

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Now, as complex and detailed as our understanding of the science of chemistry has become, it's

55
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,560
sometimes easy to forget that the vast majority of our understanding of the science is rooted

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,960
in just over 200 years of intense study by just a handful of highly influential thinkers.

57
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,400
In the days of Loisier, Woller, and even Markovnikov and Zetsev, organic chemistry consisted of

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,400
mainly blindly, albeit very hopefully, mixing reagents in an empirical search for order in

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,280
the products that resulted.

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
As we settled into the 1900s, however, things began to change.

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,400
That large body of observational knowledge accumulated over a century had reached a critical

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,480
tipping point, the point at which the sum of all former observations started to lead

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,120
us to predictive rules about reactions.

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,880
In short, observation had led to understanding, which in turn was slowly manifesting an ability

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,320
to predict and design reactions.

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,440
As we begin our investigation into some reaction pathways, we're going to revisit an old friend,

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,400
Christopher Kelk Engeld, who did so much more for the science than just participating

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
in developing the now familiar con Engeld-Prelog nomenclature convention.

69
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,760
It's also Engeld, who's often credited with first proposing some of the fundamental rules

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,520
governing organic reaction mechanisms, which are still in use today.

71
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,240
In 1933, Engeld and his collaborator, E. D. Hughes, wrote a letter to the vaunted scientific

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
journal Nature.

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,880
In this letter, they laid out their argument for a systematic and predictive approach to

74
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,960
understanding one of three basic reaction types in organic chemistry called substitution.

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,880
Shortly thereafter, Engeld made this sense of change very clear when in 1934 he wrote

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
the following of his own research.

77
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Quote,

78
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,440
The new work made it inescapably clear that the old order in organic chemistry was changing.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
The art of the subject was diminishing, its science increasing.

80
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,820
No longer could one just mix things, sophistication in physical chemistry was the base from which

81
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,920
all chemists, including the organic chemists, must start.

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
End quote.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,040
Powerful words.

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,840
Over the next three lectures, we're going to investigate the three general reaction types

85
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,960
most often encountered in organic chemistry.

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,420
Those are substitution, in which one substituent or functional group is exchanged for another

87
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:34,460
elimination, in which substituents or functional groups are lost in favor of pi bond formation,

88
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,580
and addition, in which pi bonds are sacrificed to form sigma bonds to new substituents or

89
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,500
functional groups.

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,740
So let's begin with substitution reactions and see if we can better understand how sucrose

91
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
is turned into sucralose.

92
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,420
Now, before we go quite that far, let's take a look at a simpler reaction than one might

93
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,500
use to convert sucrose to sucralose.

94
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,940
Here I have a hydroxide ion reacting with a methyl chloride molecule.

95
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:10,300
Now the product of this reaction is a chloride ion and methyl alcohol, also known as methanol.

96
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,140
The reaction if I were to draw as line angle formula would look something like this, in

97
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,420
which the chlorine substituent from my methyl chloride has been replaced by the hydroxyl

98
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,540
from the hydroxide reagent.

99
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,540
So this is a classic example of a very simple substitution reaction.

100
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,660
You'll notice that in my starting materials I have two different species, and in my products

101
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,580
I also have two different species.

102
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,900
So a substitution reaction is what we would call entropically neutral.

103
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,100
It's not really driven or fought against by randomness, it's sort of on the fence on

104
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
that.

105
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,460
So what's going to determine whether these reactions occur or not is not the entropy,

106
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,580
but the enthalpy, the strength of the bonds that are breaking and forming.

107
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,060
Now any substitution reaction will have the same basic cast of characters.

108
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,300
A nucleophile, a substrate, an electrophile and a leaving group.

109
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,980
So let's define each of these individually before we proceed.

110
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,940
Nucleophiles are defined as species which easily donate an electron pair to form a new

111
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,900
chemical bond with another nucleus.

112
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,540
Their name in fact literally means nucleus loving.

113
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,100
In our example, the hydroxide ion with a complement of three electron pairs in a full

114
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,580
negative charge is clearly the nucleophile.

115
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,340
It's poised to donate one of those pairs to a new bond and in doing so to relieve that

116
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,900
formal charge.

117
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:41,220
An electrophile is a nucleus which, unlike the nucleophile, is deficient in electrons

118
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,820
and is capable of receiving electrons from the nucleophile.

119
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,580
In our example, the bond dipole created by the presence of the chlorine substituent makes

120
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:57,980
the carbon of methylchloride electrophilic, or electron loving.

121
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,780
In contrast to nucleophiles, leaving groups are those groups which easily withdraw their

122
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:09,780
bonding electrons to become a separate stable species, like the chlorine from our methylchloride.

123
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,340
Recall from our lecture on alkyl halides that withdrawing its bonding electrons and becoming

124
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,300
a chloride ion is more acceptable to chlorine because its large electron cloud allows it

125
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,980
to distribute its charge over a larger volume.

126
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,820
Finally, we term the entire molecule undergoing substitution as the substrate.

127
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:37,100
In our case, methylchloride would be the substrate for our substitution reaction.

128
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,220
So let's think for just a moment about how a substitution might take place.

129
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,060
With a nucleophile and a leaving group both in the mix, there are three possible permutations

130
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,420
of such a reaction.

131
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,540
One in which the nucleophile first attacks, establishing its bond, then the leaving group

132
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,740
departs, breaking its bond.

133
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,460
There's one in which the nucleophile attacks as the leaving group departs, and one in which

134
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,900
the nucleophile attacks only after the leaving group has departed.

135
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,740
The first of these three situations is impossible, since it would require that a transition state

136
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,340
form in which the electrophilic carbon has more than eight valence electrons.

137
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,900
Many organic professors will joke that to draw such a pentavalent carbon is to immediately

138
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,740
fail their exam.

139
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,660
And there is a modicum of truth in that statement, and I have a reputation to uphold, so we're

140
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,060
not going to go there today.

141
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,740
But the other two are equally valid possibilities.

142
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,460
There's one in which simultaneous attack and departure maintains a balance of eight

143
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,180
electrons around the carbon throughout the transition, and the other in which initial

144
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,180
departure of the leaving group produces a carbocation intermediate with only six valence

145
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
electrons.

146
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,820
Non-ideal, yes, but a blatant violation of the octet rule like our pentavalent carbon?

147
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
No.

148
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,860
Now one of Ingalls' great contributions to the discipline of organic chemistry is his

149
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,620
1933 description of these two possible pathways by which a substitution can take place.

150
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,780
We call these reaction pathways SN1 and SN2.

151
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:22,260
This is for nucleophilic substitution, so SN2 stands for substitution, nucleophilic,

152
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:30,820
second order, and SN1 stands for substitution, nucleophilic, first order.

153
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,300
These names are based upon the reaction mechanism which Ingalls was able to infer from changes

154
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,340
that he made to reagent concentrations.

155
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,380
Any mechanism, no matter how complex, will have what's called a rate limiting step.

156
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,740
This is the slowest elementary step in the mechanism, and it defines the rate of the

157
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,780
reaction.

158
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,860
So just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so a reaction is only as fast

159
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,700
as its slowest step.

160
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,300
So the rate limiting step and all steps before it are affected to some extent by the concentration

161
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,580
of the reagents involved in those steps.

162
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,460
In other words, the rate of a reaction is proportional to the concentration of reagents

163
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,140
in its rate limiting step, but it's unaffected by concentrations of reagents which participate

164
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,260
after that.

165
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,140
In chemistry, we use a rate proportionality constant, written as the lower case letter

166
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:30,020
K, to produce what's known as a rate law for a given reaction.

167
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,620
So let's take a moment and look at our two generic substitution reactions and try to

168
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,940
get inside of Ingalls' head and see how he came up with his system.

169
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,460
One of the possibilities involved the nucleophile attacking the electrophilic carbon at the

170
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,780
same time that the leading group departs.

171
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,660
Now when this happens, the entire reaction takes place in a single concerted step.

172
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,100
Because there's only one step, clearly this must be the rate limiting step.

173
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,660
And that means that the rate law for this reaction is expected to contain both the concentration

174
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,700
of the nucleophile and the concentration of the substrate, meaning that altering the concentration

175
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,700
of either one should affect the reaction rate.

176
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,220
Because this rate order is two, it's got two different concentrations in it, Ingalls

177
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,460
call this the SN2 reaction.

178
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,540
Now if instead we go through our other possible reaction, one in which first a leaving group

179
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,460
departs from the substrate creating a carbocation intermediate, which is then attacked by the

180
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,420
nucleophile leading to product, we have a situation in which the slow initial step takes

181
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,660
place before the nucleophile ever reacts.

182
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,980
So the rate law for this particular reaction will not contain a factor for nucleophile

183
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,660
concentration.

184
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,140
It will depend only on the concentration of the substrate and because it depends on only

185
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,420
one reactant concentration, Ingalls dub this a first order reaction.

186
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,020
So Ingalls began the process of linking molecular structure with function and reactivity.

187
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,100
He observed that not only did two substitution pathways exist, but that the tendency of reactions

188
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,020
to proceed by one or the other was predictable based on correlated structural features in

189
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,340
the starting materials.

190
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,260
Ingalls sought to explain this in his famous 1933 letter to Nature, and this is what I'm

191
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,060
going to try to explain to you now.

192
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:38,060
The second order nucleophilic substitution pathway, SN2, is characterized by a bimolecular

193
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:44,700
reaction in which a nucleophile attacks and a leaving group departs simultaneously.

194
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,980
Because it's the nucleophile's attack which initiates the leaving group's departure,

195
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,140
the attack must take place from the opposite side of the substrate in order to break the

196
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,660
associated bond with the leaving group.

197
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,380
We call this orientation a backside attack.

198
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,940
This type of reaction is expected to take place in a single concerted step with only

199
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,300
one elementary step in the reaction, so we expect the rate to be affected equally by

200
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,060
the concentration of both starting materials.

201
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,820
The key to a reaction running by the SN2 mechanism lies primarily in two factors, strong reactive

202
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,620
nucleophiles like hydroxide and less substituted electrophiles like methyl chloride.

203
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,180
So let's consider each of these factors individually.

204
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,740
A strong nucleophile like hydroxide, it's inherently unstable, its high density of negative

205
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,340
charge around the oxygen atom is the source of that instability, and hydroxide is going

206
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,020
to seek to relieve it at its earliest chance.

207
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:52,500
Now, another crucial feature is the degree of substitution at the electrophile.

208
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,620
You see, hydroxide might be poised to attack, but it can't attack what it can't get to.

209
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,860
So let's take a look at the substrate from our SN2 reaction.

210
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,740
This is a molecule of methyl chloride, drawn in the usual format so that you can see the

211
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,460
chlorine atom on one side and the methyl group on the other.

212
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,860
But my hydroxide nucleophile has to attack from the opposing side.

213
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,340
So what I'm going to do now is turn my ball and stick model into a space filling model,

214
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,940
and then I'm going to turn that model so that you have the perspective of a nucleophile

215
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,780
that's approaching.

216
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,380
So I'm going to turn my substrate this way, and you can see clearly the electrophilic

217
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,460
carbon is wide open.

218
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,620
We can fit almost anything in there to react with it.

219
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,860
But what if I were going to use an analogous substrate, which was tertiary, like say T-butylchloride?

220
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,980
Let's bring that one up.

221
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,580
And again, I'll convert this into a space filling model, and I'm going to rotate it

222
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,980
in the same orientation.

223
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,620
So now you're the nucleophile looking at a T-butyl substrate and looking at a methyl

224
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,820
substrate.

225
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,180
I think it's very clear which one you're going to be able to get to easier.

226
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,780
So this is the reason why less substituted substrates find themselves in SN2 reactions.

227
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,620
They're simply more accessible to the nucleophile.

228
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,420
So we've seen what can happen when strong nucleophiles react with substrates of low

229
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,900
substitution in an SN2 reaction.

230
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,100
Now what if we reverse these conditions, and instead we attempt to react a weak nucleophile

231
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,020
with a highly substituted substrate?

232
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,940
Let's take a look at water reacting with T-butylchloride.

233
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,220
Now water is clearly a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide.

234
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,580
It has lone pairs of electrons on its oxygen, but it lacks the negative charge which made

235
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,580
the hydroxide attack with such urgency.

236
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,780
T-butylchloride has three methyl substituents on the electrophilic carbon, making attack

237
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,740
difficult even for a strong nucleophile.

238
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,540
So what's going to happen in this situation?

239
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,700
Well a patient nucleophile like water, with nowhere to attack, is going to simply wait,

240
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,660
biding its time until something more accessible and reactive presents itself.

241
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,300
In the case of T-butylchloride, this happens when the chloride ion departs on its own,

242
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,780
leaving behind a carbocation.

243
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,620
Now T-butylchloride is a distinctively more attractive substrate for two reasons.

244
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,220
First, the electrophilic carbon now has only six valence electrons and a full positive charge.

245
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:31,220
Second, its new planar arrangement of substituents means that it's much more accessible to nucleophiles.

246
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:38,100
So this cation is practically begging to be attacked by even the weakest of nucleophiles.

247
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,900
Water will oblige in short order, attacking the carbocation and completing the reaction,

248
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:51,740
producing a protonated alcohol which quickly deprotonates to form a neutral molecule.

249
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,740
So in this case, it's the formation of a carbocation which is the first and rate limiting

250
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,020
of two steps in the reaction process.

251
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,620
Because the nucleophilic attack happens after the slow formation of the carbocation, the

252
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,500
nucleophiles concentration no longer affects the rate of this reaction.

253
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,220
Now remember that SN2 reactions take place in one concerted step, requiring that the

254
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,180
nucleophile attack the carbon bearing the leaving group and only that specific carbon.

255
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,140
But if we've arrived at our first example of carbocation intermediates, so we have to

256
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,380
consider the possibility that rearrangements, like those we discussed in our alkyl halide

257
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,980
lecture, might occur.

258
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,260
Take the example of 2-chloro-3-methylbutane reacting with water.

259
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,660
Just as before, a chloride ion will depart from the molecule, creating a secondary carbocation.

260
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,780
But in this example, the resulting carbocation will have that special recipe of a secondary

261
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,340
carbocation adjacent to a tertiary carbon.

262
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,260
So before a nucleophile attacks, the carbocation can rearrange by hydride shift to form a tertiary

263
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,740
alcohol ultimate.

264
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,180
Instead of that secondary alcohol that we may have initially predicted, the analogous

265
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,540
reaction with 3-chloro-2-2-dimethylbutane would proceed with a secondary methyl shift,

266
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,380
also producing a tertiary alcohol, but this time with a different connectivity of carbon

267
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,180
atoms altogether.

268
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,340
Alkyl shifts can also affect the product in cyclic substrates, such as 1-1-chloroethyl

269
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,940
2-methylcyclobutane.

270
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,060
I know that's a mouthful, but it's a very simple structure.

271
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,060
But remember that the Bayer ring strain theory tells us that these 3 and 4-membered rings

272
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,860
in particular are less stable than 5 and 6.

273
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,060
So in this case, the carbocation can form adjacent to the strain ring, and the ring

274
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,420
can then expand in a sort of alkyl shift, which leads to a product with 5-membered ring

275
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,900
instead of 4.

276
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,740
Now you've no doubt noticed that our reaction examples today all involved conversion of

277
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,740
one tetrahedral carbon center into a different one.

278
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,780
So this leads us to our final set of reactions for the day, substitution reactions involving

279
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,780
chiral substrates.

280
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,700
Now you'll recall that SN2 reactions have to take place by the backside attack, but

281
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,980
SN1 reactions produce a planar carbocation intermediate which can be attacked from either

282
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,740
side with equal efficiency.

283
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,860
This leads to a difference in product composition from a stereochemical standpoint.

284
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Now if we were to react a chiral substrate by SN2, for example, enantiopur R2-chlorobutane,

285
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,860
we can expect an enantiopur product to form.

286
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,180
The identity of the substrate has not only changed, but the stereochemistry has been

287
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,540
inverted as a consequence of backside attack.

288
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,580
So this reaction would produce S2-butanol.

289
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,180
In contrast, let's consider the SN1 reaction between water and R2-chlorobutane.

290
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,380
In this case, our substrate must first convert to a carbocation, which can then be attacked

291
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,020
by the nucleophile from either side.

292
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,940
This leads to what we call a racemic mixture of 2-butanol, in other words, a 50-50 composition

293
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,020
of both R and S enantiomers.

294
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,700
So we've broken our two substitution mechanisms down to their elementary steps.

295
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,820
Of course, for SN2 this means a bimolecular reaction in a single concerted step, but for

296
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,060
SN1 there's a unimolecular rate-limiting dissociation of the substrate at the beginning

297
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,540
of a two-step mechanism.

298
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,660
An Engel proved long ago that the concentration of the nucleophile affects the rate of SN2,

299
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,220
but not of SN1.

300
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,860
This is a consequence of its absence in the rate-limiting step of the SN1 pathway.

301
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,740
But reagent concentration is not the only way to alter the rate of an SN1 or SN2 reaction

302
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,420
to our benefit.

303
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:05,060
See, because the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms differ in the chemistry of their rate-limiting steps,

304
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,340
it stands to reason their rates can be affected differently by changes in the surrounding chemical

305
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,340
environment.

306
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,520
Usually, this environment is a liquid solvent in which they're dissolved.

307
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,740
So let's take a look at a few substitution reactions and ask ourselves how choosing a

308
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,060
different solvent might change the rate of that reaction.

309
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:32,300
We'll start with an SN2, a nice concerted mechanism taking place in a single step.

310
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,700
Recall that SN2 reactions are characterized by the presence of strong nucleophiles, which

311
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,620
tend to have high negative charge density, species like hydroxide.

312
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,620
Now let's consider the effect of running an SN2 reaction between methyl chloride and

313
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,660
hydroxide starting materials.

314
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:56,820
The starting material includes the hydroxide with a full, localized negative charge.

315
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,740
The reaction then proceeds through a transition state in which that negative charge is spread

316
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,700
out across the nucleophile and the leaving group.

317
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,580
So the transition state has less charge density.

318
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,780
Of course, there are other factors making it less stable in the starting materials like

319
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,740
the two bonds that are in the process of breaking and forming.

320
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,700
But the fact remains that the activation energy of the reaction is simply the difference between

321
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,740
the starting and final states.

322
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,220
So anything we can do to close that energy gap will speed up the reaction.

323
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,460
Anything we can do to destabilize that starting material more than the intermediate is going

324
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,820
to result in acceleration.

325
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,980
One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is to choose the right solvent.

326
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,780
As you might imagine, solvents of low polarity like the hydrocarbon hexane don't interact

327
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,980
well with charged nucleophiles, leaving them highly reactive.

328
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,540
And therefore, these nucleophiles are more likely to attack.

329
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,020
And the problem which sometimes arises in this situation is that charged nucleophiles

330
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:06,020
simply aren't soluble at all in nonpolar solvents, so we have to choose very carefully.

331
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:14,180
We sometimes classify solvents based not only on their polarity, but also on their acidity.

332
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:23,100
We call solvents like acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and acetonitrile, polar A-protic solvents,

333
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,100
because they lack any real acidic hydrogens.

334
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:33,620
Conversely, solvents like isopropanol, ethanol, and water are called polar protic.

335
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,460
See all of these solvents have a strong molecular dipole, but the real difference is the orientation

336
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,860
of that dipole.

337
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,140
You'll notice that all the A-protic solvents have a dipole oriented with the negative end

338
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,900
near the surface of the molecule, while all the protic solvents have a dipole oriented

339
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,820
just the opposite, with the positive charge density at the periphery of the solvent molecule,

340
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,620
and the negative end buried deep within.

341
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,500
So the interaction between solvent dipoles and the nucleophile in our example reaction

342
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,220
is greater in magnitude than that in the transition state, owing to the stronger charge of that

343
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,620
starting material.

344
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,500
If we use a polar protic solvent like isopropanol, the positive end of its dipole is readily

345
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,340
available to stabilize that charged nucleophile.

346
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,220
This lowers the energy of the starting material and increases the activation energy barrier,

347
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,860
slowing the reaction down.

348
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,020
But if we use a polar A-protic solvent like acetone for this reaction, the positive end

349
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,180
of the dipole is buried within the molecule of solvent and can't interact as well with

350
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,500
the nucleophile.

351
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,660
Instead, the nucleophile sort of sees more negative charge density at the surface of

352
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,760
the solvent molecules, and this is very destabilizing.

353
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,580
It raises the energy of the nucleophile and lowers the activation energy barrier, which

354
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,900
results in a faster reaction.

355
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,900
Now in the case of SN1 reactions, we tend to begin the rate limiting step with a neutral

356
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,860
substrate like t-butyl chloride, and this neutral substrate dissociates into two ions

357
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,460
in that rate limiting step.

358
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,900
So since this reaction involves the formation of both a cation and an anion, either protic

359
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,340
or A-protic solvents, that's usually not the big concern to us.

360
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,260
We could use either one.

361
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,540
But the overall polarity of the solvent is crucial, since stronger dipoles in the solvent

362
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:32,580
can produce more stabilizing interactions with the charged intermediates.

363
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:39,060
So while low polarity or polar A-protic solvents tend to accelerate SN2 reactions, polar solvents

364
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,420
in general tend to accelerate SN1 reactions.

365
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:49,220
This is a good general rule for prototypical substitution mechanisms I've shown you today.

366
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,740
But you should be aware that we'll see many exceptions to this rule as we continue our

367
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,580
course and the nature of these species becomes more complex.

368
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,100
I'll be pointing them out and explaining what makes these exceptions occur as we reach them.

369
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:10,060
So let's take a final look at the differences in the structures of sucrose and sucralose.

370
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:16,460
The question that we're going to ask today is, when we want to convert sucrose into sucralose,

371
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,780
do we need to use an SN1 reaction to complete the synthesis or an SN2 reaction to complete

372
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780
the synthesis?

373
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,260
Now, the actual reagents that we'll need to complete the synthesis will come in a later

374
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,820
lecture, so we'll be revisiting this synthesis at least one more time.

375
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,780
But for today, let's just take a look at sucrose and sucralose and the changes that we want

376
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,080
to make.

377
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,180
There are three hydroxyl groups on our sucrose molecule, which need to be altered into chlorine

378
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,460
groups.

379
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,300
But not only that, we have two of them on primary carbons and we have another one on

380
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,340
a secondary carbon.

381
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,160
So this one is attached to a primary, this one is attached to a primary, and this one

382
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,300
over here is attached to a secondary.

383
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,580
But another piece of interest here is that that secondary carbon is chiral.

384
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,420
And if you look closely, you notice that here I have inverted the stereochemistry, where

385
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,380
in this perspective formula my hydroxide is falling behind the plane of the monitor,

386
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,540
but in this depiction my new chloride group is coming out of the plane of the monitor.

387
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,100
So not only do I have to alter my two primary substrate locations and one secondary substrate

388
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,900
location, but I have to alter the secondary substrate location in such a way that it proceeds

389
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,540
with inversion.

390
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:43,340
Now all three of these are only congruent with an SN2 reaction.

391
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,800
So when the time comes, we're going to have to select reagents to complete our synthesis

392
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,860
by an SN2.

393
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,020
So let's sum up the work of Ingold and his contemporaries that we've covered in this

394
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
lecture.

395
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,820
We've defined nucleophilic substitution reactions as the reaction between a nucleophile and

396
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,700
a substrate to form a product and a leaving group.

397
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,060
We discussed how these reactions are usually entropically neutral and tend to be driven

398
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,220
by the enthalpies of the reactants and products.

399
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,600
We discussed how nucleophilic substitution mechanisms are divided into two classes based

400
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,900
upon the rate laws for each pathway.

401
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:30,180
SN2 for bimolecular reactions taking place in a single concerted step and SN1 for reactions

402
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,660
taking place in a sequence of steps beginning with the slow departure of a leaving group

403
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,380
from the substrate.

404
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,500
We took a look at the two most important factors influencing a substitution pathway.

405
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,500
How strong nucleophiles and low substitution substrates favor SN2?

406
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:55,020
While weak nucleophiles and highly substituted substrates favor the SN1.

407
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:01,500
We also took a look at the effect each pathway has on the retention of chirality in substrates.

408
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,860
Finally, we considered solvent selection for substitution reactions.

409
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,940
We looked at how the high negative charge density in strong nucleophiles makes SN2 reactions

410
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:20,180
tend to run best in low polarity solvents or polar aprotic solvents like acetone.

411
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,780
We then considered SN1 reactions and how their charged intermediates make them tend to run

412
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:32,900
poorly in low polarity solvents but usually run well in a very broad range of polar solvents.

413
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,140
We concerned ourselves today with some of the very ideal conditions of nucleophile strength

414
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,420
and substrate substitution to achieve an SN1 or SN2 reaction.

415
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,900
Next time we're going to consider what happens when the factors influencing these pathways

416
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:51,300
are in conflict with one another rather than conspiring to a specific substitution mechanism.

417
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,420
I'll see you then.
