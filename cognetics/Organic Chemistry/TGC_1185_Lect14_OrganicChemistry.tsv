0	19360	In 1540, a German botanist by the name of Valerius Cordus isolated a substance produced
19360	23360	when ethanol was mixed with sulfuric acid.
23360	29280	Uncertain of what he'd created, Cordus simply named his creation Sweet Oil of Vitriol after
29280	34360	the common name for sulfuric acid at the time, Oil of Vitriol.
34360	38640	In his time, Cordus had no way of knowing what a powerful and useful molecule he had
38640	42640	managed to create.
42640	49240	Three centuries later, on March 30, 1842, American physician Crawford Williamson Long
49240	55720	demonstrated the anesthetic effects of the very same molecule that Cordus had created.
55720	60600	In doing so, he effectively changed the practice of surgery forever.
60600	65760	Of course, I'm talking about ether, a compound with such a huge impact on the practice of
65760	72800	modern medicine that National Doctors' Day is marked on March 30 in the United States.
72800	79900	Today, ether has been replaced by safer alternatives in medicine, but it finds wide use as an industrial
79900	82680	solvent and in fuel blending.
82680	88400	More than just a useful medicine, ether is also an example of one of today's star compounds,
88400	93040	those containing oxygen.
93040	96960	We spend a great deal of time so far looking at the structures, properties and reactions
96960	101320	of just a small slice of the organic compound arsenal.
101320	106800	Specifically, we've investigated hydrocarbons, those compounds containing only hydrogen and
106800	114120	carbon, and alkyl halides, in which a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine heteroatom is
114120	117680	present in place of a hydrogen.
117680	123080	Oxygen's made a cameo as nucleophiles and substitution and as bases in elimination,
123080	130680	but oxygen-containing species have a much greater utility and versatility in organic chemistry.
130680	134880	Today we're going to take a quantum leap forward, introducing this heteroatom to the
134880	141440	mix in earnest, looking at examples of oxygen-containing functional groups which find use as reagents,
141440	146160	solvents, catalysts and everyday commercial products.
146160	152760	This atom is present in acids, bases, explosives, medicines and countless other relevant organic
152760	153760	compounds.
153760	160280	It's in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the foods we eat and so much more.
160280	164080	Clearly, oxygen deserves some attention.
164080	168760	So before we start to explore oxygen in the context of organic compounds, let's quickly
168760	173600	review its characteristics as an element.
173600	178640	Oxygen is element number 8 on the periodic table, so it has a ground state electron configuration
178640	184040	of 1s2, 2s2, 2p4.
184040	189040	Now this of course means that oxygen has a strong tendency to form two covalent bonds
189040	195360	to complete its octet, either two bonds in an sp3 hybridized state with bond angles of
195360	204720	approximately 109.5 degrees, or as a double bond in an sp2 hybridized state.
204720	212080	In either case the oxygen atom will have two lone pairs of electrons to complete its octet.
212080	217040	So far, the only heteroatoms that we've significantly explored are halogens, which tend to form
217040	220640	only one bond to complete their octet.
220640	225760	This means that for halogens, reacting is almost always requiring that the halogen be
225760	230800	removed from or added to a chemical scaffold.
230800	235920	But the two bonds that oxygen can form allow it to remain connected to an organic scaffold
235920	242400	by one bond as it reacts with the other, making its chemistry much richer and even more useful
242400	246240	than that of halogens.
246240	252920	So let's begin by considering compounds containing a single sp3 hybridized oxygen atom.
252920	258840	So what went on in that flask that fateful day in 1540 when Cordis mixed ethanol with
258840	260560	sulfuric acid?
260560	265160	Well, he converted one oxygen containing compound into another.
265160	271120	Specifically, he converted an alcohol into an ether.
271120	273680	So let's start our day off by considering alcohols.
274480	278400	I'm going to show you some common aliphatic alcohols, meaning those that only contain
278400	282320	saturated hydrocarbons as their scaffold.
282320	289240	We can start with the simplest of all, methanol, with the formula CH3OH.
289240	295440	One additional carbon gives us ethanol, with the formula C2H5OH.
295440	302480	And I can continue adding carbons to my scaffold, giving N-propanol and N-butanol as the next
302480	303800	two in line.
303800	309120	Now, it probably won't surprise you to know that the boiling points of these compounds
309120	312640	increase as I increase the number of carbons in the chain.
312640	316880	This is analogous to what we would see for alkanes, for example.
316880	321360	So as I add additional carbons to my alcohol, I increase its boiling point and therefore
321360	324200	give it a greater tendency to be a liquid.
324200	329360	Just as with alkanes, when we reach a certain critical number of carbons, in this case three
329880	332600	We can form structural isomers.
332600	336960	Now there are only two structural isomers of three carbon-containing compounds.
336960	340560	Those would be propanol and isopropanol.
340560	345200	So I'm going to show you instead the structural isomers of four carbon alcohols, because they
345200	348280	get a little more interesting at that point.
348280	352680	We've already learned about N-butanol, which has a four-carbon, linear chain with a hydroxyl
352680	354920	group attached.
354920	359960	But I can arrange these carbons in a different type of way to create a new structural isomer.
359960	365440	For example, I can create isobutanol by placing a branch in the chain near the other side
365440	369360	of the molecule away from the functional group.
369360	374760	If I instead branch that chain at a location adjacent to the functional group, I create
374760	380320	something called sec-butanol, which is short for secondary.
380320	387160	I can branch it even further and create tert-butanol, which of course is short for tertiary.
387160	391840	So all of these alcohols have exactly the same molecular formula, but clearly have different
391840	393760	arrangements of atoms.
393760	396920	And this has an effect on their boiling points as well.
396920	402080	Again, N-butanol has a primary carbon and a straight chain.
402080	406280	Isobutanol has a primary carbon bearing its hydroxyl on a branched chain.
406280	411100	Sec-butanol with a secondary on an otherwise straight chain and tert-butanol, which is as
411100	414240	branched as I can possibly get.
414240	419480	So knowing what we do about how branching affects the volatility of organic compounds,
419480	424040	we can predict, and we would be right, that the boiling point trend of these four isomers
424040	426360	of isobutanol is as follows.
426360	433720	T-butanol is the lowest, followed by sec-butanol, isobutanol, and finally, N-butanol having
433720	438840	the highest boiling point of all.
438840	443720	The IUPAC nomenclature of alcohols follows the usual system, keeping in mind that the
443720	447040	alcohol is treated as a functional group.
447040	452460	So for example, if I were going to name this compound, by IUPAC, I would first have to
452460	454440	identify the parent compound.
454440	456600	The parent hydrocarbon is here.
456600	462840	One, two, three, four carbons bearing the functional group.
462840	466040	So this is going to be a butanol molecule.
466040	469960	I have a single substituent in the form of a methyl group.
469960	474560	So all that's left now is to number my parent chain in such a way that my functional group
474560	477200	gets the lowest possible number.
477200	482560	So I have this numbering scheme available, and I have this numbering scheme here.
482560	488680	Naturally I'm going to choose the scheme which gives my hydroxyl group an address of one.
488680	495200	So I construct my name using these elements, and I get three methyl, one butanol.
495200	498360	Let's do another one.
498360	501840	Here's an alcohol that has a halogen as a substituent.
501840	507480	Again, I need to find my parent carbon chain which contains the hydroxyl bond.
507480	509080	Here it is.
509080	513120	Five carbons containing the bond to the OH group.
513120	517280	So this is going to be a pentanol molecule.
517280	522120	My substituent is a chlorine, so this is a chloro group.
522120	527440	And again, I will address my carbon chain starting with one end and giving the lowest
527440	529800	number to the functional group.
529800	535480	In this case that means putting a two on my alcohol group and a four on my chloro group
535480	540760	which gives me the name four chloro, two pentanol.
540760	544960	So now that we've taken a look at alcohols, let's switch gears a little bit and look at
544960	549120	ethers so that we can try to understand their differences in their properties and how they
549120	551720	are interconverted.
551720	556420	The simplest possible ether is dimethyl ether, and you should immediately notice what makes
556420	561880	it different from the alcohol examples in the previous slides, that the oxygen does not
561880	564680	contain a bond directly to hydrogen.
564680	570840	Instead, it's bonded to two different R groups, in this case both methyl.
570840	576200	So this has a formula of CH3OCH3.
576200	579880	I can extend one of those R groups to a longer chain and get what we would call ethyl methyl
579880	583400	ether, which has this formula.
583400	592320	And I could extend the other chain even further to get diethyl ether, which has this formula.
592320	595840	But those common names of ethers get unwieldy just like any other organic compound as they
595840	597240	get larger and larger.
597240	601960	So as usual, the IUPAC has stepped in with some nomenclature rules.
601960	606680	But in the case of ether, since there's no hydrogen attached directly to the oxygen,
606680	609240	we don't treat it as a functional group.
609240	614080	Instead, we treat the ether motif as what we would call an alkoxy group.
614080	616580	This is best shown by example.
616580	619160	So let's name this compound.
619160	624720	Remembering that I have an ether here because my oxygen is connected to two distinct R groups.
624720	628620	This is not going to be a functional group, but rather a substituent.
628620	635520	So the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule I have here is five carbons long.
635520	640440	And I have, in this case, a pentane, which contains two different substituents.
640440	647960	Those substituents are the chloro, shown here, and the ethoxy substituent, which constitutes
647960	649320	my ether.
650320	654960	But because it is a substituent and not a functional group, it no longer gets that
654960	657560	special priority in numbering.
657560	663360	So I would number my chain from the left-hand side to give the lower number two to the alphabetically
663360	665760	first chloro group.
665760	676160	So in this case, I'm going to call my compound two chloro for ethoxypentane.
676160	682040	Just for fun, let's do the diethyl ether that Cortis created back in the 1500s.
682040	686360	In this case, it may seem funny, but my parent chain is going to be relatively small compared
686360	688000	to the rest of the molecule.
688000	689000	Here it is.
689000	694480	Two carbons long is the longest possible continuous chain of carbon atoms that I can find.
694480	698800	And of course, the substituent would be the entire ethoxy group.
698800	703360	So we would name this, under IUPAC rules, ethoxyethane.
703360	707600	No address is needed in this case, because whether it's on one carbon of the ethane or
707600	711240	the other, that's always going to be my number one carbon.
711240	716080	And in cases like this, where there's no ambiguity, we frequently drop the address out of the
716080	718400	substituent's portion of the name.
718400	722440	Now another property that we should discuss is the hydrogen bonding characteristics of
722440	725480	alcohols and ethers.
725480	729600	Let's do this by looking first at the structure of alcohol.
729600	733760	Here's our molecule of ethanol, with which we're fairly familiar.
733760	738080	It has an OH bond, which should have a fairly strong dipole with a negative end near the
738080	742480	oxygen and a positive end near the hydrogen.
742480	746680	It also has a carbon-oxygen polar bond, which should have some positive charge density near
746680	752280	the carbon, which bears the hydroxyl, and again, some negative charge on the oxygen.
752280	757120	So overall, this particular molecule has a net molecular dipole.
758000	764000	Furthermore, when it is near another molecule of ethanol, it can form an extra type of intermolecular
764000	767640	interaction known as a hydrogen bond.
767640	774880	Whenever I have an OH, NH, or FH bond in a functional group, there's a potential that
774880	780080	the electronegative oxygen, fluorine, or nitrogen atom can share its lone pairs for
780080	787200	just a split second with the hydrogen from another molecule of the same type.
787200	791880	When this interaction takes place, it's fairly strong compared to a lot of other intermolecular
791880	794280	forces and so we give it a special name.
794280	799800	We call it hydrogen bonding, or H bonding, and it is this hydrogen bonding that can occur
799800	806600	between two different molecules of ethanol that give it such a high boiling point.
806600	811600	If instead we compare how ethers look, we see that ethers have polar bonds in the form
811600	816360	of two different carbon-oxygen bonds, one here, one here.
816360	819080	So there is a little bit of polarity to this molecule.
819080	822880	Now those dipoles are almost pointed opposite to one another, so they cancel out a great
822880	827540	deal, but what's even more important here is that there's no potential for hydrogen
827540	834320	bonding in ether, and that's because the oxygen contains the lone pairs necessary, but there's
834320	838900	no polar hydrogen like there is here in my ethanol molecule.
838900	844360	So ethers make great solvents for dissolving compounds like ethanol, but they don't adhere
844360	849800	well to one another, and this translates to a lower boiling point.
849800	854720	So here we have an ethane compared to a methyl ether and an ethanol boiling point, and you
854720	859800	can see clearly that hydrogen bonding interaction is enough to make up almost a hundred degrees
859800	862000	difference worth of boiling point here.
862000	866720	So this is a very important, very fundamental intermolecular force that we always have to
866720	868760	be mindful of.
868760	876160	To last property, let's talk about the acidity of alcohols and ethers.
876160	882400	Now the alcohol has this OH, which is a polar bond containing a hydrogen, so we expect it
882400	885360	to act as an acid, albeit a weak one.
885360	891400	To form an alkoxide conjugate base, we have a pKa of about 16.
891400	895600	So on the grand scheme of things, alcohols aren't terribly acidic, but they're certainly
895600	900360	much more acidic than, for example, alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, all of which we've looked
900360	903040	at so far.
903040	906840	But alcohols can also act as a base.
906840	912000	When they accept a proton at that group, they form a species known as an oxonium ion.
912000	918320	Now, oxonium ions have a lot of positive charge density right near an electronegative element,
918320	922360	so they're not very stable, and they tend to give up that proton very rapidly, giving
922360	926000	them a pKa of about negative 2.
926000	931360	So in this case, alcohols can act either as very weak acids, releasing a proton, or very
931360	933800	weak bases, accepting a proton.
933800	937400	And we call this property amphoterism.
937400	944120	So ethanol, like all aliphatic alcohols, is amphoteric.
944120	946080	But what about ethers?
946080	948200	Let's look at the structure of ether.
948200	952200	Remember, we have that electronegative oxygen there with lone pairs, so there's a potential
952200	954080	here for some acid-base chemistry.
954080	955640	But there's no acidic proton.
955640	960780	In fact, the most acidic proton on ether, in this case dimethyl ether, would be one
960780	965560	of the six protons that it has on the adjacent methyl groups, which would have a pKa of somewhere
965560	966960	around 50.
966960	973560	Now, from a practical perspective, when pKa's become this prohibitively large, we just say,
973560	976920	now this is not an acid at all.
976920	978960	But it can act as a base.
978960	984080	Just as the oxygen in alcohol can accept a proton, so can this oxygen in ether accept
984080	989700	a proton via one of the two lone pairs, creating a protonated ether which has a pKa of around
989700	992580	negative 3.5.
992580	996800	So in the case of ethers, we're not dealing with amphoterism, we're simply dealing with
996800	1001440	a very weakly basic organic compound.
1001440	1005360	Organic chemicals are used widely in organic chemistry, as both reagents and solvents.
1005360	1009120	And I'm sure that most of us are familiar with the means by which most of the world's
1009120	1014760	ethanol is prepared, fermentation of sugars by the bacterium Saccharomyces.
1014760	1017160	This is just a fancy name for yeast.
1017160	1020960	These little organic chemists are without equal when it comes to creating ethanol.
1020960	1025640	But what about other, more complex alcohols?
1025640	1030480	When larger, more complex alcohols are needed, we must often turn to the tools of organic
1030480	1032720	chemistry to create them.
1032720	1034600	There are many ways in which to do this.
1034600	1039520	In fact, we already saw how they can be produced by nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides
1039520	1043160	using hydroxide ions.
1043160	1048120	There are many, many more, there are far too many in fact, to survey them all in this course.
1048120	1052080	In fact, we're now just going to focus on how alcohols are produced using starting materials
1052080	1057720	with which we're already familiar, alkenes, and a mechanism that we already understand,
1057720	1060080	addition.
1060080	1064120	To accomplish this, we'll discuss three types of reactions.
1064120	1070320	Hydration of alkenes, a technique called oxymercuration demercuration, and one known as hydroboration
1070320	1072480	and oxidation.
1072480	1076960	Each of these reactions has specific advantages and challenges associated with them, and in
1076960	1083080	many cases they will produce various structural isomers of the product alcohol.
1083080	1086280	So let's begin with a special kind of addition reaction.
1086280	1091160	This is a catalyzed hydration of a very simple alkene, like propene.
1091160	1098920	As the name implies, we'll need three ingredients, an alkene, a mineral acid, and water.
1098920	1103400	In order to complete our reaction, we'll need to acidify the sample using an aqueous solution
1103400	1108080	of that mineral acid, being sure that it has a non-nucleophilic conjugate base, so we'd
1108080	1111680	use something like phosphoric or sulfuric acid for this purpose.
1112680	1118560	A strong acid like sulfuric acid protonates the alkene, but there are two possible carbocation
1118560	1121760	which could form, primary and secondary.
1121760	1125960	Of course, we know that hyperconjugation causes the secondary carbocation to be strongly
1125960	1130360	favored, and it's one of the driving forces behind Markov and Kov's rule, and this reaction
1130360	1133320	is no exception.
1133320	1138000	Now if we follow the reaction with the isopropyl cation to completion, we see that our acid
1138000	1143440	selection has produced a non-nucleophilic base, leaving only water to act as the nucleophile,
1143440	1146960	attacking the carbocation and forming a new bond.
1146960	1151120	So we've created that species known as an oxonium ion.
1151120	1156080	Remember oxonium ions are very acidic, so they quickly lose that acidic proton to a molecule
1156080	1161160	of solvent or to another alkene perpetuating the reaction.
1161160	1164960	And if we evaluate the product obtained, we see that the extension of Markov and Kov's
1164960	1169880	rule has held, with the added hydrogen on the less substituted carbon of the product
1169880	1173680	and the hydroxyl group on the more substituted carbon.
1173680	1180080	So if the goal of our synthesis is to convert an alkene into an alcohol without stereoselectivity
1180080	1186480	and with obeying Markov and Kov's rule, acid-catalyzed hydration seems to be the ticket.
1186480	1191120	But just as with all reactions involving carbocation, we have to be vigilant of the possibility
1191120	1195120	for rearrangements in the intermediate.
1195120	1197280	So how do we cope with this problem?
1197280	1201200	It's an interesting question and one which no doubt vexed Markov and Kov.
1201200	1206880	So this question was taken up by Carl Andreas Hoffman and Julius Sand in 1900.
1206880	1210280	Hoffman and Sand were part of a burgeoning subclass of chemists practicing what is known
1210280	1212720	as organometallic chemistry.
1212720	1216480	And metals, though they're rare in organic chemistry, are present and can form bonds
1216480	1217480	to carbon.
1217840	1222080	It was a very interesting phenomenon that they were investigating.
1222080	1228280	So the reaction that Hoffman and Sand developed involves the use of mercuric acetate, compound
1228280	1233000	consisting of one atom of mercury bonded to two acetate groups.
1233000	1237400	Hoffman and Sand realized that if this compound was used in place of a mineral acid to initiate
1237400	1242600	the hydration of an alkene, no rearrangement took place.
1242600	1247480	So as mercuric acetate is attacked by the alkene, the large mercury atom takes up residence
1247480	1252200	between the two carbons of the pi system, much like our cyclic halonium ion discussed
1252200	1253880	last time.
1253880	1259000	Because of this, it cannot rearrange, that cyclic structure locks it down.
1259000	1263240	Attack by the solvent takes place, and finally the organomercury group is reacted with an
1263240	1266000	agent called sodium borohydride.
1266000	1271880	The borohydride removes the mercuric group and replaces it with a hydrogen.
1271880	1275880	So the use of this reagent allowed Hoffman and Sand to create the Markovnikov product
1275880	1280360	in this hydration without suffering the effects of rearrangement.
1280360	1284720	So we've seen how acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes leads to Markovnikov products with
1284720	1289360	the potential for rearrangement, and we've seen how to produce the Markovnikov product
1289360	1296400	while avoiding rearrangement by use of oxymercuration and subsequent demercuration with borohydride.
1296400	1300600	But what if instead it were necessary to hydrate an alkene to produce the anti-Markovnikov
1300600	1301600	product?
1301600	1305360	Well, we can accomplish this using boron trihydride.
1305360	1312080	You see, what makes boron hydride so interesting is that boron has very low electronegativity,
1312080	1316600	so low in fact that the hydrogen atoms of borotrihydride are at the negative end of the
1316600	1318280	bond dipole.
1318280	1321120	Very unusual.
1321120	1326000	The unusual orientation of the bond dipole in boron trihydride causes it to interact with
1326000	1330680	the pi system of the alkene in such a way that the hydrogen preferentially positions
1330680	1335560	itself above the more substituted carbon.
1335560	1339000	This point, we produce what's called an alkyl borane.
1339000	1344160	And finally, the borane group is reacted with hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide to replace
1344160	1346980	the borane with a hydroxyl group.
1346980	1352400	This leads to the anti-Markovnikov hydration of an alkene, so this is an alcohol that's
1352400	1356800	made with syn-stereochemistry.
1356800	1361400	A final distinction between ethers and alcohols is the lack of an acidic hydrogen in ethers.
1361400	1366520	Now, because ethers don't act as acids under common laboratory conditions, they find use
1366520	1373400	much more frequently as solvents than as reagents, but they're critical materials nonetheless.
1373400	1377120	So after everything that we've been through so far today, you're probably stealing yourself
1377120	1380640	for a new round of complex mechanisms depicting synthesis of ethers.
1381640	1383640	Well, I have some good news for you.
1383640	1388400	You can relax a little bit because ethers can be synthesized using analogs of two of the
1388400	1393760	three reactions that we just discussed, simply by substituting the desired alkyl group for
1393760	1396160	the appropriate hydrogen.
1396160	1401120	For example, instead of acid-catalyzed hydration to form 2-methyl-2-butanol, we can simply
1401120	1406120	replace water with an alcohol leading to the corresponding sec-butyl ether.
1407120	1413320	In a similar way, oxymercuration and demercuration in an alcohol solvent rather than water leads
1413320	1417120	to a Markovnikov ether product without the rearrangement.
1418120	1423680	Now, unfortunately, the complexities of the oxidation step in hydroboration and oxidation
1423680	1428320	make it impossible to produce ethers from alkenes using this method.
1428320	1430520	But there is a solution to this problem.
1430520	1435000	It's not only the last reaction in our synthesis segment of the lecture, but the first in our
1435000	1437000	reactions segment.
1439000	1443080	Although alcohols, and particularly ethers, are most frequently used as solvents in organic
1443080	1448360	chemistry, there are situations in which alcohols can be reactants.
1448360	1452680	The difference in the utility of these chemical cousins lies in their most obvious difference,
1452680	1455680	the presence of an acidic hydrogen.
1455680	1459640	Recall from earlier that I mentioned the most simple aliphatic alcohols have a pKa of about
1459640	1462880	16, which makes them very weakly acidic.
1462880	1464380	But acidic nonetheless.
1464380	1469060	So in the presence of a suitably basic environment, alcohols can be deprotonated to form their
1469060	1471940	conjugate bases, called alkoxides.
1471940	1475740	So let's look at an example of the formation of an alkoxide.
1475740	1478300	Here's an alcohol that we've already discussed, t-butanol.
1478300	1484940	Now this has a pKa of about 16, so when placed in the presence of a reagent like sodium hydride,
1484940	1489980	which presents or reacts as a hydride, we have a reaction take place.
1490380	1496900	It's a proton transfer, in which the hydride removes the proton from that t-butanol.
1496900	1502620	This produces t-butoxide ion, sodium ions, and a little bit of molecular hydrogen.
1502620	1509780	But the molecular hydrogen, remember, has a pKa of about 35 compared to 16 for my t-butyl
1509780	1511300	alcohol.
1511300	1516260	So this reaction is highly favored, and not only that, the hydrogen gas effervesces and
1516260	1518060	escapes into the atmosphere.
1518060	1521020	Once it's gone, clearly the reaction can never go back.
1521020	1527420	So this is a very effective way to make t-butoxide ions.
1527420	1531860	We can use these t-butoxide ions in something called a Williams and Ether synthesis, in
1531860	1536740	which the alkoxide is reacted with an alkyl halide of low substitution, something like
1536740	1539500	methyl chloride.
1539500	1544900	In this case we expect the alkoxide will attack the electrophilic carbon here of the methyl
1544900	1548340	chloride displacing the chloride leaving group.
1548340	1553660	So it proceeds through this intermediate state, where one bond is forming and the other breaking,
1553660	1562340	and concludes with the formation of t-butyl methyl ether and a halide ion byproduct.
1562340	1566540	Now Williams and Ether synthesis are very useful, but they're not always useful.
1566540	1569900	We have to consider the substitution of the R groups on the ether.
1569900	1571940	This is best shown by example.
1571940	1577180	So here are three different ethers that we might want to make, di-t-butyl ether, t-butyl
1577180	1580340	methyl ether, and ethyl methyl ether.
1580340	1586220	So let's ask ourselves if we could form each one of these using a Williams and Ether synthesis.
1586220	1588660	Let's start with di-t-butyl ether.
1588660	1592320	There's only one combination of alcohol and alkyl halide which would lead to this particular
1592320	1599740	ether, and because we're stuck using a tertiary substrate in what would be an SN2 reaction,
1599740	1601580	this can't be done.
1601580	1606620	So Williamson doesn't solve our problem of forming di-t-butyl ethers.
1606620	1608620	What about t-butyl methyl ethers?
1608620	1612860	Well, we can certainly accomplish it, and you know that I can because you've seen it
1612860	1618820	in the previous slide, using methyl chloride, because methyl chloride is completely unsubstituted
1618820	1625420	and therefore the back side of the carbon-chlorine bond is available for nucleophilic attack.
1625420	1631140	But what about turning the tables and trying to use methyl alcohol and t-butyl chloride?
1631140	1636060	Well, in theory this sounds good, but remember we have a tertiary substrate now in an SN2
1636060	1640020	reaction, so this is going to be more of an elimination reaction setup and is not likely
1640020	1643660	to form the ether that we want.
1643660	1649180	Similar analysis for ethyl methyl ether leads to the conclusion that we could use ethanol
1649340	1656940	and methyl chloride, which is a methyl substrate, or we could use methanol and ethyl chloride,
1656940	1660500	because this involves a primary substrate.
1660500	1664580	So as you can see, there are situations in which the Williamson ether synthesis is completely
1664580	1670340	useless to us, situations in which it's useful to us as long as synthetic design is properly
1670340	1674900	conducted, and others in which there are many different ways to make the same product using
1674900	1676140	different reagents.
1676780	1681340	But remember, alcohols are amphoteric, meaning they can also accept the proton to become their
1681340	1683340	conjugate acid.
1683340	1689660	So let's take a moment and think instead about that protonated oxonium ion.
1689660	1694420	Protonation of an alcohol under various acidic conditions changes what would be a poor hydroxide
1694420	1699300	leaving group into a much more stable water leaving group.
1699300	1704300	That's right, what was the nucleophile and basic solution is instead the electrophilic
1704300	1708380	substrate under acidic conditions.
1708380	1711820	This is, in fact, what Cordus had unwittingly accomplished.
1711820	1716900	By mixing ethanol with sulfuric acid, he created a situation in which a portion of the ethanol
1716900	1722100	was protonated, and the remaining neutral alcohol molecules then attacked the oxonium
1722100	1727060	ions, creating the diethyl ether he observed.
1727060	1732220	Now because this reaction wasn't really optimized for SN1 or SN2, it's likely that he unwittingly
1732220	1737060	produced a fair amount of ethylene as well, because this is the elimination product obtained
1737060	1740220	when the dehydration of ethanol takes place.
1740220	1744500	But in defensive Cordus, Christingold's work, which elucidated those mechanisms, was still
1744500	1750020	about four centuries away from being performed, so I think we can forgive him for his suboptimal
1750020	1752540	synthetic design.
1752540	1758940	Nonetheless, alcohols in acidic solution are prone to substitution and elimination because
1758940	1763460	of the stability of the water group which leaves oxonium ions.
1763460	1768540	So alcohol functional groups can be turned into good substrates for substitution by altering
1768540	1772660	the hydroxyl group to make it a better leaving group.
1772660	1777460	Cordus used sulfuric acid to produce oxonium in which water is a leaving group, but many
1777460	1781540	other strategies exist.
1781540	1787820	For example, alcohols can be converted into chlorides using a reagent called thionylchloride.
1787820	1792380	The thionylchloride is first attacked by the alcohol, producing an activated alcohol species
1792380	1794940	known as a sulfonate ester.
1794940	1797260	There's also a chloride ion made in this process.
1797260	1801420	Now, the new leaving group is more stable than chloride ion, which can now attack the
1801420	1807940	electrophilic center from the backside substituting it.
1807940	1812260	Similar strategy can be used to brominate alcohols using phosphorus tribromide.
1812260	1817220	This reagent produces a phosphonate ester and a bromide ion.
1817300	1821180	The combination of alcohols with a reagent called tosylchloride also produces a better
1821180	1823860	leaving group called a tosylate.
1823860	1828220	And this strategy is used frequently to activate primary and secondary alcohols for use in
1828220	1832180	SN2 reactions.
1832180	1836100	So let's finish up the day by taking a look at our sucralose synthesis again.
1836100	1839820	You'll recall that earlier we took a look at sucrose and asked ourselves how can we
1839820	1841300	convert this into sucralose.
1841300	1845220	And we concluded that we had to use an SN2 reaction and today we're going to finish
1845220	1851220	that discussion by choosing the SN2 reaction reagents to make it happen.
1851220	1854740	Now the way that this is done industrially is we first have to get rid of all these other
1854740	1861500	hydroxyl groups here that we don't want reacting when we introduce the substitution reaction.
1861500	1865700	This is done by placing something called an acetyl ester or an acetate group over the
1865700	1866700	alcohols.
1866700	1869620	We basically have masked them with a protecting group.
1869620	1872020	Next, we run our reaction.
1872020	1876620	In our case, we're going to use thionyl chloride followed by hydrochloric acid to quench the
1876620	1877620	reaction.
1877620	1882380	And when this is done, I'm going to substitute both of my primary alcohols for chlorines
1882380	1889900	and I'm also going to substitute my secondary with inversion because I'm running SN2.
1889900	1893940	The final step of my process, I'm going to remove the protecting groups that I placed
1893940	1896780	on to mask the other hydroxyls.
1896780	1899380	After doing that, I've arrived at the product.
1899380	1905740	And this is actually how sucralose is produced industrially today for consumption.
1905740	1909580	So let's take a few moments and summarize what we've covered today.
1909580	1914660	We took a look at the atomic structure and bonding behavior of oxygen, how its electron
1914660	1919140	configuration makes it most stable when it has two bonds, either as a pair of single
1919140	1923300	bonds or as a double bond.
1923300	1928580	We focused on the oxygen atom in sp3 hybridization states in which it has two lone pairs and
1928580	1934260	two sigma bonds and how it leads to three possibilities, either two bonded hydrogens
1934260	1940580	producing water, one alkyl group and one hydrogen producing an alcohol, or two bonded alkyl
1940580	1944120	groups creating an ether.
1944120	1948260	We discussed how alcohol groups have that special designation of functional group in
1948260	1953740	IUPAC nomenclature and how their less reactive ether cousins don't enjoy the same distinction,
1953740	1960820	instead being named as alkanes having alkoxy substituents.
1960820	1965100	We covered techniques for synthesizing alcohols and ethers, including acid-catalyzed addition
1965100	1970020	which results in Markovnikov products, but which are prone to rearrangement.
1970020	1973980	We looked at how Hoffman and Sands solved the rearrangement problem with oxymercuration
1973980	1976700	and demercuration.
1976700	1982500	We also considered how one might make an anti-Markovnikov alcohol or ether product from alkenes
1982780	1987860	using hydroboration and oxidation as the pathway.
1987860	1992220	We took a look at the reactivity of alcohols and how their amphoteric nature makes them
1992220	1997740	prone to act as electrophiles or substrates in acidic media, but as nucleophiles in extremely
1997740	1999420	basic environments.
1999420	2004180	Finally, we investigated a few methods of activating alcohols by converting their hydroxyl
2004180	2007260	groups into more reactive leaving groups.
2007340	2013380	Specifically, we looked at sulfonate esters, phosphonate esters, and tosylates.
2013380	2017220	We saw specifically how sulfonate esters are employed in the synthesis of the sugar
2017220	2020780	substitute sucralose.
2020780	2025300	So there's no denying that alcohols and ethers are versatile solvents and reagents, but there's
2025300	2029140	much more to the remarkable role of oxygen in organic synthesis.
2029140	2034460	We'll cover even more of it next time, including a look at the role of oxygen-containing compounds
2034540	2038940	and their chemistry in the aftermath of a night of enjoying a few cold beers.
2038940	2040100	I'll see you then.
