1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,120
So, we're now knee-deep in what I like to call the alphabet soup segment of the course,

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,480
where every few lectures we introduce a new element to the train wreck of lines, letters

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,080
and dots on the screen.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,200
I make no mistake, there are many players in the organic chemistry game, but there are

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,720
just a few which make up the vast majority of the science, and with just two more lectures

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,720
to go, we're on the downslope of our short tour, so hang in there.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,440
Now, nitrogen, it's been a player in the chemistry of life since day one, playing an

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,720
integral role in the makeup of our simplest organic compounds which came together to create

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,240
the spark of life on the early Earth some three billion years ago.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,680
And the biological relevance of nitrogen is evident today, in the experience we get when

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,680
we happen on a piece of rotten flesh or spoiled meat.

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,520
See, some of the earliest discovered nitrogen-containing compounds received very unappetizing names

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,680
like cadaverine and putrassine.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,240
This is a testament to the first source from which they were isolated, and of course to

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,120
the smell that they produced.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,200
No discussion of nitrogen is ever complete without the mention of one name in particular,

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,960
it's Haber, and you may remember from our lecture on drawing chemical reactions that

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,600
Haber was a German chemist working in Germany during the first part of the 20th century.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,800
As one of the more eccentric personalities in the history of organic chemistry, Haber's

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,640
famous or infamous for making some very dubious choices about how to pursue and apply the science

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,880
of chemistry.

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,560
But whatever you may think of as politics, there is one incontrovertible fact that we

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,800
can all agree on.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,120
Haber may be responsible for the single, most influential chemical development of the 20th

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,680
century, and possibly of all human history, the Haber-Bosch process which allows us to

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,240
convert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into ammonia.

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,120
You might also remember that I mentioned in a previous lecture, Haber's process for

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,400
converting nitrogen to ammonia isn't technically an organic reaction at all, since it lacks

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,760
the involvement of carbon.

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,200
But by the end of today, I think you'll begin to see why organic chemists owe so much to

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,640
this inorganic reaction that we've adopted Haber as one of our own.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,040
In short, the product of his reaction, ammonia, is one of the primary entry points for nitrogen

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,520
into the field of synthetic organic chemistry.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Just as certain plants use ammonia from this process as a nutrient to build the organic

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,080
molecules they need to live, so do organic chemists often use ammonia to introduce nitrogen

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,440
into organics in the laboratory.

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,520
Nitrogen is a key element in the structures of many critical commercial materials.

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,560
From explosives to fertilizers to polymers, nitrogen is frequently present and almost

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,840
just as frequently irreplaceable in the process of creating certain essential goods.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,120
It can be found in a host of organic compounds with diverse applications.

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,640
Being a key player in compounds is different and versatile as the explosive nitroglycerin,

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,600
the powerful antibiotic vancomycin, and even the proteins making up 20% of the mass in

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,280
your own body.

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,920
Today we will begin our short survey of nitrogen-containing compounds with a look at amines, amines,

45
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,720
and nitriles, compounds containing only nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen.

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,280
Next time we'll bring oxygen back to this dance, but for now let's just concentrate

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,760
on the simplest possible classes of nitrogen-containing molecules.

48
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,520
Now I hope I have convinced you that nitrogen is worth taking a look at if not a smell of,

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,360
but let's take a look at nitrogen-containing compounds now.

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Nitrogen itself has an electron configuration of 1s2, 2s2, 2p3.

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,800
So nitrogen's valence shell will be filled when it shares 3 covalent bonds with other

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,680
atoms.

53
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,080
This makes nitrogen quite an interesting structural twist, since unlike oxygen, in

54
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,040
its sp3 hybridization state, it can perpetuate chains and can also bear one additional functional

55
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,440
group or substituent.

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,520
So the library of nitrogen-containing motifs can get unwieldy pretty quickly.

57
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,480
So let's focus on just the simplest of all these groups to start, those consisting of

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,000
only one nitrogen atom bonded to one or more hydrocarbons.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,880
Let's begin with an sp3 nitrogen.

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,200
As you can see from this structure, the sp3 nitrogen contains enough electrons to make

61
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,600
three different covalent bonds, but also keeps a lone pair for itself.

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,520
The presence of that lone pair means that the three bonds to other atoms are actually

63
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,440
about 109.5 degrees from one another, maybe ever so slightly closer because of the presence

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
of pushing down from that lone pair of electrons, but in general we can think of them as being

65
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,520
about the same as any other tetrahedral center.

66
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,480
Now if we instead think about a nitrogen which contains a single bond and a double bond, what

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,720
we get is a nitrogen in which the lone pair is pushing down on those bonds as well, and

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,200
therefore even though there are only two bonded substituents, the angle is closer to 120 degrees

69
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,400
than we might think, it's not 180.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,720
So let's put that one away.

71
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,480
Now let's take a look at one of our nitrogen atoms, but in this case one that is in the

72
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,840
sp hybridized state.

73
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,160
Now in this hybridized state we can have only one bond, excuse me, to our nitrogen and that

74
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,760
is a triple bond.

75
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,080
So in this case the triple bond to our nitrogen leaves the lone pair dangling on the end and

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,720
leaves our substituent, whether it's an alkyl substituent or a nitrogen, pointing directly

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,920
in the other direction.

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,440
Now this means that the family of simple nitrogen-containing compounds is much larger and more complex

79
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,320
than oxygen.

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,000
So we now have to consider not just how our heteroatom can terminate or perpetuate a chain,

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,800
but also how it can potentially modify that chain, introducing branching in ways that

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,600
oxygen simply can't.

83
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,760
So let's start our survey of nitrogen-containing compounds by considering the simplest of all

84
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,720
the amine functional group.

85
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Now an amine functional group is defined as one containing a carbon-nitrogen single bond.

86
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,960
So three examples are here, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine.

87
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,440
You notice that in each case the nitrogen atom indicated in blue is singly bonded to

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,320
at least one other hydrocarbon, otherwise we would end up with an ammonia molecule.

89
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,360
Now when a single R-group is attached, we call this a primary amine.

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,120
When there are two, a secondary amine, and three, a tertiary amine.

91
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,040
This is our basic method of classifying this kind of molecule.

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,160
But it's not enough to simply call them primary, secondary, and tertiary.

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,640
We need a nomenclature system which will allow us to identify specific amine molecules, and

94
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,040
we rely on IUPAC for this.

95
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,800
We'll be naming these amines in exactly the same way as we would most other molecules

96
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,680
with one very important change.

97
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,080
Not only will we be doing the usual of finding our longest continuous chain with the functional

98
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,480
group and giving the lowest possible number to the carbon varying the functional group,

99
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,800
but we're going to have a new address of n for the substituent that's bonded to the

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,600
actual amine functional group.

101
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's take a look at an example.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Let's say we wanted to name this amine.

103
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,480
But we'd go through our usual IUPAC system in which we find the functional group and

104
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,480
the longest attached chain indicated here in orange.

105
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,960
So this would be a pentanamine.

106
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,080
It has a single methyl substituent, and we'll give it an address based upon the location

107
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
of the functional group, which is the NH2.

108
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,800
So we would number our parent hydrocarbon in this way, thereby giving the lowest number

109
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,480
to the functional group and giving us the name three methyl, one, and tannamine.

110
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,880
As another example, let's try a secondary amine and see how that affects the name.

111
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,200
In my secondary amine, I have, again, my hydrocarbon parent here in orange.

112
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,120
You'll notice that in this case, my functional group is not at the end of the chain, but

113
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,480
that's okay.

114
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,400
So I have a butanamine.

115
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,320
My butanamine also has an ethyl group attached to its amine nitrogen.

116
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,760
So the ethyl group will get a special address indicated not by a number, but by the letter

117
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
n.

118
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:08,240
So in this case, after numbering my chain, I find that I have an n-ethyl-2-butanamine.

119
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:16,720
I've now unambiguously named this particular isomer of this particular secondary amine.

120
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,600
What makes amines so different from other compounds is the types of properties that

121
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,960
their polarity and their hydrogen bonding gives them.

122
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,880
When we think about primary and secondary amines, we see that they have Cn dipoles, but that

123
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,080
they also have a very important NH bond, which gives them not only another dipole, but also

124
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,320
gives them the ability to be not only the H bond donor, but also an H bond acceptor.

125
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,880
So just like carboxylic acids, these amines, when they're primary and secondary, have

126
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,280
the ability to hydrogen bond to other molecules of the same kind.

127
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,480
Now, what we find in the case of tertiary amines, however, is that although they contain plenty

128
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,760
of dipoles, making them polar molecules, that they have no NH bonds, therefore they can

129
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,680
only act as hydrogen bond acceptors.

130
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,160
So if we place a trimethylamine molecule next to another trimethylamine molecule, they can't

131
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,760
interact in the same way as their primary and secondary counterparts.

132
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,360
And what this means is that they tend to have much lower boiling points than do primary

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,040
and secondary amines, as we can see here.

134
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,640
Now, aside from their volatilities and their ability to hydrogen bond to one another, amines

135
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,560
are most well known in the organic lab as bases.

136
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,000
And the reason that we use them as bases is that the nitrogen, of course, has that special

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,120
lone pair right there, which is able to pick up an H+, forming its conjugate acid.

138
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,000
If we consider using methylamine first as an acid, we see that we have to make something

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,040
called an amide anion, which is extremely unstable.

140
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,200
So the amide anion not being so stable, the pKa of neutral methylamine is about 35.

141
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,560
And when we reach pKa this level, we tend to think of things as being not acidic at all.

142
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,480
But what methylamine can do instead is use the nitrogen as a base, picking up a proton

143
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,640
from elsewhere, and becoming a methyl ammonium ion.

144
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,460
Now, the methyl ammonium ion is actually fairly stable, and that leads to a pKa of this conjugate

145
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,840
acid of about 11.

146
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,600
So when we mix methylamine into many different organic reactions and organic systems, they

147
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,880
have a strong tendency to accept protons and act as a base.

148
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,560
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about how amines are made.

149
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,440
And I have to admit this again.

150
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,440
When it comes to organic synthesis, the human race has been vested time and time again by

151
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,140
single-celled organisms.

152
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,000
Just as was the case in the synthesis of acid aldehyde, acetic acid, and other oxygen-containing

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,280
compounds, it would seem that an extra three billion years of practice afforded to microorganisms

154
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:09,240
has made them far more prolific at synthesizing nitrogen-containing compounds, too.

155
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,800
Our best natural resource or best natural source for nitrogen-containing organics comes from

156
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,560
the rhizobia bacterium, which live in the root nodules of legumes.

157
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,960
So have you ever driven or walked past a cornfield one year, only to see a field of

158
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,920
soy plants in it the next, and maybe wondered why the farmer suddenly had a change of heart

159
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,160
over which crop to plant?

160
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,720
Well, there's actually far more to the change in crop selection than the whim of a farmer.

161
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,680
You see, corn is very taxing on soil, draining it of nutrients, including nitrogen, and

162
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,360
leaving even the best fertilized fields too depleted to support a following year's crop.

163
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,760
The solution to this problem is crop rotation, in which soybeans and their nitrogen-fixing

164
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,000
stowaways are given a season to grow before their root systems are tilled under to replenish

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,880
the nitrogen content of the soil.

166
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,160
So once again, we find ourselves depending on the synthesis skills of these micron-sized

167
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,160
chemists to help us better our quality of life.

168
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,000
But organic chemists aren't cyanobacteria, we're people, and we work in labs.

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,360
So let's take a look now at some of humanity's rather clumsy attempts to duplicate this amazing

170
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,720
feat.

171
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,400
Amines are the simplest starting point from which Haber-Bosch ammonia can be injected

172
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,120
into the organic chemistry realm.

173
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,960
And one very simple method used to accomplish this is the direct alkylation of ammonia using

174
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,640
a familiar compound, alkylchlorides.

175
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,000
You see, ammonia is a fairly good nucleophile, and it can be coarsed to react by an SN2 reaction

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,720
with a primary or methyl alkyl halide, like this ethylchloride.

177
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,480
When mixed, a nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place, generating a primary amine and

178
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,560
one mole of hydrochloric acid.

179
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,640
So here we run into a potential problem.

180
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,920
Notice that the product amine is also nucleophilic, and in theory can react with yet another

181
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,920
alkyl halide to form a secondary amine, which could then again react to form a tertiary

182
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,400
amine.

183
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,360
So it's rather easy to make a tertiary alkyl amine by direct alkylation, just use a very

184
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,120
large excess of the alkyl halide.

185
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,880
And conversely, we can force the reaction system in the direction of primary alkyl amines

186
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,960
by using a large excess of ammonia, limiting the chances that an already formed primary

187
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:44,600
amine will productively collide with another alkyl halide before they're all consumed.

188
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,320
But this requires a very large excess of ammonia, and even though his process has helped to

189
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,360
make ammonia relatively abundant and inexpensive, I don't think Fritz Haber would be very happy

190
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,400
with us wasting his hard-earned fixed nitrogen like that.

191
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,320
And Rhizobia is probably already having a pretty good laugh at our expense anyway.

192
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,680
So the solution to this problem, not being mocked by bacteria, but the synthetic problem

193
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,800
at hand, was actually worked out well ahead of Haber's time by one of his countrymen,

194
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,920
Sigmund Gabriel.

195
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,760
Gabriel used what we commonly refer to as a protecting group, to temporarily render

196
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,680
two sites on ammonia unreactive, then restore them to their original state only after the

197
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,480
alkylation was complete.

198
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,800
Gabriel used a compound called thalamine, in place of ammonia, activating it with potassium

199
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,760
hydroxide to create a more nucleophilic thalamide ion.

200
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:46,840
This ion attacks the alkyl halide much like ammonia would, this time forming an N-alkyl

201
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,480
thalamide intermediate.

202
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,720
But notice that there are no more NH protons to lose, which is a requirement for the reaction

203
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,920
to proceed beyond the first alkylation.

204
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,680
Now after this step, a molecule known as hydrazine is used to remove that protecting group.

205
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,040
Notice that hydrazine contains two potentially nucleophilic nitrogens.

206
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Gabriel also probably noticed that the thalamide motif has two electrophilic carbonyl carbons.

207
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,320
Now that's no coincidence.

208
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,440
The hydrazine first attacks one carbonyl, and then the next, forming a very stable by-product

209
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,840
thalamide hydrazide and our primary amine.

210
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,000
So we've seen that direct alkylation is an easy way to make tertiary amines, and that

211
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,560
primary amines can be made using thalamine.

212
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,080
Amine groups like that are called the Gabriel synthesis.

213
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,560
But what about secondary amines?

214
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,520
They can't be favored by stoichiometric control, meaning adding lots of one reagent or the

215
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,600
other, nor can they be favored using the Gabriel synthesis because that would be a very difficult

216
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,280
modification.

217
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,240
So what do we do?

218
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,360
The simplest solution to this problem is a technique known as reductive amination.

219
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,360
In this reaction, a primary amine, formed by direct alkylation, the Gabriel synthesis

220
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,600
or some other means, is reacted with a ketone or an aldehyde under acidic conditions.

221
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,360
Now under these conditions, an N-substituted amine is formed.

222
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,840
Once this amine intermediate is formed, the product is reduced using a very familiar reagent

223
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,080
to us, lithium aluminum hydride.

224
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,400
This adds hydrogen across the double bond, producing a secondary amine.

225
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,600
In the case of ketones, a branched alkyl group is obtained, whereas with aldehydes, we get

226
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
a straight chain secondary amine.

227
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Okay, so now that we've gotten to know amines a little bit, let's take a look at nitrogen

228
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,280
containing compounds with double bonds, or imines.

229
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,920
As I just mentioned, imines are defined as those compounds which contain CN double bonds.

230
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,760
So I've highlighted those for you here in yellow.

231
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,160
Notice that each of these compounds has a carbon double bonded to a nitrogen.

232
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,280
Now having this carbon double bonded to a nitrogen means that they'll behave somewhat

233
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,960
similarly to their carbonyl brethren, ketones and aldehydes, meaning that we can have either

234
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:18,480
nothing bonded to the carbonyl or we can have one R-group bonded or two R-group bonded.

235
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,280
When we have no R-groups on the carbon of it, we call it a formimine.

236
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,240
When one R-group is present on the doubly bonded carbon, we call this compound an aldimine.

237
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,600
When we have two, we call this type of compound a ketamine, not to be confused with ketamine,

238
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,760
the horse tranquilizer, which is a completely different type of compound.

239
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,080
Now, imines are most easily synthesized by the reaction of ammonia, or primary amine

240
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,960
with ketones and aldehydes, using a strong non-nucleophilic mineral acid like sulfuric

241
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,360
acid.

242
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,880
In this situation, the nitrogen acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl, which

243
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,640
causes one of the amine protons to tautomerize into what we call a beta-hydroxyamine.

244
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:10,320
Finally, a second tautomerism occurs, leading to departure of a water molecule and formation

245
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
of the imine.

246
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,400
Of course, having a double bond, imines can always be reduced to their analogous amines

247
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,600
using lithium aluminum hydride or palladium on carbon or similar chemistry.

248
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,040
Just as we previously did to create a secondary amine, so can a linear primary amine be made

249
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,400
by the reduction of a primary aldamine?

250
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,840
Branched primary amines can be prepared from reduction of primary ketamines.

251
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,600
Linear secondary amines can be prepared from secondary aldamines and branched secondary

252
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,200
amines from secondary ketamines.

253
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,040
But imines are so much more than just intermediates in the synthesis of amines.

254
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,560
They hold their own as a commercially useful class of materials.

255
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,920
You see, imines have the ability to do something that no other functional group we've yet

256
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,480
looked at can accomplish.

257
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,080
They can be used to connect two large pi systems together through resonance.

258
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,720
Let's take a look at a reaction that's actually quite famous.

259
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm going to react two molecules of aniline with two different isomers of the molecule

260
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,800
toluidine.

261
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,560
Now, when I do this under oxidative conditions, I get a compound that looks like this called

262
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
mauveine.

263
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,360
Now, mauveine has two imine groups highlighted here.

264
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,160
But what's really interesting about these imine groups is that they're not isolated,

265
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,480
they're in resonance.

266
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,440
They have pi systems on both sides.

267
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,760
So if I think about this mauveine molecule as more of its resonance hybrid, I notice

268
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,520
that there's a very large region of delocalized pi electrons.

269
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,160
And as we're going to see in some future lectures, when we have large regions of pi electrons

270
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,560
that can move like this in resonance, we tend to have compounds that can absorb visible

271
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
light.

272
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,920
Now, mauveine was first synthesized in 1856 by a British student named William Henry Perkin.

273
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,680
Now, like so many other groundbreaking products, it wasn't design synthesis, but it was actually

274
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
an accident.

275
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:29,320
See, Perkin was trying to oxidize aniline using an oxidizing agent called potassium dichromate.

276
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,040
Now, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how fond you are of the color purple,

277
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,880
his dichromate was contaminated with toluidine, and his synthesis resulted in a thick black

278
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,280
mess of material.

279
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,640
A disappointed Perkin set to cleaning the black sludge from his flask with alcohol only

280
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,760
to find that the resulting solution was a beautiful, brilliant shade of purple.

281
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,720
Perkin quickly sorted out the puzzle of the beautiful purple compound, developing a synthesis

282
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,160
which launched the synthetic dye industry.

283
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,680
His discovery proved so influential that the American branch of the society of chemical

284
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,520
industry has made him the namesake of their highest professional award, conferring the

285
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,960
first one to Perkin himself on the 50th anniversary of his discovery.

286
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,520
So, this is just one more anecdote proving that sometimes an accident and keen powers

287
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,520
of observation are all it takes to make it to the top in science.

288
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:35,440
Now, let's turn our attention to the simplest compounds containing an SP hybridized nitrogen,

289
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,920
known as nitrials.

290
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:45,800
So, nitrials contain an SP nitrogen, which means that it's likely to contain a triple

291
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,040
bond.

292
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,600
Now, when we have CN triple bonds like these, there are really only two possible structural

293
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
approaches.

294
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,200
One is to have a hydrogen attached as the fourth bond to carbon.

295
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,520
The other is to have an R-group.

296
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,400
When the attached motif is a hydrogen, we call this molecule cyanic acid.

297
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,520
If instead the carbon that's triply bonded to the nitrogen contains some kind of R-group,

298
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,840
we call this class of compounds a nitrile.

299
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:26,040
Now, nitrials are weakly acidic, but HCN, hydrocyanide, or hydrocyanic acid rather, is

300
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:32,160
actually much more acidic than any other nitrile because its hydrogen is bonded directly to

301
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,600
the carbon which bears the CN triple bond.

302
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,040
So, removal of this hydrogen creates what we call a cyanide ion, which I'm sure we're

303
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,080
all familiar with hearing.

304
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,240
This is the ion that actually is generated in your bloodstream when you inhale hydrogen

305
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,000
cyanide gas as you might if you were in an execution chamber several decades ago.

306
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,520
The ion is actually resonance stabilized and therefore gives HCN a pKa of around 9,

307
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,320
which means that at physiological pHs, it can actually give up a small amount of these

308
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,720
protons leading to the lethal cyanide ion.

309
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,480
Now, acetylnitrile and other nitriles, on the other hand, don't have a hydrogen bonded

310
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,080
directly to the carbon of the nitrile group.

311
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,960
And so, although they can lose these protons and form a resonance stabilized conjugate

312
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,920
base, because it's not directly on the carbon bearing the electron withdrawing nitrogen,

313
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,720
the pKa of compounds like this is actually significantly reduced, about 25.

314
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,440
Now, hydrogen cyanide, of course, is special among nitriles because its pKa allows it to

315
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,880
dissociate partially at physiological pH conditions.

316
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,600
This means in your bloodstream, if you were to ingest or in some other way take in hydrogen

317
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,720
cyanide, there would be a small amount of this ion.

318
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,140
Now, the ion cyanide is a powerful binder to certain proteins involved in the electron

319
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:04,280
transport chain, which our bodies use to process energy and stay alive.

320
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,360
But cyanide ion is not only very toxic, it's also very nucleophilic, and it interacts strongly

321
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,720
with certain metals too.

322
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,800
And this prompts many chemists to brave this potentially lethal compound in pursuit of their

323
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,440
chemical goals.

324
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:26,160
For example, cyanide was, and in some cases still is, used as an agent to extract gold

325
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,600
from low-grade ore.

326
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:36,120
Cyanide and gold form a strong complex known as orosionine, and this complex is far more

327
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,560
water soluble than gold itself, and the gold can be leached from rock using strong solutions

328
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,760
of cyanide in water.

329
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,160
Naturally, this process has to be very carefully monitored, controlled, and of course, its

330
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,440
byproducts thoroughly treated before disposal.

331
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,240
So it would seem that only the lure of something as precious as gold could convince a person

332
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,920
to work with this deadly compound, right?

333
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,160
Well, maybe organic chemists live for danger, because we also use cyanide to produce a much

334
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:11,360
larger nitrile compound from primary and secondary alkyl halides in a simple SN2 reaction.

335
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Using cyanide as a nucleophile, carbon chains can be conveniently extended by one carbon

336
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,720
creating larger nitriles.

337
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,400
And these nitriles have many uses, including as an alternative to the Gabriel synthesis

338
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,680
to manufacture primary amines without concern of oversubstituting the product.

339
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:36,720
For example, ethyl bromide plus a cyanide ion leads to a compound known as propane nitrile,

340
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,720
which can be easily converted into propanamine with H2 and platinum catalyst.

341
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,800
Of course, having pi bonds to their heteroatoms means that nitriles can also be thought of

342
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,240
as being similar to carbonyls, just like their immune cousins.

343
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,720
And they tend to have a very electrophilic nitrile carbon, and so they're susceptible

344
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,920
to a nucleophilic attack at that location.

345
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,720
So we can design synthesis in which the electrophilic nitrile carbon is attacked, leading to strategies

346
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,960
to create many of the other functional groups that we've discussed so far.

347
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,160
Probably the most familiar use of the term nitrile is in reference to functional groups

348
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,800
used in certain rubber products, the best example being nitrile examination gloves.

349
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,920
See, the polymer used to produce nitrile rubber is created from a reaction using acrylonitrile

350
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
as one of its starting materials.

351
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,360
And we're going to take a closer look at this process later on in the course.

352
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,880
But the result of this process is a polymer, which is decorated with repeating nitrile

353
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,960
groups, giving it greater resistance to oils than natural rubber latex.

354
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,040
Of course, another benefit of nitrile latex is that it's prepared completely synthetically,

355
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,000
and therefore it contains no plant material like natural rubber latex does.

356
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,440
And this is why nitrile products don't fall prey to the same allergy-related issues as

357
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,360
natural rubber latex.

358
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,800
So today we injected a whole new element into our thinking about organic chemistry,

359
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,080
the element nitrogen.

360
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,680
We discussed how crucial nitrogen is to many biological molecules, both small and large,

361
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,280
and the length to which Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch were willing to go to get fixed nitrogen

362
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,680
in the form of ammonia.

363
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,840
We talked about how nitrogen typically has three bonds, making it structurally diverse

364
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,360
as an atom, and giving it geometric complexity in the second row of the periodic table that's

365
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,040
only exceeded by that of carbon.

366
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,560
We also talked about the simplest of nitrogen-containing compounds, amines, and how they're classified

367
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,120
as primary, secondary, and tertiary.

368
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,280
We saw how primary amines can be made using the Gabriel synthesis.

369
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,400
Secondary amines can be made by the reduction of amines produced by amination of ketones

370
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,120
and aldehydes.

371
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,640
And we also saw how tertiary amines can be easily made by the direct amination of alkyl

372
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,160
halides.

373
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,640
We touched on the structure and classification of amines, in which the nitrogen contains

374
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,600
a pi bond to an adjacent carbon.

375
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,560
We discussed how primary and secondary, ketamines, and aldehydes can be formed from ketones and

376
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,280
aldehydes using ammonia or primary amines.

377
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,840
And finally, we considered nitrials, in which two pi bonds are present.

378
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,880
We looked at the simplest and most well-known of these nitrials, hydrogen cyanide, which

379
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,440
can be deprotonated to create a potent toxin that's also a good nucleophile in the form

380
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,680
of cyanide ion.

381
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,320
We talked about how cyanide ion can be used to produce larger nitrials by us in two reactions,

382
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,920
with primary and secondary alkyl halides.

383
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,920
And finally, we saw how, in a second step, these nitrial products can be converted into

384
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,960
compounds with a host of other functional groups.

385
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,880
Next time, we're going to bring oxygen back to the discussion and look at some functional

386
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,920
groups which contain both nitrogen and oxygen, from biopolymers to artificial sweeteners

387
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
to explosives.

388
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,840
It should be a wild ride.

389
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
I'll see you then.
