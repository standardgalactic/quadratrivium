1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Over our last few lectures, we've considered some of the techniques that organic chemists

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,000
use to characterize organic compounds in their structures.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,200
Specifically, we've looked at UV-visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, polarimetry, and continuous

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,120
wave NMR spectroscopy.

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,640
Now all of these techniques were developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,100
no doubt contributed significantly to developing the basis for our understanding of organic

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,000
chemistry.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,600
But in many cases, most notably the case of NMR, these techniques are not locked in time.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,600
They've been relentlessly expanded, improved upon, and even supplemented with newer techniques

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,600
for identifications, just a few of which we're going to explore today.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,680
Now last time we explored the technique pioneered by Isidore Rebe and his contemporaries in the

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,520
middle of the 20th century.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,840
Specifically we discussed the phenomenon of resonance and how factors like shielding

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,760
and magnetic coupling can all affect the resonance behavior of specific protons within a sample.

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,920
Today we will apply all of these principles and more as we investigate modern NMR spectrometers,

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
which cannot only collect these spectra faster and more precisely, but are fundamentally

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,400
different in the way which they do so.

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Several advances in technology have led to the development of what's called the pulsed

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
NMR technique.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
First and foremost is the development of superconductors.

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,520
See all modern high-field spectrometers use a superconducting magnet to generate an extremely

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,840
high applied field, which helps us to achieve better resolution in the spectrum.

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Keeping these superconducting magnets cold is critical to their function, so spectrometers

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,720
contain a series of concentric vacuum-walled compartments called duers.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,080
There's an exterior duer filled with liquid nitrogen and an interior duer containing liquid

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,240
helium and the superconducting magnet itself.

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,600
The liquid helium keeps the magnet itself at four kelvins, that's colder than the dark

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
side of the moon.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,960
Meanwhile, just inches away from it is the organic sample at room temperature.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,920
The second advancement which opened the door to the pulsed NMR method is computer technology.

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,600
The detector in NMR is more often called a receiver, because the response it creates

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,280
is not a spectrum, but rather a raw data set which has to be manipulated by a computer

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,720
before it can be used.

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,000
So these two technologies, the superconducting material development and computing power advancement,

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
have allowed us to use this very effective technique to do so much more with NMR than

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,240
could ever have been done in rabies day.

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,600
As we try to explain the pulsed NMR method, we're going to rely on all the knowledge that

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,880
we've gained in the previous lecture.

39
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,320
That in the presence of a magnetic field, protons align their dipoles in the parallel

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,200
alpha spin state or the anti-parallel beta spin state, and that the populations of these

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,600
two states is governed by the Zeeman splitting.

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,400
Zeeman splitting is the energy difference between the alpha and beta states and can

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,280
be calculated using the field strength at the nucleus and the gyromagnetic ratio.

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,960
But to really understand pulsed NMR will require us to acknowledge two additional principles.

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,080
First, when an individual atomic dipole aligns itself with external magnetic field lines,

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,680
the two are not actually perfectly parallel.

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,440
You see the dipole processes about the applied field, much like this gyroscope, which I'm

48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:18,280
about to wind up so that we can see this for ourselves.

49
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,520
So you can clearly see what's going on here.

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,300
Let me quiet it down a bit for you so we can discuss.

51
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,240
So the axis of that gyroscope was processing about the axis of the Earth's gravitational

52
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,400
field, which is oriented straight up and down.

53
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,920
Now just as that gyroscope would process, say, slower in the reduced gravity of the

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,880
moon but faster in the higher gravity of Jupiter, so will the magnetic dipole of a nucleus

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,400
process slower in a weaker field and faster in a stronger one.

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,560
The frequency of this procession is known as the Larmore frequency, which is exactly

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
the same as the resonance frequency for a given nucleus.

58
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,080
So we can calculate the Larmore frequency for a given proton using the same equation

59
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,400
relating it to the gyromagnetic ratio and effective field.

60
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Our second consideration.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,400
In a large collection of similar nuclei, the vector sum of all dipoles within the system

62
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,280
will in fact be aligned with the applied field because of the dispersion of the rotating dipoles

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,680
and the slight excess of the alpha spin state in the group.

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:37,400
And it's the net magnetization, which is the source of the pulsed NMR signal.

65
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,800
So let's set the stage for our first pulsed NMR experiment.

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,560
First we need to get our bearings.

67
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,240
So let's define a coordinate system such that three axes, x, y, and z, are present.

68
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,200
The z-axis will be aligned with the applied magnetic field lines and therefore also with

69
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,880
the net magnetization of the sample.

70
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,480
Now what makes pulsed NMR so fundamentally different from the continuous wave experiment

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
is this.

72
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,960
There's no continuous wave.

73
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,840
There is simply the magnetization generated by the protons within the sample.

74
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,160
So they rely on a hard pulse of radio energy containing a very broad range of frequencies.

75
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,680
This type of pulse electromagnetically pushes the net magnetization downward into the x,

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,440
y plane.

77
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,520
Now in my example, I've placed the magnetization along the x-axis.

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,800
But just as soon as that hard radio frequency pulse is removed, the magnetization wants

79
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,120
to return back to its original orientation.

80
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,120
But here's the catch, its path is not straight.

81
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Instead, it processes about that z-axis at its Larmore frequency as it relaxes.

82
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,440
It's this procession which is the basis for the raw data collected in a pulsed NMR experiment.

83
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,680
But just how is this frequency measured?

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,280
Well, consider first the analogy of a lighthouse with the beacon of light rotating at a given

85
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,840
rate.

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,440
If an observer stands at a fixed location and watches that lighthouse beacon rotate

87
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,840
over a given period of time, what will they observe?

88
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,400
Well, they'll observe the intensity of the beam first diminishing as the source rotates

89
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,960
away, and then intensifying as it sweeps back in the observer's direction.

90
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,520
And this process will continue for as long as that beam rotates.

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,400
If we were to plot this intensity as a function of time, we would expect to observe a trigonometric

92
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,040
function, specifically a cosine wave.

93
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,520
So a Fourier transform of this function should transform my cosine function into the time

94
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,640
domain into a single peak in the frequency domain.

95
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,840
Now, a modern NMR spectrometer works on a similar principle, listening with the radio

96
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,400
antenna which produces an alternating current in response to the rotation of the magnetic

97
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,680
vectors in the sample.

98
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Now, where this analogy breaks down is the fact that the magnetization of our sample

99
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,240
not only rotates, but also relaxes back to its original orientation.

100
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,480
So the x, y vector component of this magnetization is not only rotating, but also weakening as

101
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,840
the experiment progresses.

102
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,280
And this produces a decaying AC current at the detector.

103
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,360
It's a plot of that decaying AC current intensity versus time, which is the raw data produced

104
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,400
by the spectrometer.

105
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:43,320
And we call this the free induction decay, or FID for short.

106
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,680
So now that we understand how a spectrometer collects information about the Larmore frequency

107
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,280
of a collection of protons, I want to show you how we convert this information into something

108
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,760
more useful to us, like a completed NMR spectrum, the likes of which we saw last time in the

109
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,680
continuous wave experiment.

110
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,240
So let's begin by looking at a raw data set for a pulsed NMR experiment known as a free

111
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,560
induction decay.

112
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,900
On my horizontal axis will be time, because I'm in the time domain, and my vertical axis

113
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,800
will be the intensity of the AC current.

114
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,600
So I expect to see something like this.

115
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
Now what's interesting about this particular data set is that it's so simple that I can

116
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
interpret it without transforming it.

117
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,920
So let's do that first.

118
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,840
There are really only two different frequencies embedded within this particular free induction

119
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,800
decay.

120
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,720
One frequency, which is rather fast, frequency A, so the amount of time for one oscillation

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,960
to take place here is very short.

122
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,040
But if you look carefully, frequency A is embedded on top of a larger, longer frequency

123
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,400
here.

124
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,760
This would be frequency B.

125
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,720
So my data set contained two frequencies.

126
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,280
Now NMR data sets for actual samples can contain dozens or even hundreds of different

127
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,640
frequencies all superimposed on one another, so it's not always quite this easy.

128
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,600
And to solve that problem, we use a mathematical operator known as the Fourier transform.

129
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,960
The Fourier transform is very complex, and we won't cover in detail today exactly how

130
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,120
it's done, but what's important here is the outcome.

131
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,040
If I Fourier transform my data set, I alter the time domain and start looking at my data

132
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,880
instead in the frequency domain.

133
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,320
So my higher frequency, frequency A, is somewhere down here in the downfield region of my continuous

134
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,160
wave experiment, whereas a longer frequency or a lower frequency like frequency B would

135
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,760
be somewhere up here in my upfield region of the spectrum.

136
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,160
So we actually plot our data with higher longer frequencies at the left-hand side of

137
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,200
our plot, which might seem a little bit counterintuitive, but remember, this is the same type of information

138
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,720
that's included in a continuous wave experiment.

139
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,280
So to be sure that we can compare spectra collected in, say, the year 2014 with spectra

140
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,120
collected in the 1950s, we alter the axis in such a way that our frequencies are sort

141
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,740
of reversed from what we would expect.

142
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,620
So let's move on to another technique.

143
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,020
In 1895, a new class of electromagnetic radiation was discovered by German physicist

144
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,780
Wilhelm Rundgen.

145
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,140
Rundgen immediately realized the significance of his discovery and published his findings

146
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,540
the same year, referring to the uncharacterized radiation only as x-rays.

147
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,700
Rundgen was not the only one who saw potential in his new discovery, either.

148
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,820
He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics, in fact, the first one ever in 1901, just six

149
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,340
years after his discovery.

150
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,420
But it would be a decade after Rundgen's Nobel Prize award that one of the most impactful

151
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,820
applications of x-rays would be developed.

152
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,740
English physicist William Lawrence Bragg, working in collaboration with his father, opened

153
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,220
up this entirely new part of the electromagnetic spectrum to the art of identifying organic

154
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,420
molecules when he developed a technique to elucidate the structure of crystalline materials

155
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,340
using x-rays.

156
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,020
Bragg and his father had recognized that crystalline materials had a peculiar effect on x-rays as

157
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,020
they interacted.

158
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,620
There's a scattering effect caused by the electron cloud of each atom in the solid substance,

159
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,240
producing a spherical, diffracted wave of the same wavelength as the one which first came

160
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,060
into the crystal.

161
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,580
Now in a crystalline material, the atoms or ions are spaced regularly and evenly, creating

162
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,100
planes of evenly spaced positions capable of creating these spherical waves which propagate

163
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
out.

164
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,700
Now to give you an idea of how we can use this to get information about structure, I'm

165
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,280
going to show you a very simple relationship between just two atoms.

166
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,820
Each atom is represented here by one of my blue spheres.

167
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,460
So in the left case example, my two atoms are closer together in space than are the two

168
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,340
on the right side.

169
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,420
So how can I use x-rays to get information about the distances between these two?

170
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,980
Well, the key is in the scattering.

171
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,780
So if I have a coherent x-ray beam which in this case is going to be coming in from the

172
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,460
left hand side of my monitor and striking these atoms, their electron clouds respond

173
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,660
by emitting a spherical wave.

174
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,700
And that spherical wave has a very well-defined wavelength, exactly the same as the incident

175
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,940
light.

176
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,500
So let's create, in this case since it's on a two-dimensional surface, circles but

177
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,180
they'll represent the spherical waves that are created during diffraction.

178
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,740
Now the pattern looks pretty complicated, doesn't it?

179
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,100
But it's actually not as complicated as you may think.

180
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,660
Now x-rays have the ability to expose photographic film.

181
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,460
So if I place a photographic plate in a certain proximity to my crystal, only those locations

182
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,660
where the propagating spherical waves interfere with one another constructively, should I

183
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,820
see exposure?

184
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,540
So in this case, I expect to see a pattern of spots developing along my film where there

185
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,780
is constructive interference causing those spherical waves to continue propagating through

186
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,540
space.

187
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,540
Now let's do the same experiment but on my atoms that are spaced farther apart.

188
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,020
Again, my spherical waves propagate and in some places interfere constructively and in

189
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
others destructively.

190
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,180
But if I place my photographic plate at the same distance and do the same analysis, look

191
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,260
what's happened.

192
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,620
The spatial relationships of the exposures on my film have changed.

193
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,380
So by analyzing the patterns that result from this diffraction phenomenon, we can back-calculate

194
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,940
the spatial arrangement of atoms within a crystal and structure.

195
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,060
This is the principle on which x-ray diffraction works.

196
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,740
Now understanding how the diffraction patterns develop and actually observing them is always

197
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,620
challenging for students, in part because our eyes can't see x-rays, but our eyes can

198
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,380
see visible light.

199
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,100
And while the distances between atoms are so small that they require x-rays to resolve,

200
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,540
we can create little gadgets that we use in the classroom, in the laboratories, to show

201
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,820
a diffraction pattern using visible light.

202
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,620
I'm going to do that for you right now, so to help you out, I need to dim the lights.

203
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,140
Alright, I'm going to begin by showing you a dot from my laser pointer.

204
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,540
Not very exciting, is it?

205
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,660
But it's coherent light.

206
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,620
It's light of a single wavelength.

207
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,020
And when that light interacts with a grating, which is spaced somewhere around the wavelength

208
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,980
of that light, I can cause that light to diffract just like the x-rays do within a crystal.

209
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,380
For example, this is a diffraction pattern for a relatively simple grating.

210
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,820
And depending upon the spacing and the geometry of the separations, the striations and the

211
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:06,500
slides I'm using, I can create different patterns using just one laser pointer.

212
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,780
And encoded within these patterns is all the information about the geometry within the

213
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,500
striations in the slides.

214
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,140
In fact, with a little bit of practice and the right kit, I can show you the exact structure

215
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,300
that Rosalind Franklin and Watson and Crick saw when they characterized the structure

216
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,500
of DNA for the very first time.

217
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,380
This in fact contains all the symmetry elements of a DNA double helix.

218
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,540
It's a pretty amazing trick, isn't it?

219
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,140
All of those different patterns created using just a single beam of coherent red light and

220
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,660
some special slides, which you can't quite tell by looking at them, but they contain

221
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,980
striations that are just a few hundred nanometers wide and therefore interact with that visible

222
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,060
light in a very similar fashion to the way that the atoms within a crystal interact with

223
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,460
X-rays.

224
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,380
So by shining a beam of X-rays on a crystal, then exposing a photographic film to the diffracted

225
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,700
waves, a circular pattern like those we just saw with visible light can be obtained.

226
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,860
Encoded within this image are all the angles of these symmetry planes within the crystal

227
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
that produce them.

228
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:21,300
Now, in 1913, Bragg and his father famously published a paper detailing the crystal structure

229
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,340
of diamond by X-ray diffraction.

230
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,620
This structure is special because it proved for the first time that carbon was in fact

231
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:35,380
a tetrahedral atom in its SP3 hybridized state, just as chemists had suspected for decades.

232
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:44,220
And for that contribution, Bragg and his father shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915.

233
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,180
X-ray diffraction has since been used to validate many structural theories, including some of

234
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,500
those offered by chemists long before its creation.

235
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,180
A great example of this is the concept of aromaticity and anti-aromaticity.

236
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,460
It validated Kikuli's benzene ring with Robert Robinson's six evenly spaced carbon atoms

237
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,780
about a symmetrical six-membered ring.

238
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,540
It also has been used to test Huckel's rule for aromaticity and anti-aromaticity using

239
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,900
cyclo-octotetraene, which clearly has a puckert to the ring and also clearly has two different

240
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:23,020
carbon-carbon bond lengths within the ring because of its anti-aromaticity.

241
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,220
In recent years, it has helped to produce many of the amazing protein and DNA models

242
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,600
which we used in the associated units of this course, including the remarkable potassium

243
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,260
channel protein structures which won Roderick McKinnon and his Nobel Prize.

244
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,820
In short, X-ray crystallography may be the most powerful structural determination tool

245
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,660
ever invented.

246
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,500
Our final technique in this lecture will be mass spectrometry.

247
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,220
Now we call this technique spectrometry rather than spectroscopy because unlike the other

248
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,300
techniques that we've discussed so far, in mass spectrometry we're not measuring the

249
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,940
direct interaction of light with matter.

250
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,820
See, mass spectrometers were first developed to help us better characterize the structure

251
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,260
of atoms, but modern mass spectrometers are used more commonly in a variety of applications.

252
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,100
They find use in criminal forensics labs, searching for the residue of gunpowder or

253
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,060
the metabolites of illegal drugs.

254
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,100
Anyone who's traveled through the American airport system in recent decades has almost

255
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,700
certainly seen a security agent swab the baggage or clothing of a traveler inserting that swab

256
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,820
into a small device and then waiting for a result before allowing that passenger to pass

257
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,820
on.

258
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Well, the device that they're using is a mass spectrometer, searching for trace amounts

259
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,460
of chemicals used in the creation of explosives.

260
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,740
Modern mass spectrometers even have the ability to help us sequence sophisticated proteins,

261
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:56,680
characterize DNA and learn more about complex biomolecular systems too.

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,300
The influential analytical technique was first developed by British scientist Sir Joseph

263
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,340
John Thompson in the first decade of the 20th century.

264
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,700
Thompson was already a prolific physics researcher, having won the 1906 Nobel Prize

265
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,420
for his discovery of the electron a decade earlier.

266
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,980
Now you might think that reaching such a pinnacle of scientific achievement would mean that

267
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,780
Thompson would relax and enjoy his acclaim, but most researchers with the passion, talent

268
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,980
and determination required to win the Nobel Prize are not the kind to rest on even such

269
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,940
a high laurel, and Thompson was no exception.

270
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,700
As he continued his research into subatomic particles, Thompson turned his attention to

271
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,060
the nucleus of the atom, seeking any clue of the existence of subatomic particles there.

272
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,220
He found what he was looking for when he was able to create a beam of ionized neon gas

273
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,260
in his lab.

274
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,620
He aimed that beam at a piece of photographic paper, passing it through a magnetic field

275
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,060
to get it there.

276
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,100
And Thompson knew that when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences

277
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,900
a force which is dependent on its charge and velocity, but not on its mass.

278
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,460
So basically the field pushes all ions moving through it with equal force.

279
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,980
So naturally he expected to see all of his neon ions being deflected to the same extent,

280
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,340
striking the photographic paper in the same exact spot.

281
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,740
But what he saw was different and remarkable.

282
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,980
Two different spots formed on the developed paper.

283
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,900
So Thompson had observed neon atoms behaving as if they had two different masses.

284
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,300
He had proven the existence of elemental isotopes.

285
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,060
Atoms of the same element, different atomic masses.

286
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,820
The only logical explanation for his observation was that atomic nuclei must be made up of

287
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,380
something smaller than themselves.

288
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,780
But mass spectrometry is useful for much more than the study of atomic structure.

289
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,500
In the past half century it has become a favorite technique of chemical researchers

290
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,100
and forensics laboratories because of its amazing ability to identify unknown compounds

291
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,860
quickly and efficiently.

292
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,900
So let's get busy exploring a simple mass spectrometry experiment using an organic

293
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,660
compound.

294
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,460
For this discussion I'll be using a rather simple molecule, pentane, and describing

295
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,220
the most basic of mass spectrometry techniques.

296
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,540
The mass spectrometry experiment is extremely sensitive and requires that we generate a

297
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,740
high energy, very reactive species.

298
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,380
So the experiment has to take place in a really high vacuum.

299
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,620
This basically ensures that frequent collisions of our analyte ions with others or with atmospheric

300
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,380
gases are avoided.

301
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,740
Now inside of a typical mass spectrometer, the pressure is about the same as it is on

302
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,260
the outside of the International Space Station.

303
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:55,100
There are three main components to a mass spectrometer, an ionizer, a mass analyzer,

304
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,220
and a detector.

305
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,780
As the name implies, the ionizer is responsible for creating a beam of gas phase ions.

306
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,700
These ions then pass through a mass analyzer, which modifies their motion using an applied

307
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,580
magnetic field.

308
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,780
Finally, the ions collide with the detector placed such that only ions taking a specific

309
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,340
trajectory will strike it.

310
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,260
So step one for our pentane molecule is the ionization process.

311
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,300
In our example, we're going to use electron impact ionization as the ionization technique.

312
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,100
This method involves passing the gas phase pentane molecules through a beam of high

313
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,140
energy electrons.

314
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,980
And as this happens, occasionally an electron strikes a pentane molecule, knocking an electron

315
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,540
out of its cloud.

316
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,820
This process generates a radical cation of pentane.

317
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,820
Something like this would most likely never form in a lab bench, but in a high vacuum

318
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,220
being bombarded with electrons, we can expect to see some pretty strange things.

319
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,720
If the pentane survives the ionization process, it moves to a magnetic field which is carefully

320
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,500
shaped to deflect ions in a known direction.

321
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,020
Singly charged ions like ours moving through a field will experience a force.

322
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,340
Since force equals mass times acceleration, the acceleration or curvature of the ions

323
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,580
path is inversely proportional to its mass.

324
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,420
And because all moving singly charged positive ions experience the same force in our field,

325
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:38,060
we can say that more massive ions are deflected to lesser extents.

326
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,220
So knowing the mathematics governing the physics of deflection, we simply increase or decrease

327
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,740
the strength of the magnetic field until the detector indicates a hit.

328
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,960
So when using only monovalent ions, meaning ions with a single charge, we expect to see

329
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,820
just one peak for pentane at a charge to mass ratio of 72.

330
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,580
There will also be a few smaller peaks produced by the natural abundance of deuterium and

331
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:10,740
carbon-13 in our sample, so those will weigh 73, maybe even 74.

332
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,180
But this mass spectrum wouldn't be as useful as I led you to believe, would it?

333
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,900
After all, how many different organic compounds are there with a mass of 72?

334
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
There's plenty.

335
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:27,180
Just for a start, how about the three geometric isomers of n-pentane, isopentane and neopentane?

336
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,860
So how is it that mass spectrometry is so useful for identification when so many molecules

337
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,900
share the same molecular mass?

338
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,380
The answer lies in a phenomenon we initially neglected, which takes place during the ionization

339
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,780
process.

340
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,060
So let's rewind and look at our experiment one more time.

341
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,220
So let's set a few tenets before we continue our discussion here.

342
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,980
All mass spectrometry experiments require some kind of ionization.

343
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,180
Now the type that I'll talk about today isn't the only kind, but it's called electron impact

344
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,020
ionization, and it's very popular for use in small organic molecules.

345
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,780
And in this technique, a high-energy electron is going to impact a molecule and knock another

346
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,180
electron out of the cloud in a sort of game of molecular billiards.

347
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:20,820
So as a cartoon representation, here I have a gas-phase molecule, and my gas-phase molecule

348
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,700
has an electron cloud.

349
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,420
And I'm going to strike one of the electrons from that cloud with a high-energy electron

350
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,660
from outside the molecule.

351
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,460
Not pleasant for the molecule.

352
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:40,380
But what it does is relieve it of one electron, generating a cation with an unpaired electron,

353
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
which is a very unstable species.

354
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,900
So they don't always survive.

355
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,500
In fact, they rarely survive.

356
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,100
In many cases, they break apart.

357
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,020
And when they do so, most often, the charge and the radical or the unpaired electron

358
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,820
go the separate ways.

359
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,020
OK, so let's get out of the cartoon world here and look at a real molecule, pentane.

360
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
One more time.

361
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,620
We're going to ionize this with electron impact.

362
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,540
So my pentane has an electron cloud, which is depicted here in motion, and I have an

363
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:17,740
incoming high-energy electron, which strikes one and then ejects it from the electron cloud.

364
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,540
I've created a radical cation.

365
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,260
But remember, radical cations are very unstable.

366
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,380
And in the case of pentane, there can be a fragmentation.

367
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,220
I'm going to draw my fragmentation occurring here at one of the terminal carbon-carbon

368
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,980
bonds.

369
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,100
What takes place most often is a homolytic bond cleavage, which means the two electrons

370
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,940
go in different directions.

371
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,780
And when this happens, the bond breaks.

372
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:50,140
But not only that, but my radical and my positive charge go to separate sides of that broken

373
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,220
molecule or that broken ion.

374
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:02,300
So in this example, I've created a methyl radical and a butyl cation.

375
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,180
And the relative stabilities of these ions and radicals is what's going to dictate how

376
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,620
many of them form in my experiment.

377
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,420
So let's take a quick moment here and finish out our day by looking at what we expect to

378
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,900
be the mass spectrum of pentane.

379
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:23,460
The mass of pentane, or m over z as we report it, because z is a factor of charge, but remember,

380
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,620
our process only creates charges of 1.

381
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,380
So my m over z can be thought of as a mass.

382
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,380
I have my molecular ion with a mass of 72.

383
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,820
But I also can expect there to potentially be fragments involved in the breaking of the

384
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,940
terminal bond.

385
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:45,980
When this happens, I can get two possible pairs, a methyl radical and primary cation or a primary

386
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,020
radical and a methyl cation.

387
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,340
In these cases, the masses of the ions generated are 57 and 15 respectively.

388
00:28:53,340 --> 00:29:00,820
Similarly, I could have the internal carbon-carbon bond break, generating another two pairs.

389
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,460
But notice that this time, the two pairs that are generated are both primary, so a primary

390
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,140
radical and a primary cation, slightly more stable than the others.

391
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,820
So my peaks at m over z of 43 and 29 are expected to be a little bit larger.

392
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,780
In fact, that's exactly what we see in the mass spectrum of pentane using this method.

393
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,980
We see a mass spectrum in which the peaks at 29 and 43 are larger than those at 15,

394
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,220
57, and even at 72.

395
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,580
We also see a little bit of those isotope peaks in there.

396
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,100
So here we have smaller peaks for the ions that are generated along with radicals that

397
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,460
are of lower substitution.

398
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,860
We see larger peaks when there's greater substitution.

399
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,860
And again, in this case, the molecular ion itself is one of the smallest peaks in the

400
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,620
spectrum.

401
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,380
So if we continue thinking about our simple example of pentane, by comparing its fragments

402
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,700
and their abundance with those produced in isopentane and neopentane, we can find clear

403
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:06,260
and predictable differences which enable us to discriminate between their mass spectrum.

404
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,780
Of course, hydrocarbons are not the only compounds with this molecular mass.

405
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,100
Consider acrylic acid, also 72 atomic mass units.

406
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,540
Its molecular ion is the same mass as that of pentane.

407
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,340
But look at its fragmentation pattern.

408
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,780
It's quite different, isn't it?

409
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:28,460
So it's clear from the masses of the fragments that ions created by loss of a hydroxyl group,

410
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,300
loss of a carboxylic acid group, and also by loss of a vinyl group are all present.

411
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:41,220
So this example shows very clearly how not the molecular mass but the fragmentation pattern

412
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,860
is the key to much of the utility of this technique.

413
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,220
We've all probably heard the amusing story of a person making the unfortunate decision

414
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,020
to eat a poppy seed bagel before a urinalysis drug screening, only to be told afterward

415
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,380
that they've tested positive for heroin use.

416
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,140
The situation has been explored by such popular programs as mythbusters and parodied on popular

417
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,140
comedy programs like Seinfeld.

418
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,900
If the MS used in the urinalysis is so powerful and accurate, how then can it be defeated

419
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,700
by something as simple as a poppy seed?

420
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,740
The answer is actually quite simple.

421
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,580
And it's a perfect illustration of the limitation of spectroscopy and spectrometry in general.

422
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,980
You see, morphine and heroin only differ in structure by the presence of two acetyl groups.

423
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:35,100
Now these acetyl groups are added to the naturally occurring morphine from poppy seeds by a

424
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:41,500
sterification with acetic and hydride, a technique which we explored in our estrus module.

425
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,620
Now of course the seed from mature flowers is needed, and I'm leaving out a few important

426
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,100
details from the process in the hopes of avoiding a visit from the United States DEA after this

427
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,220
taping.

428
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,660
But where the story comes to bear on the limitations of spectrometry is this.

429
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:02,100
Once injected a fraction of the heroin molecules are slowly hydrolyzed back into morphine by

430
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,820
enzymes in the user's blood.

431
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,060
The resulting morphine is modified and further broken down in the liver.

432
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,380
And finally these metabolites are eliminated from the user's system winding up in their

433
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,180
urine.

434
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,700
Many drug urinalysis techniques use mass spectrometry to search for the metabolic byproducts of heroin

435
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,860
which are practically identical to those of morphine which is present naturally in poppy

436
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,100
seeds used in the food industry.

437
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,380
This is a fantastic example of the utility of even the most powerful instruments can

438
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,260
be not only a function of the technology, but of the human element as well.

439
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:46,300
In short, no spectral analysis is ever complete without careful contemplation on the part

440
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,740
of the researcher.

441
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,140
So let's summarize the last of our spectroscopic techniques.

442
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,980
Today we looked at pulsed NMR and how modern technology allows us to use superconducting

443
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,220
magnets and radio receivers to measure the larmor frequency of spin one half nuclei.

444
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,020
This reproduces the information from a continuous wave experiment, but in a miniscule fraction

445
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,340
of the time.

446
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,740
We touched on x-ray crystallography and how scattering of these high energy rays by the

447
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,780
electron clouds of highly ordered atoms leads to a pattern of interference in the scattered

448
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,980
light and this pattern can be used to back calculate that regular arrangement.

449
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,500
We viewed a few of these structures and discussed how this technique has been used to validate

450
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,420
many of the structural theories which preceded it.

451
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,100
Then we took a look at mass spectrometry and we saw how ionization, mass analysis and

452
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:47,300
detection systems work and specifically how electron impact generates the molecular

453
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,700
ions and fragment ions, how a magnetic field is used to deflect each ion to a detector

454
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,420
which generates an electrical current when struck by ions.

455
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,980
We discussed how the identity and abundance of fragments in the spectrum can be used to

456
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,740
deduce the structure of compounds analyzed even when multiple candidates have the same

457
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,100
molecular mass.

458
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,020
And finally we had an object lesson in the human element of identifications and how we

459
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,220
must always remember that these techniques have their limitations.

460
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,660
So we finished our short survey of techniques used for identifying organic compounds once

461
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,620
they've been made or extracted in the labs.

462
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,020
But we have yet to really discuss how we can achieve high levels of purity, the levels

463
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,540
of which are necessary to use some of these spectroscopic techniques.

464
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,260
We're going to broach this subject in our next lecture when we start by discussing how

465
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,380
to get the purest possible sample using a technique known as recrystallization.

466
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,900
I'll see you for that talk next time.
