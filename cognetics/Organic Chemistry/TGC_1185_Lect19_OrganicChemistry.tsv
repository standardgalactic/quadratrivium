0	16200	Steroid hormones are remarkably powerful organic molecules.
16200	20460	They can go far beyond simply determining the gender of a developing fetus.
20460	24280	Just consider the market for the two most commonly known of these compounds, estrogen
24280	26520	and testosterone.
26520	30440	Both are produced and marketed as pharmaceutical products to fight medical conditions associated
30440	33040	with aging.
33040	38280	testosterone's ability to promote a process known as anabolism or the building up of complex
38280	42960	organs and tissues in the body has made it a useful substance in both the legitimate medical
42960	50320	treatment of wasting diseases and also as a performance enhancing drug of abuse in athletics.
50320	55320	Estrogen and its derivatives are used as contraceptive medications and they also sometimes are
55320	61240	prescribed to postmenopausal women to help fight osteoporosis.
61240	65440	But it might surprise you to find out that both of these hormones with their drastically
65440	71920	differing metabolic effects are made up from the same starting materials in the body.
71920	76800	The common starting material in biological synthesis of these compounds is cholesterol
76800	82520	and in the early part of the 1900s a race was brewing to find a way to make this central
82520	86000	compound in vitro.
86000	90200	But one of the major challenges was finding ways to make new carbon-carbon bonds from
90200	92080	smaller molecules.
92080	97160	Now, during this period in time, dividing a new method to make this critical connection,
97160	102000	it was practically a guaranteed Nobel Prize.
102000	108040	In 1928, Otto Deals, a former student of the legendary Hermann M. L. Fisher and his own
108040	113880	protégé, Kurt Alder, published an article outlining a strategy then only called the
113880	116320	Dying Synthesis.
116320	122200	By the late 1940s, it was clear to all that this synthetic strategy was one of the keys
122200	126120	which would ultimately unlock the total synthesis of cholesterol.
126120	130200	In those days, a sort of holy grail of steroid chemistry.
130200	137360	In 1950, with the research groups of chemists Robert Robinson at Oxford and Robert Burns
137360	142520	Woodward at Harvard independently closing in on this goal, Deals and Alder received
142520	146120	their Nobel Prize for the Dying Synthesis.
146120	150740	In honor of the tremendous impact their development has had on organic chemistry, we now call
150740	154880	this reaction the Deals-Alder Reaction.
154880	159600	Hopefully by the end of the day, you will see exactly how they did it and why they
159600	162800	so richly deserve this honor.
162800	166880	But before we can begin to fully understand the Deals-Alder reaction, we need to take
166880	172440	a step back and analyze a little bit simpler compound than these large hormone compounds.
172440	177360	We need to take a look at compounds called conjugated diene.
177360	182840	The very simplest conjugated compound possible in organic chemistry is this hydrocarbon called
182840	184840	1-3-butadiene.
184840	189840	You may notice that the two double bonds of the compound appear to be separated by a carbon-carbon
189840	193320	single bond as I've drawn them here.
193320	198120	We recall that compounds with pi bonds, or the potential to have them, tend to have resonance
198120	202000	contributors which can stabilize those compounds.
202000	207000	And 1-3-butadiene is no different, having resonance contributors which contain pi electron
207000	210520	density in the intervening carbon-carbon bond.
210520	216360	Now, when this resonance involves the commingling of multiple pi bonds, as it does in our example
216360	222360	here, we refer to this special type of resonance as conjugation.
222360	226800	And then a compound comes with some important structural, physical, and chemical properties
226800	227800	as well.
227800	235120	You see, this is only achieved when all four of the pi atomic orbitals align with one another.
235120	241080	So for example, if I try to rotate the central carbon-carbon bond here by about 90 degrees,
241080	242840	I have a problem, right?
242840	246760	Because our two pi bonds will be oriented perpendicularly to one another.
246760	250720	And because of that, they can't have pi electrons move from one to the other.
250720	254480	In other words, I can't establish the resonance that I could previously.
254480	260200	Now, as you might suspect from this observation, conjugated dienes like ours have a strong
260200	266120	tendency to take on that planar conformation, which aligns P orbitals of all the sp2 carbon
266120	268000	atoms in the compound.
268000	273040	Now, all of this leads to a potential pair of stereo isomers in our example.
273040	279400	See, the partial pi bond character of that central carbon atom creates a restricted rotation,
279400	280960	producing two different isomers.
280960	287000	Now, we call these S-cis, or cisoid, which looks like this, or I can flip the central
287000	293240	pi bond and make it an S-trans, or transoid, conformation.
293240	299460	So the cisoid and transoid isomers, they tend to interconvert more quickly because there's
299460	301760	actually only a pi bond that needs to break.
301760	306760	So a bona fide cis and trans alkene, while they can't interconvert well at all, would
306760	309400	be interconverting much more slowly than this.
309400	314840	Nonetheless, the two different states, cisoid and transoid, can exist as individuals.
314840	320440	Now, you can see from this that the requirement for conjugation is that the double bonds are
320440	321440	alternating.
321440	327760	If the double bonds are more than one carbon-carbon bond apart, let's try that.
327760	330720	Let's put the double bonds more than one carbon-carbon bond apart.
330720	334240	Well, now there's an intervening sp3 carbon.
334240	338800	And because the intervening sp3 carbon has no available p orbitals, the electrons from
338800	342960	the two pi bonds cannot exchange by resonance.
342960	347720	And alternately, let's bring up a compound where the double bonds are not spaced at all.
347720	351480	They're right next to one another in what we call accumulated dyne.
351480	356360	Now, in this case, notice that the central carbon has to have two different p orbitals
356360	361040	participating in this bonding arrangement, and that means that it has to have two pi
361040	365600	bonds which are not parallel, but rather are normal to one another.
365600	370200	So in neither of these two cases, could we possibly make a compound that's conjugated?
370200	375000	It's only when we have that very special arrangement of alternating pi bonds that we see this very
375000	377440	special effect.
377440	383360	Now, in spite of what we know now about the remarkable mobility of pi bonds in conjugated
383360	388660	compounds, when we try to name them, we revert to the most stable resonance contributor as
388660	390160	our reference.
390160	396720	Of course, this is always a contributor with all-neutral atoms and alternating pi bonds.
396720	400800	The name is constructed in much the same way as simple alkenes, but with the alteration
400800	407200	that before the ene suffix, we insert the prefix die, try, tetra, etc. based upon the
407200	410560	number of double bonds present.
410560	416760	For example, what's commonly called vinyl ethylene would be named 1-3 butadiene.
416880	426920	Now, creating ever larger linear conjugated alkenes produces 1-3-5 hexatriene, then 1-3-5-7
426920	429760	octatetraene, and so on.
429760	435440	Now, you may be wondering at this point if the analogy extends to cyclic conjugated compounds,
435440	437920	and the answer to this question is yes.
437920	444480	For example, 1-3 cyclohexadiene would be considered a conjugated compound as well.
445480	450040	Yet again, you may wonder if conjugation in cyclic compounds can run the full circumference
450040	457120	of the ring, like in this putative 1-3-5 cyclohexatriene molecule.
457120	460880	The answer to that question spawns such a rich chemistry that we're going to give it
460880	463800	a lecture all its own next time.
463800	469200	So for now, let's keep our focus on acyclic conjugated compounds and leave the more complex
469200	473360	cyclics for another day.
473360	478800	Just as we did with isolated alkenes, we can also survey the effective conjugation on stability
478800	481560	using heats of hydrogenation.
481560	488080	So let's do this using a simple system with only a few isomers, like pentadines.
488080	494720	As a reference, the heat of hydrogenation of one pentene is 125 kilojoules per mole.
495720	501280	Now if we add a second double bond, which is isolated from the other by multiple carbon-carbon bonds,
501280	508400	we create 1-4 pentadiene, which contains two isolated double bonds.
508400	513800	Not surprisingly, the heat of hydrogenation doubles, because we've essentially added a second bond
513800	516720	of exactly the same type.
516720	524800	But hydrogenation of its regioisomer, 1-3 pentadiene, shown here in the transconfirmation,
524800	530320	releases less energy than the sum of that of two isolated double bonds.
530320	537240	It's this observation which first led to our understanding of the stabilizing effect of resonance.
537240	541680	This stabilizing effect extends far beyond simple diene hydrocarbons.
541680	545600	Resonance has similar effects on the stability of compounds containing heteroatoms,
545600	553120	like our familiar friend's enols, carbocation like allyl cation, and many others.
553120	556960	So let's take a closer look at our simple conjugated diene from earlier,
556960	561160	and see if we can explain this remarkable increase in stability.
561160	566720	We're going to begin by drawing it as what is clearly its most stable resonance contributor.
566720	569960	Then we're going to turn it on its side so that we can easily view the piatomic orbitals,
569960	576160	which are overlapping in space, to produce the new conjugated pi system.
576160	580200	Now if we try to create a representation of the resonance hybrid in this orientation,
580200	584600	it becomes clear that something very special is happening in our conjugated system.
584600	589000	The four pi electrons are not actually confined to those isolated pi bonds,
589000	593080	but rather have free run of the entire system.
593080	597600	So let's take a look at the molecular orbitals first of a simple isolated alkene
597600	603760	and analyze their energetics so that we can better understand the stabilizing effect one more time.
603760	607640	We want to start by showing you a very simple piatomic orbital.
607640	611360	And so far in the course I've shown you these orbitals as simply having two lobes,
611360	616360	one up, one down, one left, or one right, but always in opposition to one another.
616360	620680	But the truth is that piatomic orbitals have a characteristic called phase.
620680	625240	And we tend to show this phase as being plus and minus.
625280	630480	This is a rather unfortunate choice of terminology because it really has nothing to do with charge
630480	632200	or anything else that's up or down.
632200	635320	It could just as easily be bitter or sweet, beautiful and ugly.
635320	640240	They're just opposing phases, which means that I can draw my pi orbital like this
640240	643840	or I can just as easily turn the phase the other way.
643840	647520	So all pi orbitals have two potential states that they can be in,
647520	651360	that with their phases either up down or down up, plus minus or minus plus,
651360	655800	choose your language, but realize that they have two opposing phases.
655800	661280	Now what this means is that if I put another P orbital next to it in an attempt to create a pi system,
661280	665120	there are actually our two different potential arrangements.
665120	671320	An out-of-phase overlap, see, we have red-blue, blue-red, or an in-phase overlap,
671320	675920	where similar phases, red-red, blue-blue, are overlapping.
675920	680680	Now only orbital lobes that are in phase with one another can combine.
680680	684520	So we get what's called a node in the out-of-phase overlap situation.
684520	689960	This is a higher energy state and so the orbital formed by this will be higher in energy.
689960	695720	Whereas the in-phase overlap creates no node and in fact creates a larger space for the electrons to move
695720	698640	and this creates our pi bond.
698640	703000	Now these are atomic orbitals and the new orbitals that they form have shapes that look more like this,
703000	705640	which traverse larger regions of space.
705640	707640	But for today's discussion to keep things simple,
707640	712640	we're going to look more at the actual P atomic orbitals before they've actually been combined.
712640	721040	So we'll be using this representation, but we'll still be thinking about the large molecular orbitals as well.
721040	726680	So let's calculate now the energetics of the molecular orbitals in one three-butadiene.
726680	732200	So we know that our ethene had two different molecular orbitals, but what about one three-butadiene?
732240	739440	Well, its pi system has two pi bonds and therefore four electrons and four participating P orbitals.
739440	744720	So I'm going to turn the molecule on its side here and place the P system on top.
744720	748320	And then what we're going to do is we're going to analyze all the potential orientations,
748320	753920	every permutations of phase up and phase down for these four orbitals combined.
753920	756040	So let's start with the simplest.
756040	759680	When all the orbitals are in phase, there are zero nodes,
759680	764760	which means I've created a very stable region of space for the electrons to move in.
764760	769360	So I'm going to put this at the bottom of my energy axis and label it pi one.
769360	774800	So this is the orientation for my lowest energy molecular orbital.
774800	779960	The next best arrangement has a single node right through the middle of the pi system.
779960	782720	So this will be higher in energy than the previous orbital.
782720	785640	We're going to call that pi two.
785640	789640	We can continue this exercise creating a new overlap that has two nodes,
789640	792280	we're going to move that over and label it pi three.
792280	796080	And of course, the last potential permutation has three nodes
796080	800760	and we're going to move that to the highest energy position and call it pi four.
800760	804800	So what you might notice here is that if I put all these orbitals on an energy axis
804800	809640	and I put the non-bonding energy here, which means basically the energy of a vacant P orbital,
809640	814320	that some of the molecular orbitals are more stable and others are less.
814320	817600	So only when electrons move into these regions of space
817600	820360	will they be happier than if they're not in a bond at all.
820360	824440	To move into these orbitals would be energetically unfavorable.
824440	826960	Now fortunately, in the case of one-three-butadiene,
826960	829160	we have four total pi electrons,
829160	833560	which means they can all find a home in a lower energy orbital.
833560	837000	This is the source of the stability of conjugated compounds.
837000	841880	They offer a more stable lower energy orbital for the electrons to move into
841880	846800	when those P orbitals combine.
846800	849600	Now when they're down here in this region beneath, we call them bonding orbitals
849600	852840	for obvious reasons because they create a chemical bond.
852840	857240	But when we talk about orbitals up here above that non-bonding energy threshold,
857240	863760	we refer to them as anti-bonding orbitals because they're very high in energy.
863760	867640	But the effect is even more predictable and goes even further than that.
867640	872280	We can look at it by comparing one-three-butadiene, which we just looked at,
872320	878160	with a slightly larger conjugated alkene, one-three-five hexatriene.
878160	882640	So if we do the same exercise for these two compounds that we just did,
882640	886560	we'll find that when we turn them on their side and analyze their pi atomic orbital overlaps,
886560	889960	there are four molecular orbitals available for the butadiene.
889960	896600	And in this case, there will actually be six different orbitals possible for the hexatriene.
896600	900760	But there's something important you have to notice here beyond just the number of orbitals.
900760	904600	And that is that the distance between them in energy is changing.
904600	908440	Here the orbitals are closer together in energy than the others.
908440	912280	So if I take a look at these systems when populated,
912280	917120	both of them create more stable compounds than they would be if they didn't have conjugation.
917120	918800	So that's a good thing.
918800	923240	But the other important effect that we can see here is that the frontier molecular orbitals,
923240	926960	called the HOMO and LUMO for highest occupied molecular orbital
926960	930520	and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, are different.
930520	932880	Not only different, predictably so.
932880	939640	Extending conjugation decreases the frontier molecular orbital energy gap.
939640	944320	Now, in the meantime, nature has exploited this property of conjugated compounds
944320	949320	in the development of a rainbow of pigments used by plants to gather energy for photosynthesis,
949320	952800	attracts symbiotic animals, and even to protect themselves from light,
952800	956440	which could otherwise damage their cellular structure.
956480	961640	Now, one of the most familiar examples of this from our everyday lives is the pigment beta-carotene.
961640	965920	Now, this is an example of the structure of beta-carotene using chemdra.
965920	970680	Now, just like our much smaller examples, beta-carotene can absorb a very specific wavelength of light
970680	975760	to promote electrons in its pi system from the HOMO to the LUMO.
975760	980400	In this case, however, you can see that we have 22 p orbitals participating
980400	983200	in its frontier molecular orbital energy gap.
983200	987920	So that makes that gap so very small that it doesn't absorb ultraviolet light,
987920	992240	but rather low energy, visible light.
992240	997680	Now, if a specific color of light is absorbed when passing through or reflecting off of an object,
997680	1002560	even when as small as a molecule, our eye detects all of the remaining wavelengths
1002560	1009280	in the transmitted or reflected light, causing us to see the complementary color of that which is being absorbed.
1009280	1016760	In this case, orange is the complementary color to the absorbed blue light, so that's the color that we see.
1016760	1023200	Now, beta-carotene, which is right here, is responsible in part for the color of fresh carrots,
1023200	1029520	for which it was named, as well as certain color changes in the leaves of trees in autumn.
1029520	1033000	See, as fall comes, deciduous trees undergo a process called senescence,
1033000	1036080	during which they break down and reabsorb the valuable chlorophyll,
1036080	1039520	which helps them to produce food through photosynthesis.
1039520	1044120	Now, as the chlorophyll is removed from the doomed leaves, the other pigments, like this beta-carotene,
1044120	1047920	which were overwhelmed by its strong coloration, are given their chance to shine,
1047920	1053600	even if only for a few weeks, as the leaf dies and detaches from the now dormant tree.
1053600	1059240	And it's these 22 participating p orbitals in the resonance of beta-carotene
1059240	1062360	that are responsible for much of the orange color that you see.
1062360	1066360	So this year, when the fall foliage begins to burst with color, think about this.
1066360	1075480	What you're really observing is the result of a complex dance of pie electrons within the pigments of the leaves.
1075480	1082640	Now, you might also recognize that beta-carotene bears a striking similarity to another compound we've already looked at, retinol.
1082640	1084600	And that's not a coincidence.
1084600	1089520	Beta-carotene is one of a group of compounds commonly referred to as vitamin A.
1089520	1095720	And when ingested, some animal species, including humans, can convert beta-carotene into retinol.
1095720	1097520	But humans aren't very good at this.
1097520	1100240	Our bodies make our own retinol in other ways as well.
1100240	1108680	So we don't really have a need to convert large quantities of beta-carotene into this critical chromophore, or molecule which absorbs light.
1108680	1114080	So what happens when a carrot lover just can't say no to that 20th or 30th carrot stick?
1114080	1119640	Well, his or her body is unable to convert all the beta-carotene into retinol.
1119640	1123920	So instead, it stores the useful vitamin for a rainy day.
1123920	1127480	Now, beta-carotene, you probably noticed, is a hydrocarbon.
1127480	1132000	So it's naturally stored in the lowest polarity environment that your body can find.
1132000	1135960	Fat tissue just beneath your skin.
1135960	1141920	So if enough beta-carotene is consumed, and therefore stored in this way, it can lead to a yellowing of the skin.
1141920	1145240	Or even the appearance that the skin has turned orange.
1145240	1156480	This condition, called caroteneemia, is actually pretty harmless and will resolve itself over time with a minor dietary modification.
1156480	1161520	Although conjugated systems are somewhat more stable than similar but isolated pie systems,
1161520	1165720	they can and do undergo many of the addition reactions that we discussed previously.
1165720	1170320	For simple isolated alkenes, the same kind of reactions will apply to conjugated alkenes.
1170320	1173760	But with a few important caveats.
1173760	1178560	For example, the highly connected pie systems of conjugated compounds, like alkenes,
1178560	1184640	means that they can often undergo more complex addition reactions with unexpected regioisomers forming.
1184640	1191360	And the classic example of this is in the addition of a hydrogen halide to 1,3-butadiene.
1191360	1197000	So let's take a look at the addition of this hydrogen halide to 1,3-butadiene.
1197040	1202280	We're all familiar with hydrochloric acid and its properties and how it tends to react with alkenes.
1202280	1209320	So I'm going to put a 1,3-butadiene here in place of where we've already seen some isolated alkenes in earlier lessons in the course.
1209320	1217000	And your instinct is probably right here, to have your alkene attack the hydrogen of the HCl.
1217000	1220680	But in this case, you get more than one potential intermediate.
1220680	1225840	Notice that I could draw a carbocation with the positive charge on the secondary carbon here,
1225840	1229720	or I could draw it on the primary carbon here.
1229720	1233680	Now, of course, the truth about this is that it's really all the same intermediate.
1233680	1238280	And that what we're really looking at in this slide is two different resonance contributors
1238280	1244000	to what is actually a resonance hybrid with positive charges in two different locations.
1244000	1250800	Nonetheless, this means that attack can occur by the chloride on one of two different spots on the intermediate.
1250800	1253040	The chloride attacks the secondary carbon.
1253040	1259480	We get the product that one would probably anticipate based upon our earlier lectures on isolated alkenes.
1259480	1266040	If instead it attacks the primary carbon, we expect a product in which the chlorine has added actually four atoms away,
1266040	1270000	instead of two atoms away, from where we place the hydrogen.
1270000	1276720	So you can imagine in your mind that Z7 or Kovnikov would probably have a pretty good argument over this one, wouldn't they?
1276720	1281240	Because Z7 would clearly say the more substituted alkene is what you're going to make,
1281240	1287120	whereas Kovnikov is more likely to argue that the more stable carbocation will dictate the product of your reaction.
1287120	1292240	Now, although they didn't actually argue over this one, one can imagine it would be a pretty epic battle, wouldn't it?
1292240	1298280	And the real catch here, the real clincher is they would both be right. It just depends on the conditions.
1298280	1303880	We call the first situation here a 1-2 addition. This product tends to form very rapidly.
1303880	1313120	We call the lower example a 1-4 addition, and this product is actually more stable, but it also tends to form more slowly.
1313120	1318360	So we call these kinds of competitions between two different products which form under two different sets of conditions,
1318360	1323160	at least in this case, a thermodynamically or kinetically controlled reaction.
1323160	1327960	So let me explain a little bit more. Here's our reaction again, 1-3 butadiene with HCl.
1327960	1334400	But this time, let's consider the vertical here as being an energy axis and track the reaction as it goes.
1334400	1341400	So in the first step of my reaction, I'm going to form my intermediate where I have positive charge in two different regions.
1341400	1345040	Now, this is the same for either pathway, so I only have to draw one.
1345040	1350440	But at this point, the pathway splits and we go through two separate transition states,
1350440	1355800	one with the chlorine attacking at the primary and one with it attacking at the secondary.
1355800	1362680	But notice that the intermediate which results in the attack on the secondary carbon is actually lower in energy.
1362680	1369740	If we complete the reaction, though, what we find is that the higher energy transition state has led us to a lower energy product.
1369740	1373980	So the question here is, which is driving the major product of this reaction?
1373980	1379680	Is it the stability of the transition states, meaning the rate of the reaction, or the stability of the products,
1379680	1384140	meaning the thermodynamics or the free energy of the reaction?
1384140	1386580	So if we simplify this, it's a bit easier to see.
1386580	1392720	We have a fast pathway to an unstable product and a slow pathway to a more stable product.
1392720	1403720	So we call these kinetic products for that one which forms quickly and a thermodynamic product for one which takes longer to form but is more stable.
1403720	1410520	So in the earlier decades of the 1900s, synthetic organic chemistry was earning recognition as a powerful field of study,
1410520	1416160	tremendous potential for useful application in medicine, industry, and beyond.
1416160	1424360	But as the 20th century dawned, the library of synthetic techniques available to organic chemists was still somewhat lacking.
1424360	1430060	A particular challenge facing chemists was that need for techniques to create new carbon-carbon bonds.
1430060	1437220	You may notice as you review the previous lectures that examples of techniques which can accomplish this critical task are scarce.
1437220	1443180	In short, if you were a chemist in the early 1900s who could devise a new method for creating carbon-carbon bonds,
1443180	1448420	you might as well start writing your Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
1448420	1455520	One proof of this proviso is the Diels-Alder reaction, named for Otto Diels and Kurt Alder who we met earlier.
1455520	1465720	In 1928, they devised a reaction scheme which exploited the geometry of conjugated dienes and molecular orbitals to produce not just one new carbon-carbon bond,
1465720	1471820	but two new carbon-carbon bonds in a single step.
1471820	1478060	The Diels-Alder reaction is actually one of a class of reactions known as pericyclic reactions.
1478060	1488920	Pericyclic reactions consist of the exchange of multiple pi electrons simultaneously between two molecules to create two new sigma bonds between them.
1488920	1499460	The Diels-Alder is designated a 4 plus 2 pericyclic reaction because it involves this kind of a reaction between a conjugated diene having four pi electrons
1499460	1506720	and one pi bond from another reagent known as dienophile, which would have two pi electrons.
1506720	1514560	The simplest example which meets these criteria is the reaction between the cisoid isomer of 1,3-butadiene and ethene.
1514560	1517860	So let's start there.
1517900	1524700	To envision exactly how this reaction takes place, let's recreate the molecular orbitals of both molecules.
1524700	1536060	Recall from our earlier discussion in this lecture, 1,3-butadiene has four molecular orbitals of which the pi-2 is the highest occupied molecular orbital, or the HOMO.
1536060	1542360	And the pi-3 is the lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital, or the LUMO.
1542360	1553400	Now we collectively refer to the HOMO and LUMO as frontier molecular orbitals because they present the orbitals which can be vacated and occupied respectively when a reaction takes place.
1553400	1563400	Ethene is, of course, a bit simpler since it only has two p orbitals in its pi system, so pi-1 is the HOMO and pi-2 is the LUMO.
1563400	1568660	Now this is the exciting part where the elegant simplicity of this reaction shines through.
1568660	1584400	As the two reagents approach one another, we can see that the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile are in phase with one another on both sides, and that the same is actually true for the dien-LUMO and the dienophile HOMO.
1584400	1589000	Now here we can see why the diene has to be cisoid as well.
1589000	1598100	Transoid-butadiene has the ends of its pi system too far apart to achieve the needed overlap on both sides simultaneously.
1598100	1610640	What this means is that the two reagents are perfectly configured to exchange electrons on both sides in a concerted process, and this produces two new sigma bonds from four pi electrons.
1610640	1621240	The entropic penalty of making one molecule from two is very easily balanced and in fact overwhelmed by the enthalpy benefit of trading those two pi bonds for the two sigmas.
1621240	1624240	The new carbon-carbon bond creation is complete.
1624240	1627240	What a rush, right?
1627380	1634680	So what makes the four plus two reaction so easy to complete is this in-phase alignment of frontier molecular orbitals.
1634680	1644180	Because the molecular orbital geometries are perfectly set up for a reaction to take place, all we need to do is mix the reagents and wait for the molecules to collide.
1644180	1649180	So we call this a thermally activated reaction.
1649320	1667320	But if we try to conduct an analogous reaction, for example, in a two plus two cyclization, making cyclobutane from two molecules of ethylene, we see that the frontier molecular orbitals are not properly aligned when the compounds are in their lowest energy states.
1667320	1669820	We're not completely out of luck though.
1669820	1678820	We can resort to a trick called photoactivation, promoting electrons into higher molecular orbitals by shining light of just the right wavelength on them.
1678820	1688820	This essentially changes the identity of the frontier molecular orbitals, artificially creating the overlap that we can get for free in a four plus two.
1688820	1698820	Now, it's this detail that the Diels Alder reactions are thermally activated, that makes them so useful, and also the reason that I'm going to stick to the four plus two reaction as we go forward.
1698820	1708820	It also doesn't hurt that a number of biologically and commercially relevant compounds, such as cyclic terpenes, contain a cyclohexene motif.
1708820	1720820	Of course, the Diels Alder reaction can be performed with more complex dienes and dienophiles, leading to products with more robust stereochemistry than our cyclohexene products from the previous example.
1720820	1729820	Notice that in the addition of a dienophile to the diene, both of the new carbon-carbon bonds form on the same side of the newly created ring.
1729820	1740820	In the case of cyclohexene formation, this is purely an academic observation, since all substituents of the newly joined carbons are hydrogen atoms. But what if they're not?
1740820	1748820	To find a situation in which this applies, we need to look no further than the very first step of the Woodward synthesis of cholesterol.
1749820	1761820	Woodward knew that he was trying to make a compound with four fused carbon rings on it from much simpler starting materials, so why not consider the Diels Alder to start building his scaffold?
1761820	1773820	Why not indeed? Woodward began his synthesis using 1,3-butadiene to create his first fused ring. The Diels Alder process ensured that the desired six-membered ring would form.
1773820	1786820	But Woodward had a new problem in his synthesis. The newly fused rings had the proper connectivity, but were in the cis-confirmation, and clearly his final product had to be in the trans-confirmation.
1786820	1800820	Today, though, we've covered a great deal, so let's sum up. We discussed the phenomenon of conjugation, in which multiple pi bonds in resonance with one another lend extra stability to a compound or ion.
1801820	1815820	We made a few structural arguments for why this added stability exists, and we learned a new way of modeling the energies of conjugated pi systems in alkenes, backing up our predictions of stability with observed heat of hydrogenation.
1816820	1836820	We scratched the surface of conjugated diene reactivity by exploring two reactions. First, the hydrohalogenation of 1,3-butadiene, and how addition of the second double bond leads to two possible products, a kinetic one, the 1,2 product, and a thermodynamic one in the 1,4 product.
1836820	1848820	Then, we examined a Nobel Prize-winning reaction conceived by Otto Deals and Kurt Alder, a reaction which allows us to quickly and easily form not one, but two carbon-carbon bonds.
1849820	1863820	We discussed how the frontier molecular orbitals of reagents in the 4 plus 2 pericyclic reaction are perfectly suited for a thermally activated reaction, which can easily produce a motif which got Woodward started on his way to the total synthesis of cholesterol.
1866820	1877820	Next time, we're going to take a look at what happens when we take these linear conjugated systems to the next level by cyclizing them to produce a very special carbon scaffold. I'll see you then.
