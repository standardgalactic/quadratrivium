00:00.000 --> 00:17.500
In our journey through introductory organic chemistry, we've spent a great deal of time

00:17.500 --> 00:23.240
looking at ways to prepare organic compounds from one another, as well as ways to characterize

00:23.240 --> 00:29.200
the starting materials and products of the reactions that we have undertaken.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.560
So we've left one very important question yet unanswered.

00:33.560 --> 00:40.240
You see, it's very rare that any organic synthesis runs cleanly to absolute completion,

00:40.240 --> 00:46.720
producing no byproducts and leaving no starting materials behind.

00:46.720 --> 00:54.040
It's even rarer that we find organic materials in highly purified forms in natural sources.

00:54.040 --> 00:59.720
So knowing this, we have to ask ourselves the question, how do we purify organic materials

00:59.720 --> 01:04.780
sufficiently to study the molecules which make it up, or for that matter to use as food

01:04.780 --> 01:13.000
additives, medicines, or other applications which require very high levels of purity?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.920
In this segment of the course, we will investigate a few staple techniques used for isolation

01:17.920 --> 01:22.680
of organics in modern laboratory and manufacturing settings.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.720
Today in particular, we'll be interested in taking a look at two very important and

01:26.720 --> 01:33.680
widely used techniques, one for purification and the other to determine purities.

01:33.680 --> 01:41.800
And both of them rely on the tendency of organic molecules to form highly-ordered crystals.

01:41.800 --> 01:47.200
To find one of the first examples of mass-scale organic purification will take us to India

01:47.200 --> 01:50.400
in the 5th century BC.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.720
Now evidence shows that it was just around this time that the people of India began harvesting

01:55.720 --> 02:03.720
a wild reed which, when they chewed on it, became sweet-tasting and pleasant.

02:03.720 --> 02:08.080
This commodity quickly caught on in other regions of Asia and Europe.

02:08.080 --> 02:13.960
The Greek physician Diascorides wrote of it in the 1st century AD and records from the

02:13.960 --> 02:20.560
Tang dynasty confirmed that it was being cultivated in China as early as 600 AD.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.480
But the real turning point in the global spread of this product took place in the 3rd century

02:25.480 --> 02:27.200
AD.

02:27.200 --> 02:33.040
During this time, most of what is now Northern India was ruled by the Gupta dynasty.

02:33.040 --> 02:39.560
The Gupta dynasty is famous for its deep and altruistic value of cultural development.

02:39.560 --> 02:46.280
And economically beneficial cultural benefit, well, that was that much better.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.680
So it was during this golden age of Indian culture that techniques were developed to

02:50.680 --> 02:56.840
extract the juice from these reeds, then allow it to form crystals by drying it slowly in

02:56.840 --> 02:58.940
the sun.

02:58.940 --> 03:04.800
These crystals, it turns out, retained the sweet flavor of the reeds, yet spoiled far

03:04.800 --> 03:08.320
more slowly in their new crystalline form.

03:08.320 --> 03:14.560
Okay, by now you probably have put two and two together and figured out that I'm talking

03:14.560 --> 03:17.920
about crystalline sugar sucrose.

03:17.920 --> 03:23.360
It's extracted from sugarcane as a solution and then crystallized to create a more viable

03:23.360 --> 03:25.360
product.

03:25.360 --> 03:30.080
Now what you may not have known, though, is that by developing this process, the people

03:30.080 --> 03:36.440
of the Gupta kingdom were unwittingly performing what may have been mankind's first ever

03:36.440 --> 03:42.280
recrystallization experiment.

03:42.280 --> 03:48.920
So how is it that crystalline sucrose was stumbled onto so early in human history?

03:48.920 --> 03:54.760
After all, when most of us think about crystals, we think about very rare, expensive, and difficult

03:54.760 --> 03:57.200
to acquire materials.

03:57.400 --> 04:08.040
Well, it turns out that it is really not so surprising at all that crystalline organics

04:08.040 --> 04:13.080
might be some of the very first organic compounds isolated by man.

04:13.080 --> 04:17.320
The reason for this is hidden in the Gibbs free energy of crystals.

04:17.320 --> 04:23.200
Now, crystals are highly ordered, they're very ordered repeating arrangements of atoms

04:23.200 --> 04:25.240
or molecules.

04:25.240 --> 04:31.560
But organic molecules can also achieve this highly repeating patterns in the solid state.

04:31.560 --> 04:38.720
When they do so, the intermolecular attractions between and among the molecules become stronger

04:38.720 --> 04:43.280
and the free energy of the system naturally decreases.

04:43.280 --> 04:49.240
Since lower energy states are favored in nature, it stands to reason that highly ordered materials

04:49.240 --> 04:55.560
can form if the energetic benefit of their interactions exceeds the entropic penalty

04:55.560 --> 05:01.600
of assuming a highly ordered state.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.520
So let's take a look at a crystal structure forming and see if we can get our heads wrapped

05:06.520 --> 05:12.080
around this idea a little bit more of what makes pure crystalline materials relatively

05:12.080 --> 05:16.280
easy to come by.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.000
Let's start with a compound called benzomide.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.840
Now, benzomide has a fairly simple crystalline structure.

05:23.840 --> 05:28.000
It starts off with a pattern of repeating molecules in one of two orientations as I've

05:28.000 --> 05:29.440
shown them here.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.640
You notice the benzene ring and the amide groups pointing either one way or the other

05:33.640 --> 05:40.040
in each of the molecules within what would be the surface of a growing crystal.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
So here's my surface.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.120
Now, as a cartoon, I'm going to just grow my crystal by dropping in the molecules.

05:45.120 --> 05:49.080
We'll be talking very soon about how to practically accomplish this.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.280
But for now, let's just put our crystal together.

05:52.280 --> 05:58.000
So let me drop in a few more benzomide molecules in the proper orientation.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.600
Okay, now that repeating structure should be even more clear to you.

06:03.600 --> 06:08.000
It's very obvious that there are certain regions of the crystal where molecules are oriented

06:08.000 --> 06:14.440
in specific directions in an array that arranges them relative to one another in a very, very

06:14.440 --> 06:18.040
tight repeating pattern.

06:18.040 --> 06:23.280
This pattern creates a network of intermolecular attractions, including hydrogen bonds.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.880
Now, if I highlight them in the crystal here that I've created, it's very easy to see the

06:27.880 --> 06:31.040
repeating patterns.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.680
In addition to the stabilizing hydrogen bonds, there are dispersion forces, which we would

06:35.680 --> 06:40.600
also call London dispersion forces or van der Waals attractions.

06:40.600 --> 06:46.400
And this takes place where the pi systems of the benzene rings stack against one another,

06:46.400 --> 06:52.240
very similarly to the way that purine and pyrimidine bases do in DNA in the double helix.

06:52.240 --> 06:58.800
So there's an array of very carefully crafted intermolecular forces holding this crystal

06:58.800 --> 07:00.760
together.

07:00.760 --> 07:06.760
So this optimized set of intermolecular attractions leads to a very strongly held together, very

07:06.760 --> 07:13.280
stable crystal of this particular organic material.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.040
But what if I introduce something else?

07:15.040 --> 07:18.680
What if my sample is not absolutely pure?

07:18.680 --> 07:22.760
What kind of effect will that have on the energy of this crystal?

07:22.760 --> 07:26.480
Let's do that experiment right now.

07:26.480 --> 07:32.240
Let's rebuild our crystal of Benzemeib first.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.560
But this time I'm going to insert a few impurities.

07:35.560 --> 07:40.880
So again, here's my beautiful repeating pattern of my organic compounds aligned perfectly,

07:40.880 --> 07:45.120
so I have beautiful set of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces all holding that

07:45.120 --> 07:47.440
crystal together.

07:47.440 --> 07:53.320
Now I'm going to take these four molecules and make one very subtle change to them.

07:53.320 --> 08:01.360
I'm going to change them from Benzemeib to Benzaldehyde, taking away the NH2 group.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.400
Now look what happens when I do that.

08:03.400 --> 08:08.600
I have removed the ability of these molecules to form the hydrogen bonds which stabilize

08:08.600 --> 08:13.640
the crystal in this very specific localized position.

08:13.640 --> 08:19.680
So all of these hydrogen bonds that I've colored in red no longer can be formed.

08:19.680 --> 08:26.360
So by including just a few molecules of Benzaldehyde in my pure crystal or otherwise pure crystal

08:26.360 --> 08:32.680
of Benzemeib, I have decreased the overall strength of the intermolecular forces holding

08:32.680 --> 08:34.400
them together.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.680
So the fact that I'm missing these intermolecular attractions means that the free energy of

08:38.680 --> 08:40.160
my crystal is higher.

08:40.160 --> 08:46.240
In other words, it's less stable, it's a weaker crystal, and it's easier to disassemble.

08:46.240 --> 08:52.080
So if we can make crystals grow very slowly, under conditions favoring the most stable crystal

08:52.080 --> 08:57.240
formation with all the strongest intermolecular attractions possible, we should be able to

08:57.240 --> 09:00.600
produce crystals of very high purity.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.720
And this is a good thing because we rarely find compounds like sucrose all alone in nature.

09:05.720 --> 09:10.760
In biologically sourced solutions like cane juice, they can be up to 20% sucrose, but

09:10.760 --> 09:15.640
we find smaller concentrations of all of its subunits like glucose and fructose, as well

09:15.640 --> 09:20.560
as small amounts of many other biological molecules.

09:20.560 --> 09:25.760
In the days of the Gupta dynasty, this was not likely to be a concern to them.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.800
Good solidified or crystallized sugar was enough to get the job done.

09:30.800 --> 09:36.520
But today's chemists and chefs for that matter find need for highly purified sucrose so that

09:36.520 --> 09:44.040
we can use it under more controlled conditions demanded by the state of the art.

09:44.040 --> 09:49.000
So early sugar was most likely produced by evaporating water from cane juice as rapidly

09:49.000 --> 09:51.520
as possible.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.960
If however, the solution expelled from sugar cane is slowly allowed to concentrate past

09:56.960 --> 10:01.660
the point of saturation, meaning the sugars contained therein will be compelled to take

10:01.660 --> 10:04.600
on a solid form or precipitate from the solution.

10:04.600 --> 10:10.800
Well, if we produce a concentrated solution of organic molecules like sucrose, then somehow

10:10.800 --> 10:15.880
induce that system to become super saturated, meaning that it has more dissolved sucrose

10:15.880 --> 10:18.040
than it normally could hold.

10:18.040 --> 10:23.280
We expect the growing crystals of sucrose to exclude the other contaminant solutes

10:23.280 --> 10:30.120
in order to achieve optimal intermolecular attractions.

10:30.120 --> 10:35.280
To better understand the process of crystallization, let's take a look at a compound called phthalic

10:35.280 --> 10:36.280
acid.

10:36.280 --> 10:39.400
I have a sample of phthalic acid here on the bench.

10:39.400 --> 10:44.440
I also have a beaker of water, which I can use to dissolve the phthalic acid.

10:45.280 --> 10:50.560
Now phthalic acid has a solubility of about 18 grams per milliliter in boiling water,

10:50.560 --> 10:52.640
extremely high.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.580
But it's only about 0.6 per milliliter in cold water.

10:57.580 --> 11:02.560
So if my phthalic acid isn't quite pure, its crystals aren't as stable as they could

11:02.560 --> 11:05.080
possibly be.

11:05.080 --> 11:09.080
But how are they going to get to that more purified, more stable state?

11:09.080 --> 11:13.360
Clearly, the molecules in my crystals are not going to spontaneously rearrange in the

11:13.360 --> 11:18.880
solid phase, expelling any contaminants that might be in them, at least not in my lifetime.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.360
And this camera crew, they're paid by the hour.

11:21.360 --> 11:26.480
So let's see if we can speed it up a little bit, okay?

11:26.480 --> 11:30.960
So what we need to do is disassemble these crystals at the molecular level, separating

11:30.960 --> 11:35.520
them all in such a way that the phthalic acid molecules get a second chance to order

11:35.520 --> 11:37.960
themselves in a more stable state.

11:37.960 --> 11:42.680
And of course, one way to accomplish this separation is to dissolve the crystals, separating

11:42.680 --> 11:45.660
them all within a solvent.

11:45.660 --> 11:48.920
So I've set myself up to do this task right here.

11:48.920 --> 11:53.440
What I have is a beaker containing phthalic acid that's been purchased, which is about

11:53.440 --> 11:57.920
98% pure, a smaller beaker, which I'm not going to touch.

11:57.920 --> 12:02.440
This is phthalic acid, which I have contaminated with a red organic molecule, so that we can

12:02.440 --> 12:07.360
see that contaminant as it behaves in the system that we're about to subject it to.

12:07.360 --> 12:11.880
And the larger beaker here is what I'm actually going to be purifying.

12:11.880 --> 12:17.080
And in order to purify this, I'm going to use nothing more than water and some heat.

12:17.080 --> 12:23.520
Now this water is already hot, so let me get my safety glasses on just in case.

12:23.520 --> 12:28.560
I'm going to turn my hot plate back on, which is also a magnetic stir plate.

12:28.560 --> 12:33.200
It contains a magnetic element underneath of the surface of the ceramic hot plate, which

12:33.200 --> 12:38.440
I can use to articulate this little magnetic spin bar inside.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.920
So this allows me to more thoroughly heat my solvent more rapidly.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.320
So while that's going, I'm going to put on some gloves.

12:46.320 --> 12:56.640
And hopefully, they'll stay in one piece while I put them on.

12:56.640 --> 13:01.080
So these are disposable latex gloves, they're really just designed to protect my hands from

13:01.080 --> 13:06.520
the chemicals I'm dealing with, even though they're fairly safe as organic compounds go.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.280
So very soon my water will be boiling.

13:08.280 --> 13:12.360
I've preheated it to accelerate this process so that we can see what goes on.

13:12.360 --> 13:18.000
But what I'm going to do as soon as this gets warm enough is add my water to this beaker

13:18.000 --> 13:23.040
containing phthalic acid and a little bit of the red organic contaminant to see if we

13:23.040 --> 13:27.680
can get rid of it by disassembling it at the molecular level through dissolution and then

13:27.680 --> 13:32.720
encouraging it to crystallize, but very slowly.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.200
And since this is a very hot flask of water, I'm going to put a glove over my hand to protect

13:37.200 --> 13:41.400
it from the heat as well as the chemicals.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.520
And let's get started with the dissolution process.

13:45.520 --> 13:54.960
Again, this is fairly hot water, but you could clearly see that it wasn't completely boiling.

13:54.960 --> 14:00.760
So it's going to require a little bit more help to get it to thoroughly dissolve.

14:00.760 --> 14:06.080
And in order to do this, I've given myself an extra spin bar, which I'll add to the beaker

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
now.

14:07.080 --> 14:13.000
And I'm going to return everything to my hot plate.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.840
So we can see that the spin bar is moving because the powder is flowing, and now we need

14:16.840 --> 14:20.160
to give it some time to heat up.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.440
Now in this case I'm heating my recrystallization solution on a hot plate.

14:24.440 --> 14:28.720
Now the surface of the hot plate can reach temperatures well in excess of 300 degrees

14:28.720 --> 14:33.680
centigrade, which is hot enough to cause many organic solvents to catch fire spontaneously

14:33.680 --> 14:35.080
in air.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.680
So the only reason that I'm heating this particular solution the way that I am now is because

14:39.680 --> 14:43.340
the solvent that I'm using is water, which is not flammable.

14:43.340 --> 14:47.040
Water is essentially hydrogen that's already been burned, so it's not possible to burn

14:47.040 --> 14:50.000
it any further.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.640
In a future lecture, we'll actually take a look at some ways that we do heat organic

14:53.640 --> 14:58.560
solvents in safer ways than what I'm doing here, again if this were in fact an organic

14:58.560 --> 15:00.480
material.

15:00.480 --> 15:04.200
So we've finished boiling our solution of phthalic acid.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.580
Now as you can see, I'm so saturated that I'm already starting to get a little bit forming

15:08.580 --> 15:10.400
on the top of my solution.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.880
And also you can see that I've had to add a little bit more water as the boiling process

15:13.880 --> 15:18.720
went on to be sure that I got the vast majority of my compound dissolved.

15:18.720 --> 15:22.880
So now we have to wait and allow slow cooling to take hold.

15:22.880 --> 15:27.620
The reason that slow cooling needs to take place is that we want to give all of the phthalic

15:27.620 --> 15:33.040
acid molecules in solution ample time to find those perfect orientations as they come in

15:33.040 --> 15:36.080
and become part of the growing crystal.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.280
If we do this, any other molecule that tries to get involved with that crystal will not

15:40.280 --> 15:46.720
adhere as strongly as phthalic acid and can simply be excluded as the crystal grows.

15:46.720 --> 15:53.440
So if my original solution was made correctly and I have thoroughly separated molecules

15:53.440 --> 15:58.800
of phthalic acid and impurity, I should have only phthalic acid growing back in its crystals

15:58.800 --> 16:01.480
leaving the impurity behind in solution.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.880
But that's going to take a little bit of time because this has to cool all the way from

16:05.880 --> 16:11.480
100 degrees centigrade down to around room temperature where the solubility of phthalic

16:11.480 --> 16:16.600
acid is somewhere around one-thirtieth that of the total solubility of phthalic acid in

16:16.600 --> 16:24.440
boiling water.

16:24.440 --> 16:30.680
So as my solution cooled slowly, the solubility of the phthalic acid drops dramatically.

16:30.680 --> 16:36.360
So that particular compound now has nowhere else to go but out of solution.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.640
The key here is that I allow the process to happen very slowly.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.120
So I guess it's a good thing I like to talk.

16:43.120 --> 16:48.720
Now by cooling slowly, I've avoided trapping of impurity molecules in those growing crystals

16:48.720 --> 16:54.960
and at the completion of my recrystallization, I have very large, well-formed, pure phthalic

16:54.960 --> 17:00.400
acid crystals that can simply be removed from solution by a technique like filtration.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.840
So if I light my sample a little bit, you can probably see in the front and the bottom

17:04.840 --> 17:09.400
there, I've got some very large, very well-formed crystals and I'm going to try to retrieve

17:09.400 --> 17:15.080
those now, not using filtration but instead using a simpler technique to separate liquids

17:15.080 --> 17:18.320
from solids known as decanting.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.400
Decanting is actually quite simple.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.000
I'm just going to try to pour the liquid out from this beaker while leaving as much

17:24.000 --> 17:26.200
of the solid behind as possible.

17:26.200 --> 17:31.360
It just takes a steady hand and a little bit of patience to remove that liquid.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.360
There we go.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.920
And as I begin to remove the liquid, it should become clear how pure these crystals really

17:44.920 --> 17:45.920
are.

17:45.920 --> 17:54.200
They're not only large and well-formed but safe for just a little bit of the solution

17:54.200 --> 17:59.080
that they crystallized from, which is sometimes called the mother liqueur, there's really

17:59.080 --> 18:01.320
not a lot of red to speak of.

18:01.320 --> 18:06.720
So the impurity is now in solution, which I have separated from the majority of my crystals,

18:06.720 --> 18:10.680
few of which I'm going to dig out now, so that we can take a look at the difference

18:10.680 --> 18:18.000
in size and shape in comparison to what we started with.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.560
So here are just a few of the crystals that formed.

18:21.560 --> 18:28.440
And when we compare them to not only the sample that we started with that was impure, we can

18:28.440 --> 18:33.720
clearly see that the color is a lot more white, but the crystals are even larger than the

18:33.720 --> 18:38.680
material that I started with before it was even fouled by this red compound.

18:38.680 --> 18:44.280
So large crystals of the proper color tell me that I have at least in part successfully

18:44.280 --> 18:47.160
purified what was an otherwise impure sample.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.800
So washing these with a little bit of cold water will probably get a crystal that's almost

18:50.800 --> 18:54.680
as white and pure as the one that we started with before we ever added any dye at all.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.560
This is the power of recrystallization.

18:58.560 --> 19:03.480
So pure crystals tend to be more stable than their impure counterparts.

19:03.480 --> 19:07.200
Now we've already looked at how this can be used to purify a compound by crystallizing

19:07.200 --> 19:12.800
it from a solution, but we can exploit this phenomenon in a completely different way by

19:12.800 --> 19:19.480
observing the melting behavior of a sample to help us identify it and also assess its

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
purity.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.200
So let's take a look at that right now.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.880
I'm going to bring back a crystal that we've looked at once already.

19:25.880 --> 19:29.200
That's the Benzamine crystal.

19:29.200 --> 19:33.600
And again I'm going to build this beautiful network of intermolecular attractive forces

19:33.600 --> 19:38.040
holding it all together, the hydrogen bonds, the van der Waals forces.

19:38.040 --> 19:42.960
Now because there's so many forces holding it together, it's very difficult to take

19:42.960 --> 19:49.000
the crystal apart, not only by dissolution, but also by melting, which involves heating.

19:49.000 --> 19:56.280
So if I give these molecules a little bit of kinetic energy by adding some heat, let's

19:56.280 --> 19:57.840
take a look at what happens.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.880
Well they have a little bit of kinetic energy now, they want to be free to move, but they

20:01.880 --> 20:07.160
don't want to move badly enough because there are too many forces holding them all together.

20:07.160 --> 20:11.540
But if I continue to add energy in the form of heat, I eventually reach a point at which

20:11.540 --> 20:15.800
there's enough kinetic energy contained in those molecules that they no longer can be

20:15.800 --> 20:23.040
held together by those forces within the crystal, and melting takes place.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.920
But if there's an impurity present, just as there was last time in our example, where

20:26.920 --> 20:33.320
we had Benzamide with a little bit of Benzaldehyde contained inside, well remember, we had to

20:33.320 --> 20:38.400
sacrifice these specific intermolecular forces, meaning that overall there's less holding

20:38.400 --> 20:40.680
that crystal together.

20:40.680 --> 20:45.240
What this means from a bulk perspective is, as I heat up a crystal that has impurities

20:45.240 --> 20:51.400
and imperfections, like those missing intermolecular attractions, my weaker crystal should melt

20:51.400 --> 20:52.760
more easily.

20:52.760 --> 20:56.960
And indeed, in my example here, I add a little bit of heat, and that's all the kinetic energy

20:56.960 --> 21:02.360
it takes to get my molecules moving enough to overcome whatever forces are remaining

21:02.360 --> 21:04.280
holding it together.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.480
So just as dissolution involves liberating individual molecules from one another by

21:08.480 --> 21:14.680
salvation, so melting liberates them by heating them until they have sufficient kinetic energy

21:14.680 --> 21:18.380
to overcome those forces holding them together.

21:18.380 --> 21:24.060
With this in mind, the logic behind using melting to assess purity should become clear,

21:24.060 --> 21:29.000
that more purified crystals have greater forces holding them together, meaning they require

21:29.000 --> 21:31.580
more energy to melt.

21:31.580 --> 21:37.900
In other words, as purity increases, so does the melting point.

21:37.900 --> 21:44.340
This concept is clearly illustrated using a hypothetical phase diagram for a binary system.

21:44.340 --> 21:48.580
Now in order to construct this kind of phase diagram, we first take the phase diagram for

21:48.580 --> 21:52.460
a pure substance, which we could just call substance A.

21:52.460 --> 21:56.500
So here I've drawn one for you with all the phase transitions that we recognize from an

21:56.500 --> 22:02.740
introductory chemistry course, including boundaries for melting and freezing, boiling and condensing,

22:02.740 --> 22:06.940
and of course sublimation and deposition.

22:06.940 --> 22:10.660
But this diagram only applies to a pure substance.

22:10.660 --> 22:16.900
So to create a binary phase diagram, we settle on a constant pressure, like one atmosphere,

22:16.900 --> 22:19.380
the pressure in most laboratories.

22:19.380 --> 22:26.140
And at that pressure, we project the diagram along a third axis of composition.

22:26.140 --> 22:30.020
When we do this for two hypothetical solids, which in this example we could call A and

22:30.020 --> 22:37.180
B, focusing on that melting transition, the result looks something like this.

22:37.180 --> 22:42.660
So here's my phase diagram for a binary system at a given pressure.

22:42.660 --> 22:47.940
Notice that my horizontal axis is now mole percentage, meaning that on the left-hand

22:47.940 --> 22:53.020
side I'm dealing with pure, in this case green squares, and on the right-hand side pure,

22:53.020 --> 22:58.700
whatever this molecule may be, we've called it red triangles for illustration purposes.

22:58.700 --> 23:02.740
But there's some very interesting features to this phase diagram that you don't see in

23:02.740 --> 23:05.140
the phase diagram for a pure substance.

23:05.140 --> 23:10.660
So let's wipe this clean and rebuild the phase diagram piece by piece, investigating the

23:10.660 --> 23:16.260
effects of mixing one compound into another.

23:16.260 --> 23:22.100
Let's start with this compound over here, my green squares, when it's absolutely pure.

23:22.100 --> 23:27.420
Now I know that when it's absolutely pure, its melting point should be a single temperature.

23:27.420 --> 23:32.580
There is only one temperature at which a pure substance can coexist with itself in liquid

23:32.580 --> 23:34.780
and solid forms.

23:34.820 --> 23:40.700
So if I were to heat a sample of this compound, I expect it to be solid up to its melting

23:40.700 --> 23:48.380
point, after which I expect it to transition into a liquid and I can continue heating.

23:48.380 --> 23:52.620
But look what happens as I introduce a little bit of my other compound, in this case as

23:52.620 --> 23:54.700
an impurity.

23:54.700 --> 23:58.660
Well, two very interesting things happen.

23:58.660 --> 24:04.500
First is that the phase boundaries move downward, and the second is that there are actually

24:04.500 --> 24:08.340
two of them, not a single phase boundary anymore.

24:08.340 --> 24:13.220
So what this means is that if I were to heat up a solid of a composition, let's say somewhere

24:13.220 --> 24:18.740
in this region where I have mostly my green squares, but a little bit of my red triangles,

24:18.740 --> 24:19.900
take a look at what happens.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.700
I pass through another range of my diagram.

24:22.700 --> 24:27.780
It actually takes a range of temperatures to melt, not only that, but both of them are

24:27.780 --> 24:32.580
lower than the original melting point of my green square compound.

24:32.580 --> 24:38.180
We call this phenomenon melting point depression, and it occurs because one compound is acting

24:38.180 --> 24:43.940
as an impurity in the other, disrupting the forces holding the crystal lattice together.

24:43.940 --> 24:48.060
And the broadening that takes place in the melting transition is known as incongruent

24:48.060 --> 24:53.300
melting, which is an effect of having one compound moving into the liquid phase faster

24:53.300 --> 24:58.980
than the other as melting takes place, thereby changing the composition of the solid as well.

24:58.980 --> 25:05.820
So there's a range of compositions which can coexist and liquid solid forms for mixtures.

25:05.820 --> 25:08.980
But then we reach an interesting point in the diagram.

25:08.980 --> 25:13.700
It comes back to a confluence at a point somewhere in the middle of the phase diagram, though

25:13.700 --> 25:18.060
not necessarily directly in the middle of the way I've drawn it here.

25:18.060 --> 25:24.500
This is known as the eutectic point, eutectic meaning easy melting essentially.

25:24.500 --> 25:28.700
And once we cross that eutectic point, which by the way is the only composition at which

25:28.700 --> 25:34.900
a single melting temperature exists, we start to see the transition temperatures go back

25:34.900 --> 25:42.540
up, until eventually they reach a confluence again at pure compound B, or in my case red

25:42.540 --> 25:44.740
triangles.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.020
So what's going on here?

25:46.020 --> 25:49.300
Well, what's going on here is we've reached a point where we can start to think of it

25:49.300 --> 25:53.340
as green squares are now the impurity in my red triangles.

25:53.340 --> 25:59.460
And so my melting point goes back upward as my sample becomes purer and purer in the

25:59.460 --> 26:01.900
other compound.

26:01.900 --> 26:06.460
So I simply create a sort of a reflection, although the absolute temperatures and widths

26:06.460 --> 26:09.940
of these transitions are not necessarily the same on both sides.

26:09.940 --> 26:13.780
But these features are very consistent in well-behaved binary systems.

26:13.780 --> 26:18.100
Finally, of course, we reach the point where we have our melting point for our pure red

26:18.100 --> 26:22.340
compound, and again we have a single transition temperature.

26:22.340 --> 26:26.420
So why do we need to understand that kind of complex phase behavior?

26:26.420 --> 26:32.700
Well, because it gives us a useful tool to confirm the identity and purity of a compound.

26:32.700 --> 26:37.400
We use a device commonly referred to as a melt-temp apparatus, which consists of a heating

26:37.400 --> 26:40.980
block with a temperature control and a viewing window.

26:40.980 --> 26:45.300
Now if I load a sample of my original crude sathalic acid in one of my recrystallized

26:45.300 --> 26:52.260
material, I can confirm that the melting point of the purified material should be higher.

26:52.260 --> 26:57.300
Not only that, but if I were to make a third sample consisting of my purified thalic acid

26:57.300 --> 27:02.180
ground thoroughly with a small amount of a standard, that would allow me to confirm its

27:02.180 --> 27:07.700
identity since adding anything but the same compound to itself should reduce the sample's

27:07.700 --> 27:09.900
melting point.

27:09.900 --> 27:14.660
If my sample were anything but thalic acid, the melting point of the mixture with standardized

27:14.660 --> 27:18.180
thalic acid should be depressed.

27:18.180 --> 27:23.220
We call this simple technique a mixed melting point analysis, and it's a very commonly used

27:23.220 --> 27:29.020
quick check for purity and identity when synthesizing compounds in a lab.

27:29.020 --> 27:33.260
So today we started to think beyond simply making and characterizing a product to the

27:33.260 --> 27:36.860
question of how we might purify one.

27:36.860 --> 27:41.180
We discussed the effect of the presence of impurities on organic crystalline solids and

27:41.180 --> 27:46.300
how they tend to reduce the favorable intermolecular forces holding the crystal together, creating

27:46.300 --> 27:49.540
a crystal which is less stable.

27:49.540 --> 27:54.700
We took a look at how this observation can be used to devise a way to purify such materials

27:54.700 --> 28:00.380
by dissolving a sample to solve and separate all the constituent molecules, then cooling

28:00.380 --> 28:06.380
or concentrating the solution very slowly to promote formation of the most stable, pure

28:06.380 --> 28:09.660
crystal.

28:09.660 --> 28:14.460
We discussed the process of melting an organic crystalline solid and how the inclusion of

28:14.460 --> 28:19.940
different molecules usually results in not only a depressive melting point, but also in

28:19.940 --> 28:25.620
a broadening of the melting transition resulting from a phenomenon called incongruent melting.

28:25.620 --> 28:31.020
Finally, we talked a bit about how we can use the phase behavior of such solids as a

28:31.020 --> 28:38.060
means of probing their purity and identity using a mixed melting point analysis.

28:38.060 --> 28:43.620
Next time, we're going to turn our attention to another familiar phase transition, boiling.

28:43.620 --> 28:49.100
We'll explore how phase behavior of more volatile organics can also be used to purify

28:49.100 --> 28:50.100
and identify them.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.140
I'll see you for that discussion next time.
