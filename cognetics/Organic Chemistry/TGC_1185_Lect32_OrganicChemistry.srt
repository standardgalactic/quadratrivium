1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,500
In our journey through introductory organic chemistry, we've spent a great deal of time

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,240
looking at ways to prepare organic compounds from one another, as well as ways to characterize

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,200
the starting materials and products of the reactions that we have undertaken.

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,560
So we've left one very important question yet unanswered.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:40,240
You see, it's very rare that any organic synthesis runs cleanly to absolute completion,

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,720
producing no byproducts and leaving no starting materials behind.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,040
It's even rarer that we find organic materials in highly purified forms in natural sources.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,720
So knowing this, we have to ask ourselves the question, how do we purify organic materials

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,780
sufficiently to study the molecules which make it up, or for that matter to use as food

10
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:13,000
additives, medicines, or other applications which require very high levels of purity?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,920
In this segment of the course, we will investigate a few staple techniques used for isolation

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,680
of organics in modern laboratory and manufacturing settings.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,720
Today in particular, we'll be interested in taking a look at two very important and

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,680
widely used techniques, one for purification and the other to determine purities.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,800
And both of them rely on the tendency of organic molecules to form highly-ordered crystals.

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,200
To find one of the first examples of mass-scale organic purification will take us to India

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
in the 5th century BC.

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Now evidence shows that it was just around this time that the people of India began harvesting

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:03,720
a wild reed which, when they chewed on it, became sweet-tasting and pleasant.

20
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,080
This commodity quickly caught on in other regions of Asia and Europe.

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,960
The Greek physician Diascorides wrote of it in the 1st century AD and records from the

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,560
Tang dynasty confirmed that it was being cultivated in China as early as 600 AD.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,480
But the real turning point in the global spread of this product took place in the 3rd century

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,200
AD.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,040
During this time, most of what is now Northern India was ruled by the Gupta dynasty.

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,560
The Gupta dynasty is famous for its deep and altruistic value of cultural development.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,280
And economically beneficial cultural benefit, well, that was that much better.

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,680
So it was during this golden age of Indian culture that techniques were developed to

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,840
extract the juice from these reeds, then allow it to form crystals by drying it slowly in

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,940
the sun.

31
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,800
These crystals, it turns out, retained the sweet flavor of the reeds, yet spoiled far

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,320
more slowly in their new crystalline form.

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,560
Okay, by now you probably have put two and two together and figured out that I'm talking

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
about crystalline sugar sucrose.

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,360
It's extracted from sugarcane as a solution and then crystallized to create a more viable

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
product.

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,080
Now what you may not have known, though, is that by developing this process, the people

38
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,440
of the Gupta kingdom were unwittingly performing what may have been mankind's first ever

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,280
recrystallization experiment.

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,920
So how is it that crystalline sucrose was stumbled onto so early in human history?

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,760
After all, when most of us think about crystals, we think about very rare, expensive, and difficult

42
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,200
to acquire materials.

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:08,040
Well, it turns out that it is really not so surprising at all that crystalline organics

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,080
might be some of the very first organic compounds isolated by man.

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,320
The reason for this is hidden in the Gibbs free energy of crystals.

46
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Now, crystals are highly ordered, they're very ordered repeating arrangements of atoms

47
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,240
or molecules.

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,560
But organic molecules can also achieve this highly repeating patterns in the solid state.

49
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,720
When they do so, the intermolecular attractions between and among the molecules become stronger

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
and the free energy of the system naturally decreases.

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,240
Since lower energy states are favored in nature, it stands to reason that highly ordered materials

52
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,560
can form if the energetic benefit of their interactions exceeds the entropic penalty

53
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,600
of assuming a highly ordered state.

54
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,520
So let's take a look at a crystal structure forming and see if we can get our heads wrapped

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,080
around this idea a little bit more of what makes pure crystalline materials relatively

56
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,280
easy to come by.

57
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's start with a compound called benzomide.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Now, benzomide has a fairly simple crystalline structure.

59
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,000
It starts off with a pattern of repeating molecules in one of two orientations as I've

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
shown them here.

61
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,640
You notice the benzene ring and the amide groups pointing either one way or the other

62
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,040
in each of the molecules within what would be the surface of a growing crystal.

63
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
So here's my surface.

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,120
Now, as a cartoon, I'm going to just grow my crystal by dropping in the molecules.

65
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,080
We'll be talking very soon about how to practically accomplish this.

66
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,280
But for now, let's just put our crystal together.

67
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,000
So let me drop in a few more benzomide molecules in the proper orientation.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,600
Okay, now that repeating structure should be even more clear to you.

69
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,000
It's very obvious that there are certain regions of the crystal where molecules are oriented

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,440
in specific directions in an array that arranges them relative to one another in a very, very

71
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,040
tight repeating pattern.

72
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,280
This pattern creates a network of intermolecular attractions, including hydrogen bonds.

73
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,880
Now, if I highlight them in the crystal here that I've created, it's very easy to see the

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,040
repeating patterns.

75
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,680
In addition to the stabilizing hydrogen bonds, there are dispersion forces, which we would

76
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,600
also call London dispersion forces or van der Waals attractions.

77
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,400
And this takes place where the pi systems of the benzene rings stack against one another,

78
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,240
very similarly to the way that purine and pyrimidine bases do in DNA in the double helix.

79
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,800
So there's an array of very carefully crafted intermolecular forces holding this crystal

80
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,760
together.

81
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,760
So this optimized set of intermolecular attractions leads to a very strongly held together, very

82
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,280
stable crystal of this particular organic material.

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,040
But what if I introduce something else?

84
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,680
What if my sample is not absolutely pure?

85
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,760
What kind of effect will that have on the energy of this crystal?

86
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,480
Let's do that experiment right now.

87
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Let's rebuild our crystal of Benzemeib first.

88
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,560
But this time I'm going to insert a few impurities.

89
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,880
So again, here's my beautiful repeating pattern of my organic compounds aligned perfectly,

90
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
so I have beautiful set of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces all holding that

91
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,440
crystal together.

92
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Now I'm going to take these four molecules and make one very subtle change to them.

93
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm going to change them from Benzemeib to Benzaldehyde, taking away the NH2 group.

94
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,400
Now look what happens when I do that.

95
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,600
I have removed the ability of these molecules to form the hydrogen bonds which stabilize

96
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,640
the crystal in this very specific localized position.

97
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,680
So all of these hydrogen bonds that I've colored in red no longer can be formed.

98
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,360
So by including just a few molecules of Benzaldehyde in my pure crystal or otherwise pure crystal

99
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,680
of Benzemeib, I have decreased the overall strength of the intermolecular forces holding

100
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,400
them together.

101
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,680
So the fact that I'm missing these intermolecular attractions means that the free energy of

102
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,160
my crystal is higher.

103
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,240
In other words, it's less stable, it's a weaker crystal, and it's easier to disassemble.

104
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,080
So if we can make crystals grow very slowly, under conditions favoring the most stable crystal

105
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,240
formation with all the strongest intermolecular attractions possible, we should be able to

106
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,600
produce crystals of very high purity.

107
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,720
And this is a good thing because we rarely find compounds like sucrose all alone in nature.

108
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,760
In biologically sourced solutions like cane juice, they can be up to 20% sucrose, but

109
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,640
we find smaller concentrations of all of its subunits like glucose and fructose, as well

110
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,560
as small amounts of many other biological molecules.

111
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,760
In the days of the Gupta dynasty, this was not likely to be a concern to them.

112
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
Good solidified or crystallized sugar was enough to get the job done.

113
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,520
But today's chemists and chefs for that matter find need for highly purified sucrose so that

114
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:44,040
we can use it under more controlled conditions demanded by the state of the art.

115
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,000
So early sugar was most likely produced by evaporating water from cane juice as rapidly

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,520
as possible.

117
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,960
If however, the solution expelled from sugar cane is slowly allowed to concentrate past

118
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,660
the point of saturation, meaning the sugars contained therein will be compelled to take

119
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,600
on a solid form or precipitate from the solution.

120
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,800
Well, if we produce a concentrated solution of organic molecules like sucrose, then somehow

121
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,880
induce that system to become super saturated, meaning that it has more dissolved sucrose

122
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,040
than it normally could hold.

123
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,280
We expect the growing crystals of sucrose to exclude the other contaminant solutes

124
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:30,120
in order to achieve optimal intermolecular attractions.

125
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,280
To better understand the process of crystallization, let's take a look at a compound called phthalic

126
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
acid.

127
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,400
I have a sample of phthalic acid here on the bench.

128
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,440
I also have a beaker of water, which I can use to dissolve the phthalic acid.

129
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,560
Now phthalic acid has a solubility of about 18 grams per milliliter in boiling water,

130
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
extremely high.

131
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,580
But it's only about 0.6 per milliliter in cold water.

132
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,560
So if my phthalic acid isn't quite pure, its crystals aren't as stable as they could

133
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,080
possibly be.

134
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,080
But how are they going to get to that more purified, more stable state?

135
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,360
Clearly, the molecules in my crystals are not going to spontaneously rearrange in the

136
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,880
solid phase, expelling any contaminants that might be in them, at least not in my lifetime.

137
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,360
And this camera crew, they're paid by the hour.

138
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,480
So let's see if we can speed it up a little bit, okay?

139
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,960
So what we need to do is disassemble these crystals at the molecular level, separating

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,520
them all in such a way that the phthalic acid molecules get a second chance to order

141
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,960
themselves in a more stable state.

142
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,680
And of course, one way to accomplish this separation is to dissolve the crystals, separating

143
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,660
them all within a solvent.

144
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,920
So I've set myself up to do this task right here.

145
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,440
What I have is a beaker containing phthalic acid that's been purchased, which is about

146
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
98% pure, a smaller beaker, which I'm not going to touch.

147
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,440
This is phthalic acid, which I have contaminated with a red organic molecule, so that we can

148
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,360
see that contaminant as it behaves in the system that we're about to subject it to.

149
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,880
And the larger beaker here is what I'm actually going to be purifying.

150
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,080
And in order to purify this, I'm going to use nothing more than water and some heat.

151
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,520
Now this water is already hot, so let me get my safety glasses on just in case.

152
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm going to turn my hot plate back on, which is also a magnetic stir plate.

153
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,200
It contains a magnetic element underneath of the surface of the ceramic hot plate, which

154
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,440
I can use to articulate this little magnetic spin bar inside.

155
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,920
So this allows me to more thoroughly heat my solvent more rapidly.

156
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,320
So while that's going, I'm going to put on some gloves.

157
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:56,640
And hopefully, they'll stay in one piece while I put them on.

158
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,080
So these are disposable latex gloves, they're really just designed to protect my hands from

159
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,520
the chemicals I'm dealing with, even though they're fairly safe as organic compounds go.

160
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,280
So very soon my water will be boiling.

161
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,360
I've preheated it to accelerate this process so that we can see what goes on.

162
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,000
But what I'm going to do as soon as this gets warm enough is add my water to this beaker

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,040
containing phthalic acid and a little bit of the red organic contaminant to see if we

164
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,680
can get rid of it by disassembling it at the molecular level through dissolution and then

165
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,720
encouraging it to crystallize, but very slowly.

166
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,200
And since this is a very hot flask of water, I'm going to put a glove over my hand to protect

167
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,400
it from the heat as well as the chemicals.

168
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,520
And let's get started with the dissolution process.

169
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:54,960
Again, this is fairly hot water, but you could clearly see that it wasn't completely boiling.

170
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,760
So it's going to require a little bit more help to get it to thoroughly dissolve.

171
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,080
And in order to do this, I've given myself an extra spin bar, which I'll add to the beaker

172
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
now.

173
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,000
And I'm going to return everything to my hot plate.

174
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,840
So we can see that the spin bar is moving because the powder is flowing, and now we need

175
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,160
to give it some time to heat up.

176
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,440
Now in this case I'm heating my recrystallization solution on a hot plate.

177
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,720
Now the surface of the hot plate can reach temperatures well in excess of 300 degrees

178
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,680
centigrade, which is hot enough to cause many organic solvents to catch fire spontaneously

179
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,080
in air.

180
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,680
So the only reason that I'm heating this particular solution the way that I am now is because

181
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,340
the solvent that I'm using is water, which is not flammable.

182
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,040
Water is essentially hydrogen that's already been burned, so it's not possible to burn

183
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,000
it any further.

184
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,640
In a future lecture, we'll actually take a look at some ways that we do heat organic

185
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,560
solvents in safer ways than what I'm doing here, again if this were in fact an organic

186
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
material.

187
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,200
So we've finished boiling our solution of phthalic acid.

188
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,580
Now as you can see, I'm so saturated that I'm already starting to get a little bit forming

189
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,400
on the top of my solution.

190
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,880
And also you can see that I've had to add a little bit more water as the boiling process

191
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,720
went on to be sure that I got the vast majority of my compound dissolved.

192
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,880
So now we have to wait and allow slow cooling to take hold.

193
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,620
The reason that slow cooling needs to take place is that we want to give all of the phthalic

194
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,040
acid molecules in solution ample time to find those perfect orientations as they come in

195
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,080
and become part of the growing crystal.

196
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,280
If we do this, any other molecule that tries to get involved with that crystal will not

197
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:46,720
adhere as strongly as phthalic acid and can simply be excluded as the crystal grows.

198
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,440
So if my original solution was made correctly and I have thoroughly separated molecules

199
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,800
of phthalic acid and impurity, I should have only phthalic acid growing back in its crystals

200
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,480
leaving the impurity behind in solution.

201
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,880
But that's going to take a little bit of time because this has to cool all the way from

202
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,480
100 degrees centigrade down to around room temperature where the solubility of phthalic

203
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,600
acid is somewhere around one-thirtieth that of the total solubility of phthalic acid in

204
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:24,440
boiling water.

205
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,680
So as my solution cooled slowly, the solubility of the phthalic acid drops dramatically.

206
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,360
So that particular compound now has nowhere else to go but out of solution.

207
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,640
The key here is that I allow the process to happen very slowly.

208
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,120
So I guess it's a good thing I like to talk.

209
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,720
Now by cooling slowly, I've avoided trapping of impurity molecules in those growing crystals

210
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,960
and at the completion of my recrystallization, I have very large, well-formed, pure phthalic

211
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,400
acid crystals that can simply be removed from solution by a technique like filtration.

212
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,840
So if I light my sample a little bit, you can probably see in the front and the bottom

213
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,400
there, I've got some very large, very well-formed crystals and I'm going to try to retrieve

214
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,080
those now, not using filtration but instead using a simpler technique to separate liquids

215
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,320
from solids known as decanting.

216
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,400
Decanting is actually quite simple.

217
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm just going to try to pour the liquid out from this beaker while leaving as much

218
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,200
of the solid behind as possible.

219
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,360
It just takes a steady hand and a little bit of patience to remove that liquid.

220
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
There we go.

221
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,920
And as I begin to remove the liquid, it should become clear how pure these crystals really

222
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
are.

223
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:54,200
They're not only large and well-formed but safe for just a little bit of the solution

224
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,080
that they crystallized from, which is sometimes called the mother liqueur, there's really

225
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,320
not a lot of red to speak of.

226
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,720
So the impurity is now in solution, which I have separated from the majority of my crystals,

227
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,680
few of which I'm going to dig out now, so that we can take a look at the difference

228
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:18,000
in size and shape in comparison to what we started with.

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,560
So here are just a few of the crystals that formed.

230
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:28,440
And when we compare them to not only the sample that we started with that was impure, we can

231
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,720
clearly see that the color is a lot more white, but the crystals are even larger than the

232
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,680
material that I started with before it was even fouled by this red compound.

233
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,280
So large crystals of the proper color tell me that I have at least in part successfully

234
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,160
purified what was an otherwise impure sample.

235
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,800
So washing these with a little bit of cold water will probably get a crystal that's almost

236
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,680
as white and pure as the one that we started with before we ever added any dye at all.

237
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,560
This is the power of recrystallization.

238
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,480
So pure crystals tend to be more stable than their impure counterparts.

239
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,200
Now we've already looked at how this can be used to purify a compound by crystallizing

240
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,800
it from a solution, but we can exploit this phenomenon in a completely different way by

241
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,480
observing the melting behavior of a sample to help us identify it and also assess its

242
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
purity.

243
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,200
So let's take a look at that right now.

244
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,880
I'm going to bring back a crystal that we've looked at once already.

245
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,200
That's the Benzamine crystal.

246
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,600
And again I'm going to build this beautiful network of intermolecular attractive forces

247
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,040
holding it all together, the hydrogen bonds, the van der Waals forces.

248
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,960
Now because there's so many forces holding it together, it's very difficult to take

249
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,000
the crystal apart, not only by dissolution, but also by melting, which involves heating.

250
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,280
So if I give these molecules a little bit of kinetic energy by adding some heat, let's

251
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,840
take a look at what happens.

252
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,880
Well they have a little bit of kinetic energy now, they want to be free to move, but they

253
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,160
don't want to move badly enough because there are too many forces holding them all together.

254
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,540
But if I continue to add energy in the form of heat, I eventually reach a point at which

255
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,800
there's enough kinetic energy contained in those molecules that they no longer can be

256
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:23,040
held together by those forces within the crystal, and melting takes place.

257
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,920
But if there's an impurity present, just as there was last time in our example, where

258
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,320
we had Benzamide with a little bit of Benzaldehyde contained inside, well remember, we had to

259
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,400
sacrifice these specific intermolecular forces, meaning that overall there's less holding

260
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,680
that crystal together.

261
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,240
What this means from a bulk perspective is, as I heat up a crystal that has impurities

262
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,400
and imperfections, like those missing intermolecular attractions, my weaker crystal should melt

263
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,760
more easily.

264
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,960
And indeed, in my example here, I add a little bit of heat, and that's all the kinetic energy

265
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,360
it takes to get my molecules moving enough to overcome whatever forces are remaining

266
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,280
holding it together.

267
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,480
So just as dissolution involves liberating individual molecules from one another by

268
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,680
salvation, so melting liberates them by heating them until they have sufficient kinetic energy

269
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,380
to overcome those forces holding them together.

270
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,060
With this in mind, the logic behind using melting to assess purity should become clear,

271
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,000
that more purified crystals have greater forces holding them together, meaning they require

272
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,580
more energy to melt.

273
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:37,900
In other words, as purity increases, so does the melting point.

274
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:44,340
This concept is clearly illustrated using a hypothetical phase diagram for a binary system.

275
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,580
Now in order to construct this kind of phase diagram, we first take the phase diagram for

276
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,460
a pure substance, which we could just call substance A.

277
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,500
So here I've drawn one for you with all the phase transitions that we recognize from an

278
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,740
introductory chemistry course, including boundaries for melting and freezing, boiling and condensing,

279
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,940
and of course sublimation and deposition.

280
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,660
But this diagram only applies to a pure substance.

281
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:16,900
So to create a binary phase diagram, we settle on a constant pressure, like one atmosphere,

282
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,380
the pressure in most laboratories.

283
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:26,140
And at that pressure, we project the diagram along a third axis of composition.

284
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,020
When we do this for two hypothetical solids, which in this example we could call A and

285
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:37,180
B, focusing on that melting transition, the result looks something like this.

286
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,660
So here's my phase diagram for a binary system at a given pressure.

287
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,940
Notice that my horizontal axis is now mole percentage, meaning that on the left-hand

288
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,020
side I'm dealing with pure, in this case green squares, and on the right-hand side pure,

289
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,700
whatever this molecule may be, we've called it red triangles for illustration purposes.

290
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,740
But there's some very interesting features to this phase diagram that you don't see in

291
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,140
the phase diagram for a pure substance.

292
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,660
So let's wipe this clean and rebuild the phase diagram piece by piece, investigating the

293
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,260
effects of mixing one compound into another.

294
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,100
Let's start with this compound over here, my green squares, when it's absolutely pure.

295
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,420
Now I know that when it's absolutely pure, its melting point should be a single temperature.

296
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,580
There is only one temperature at which a pure substance can coexist with itself in liquid

297
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,780
and solid forms.

298
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,700
So if I were to heat a sample of this compound, I expect it to be solid up to its melting

299
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:48,380
point, after which I expect it to transition into a liquid and I can continue heating.

300
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,620
But look what happens as I introduce a little bit of my other compound, in this case as

301
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,700
an impurity.

302
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,660
Well, two very interesting things happen.

303
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,500
First is that the phase boundaries move downward, and the second is that there are actually

304
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,340
two of them, not a single phase boundary anymore.

305
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,220
So what this means is that if I were to heat up a solid of a composition, let's say somewhere

306
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,740
in this region where I have mostly my green squares, but a little bit of my red triangles,

307
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,900
take a look at what happens.

308
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,700
I pass through another range of my diagram.

309
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,780
It actually takes a range of temperatures to melt, not only that, but both of them are

310
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,580
lower than the original melting point of my green square compound.

311
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:38,180
We call this phenomenon melting point depression, and it occurs because one compound is acting

312
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,940
as an impurity in the other, disrupting the forces holding the crystal lattice together.

313
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,060
And the broadening that takes place in the melting transition is known as incongruent

314
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,300
melting, which is an effect of having one compound moving into the liquid phase faster

315
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,980
than the other as melting takes place, thereby changing the composition of the solid as well.

316
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,820
So there's a range of compositions which can coexist and liquid solid forms for mixtures.

317
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,980
But then we reach an interesting point in the diagram.

318
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,700
It comes back to a confluence at a point somewhere in the middle of the phase diagram, though

319
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,060
not necessarily directly in the middle of the way I've drawn it here.

320
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:24,500
This is known as the eutectic point, eutectic meaning easy melting essentially.

321
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,700
And once we cross that eutectic point, which by the way is the only composition at which

322
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,900
a single melting temperature exists, we start to see the transition temperatures go back

323
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:42,540
up, until eventually they reach a confluence again at pure compound B, or in my case red

324
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,740
triangles.

325
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,020
So what's going on here?

326
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,300
Well, what's going on here is we've reached a point where we can start to think of it

327
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,340
as green squares are now the impurity in my red triangles.

328
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,460
And so my melting point goes back upward as my sample becomes purer and purer in the

329
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,900
other compound.

330
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,460
So I simply create a sort of a reflection, although the absolute temperatures and widths

331
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,940
of these transitions are not necessarily the same on both sides.

332
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,780
But these features are very consistent in well-behaved binary systems.

333
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,100
Finally, of course, we reach the point where we have our melting point for our pure red

334
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,340
compound, and again we have a single transition temperature.

335
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,420
So why do we need to understand that kind of complex phase behavior?

336
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:32,700
Well, because it gives us a useful tool to confirm the identity and purity of a compound.

337
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,400
We use a device commonly referred to as a melt-temp apparatus, which consists of a heating

338
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,980
block with a temperature control and a viewing window.

339
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,300
Now if I load a sample of my original crude sathalic acid in one of my recrystallized

340
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:52,260
material, I can confirm that the melting point of the purified material should be higher.

341
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,300
Not only that, but if I were to make a third sample consisting of my purified thalic acid

342
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,180
ground thoroughly with a small amount of a standard, that would allow me to confirm its

343
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,700
identity since adding anything but the same compound to itself should reduce the sample's

344
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,900
melting point.

345
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,660
If my sample were anything but thalic acid, the melting point of the mixture with standardized

346
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,180
thalic acid should be depressed.

347
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,220
We call this simple technique a mixed melting point analysis, and it's a very commonly used

348
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,020
quick check for purity and identity when synthesizing compounds in a lab.

349
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,260
So today we started to think beyond simply making and characterizing a product to the

350
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,860
question of how we might purify one.

351
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,180
We discussed the effect of the presence of impurities on organic crystalline solids and

352
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,300
how they tend to reduce the favorable intermolecular forces holding the crystal together, creating

353
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,540
a crystal which is less stable.

354
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,700
We took a look at how this observation can be used to devise a way to purify such materials

355
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,380
by dissolving a sample to solve and separate all the constituent molecules, then cooling

356
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,380
or concentrating the solution very slowly to promote formation of the most stable, pure

357
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,660
crystal.

358
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,460
We discussed the process of melting an organic crystalline solid and how the inclusion of

359
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,940
different molecules usually results in not only a depressive melting point, but also in

360
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,620
a broadening of the melting transition resulting from a phenomenon called incongruent melting.

361
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,020
Finally, we talked a bit about how we can use the phase behavior of such solids as a

362
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:38,060
means of probing their purity and identity using a mixed melting point analysis.

363
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:43,620
Next time, we're going to turn our attention to another familiar phase transition, boiling.

364
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,100
We'll explore how phase behavior of more volatile organics can also be used to purify

365
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
and identify them.

366
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,140
I'll see you for that discussion next time.
