0	17160	You may recall from our discussion on alkanes that the discovery of petroleum took place
17160	23760	around 1860, drastically altering the methods used to recover and refine fuel oils.
23760	28160	To begin today's discussion, we'll have to move farther back in time, several decades
28160	32600	before Drake's discovery of petroleum, to a time when fuel oils were still sourced
32600	36320	from whale and fish oil.
36320	40480	Now Michael Faraday was an English researcher, and he's most well known for his work in
40480	42920	the field of electromagnetism.
42920	47680	But in 1820, he developed a keen interest in the chemistry of fuels.
47680	51600	So interested was Michael Faraday, that he all but abandoned his very successful line
51600	56200	of research in electromagnetism, so that he could begin deconstructing the composition
56200	62160	of what was then commonly known as illuminating gas, a processed form of fish or whale oil
62160	66440	commonly used in the lamps of the day.
66440	71160	A Faraday worked for nearly five years refining his techniques for isolation of certain components
71160	73440	from that material.
73440	77240	Most notable among them was a liquid, which he found he could produce by pressurizing
77240	83160	the gas to 30 atmospheres and isolating the condensate which formed.
83160	88000	Even in Faraday's time, it was known that hydrocarbons with suboptimal amounts of hydrogen
88000	93960	were susceptible to reactions with such reagents as chlorine gas or molecular bromine.
93960	99640	So Faraday dutifully determined the hydrogen to carbon ratio in his isole, finding that
99640	103560	it was extremely low.
103560	108160	Now in his day, scientists thought that carbon had an atomic mass only half that of what
108160	110000	it actually is.
110000	115600	So Faraday erroneously named his new discovery bicarboret of hydrogen.
115600	122240	In fact, carbohydrate of hydrogen or monocarboret of hydrogen would have been more appropriate.
122240	126960	But considering the circumstances, I think we can forgive this little miscalculation.
126960	131480	And this error notwithstanding, when comparing Faraday's bicarboret of hydrogen formula to
131480	137120	other hydrocarbons of the day, it was very clear that his new compound had a very low
137120	143320	hydrogen to carbon ratio.
143320	150720	So Faraday had already isolated his new compound bicarboret of hydrogen from his lamp oil.
150720	153120	But he wanted to go about doing some more analysis.
153120	157560	He had combusted this material already, measuring how much carbon dioxide and water formed in
157560	161560	the process, which gave him a rough idea of the formulas.
161560	166120	He was off by a factor of two because of the putative mass of carbon in that day, but I've
166120	170440	corrected that in my formulas here for my demonstration.
170440	176040	So what I have here, as soon as I protect myself properly from it, are some vials containing
176040	177240	molecular bromine.
177240	184200	These colorful solutions here are Br2 contained in an inert solvent, methylene chloride.
184200	189400	I also have samples of some of the hydrocarbons that have been isolated in Faraday's time.
189400	199520	And those include C6H14, C6H12, C6H10, C6H8, and C6H6.
199520	202840	Again I've corrected these formulas for the actual mass of carbon.
202840	207520	Now I'm going to cover my hands with something a little bit to make sure that they're safe
207520	209520	as well.
209520	213240	And I'm going to recreate the experiment that Faraday would have done in his day, which
213240	217560	generated such a buzz about his new bicarboret of hydrogen.
217560	224560	What I'm going to do here first is I'm going to uncap my bromine solutions, and I'm going
224560	229880	to add them to the various hydrocarbons that I have placed here as well.
229880	234560	And when I do that, if a reaction takes place between the bromine and the hydrocarbon, naturally
234560	239440	we would expect that the bromine would be something other than bromine, and the color
239440	241240	will change.
241240	250720	So let's start with the first hydrocarbon, C6H14.
250720	257000	So I add my bromine, make sure that we're well agitated, you may notice that no reaction
257000	258000	is taking place.
258000	259560	Now this was well known to Faraday.
259560	265200	Now he also knew that if he took this other compound here, C6H12, which had a slightly
265200	272320	lower hydrogen to carbon ratio, and added, again, molecular bromine, that a reaction
272320	273800	took place.
273800	278000	Clearly, no pun intended, a reaction has happened here.
278000	280520	Move my bromine vial to the back.
280520	285040	Now he could continue this experiment, going along all the various isolates from all the
285040	290680	various sources available to him, including C6H10.
290680	295640	We have our reaction gone clear.
295640	296640	One more.
296640	306520	Let's uncap our C6H8, again an unsaturated hydrocarbon, and a reaction takes place.
306520	309200	Now Faraday knew all of this was happening.
309200	311360	All these experiments had been done previously.
311360	315840	So when he isolated a new compound and determined that its formula had even less hydrogen, he
315840	321120	clearly predicted, and everyone thought he'd be right, that this new bicarburet of hydrogen
321120	323840	would also react with molecular bromine.
323840	327840	So just as any good scientist would, he validated that by adding molecular bromine.
327840	333840	Give it a swirl to be sure that we're well mixed.
333840	335720	We have a problem, don't we?
335720	337600	The trend is bucked here.
337600	343800	The C6H6 doesn't react the same way as all of the other hydrocarbons with suboptimal hydrogen
343800	346120	to carbon ratios.
346120	352200	So Faraday found this fascinating, and he needed to figure out what was going on.
352200	358640	Alas, Faraday never completed his characterization of this new compound.
358640	363680	And sadly for us chemists, Faraday's first love of electromagnetism took hold again and
363680	366880	distracted him from his curious hydrocarbon.
366880	371800	So Faraday had to settle for inventing electromagnetic induction, which essentially heralded the arrival
371800	374640	of the age of widely useful electricity.
374640	379040	Not a bad consolation prize, I suppose.
379040	383960	Instead the world would have to wait until the 1860s, when August Kekule, a German-born
383960	389000	scientist working in Belgium, took up the mantle of explaining the low hydrogen content
389000	394040	and unusual stability of this compound, which had since been renamed benzene.
394040	396560	Now this guy's a real looker, isn't he?
396560	400800	This is how I know I would never make it as an Eastern European chemist in the 1800s.
400800	404700	I can't pull off a beard that good.
404700	409640	So it's known for quite some time that a compound of unusual stability and a very low hydrogen
409640	413440	to carbon ratio could be isolated from torch fuel.
413440	418160	Although the compound was clearly a hydrocarbon, its unusual chemical stability and reduced
418160	421240	hydrogen content defied explanation.
421240	428760	At least until Kekule had what he claimed in later years was a genuine revelatory dream.
428760	434060	In an 1890 interview, near the end of his career, Kekule claimed that he had this famous
434060	439600	vision while dozing on the upper deck of a horse-drawn bus in 1850s London.
439600	444400	As he tells it, he dreamt of a snake biting its own tail, and woke to the revelation
444400	448720	that benzene's formula and properties could be explained if the molecule were in fact
448720	449720	cyclic.
449720	455520	Now there are many who wonder to this day why Kekule would wait nearly four decades
455520	457960	to tell such a fantastic tale.
457960	462680	In fact, most doubt the story's validity, but the story is so colorful and inspirational
462680	467200	that it lives on in text to this day.
467200	471680	So whether it came by divine revelation or educated guess, we may never know.
471680	475880	But we do know today Kekule was right.
475880	482240	What Kekule had proposed was this, that we have a molecule which is cyclic containing
482240	485640	spaced double bonds around that molecule.
485640	490040	And this would explain why it would have different chemistry than all of the other conjugated
490040	493800	alkenes or hydrocarbons as they would call them in his day.
493800	498000	Now if you take a look at this structure, we want you to notice something important.
498000	503760	Kekule's theory about the cyclization of a hexatriene is not beyond reproach, because
503760	509440	benzene itself would have three double bonds if they were isolated, leading to the potential
509440	511720	for two different isomers.
512720	517000	Once scientists were able to figure out how to attach halogens, there are actually two
517000	522200	potential arrangements for the addition of a halogen to a benzene ring, or more accurately
522200	524400	a substitution.
524400	529600	We can put two halogens at the top here where the double bond is located, meaning that our
529600	532800	halogens will be across a double bond.
532800	540560	But if I wanted to, I could place those halogens on opposite sides of a single bond instead.
540560	546440	So if Kekule's theory was right that this was simply a cyclic hexatriene, then there
546440	552880	should be two isolatable isomers of say dichlorocyclohexatriene.
552880	554360	And yet there were not.
554360	557840	An interesting conundrum, isn't it?
557840	562240	Now Kekule attempted to explain this observation as a fast interconversion between the two
562240	564120	putative isomers.
564120	566520	But there was no revelatory dream to save him this time.
566520	569360	He was actually wrong about that.
569360	574960	The story of benzene was completed in 1925 when Sir Robert Robinson published a paper
574960	580160	in the Journal of the Chemical Society postulating that what he called an aromatic sextet of
580160	586720	electrons stabilized the ring by moving unrestricted about the entire circular pi system.
586720	591040	This would create a ring of identical carbons joined by bonds of one and a half order and
591040	594120	would solve the problem of why there aren't two different isomers.
594120	598720	This theory leads us to more accurately draw benzene molecules using a circle or a dashed
598720	603720	interior hexagon to represent the aromatic sextet of electrons.
603720	608440	But it isn't the early 1900s, it's the 21st century and we have much more sophisticated
608440	612320	techniques than Faraday, Kekule and even Robinson had.
612320	618320	So let's bring those to bear on the issue of benzene stability.
618320	622240	Far from just qualitatively observing the stability of benzene, we can use our familiar
622240	626160	technique of calorimetry to determine its heat of hydrogenation.
626160	630560	This is the amount of heat released when the unsaturated compound is completely saturated
630560	632720	with hydrogen.
632720	639480	If we conduct this experiment using cyclohexene, 13-cyclohexadiene also as controls, we can
639480	643600	determine with relative ease that the double bonds in these systems are nearly equivalent
643600	646760	to one another.
646760	652000	But when we add that magical third pair of pi electrons, the heat of hydrogenation is
652000	658300	far less than we would have expected, about 150 kilojoules per mole less.
658300	662600	We call this discrepancy the resonance energy for benzene.
662600	666680	To put the size of that resonance energy into perspective, it's just less than half the
666680	672160	bond enthalpy of a covalent carbon-carbon bond.
672160	676720	So about a century passed between Faraday's first isolation and characterization of benzene
676720	681080	and Robinson's final description of the aromaticity that it possesses.
681080	685100	And this opened the floodgates, and it wasn't long after this that the molecular orbital
685100	690320	energetics of benzene and other cyclic molecules with alternating double bonds, which we collectively
690320	696960	call anulines, were worked out by a German chemist named Erich Huckel.
696960	701320	You see, just as we produced mathematical combinations of piatomic orbitals to model
701320	706600	pi systems in linear conjugated compounds last time, we can use the same technique for
706600	710080	cyclic alkenes with overlapping pi bonds.
710080	716040	Let's start by sticking with the familiar aromatic compound benzene.
716040	721080	Benzene consists of six sp2 carbon atoms joined in a ring.
721080	725480	Now this ring is perfectly flat in the case of benzene, which allows all of its piatomic
725480	732560	orbitals to combine to form one large pi system with density both above and below the ring.
732560	736320	But remember our rules for the formation of molecular orbitals.
736320	741040	Six atomic orbitals in means six molecular orbitals out.
741040	745640	These orbitals all correspond to the linear addition of piatomic orbitals with varying
745640	748720	combinations of phase.
748720	752960	For example, when all six p orbitals are in phase, the lowest possible energy molecular
752960	754800	orbital is obtained.
754800	759320	We call this the pi1.
759320	764680	But it's also possible to form five other permutations of molecular orbitals.
764680	768400	Two possibilities exist with a single nodal plane.
768400	774440	Let's call them the pi2 and the pi3.
774440	778000	Two possibilities with two node planes also exist.
778000	783960	So let's call those the pi4 and pi5.
783960	789680	Finally, there's one possibility in which all six p orbitals are aligned anti-parallel,
789680	796280	creating three nodal planes and a sixth possible molecular orbital, pi6.
796280	801400	So let's take a look now at aromaticity and our famous popular benzene molecule as well
801400	804840	as a different cyclic compound with alternating pi bonds.
804840	809880	And what we're going to do now is analyze the energetics of those pi molecular orbitals
809880	815000	that we just looked at, not only for benzene, but also for a different cyclic compound with
815000	817160	multiple pi bonds.
817160	822640	Let's use 1,3 cyclobutadiene and benzene as our subjects.
822640	829000	So here I've drawn 1,3 cyclobutadiene with two isolated pi bonds.
829000	834520	And yet I've drawn benzene with three delocalized pi bonds, denoted by the dashes moving all
834520	836680	the way around the ring.
836680	838600	And that's not an accident.
838600	843400	So if we think about the energetics of those six molecular orbitals from benzene to start,
843400	848240	there's a little mnemonic trick we can use to determine the relative energies of those
848240	849400	orbitals.
849400	853480	What we do is we draw a circle on an energy axis.
853480	858800	And we inscribe within that circle, point down a polygon with a number of sides equal
858800	862240	to that of the cyclic compound we'd like to analyze.
862240	868280	For example, benzene having six atoms in the ring is going to have six corners in its polygon
868280	872040	with one corner pointed straight down.
872040	877160	When I do this, the corners of the polygon where they touch the circle indicate the relative
877160	883280	energies of the six pi molecular orbitals of this particular compound.
883280	888480	So if I draw my non-bonding energy line through the center and populate it, what I discover
888480	894840	is that the bonding region gets all of the electrons from the pi system, all six of them.
894840	900200	So clearly, benzene's perspective on this molecular orbital system is that it would
900200	901200	like to have it.
901200	906720	If I populate this, this is great because all of my electrons get to go down in energy.
906720	911440	But what if we do a similar analysis for 1,3 cyclobutadiene, which is another angeline
911440	914960	which looks for all intents and purposes like it should be aromatic?
914960	920680	Well, if we do the exact same exercise, inscribing our polygon and forming our molecular orbital
920680	924120	energies, we find something quite different.
924120	929280	We find that when we populate it with the four pi electrons from cyclobutadiene, that
929280	932320	two of them go into non-bonding molecular orbitals.
932320	936920	In other words, there's little or in this case really no energetic benefit to this particular
936920	943640	molecule being planar and forming these new molecular orbitals.
943640	945200	But the trend actually continues.
945200	949680	It's a predictable trend in the stability of annulings.
949680	953640	So we've already seen 1,3 cyclobutadiene and benzene treated in this way.
953640	959000	So let's go on through those, create their polygons and populate them.
959360	961800	Cyclobutadiene, rather, we know is anti-aromatic.
961800	967920	If we do the same exercise for benzene as we did previously, we see that benzene is aromatic
967920	971400	because of the extra stability.
971400	976840	Cyclo-octotetraene, on the other hand, will actually populate non-bonding orbitals if
976840	985080	it's planar, whereas cyclo-decapentaene will not, making it aromatic.
985080	987200	So you're probably beginning to notice a trend here.
987600	988920	Well, you're not the first.
988920	989920	Huckel was the first.
989920	992680	That's why he was the one who got to name it, sorry.
992680	998160	But what it turns out is happening here is that every time we add two pi electrons, we
998160	1002640	switch from anti-aromatic to aromatic, anti-aromatic to aromatic.
1002640	1006360	And therefore, we can model this as a simple mathematical equation.
1006360	1013200	Four n pi electrons leads to an anti-aromatic system, while four n plus two electrons leads
1013200	1014520	to an aromatic system.
1015080	1017720	This is the origin of Huckel's rule.
1017720	1022440	But the utility of Huckel's rule extends well beyond just hydrocarbons like benzene.
1022440	1026080	It can be used to explain the behavior of other cyclic systems with aligned p-orbitals
1026080	1027080	as well.
1027080	1032360	For example, the tropillium ion, which is a carbocation consisting of a seven-membered
1032360	1037240	ring with six pi electrons and a positive charge.
1037240	1042320	Polygon analysis of this species shows us that it's also aromatic.
1042320	1046960	In fact, the effect of resonance on the stability of tropillium is so powerful that it's one
1046960	1051600	of the few carbocation which can be purchased as a stable salt and stored on a shelf in
1051600	1052600	the laboratory.
1052600	1056920	That's right, those pesky intermediates from first-order reactions have become a starting
1056920	1063200	material owing to the stabilization provided by this very special type of resonance.
1063200	1069760	So cyclopentadienyl anion also contains six pi electrons, and this time a system of five
1070120	1071600	molecular orbitals.
1071600	1076840	And you can clearly see that in both instances all six pi electrons find homes in bonding
1076840	1081800	orbitals lending extra stability to the ions.
1081800	1085000	But we don't need to stop at hydrocarbons in their ions.
1085000	1089800	Huckel's rule can be extended even farther to systems containing heteroatoms as well.
1089800	1093760	Take the example of perol C4H5N.
1093760	1099240	Now when I draw this molecule in class I usually have more than a few hands go up, and that's
1099240	1104040	because as I've drawn it the lone pair of nitrogen seemed to be in an sp3 orbital, isolated
1104040	1105400	on the nitrogen atom.
1105400	1108760	And you could argue this molecule can't be aromatic as drawn because the pi system is
1108760	1112240	encyclic, and you'd be right.
1112240	1117040	To properly depict the perol I have to move that lone pair into a p-atomic orbital, allowing
1117040	1119880	it to join that pi system of the ring.
1119880	1125000	And in doing so I produce an aromatic system in which the amine nitrogen and hydrogen are
1125000	1128200	both coplanar with the rest of the molecule.
1128200	1136200	The energetic benefit of aromaticity exceeds that of orbital hybridization in this situation.
1136200	1140880	The effects of aromaticity on the basicity of perol are also dramatic.
1140880	1146400	Note that accepting a proton for perol means sacrificing that stabilizing aromaticity.
1146400	1152240	While the same process for its close chemical cousin, pyridine, does not.
1152240	1156600	So it should come as no surprise that perol is literally millions of times less basic
1156600	1158160	than pyridine.
1158160	1163560	This is all a powerful testament to the influence of aromaticity, and also a very obvious application
1163560	1167720	of Huckel's rule in action.
1167720	1171280	There are many other examples of aromatics which contain heteroatoms, like the mauving
1171280	1174240	that we encountered in our nitrogen lecture.
1174240	1178240	But for today we're going to turn our attention back to hydrocarbons to keep our discussion
1178240	1181240	focused.
1181240	1185120	Just as with all other molecules, if we want to have meaningful discussions about benzene
1185120	1189360	and its derivatives, then we need to agree on a nomenclature standard.
1189360	1193920	The revelation that all carbons of benzene are equivalent simplifies the process of naming
1193920	1196400	them when they're substituted.
1196400	1201200	Since all six carbons are identical and the pi-bonding electron density is the same, using
1201200	1209080	the name 135 cyclohexatriene per the IUPAC standard is a bit misleading, so we usually
1209080	1214200	default to describing this ring motif as benzene.
1214200	1218160	Now just as any other hydrocarbon scaffold can be modified by replacing its hydrogen
1218160	1223640	atoms with more complex substituents in functional groups, so can benzene.
1223640	1227760	We'll take a look at some techniques used to accomplish these modifications next time,
1227760	1232920	but for now let's focus on the nomenclature of the modified compounds.
1232920	1237360	When a single substituent is attached to a benzene ring, we simply start the name with
1237360	1239480	that substituent's prefix.
1239480	1247640	For example, chlorobenzene, hydroxybenzene, or methylbenzene.
1247640	1251440	Since all six carbons of benzene are equivalent, the position of that first modification is
1251440	1253200	of no consequence.
1253200	1257920	We get chlorobenzene no matter which carbon I attach my chlorine to.
1257920	1261080	Attaching a single functional group to the ring prompts us to place a modifier at the
1261080	1262240	end of the name.
1263000	1268600	For example, benzaldehyde, or benzoic acid.
1268600	1274080	Now, if this distinction between substituents and functional groups isn't confusing enough,
1274080	1278080	sometimes the groups and the parent get turned on their head, and we describe the benzene
1278080	1284200	ring as a substituent, so we would use the identifier phenyl or aryl in situations like
1284200	1285880	this.
1285880	1293960	For example, chlorobenzene is also often called arylchloride, and hydroxybenzene, sometimes
1293960	1295720	called phenol.
1295720	1302480	But what really spices up the nomenclature of benzene rings is when we have two or more
1302480	1305440	attached substituents and functional groups.
1305440	1309640	Since the attachment of a single substituent renders the remaining unmodified carbons different
1309640	1310640	from one another.
1310640	1314040	Let's take a look at methylbenzene.
1314040	1318060	There are now three chemically distinct locations on the ring.
1318060	1324640	One of them is just a bond away, another two bonds away, and a final position three bonds
1324640	1329320	away on the opposite side.
1329320	1333360	So where we place the second group makes a profound difference in the identity and chemistry
1333360	1335520	of the new compound.
1335520	1341920	For example, dimethylbenzene, commonly called xylene, can form three different isomers.
1341920	1350460	One two dimethylbenzene, one three dimethylbenzene, and one four dimethylbenzene.
1350460	1355080	Now often we use a more common method of nomenclature to indicate which regioisomer of the compound
1355080	1362640	we're discussing using prefixes ortho, meta, and para in place of the numbered locations
1362640	1365160	on the groups.
1365160	1368960	The prefixes are often shortened to a single italicized letter.
1368960	1378640	So here we would describe these three isomers as o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene.
1378640	1384120	The nomenclature system is the source of the para in the popular pain reliever, paracetamol,
1384120	1386560	also known as acetaminophen.
1386560	1390840	Now notice that the two groups in this compound are attached to the benzene ring in the para
1390840	1392680	arrangement.
1392680	1398720	It's only when they're at that specific position relative to one another that the drug works.
1399720	1404840	In fact, during the industrial scale synthesis of acetaminophen, a portion of the phenol
1404840	1410440	starting material is converted to ortho-nitrophenol, which would lead to the ortho-isomer of acetaminophen
1410440	1412680	in a completed synthesis.
1412680	1418500	But this ortho-nitrophenol is removed before continuing because it leads to an inactive
1418500	1422640	isomer of the compound.
1422640	1428360	It's worth mentioning that aromatics don't have to exist as isolated rings, though most
1428360	1433320	if not all of the compounds we'll be investigating will have isolated benzene motifs.
1433320	1438680	A newer class of compounds has gathered considerable interest more recently.
1438680	1446240	Picture two benzene rings fused along one edge, essentially sharing a carbon-carbon bond.
1446240	1449360	We call this compound naphthalene.
1449360	1455400	Notice that by fusing the rings we create an aromatic system in which two rings share
1455400	1458320	a common pair of p-orbitals.
1458320	1463800	So it should come as no surprise that naphthalene's resonance energy is about 252 kilojoules
1463800	1471000	per mole, slightly less than two separate benzene rings, but substantial nonetheless.
1471000	1478360	Now for planar compounds, this trend continues through tricyclics like anthracine and phenanthrene,
1478360	1485040	all the way up to graphite, which is essentially a never-ending sheet of fully fused benzene
1485040	1486040	rings.
1486560	1491440	Now this allotrope of carbon benefits from such significant resonance stabilization that
1491440	1497680	at standard temperatures and pressures, it's even more stable than diamond.
1497680	1502280	In the 1980s, chemists began devising ways to impart curvature to these so-called graphene
1502280	1508760	sheets by changing which edges each ring shares with others, creating new allotropes of carbon
1508760	1514840	in the form of spheres, the most famous of which is hands down, the truncated icosahedron
1514840	1521360	C60 molecule buckminster fillering, affectionately referred to as buckyballs, and named for the
1521360	1526760	famous architect, inventor and futurist buckminster fuller.
1526760	1532640	Now one can envision how the buckyball motif could act as an end cap, connecting a graphene
1532640	1538240	sheet which is rolled up on itself.
1538240	1543920	This structure is commonly called a carbon nanotube, and these materials show some promise
1543920	1549600	in some very exciting applications, such as gas storage media and building materials,
1549600	1552960	to electronics, engineering and medicine.
1552960	1556280	But much of that potential is yet to be realized.
1556280	1560600	Even if we never find a good use for them, I think we can all agree they are just beautiful
1560600	1563680	to look at, aren't they?
1563680	1568320	Now yet another useful material created from graphene sheets is what's commonly known as
1568320	1570520	carbon fiber.
1570520	1575320	Most of us are probably familiar with this material, which was first created in the 1980s
1575320	1578960	and has since found its way into a host of applications.
1578960	1583800	Many of these applications exploit carbon fibers' enormous tensile strength, which
1583800	1589160	rivals that of steel, but in a material four times less dense.
1589160	1596560	Now graphite consists of flat planar sheets of graphene, which can easily slide along
1596560	1601540	one another's pi electron clouds, making it soft and slippery to the touch.
1601540	1606440	And this is why we see it used commonly in writing instruments and lubricants.
1606440	1610840	But carbon fiber, as opposed to graphite, can be thought of as a series of graphene sheets
1610840	1614120	which are bunched and tangled with one another.
1614120	1619360	And this bunching and tangling prevents the graphene sheets from sliding along one another,
1619360	1628600	creating a material with great tensile strength rather than soft lubricating properties.
1628600	1633700	So today we focused on characterizing and naming a class of compounds known as aromatics.
1633700	1640280	We discussed how cyclic pi systems of 4n plus 2 pi electrons have a remarkable stability,
1640280	1644520	which was recognized very early in the history of organic chemistry.
1644520	1647960	We covered Huckel's Rule, which predicts that this trend continues on to larger systems
1647960	1651240	as well.
1651240	1655480	We examined what's commonly called the polygon rule, an extension of the mnemonic we use
1655480	1660920	for linear conjugated alkenes, which is used to construct energy diagrams for cyclic pi
1660920	1662520	systems.
1662520	1667920	We also used this tool to demonstrate the principles on which Huckel's Rule is founded.
1667920	1672840	We took a look at how aromaticity can profoundly influence the acid-base properties of organics
1672960	1676240	by stabilizing conjugate acids and bases.
1676240	1683280	Particularly we looked at the example of parole in comparison to pyridine.
1683280	1688160	Next we tried our hand at naming some of these compounds, placing substituents ahead of benzene
1688160	1693800	and functional groups after benzene in the names, and how we used the prefixes ortho,
1693800	1699920	meta, and para to describe disubstituted benzene regioisomers.
1700000	1704440	We then concluded by considering situations in which aromatic rings fuse together to create
1704440	1710320	a new class called polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and how this naturally extends to buckminster
1710320	1715320	fullerines, and carbon nanotubes, and carbon fibers, which are the focus of current research
1715320	1719600	in many labs around the world.
1719600	1723400	Next time we'll take a look at some of the techniques that organic chemists use to create
1723400	1726200	these modified benzene rings, and I'll see you then.
