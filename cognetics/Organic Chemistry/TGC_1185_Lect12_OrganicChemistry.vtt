00:00.000 --> 00:14.920
Let's get back to one of my favorite stories.

00:14.920 --> 00:21.000
The years 1870, and in the laboratories of Alexander Butlarov at the University of Kazan,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.920
are working two men who will become arguably the two most prolific chemical researchers

00:25.920 --> 00:27.720
of the coming decade.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.320
Vladimir Markovnikov and Alexander Zetsev.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.200
Now Markovnikov and Zetsev have little love for one another.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.360
Their mutual contempt is driving these two men to forge ahead in their research in the

00:38.360 --> 00:43.520
hopes of not only making a name for themselves, but of one upping the other.

00:43.520 --> 00:47.880
We've already seen how one of their most prominent battlegrounds was the chemistry

00:47.880 --> 00:53.640
of alkyl halides and alkenes, both how they're made and how they react.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.200
During our lecture on alkenes, I told you about Zetsev's great victory in the debate

00:57.200 --> 00:59.280
over alkene stability.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.280
But I chose to show you how modern chemists go about proving his rule.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.280
By the end of the day today, we'll have all the necessary understanding to survey the

01:07.280 --> 01:13.000
reactions Zetsev himself used, one of the principle methods of producing alkenes, elimination

01:13.000 --> 01:19.720
reactions.

01:19.720 --> 01:24.080
Alkyl halides and other compounds containing good leaving groups need not necessarily undergo

01:24.080 --> 01:26.560
substitution reactions.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.960
There's another class of reactions in which these types of compounds often participate.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.200
Now instead of substituting a new group in place of the leaving group, a pi bond is formed

01:37.200 --> 01:43.760
by the loss of an adjacent proton, which we call the beta proton.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.440
Elimination reactions always proceed with the production of a byproduct formed by the

01:47.440 --> 01:52.400
leaving group, but they don't consume a nucleophile in the process.

01:52.400 --> 01:57.360
So in contrast to substitution reactions, which are entropically neutral, elimination

01:57.360 --> 02:03.140
reactions actually proceed with a pretty significant increase in entropy, because they're making

02:03.140 --> 02:06.000
two or more molecules from one.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.360
Now this is a good thing, because the exchange of sigma bonds for a pi bond means that the

02:10.360 --> 02:14.320
enthalpy of this reaction is not usually favorable.

02:14.320 --> 02:19.160
So elimination reactions are driven by factors like increased heat and time, as well as the

02:19.160 --> 02:24.160
formation of stable leaving groups and alkene products.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.580
Eliminations are always a possibility and are usually competing pathways in substitution

02:28.580 --> 02:30.080
reactions.

02:30.080 --> 02:39.000
It's when this competing pathway becomes dominant that we call the reaction an elimination.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.120
So just as we did with substitution, let's start from the very beginning.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.600
Let's limit ourselves to only the knowledge available to Markovnikov and Zetsev in the

02:47.960 --> 02:54.360
1870s and consider exactly how elimination reactions might take place.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.960
Completing an elimination reaction requires that two things be removed from the starting

02:57.960 --> 03:04.080
material, a stable leaving group and a beta proton from an adjacent carbon.

03:04.080 --> 03:09.760
Zetsev's theory that more substituted alkenes would form in these reactions proved true.

03:09.760 --> 03:15.200
Markovnikov instead hung his hat on a theory called microscopic reversibility.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.040
Having observed that alkyl halides of low substitution could be used to prepare alkenes,

03:20.040 --> 03:25.200
he theorized that reversing the reaction should produce the original starting material.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.880
But Markovnikov and Zetsev lacked the tools to probe these mechanisms much, if at all.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.960
Decades later it was our friend Christopher Engeld who once again left his mark on organic

03:34.960 --> 03:40.400
chemistry by recognizing that there were three potential mechanisms which he had to consider.

03:40.520 --> 03:45.520
The first of these three possibilities would involve having the base abstract the proton

03:45.520 --> 03:50.480
from our alkyl halide's beta carbon to initiate the reaction, so first the base will take

03:50.480 --> 03:55.080
the proton, then the remainder of the reaction will complete.

03:55.080 --> 03:59.680
If I do this, I have to go through an intermediate called the carbanion which then undergoes

03:59.680 --> 04:05.240
the remainder of the reaction, losing the leaving group to form the new alkene.

04:05.240 --> 04:09.880
The problem with this particular mechanism is that our base is trying to abstract a

04:09.880 --> 04:13.720
proton from something with a pKa of about 50.

04:13.720 --> 04:19.680
And you'll recall from our lecture on alkenes and alkynes that pKa's of 44, like those

04:19.680 --> 04:22.520
in an alkene, are considered to be prohibitive.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.640
So in this case with a pKa of 50, it's simply not possible.

04:26.640 --> 04:31.840
The substrate is just not acidic enough.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.680
But we still have two more possibilities.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.840
So let's take a look at another one.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.640
How about a reaction in which the base abstracts that beta proton at the same time as departure

04:41.640 --> 04:45.600
of the leaving group and the formation of the pi bond?

04:45.600 --> 04:51.000
If this all takes place in a single concerted step, we avoid that very unstable conjugate

04:51.000 --> 04:52.240
base.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.600
So this is a very viable reaction mechanism.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.160
And if this were a reaction mechanism that we're taking place, since it happens in a

04:59.160 --> 05:05.040
single step, we expect its rate law to involve both the concentration of the base and the

05:05.040 --> 05:07.600
concentration of the substrate.

05:07.600 --> 05:13.160
In other words, this is a second order elimination engulfed called these E2 mechanisms.

05:13.160 --> 05:18.760
The third possibility would involve the departure of the leaving group before the base abstracts

05:18.760 --> 05:19.760
the proton.

05:19.760 --> 05:24.480
In other words, we're going to go through a carbocation intermediate.

05:24.480 --> 05:29.440
This carbocation intermediate can then act as an acid protonating our base and leading

05:29.440 --> 05:31.360
to products.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.600
This is also a perfectly viable mechanism, as we're well aware carbocation is frequently

05:35.600 --> 05:38.000
formed from alkyl halides.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.880
So in this case, because the rate limiting step occurs before the base reacts with the

05:42.880 --> 05:48.720
acidic proton, the rate law should only contain the substrate concentration.

05:48.720 --> 05:54.800
In other words, this is a first order elimination or an E1 reaction.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.520
So just as in the case of substitution, we're left pondering two believable mechanisms for

05:59.520 --> 06:05.240
the elimination of an alkyl halide to form an alkene, one with a rate dependent only

06:05.240 --> 06:12.880
on substrate concentration and another dependent on both substrate and base concentration.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.240
So which is correct?

06:14.240 --> 06:20.400
Well, just as with substitution, the conditional answer here is both.

06:20.400 --> 06:25.120
Engle realized that in each potential reaction mechanism was a base accepting a beta proton

06:25.120 --> 06:26.880
from the substrate.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.600
But in one mechanism, the base participates in the rate limiting step while in the other,

06:30.600 --> 06:31.840
it did not.

06:31.840 --> 06:43.080
And again, kinetic studies were the key to unlocking the rules governing these two mechanisms.

06:43.080 --> 06:48.080
Let's begin with the E2 reaction pathway, which involves simultaneous deprotonation

06:48.080 --> 06:50.840
and leaving group departure.

06:50.840 --> 06:55.800
In our previous lecture, we defined nucleophiles as electron rich species, which have high

06:55.840 --> 07:03.040
negative charge density and lone pair electrons to donate in heterogenic bond formation.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.560
You may recall that in an earlier lecture, we mentioned another type of reagent which

07:06.560 --> 07:09.920
has a very similar set of properties, right?

07:09.920 --> 07:11.560
Lewis bases.

07:11.560 --> 07:17.160
So if nucleophiles and bases have similar properties, is it possible for a nucleophile

07:17.160 --> 07:19.000
to act as a base?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.800
And the answer is yes.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.640
You may also recall from our last lecture that SN2 reactions take place when strong

07:25.640 --> 07:30.200
nucleophiles attack a substrate of low substitution from the backside.

07:30.200 --> 07:36.280
A natural question to follow that observation is, what happens if the nucleophile is strong,

07:36.280 --> 07:44.400
like hydroxide, but the substrate is of high substitution, like t-butyl chloride?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.560
The answer to this question should be clear.

07:46.560 --> 07:53.160
The nucleophile unable to attack the obstructed electrophile is not going to wait to react.

07:53.160 --> 07:58.720
When nucleophilic attack isn't possible, it will instead react as a base.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.840
The protonation of the beta carbon seems like the next best alternative to satiate these

08:02.840 --> 08:05.040
very reactive species.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.720
But we already know simple deprotonation would be a highly disfavored reaction because of

08:09.720 --> 08:14.560
the high pKa of the alkyl halide beta protons.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.440
But there's a second process which can be coupled to the proton removal, that's the

08:18.440 --> 08:20.320
departure of the leaving group.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.800
And it's the simultaneous removal of the beta proton, departure of the leaving group, and

08:24.800 --> 08:30.720
formation of a new double bond, which all come together to form a single step process

08:30.720 --> 08:35.360
resulting in the formation of an alkene.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.520
Now a beta proton, which is at opposition to the leaving group, is the one which will

08:39.520 --> 08:40.520
be removed.

08:41.040 --> 08:46.240
Remember leaving groups and second order reactions depart when electrons move in from the backside

08:46.240 --> 08:49.000
of the electrophilic carbon.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.760
In order to accomplish this in an E2 substrate, the bond holding the acidic proton has to

08:54.760 --> 09:01.040
be on the backside of the molecule relative to the leaving group.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.960
This orientation is only achieved when the beta proton has a 180 degree dihedral angle

09:06.960 --> 09:09.160
relative to the leaving group.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.080
We call this orientation of substituents anti-coplanar.

09:13.080 --> 09:18.600
Fortunately, in this saturated alkyl halide, the bond joining the electrophilic carbon

09:18.600 --> 09:23.560
and the beta carbon has free rotation, so it can easily achieve this arrangement, allowing

09:23.560 --> 09:26.080
the E2 reaction to take place.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.080
So in this case, we form 2-methylpropene.

09:30.080 --> 09:39.480
Now let's consider a different situation, which might lead to a first order reaction.

09:39.480 --> 09:45.120
One in which an alkyl halide of high substitution is placed in the presence of a very weak base.

09:45.120 --> 09:50.320
In a situation like this, any elimination which might occur would likely fall into the

09:50.320 --> 09:53.200
E1 class of reactions.

09:53.200 --> 09:58.920
Now by very weak base, I mean a species which can accept a proton only under extreme conditions.

09:58.920 --> 10:03.760
Usually this means a neutral compound such as a molecule of solvent, or one which is

10:03.760 --> 10:09.120
negatively charged but has lots of resonance to help stabilize that charge, like this dihydrogen

10:09.120 --> 10:12.600
phosphate ion.

10:12.600 --> 10:18.280
So let's consider the same substrate as before, but with a weak nucleophile like water.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.640
In this situation, carbocation should form quite easily from something like t-butyl chloride,

10:23.640 --> 10:27.520
but even so, there's no strong nucleophile to be found.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.240
So what's a carbocation to do?

10:31.240 --> 10:37.320
Under the circumstances, the only way to produce a product is to lose an adjacent proton and

10:37.320 --> 10:39.560
form an alkene.

10:39.560 --> 10:44.560
In the case of t-butyl chloride, the elimination product is exactly the same as that obtained

10:44.560 --> 10:47.920
in our E2 example, but don't be fooled.

10:47.920 --> 10:52.200
We'll soon see some examples in which this is not true.

10:52.200 --> 10:57.100
So you can see the distinguishing property of E1 reactions is that they tend to run best

10:57.100 --> 11:01.540
under acidic conditions where there's no good nucleophile, and at higher temperatures

11:01.540 --> 11:12.180
which favor systems of greater entropy.

11:12.180 --> 11:17.380
One consideration which sets second order elimination, or E2 reactions, apart from second

11:17.380 --> 11:22.960
order substitution, SN2 reactions, is the wide variety of possible products which can

11:22.960 --> 11:26.540
form from the same combination of reagents.

11:26.540 --> 11:31.380
For example, unlike the SN2 pathway, which involves the attack of a nucleophile on the

11:31.380 --> 11:37.300
carbon-bearing the leaving group, giving it only one potential reactive site, the E2 reaction

11:37.300 --> 11:44.120
requires the abstraction of an adjacent proton, of which there may be many.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.700
When I first introduced this mechanism, I was careful to select a t-butyl halide, since

11:48.700 --> 11:53.700
all of its beta protons are equivalent, so eliminates that consideration.

11:53.700 --> 11:58.100
But most substrates for elimination reactions aren't so convenient.

11:58.100 --> 12:03.460
Issues of regiospecificity and stereospecificity will arise quickly.

12:03.460 --> 12:12.060
So let's take a look at this reaction between hydroxide ions and S2 bromo-3-methylbutane.

12:12.060 --> 12:16.100
Now in this case I'm going to have an elimination mechanism take place so that we can observe

12:16.100 --> 12:19.140
the potential products that form.

12:19.140 --> 12:24.380
Now in this case I actually have a substrate which has two different kinds of beta protons.

12:24.380 --> 12:29.060
I have the outside ones here labeled in green on a primary carbon, and I have this more

12:29.060 --> 12:33.420
interior beta proton which is on a tertiary carbon.

12:33.420 --> 12:38.140
So if hydroxide ion is going to act as a base rather than a nucleophile in this situation,

12:38.140 --> 12:43.540
there are two different protons which it can abstract from my alkyl halide.

12:43.540 --> 12:47.860
And depending upon which one it takes, I will get a different structural isomer of the resulting

12:47.860 --> 12:50.300
alkene.

12:50.300 --> 12:55.220
So if the green proton participates in the reaction, I'll get this product.

12:55.220 --> 13:00.700
This particular alkene has three hydrogens and one R-group attached to its functional

13:00.700 --> 13:02.140
group.

13:02.140 --> 13:07.260
But if instead the purple interior proton is abstracted, I'll get the lower product

13:07.260 --> 13:13.260
in which there is one hydrogen and three attached alkyl groups.

13:13.260 --> 13:17.460
So in this case I'm also going to get a little bit of water and bromide ion, but my primary

13:17.460 --> 13:20.540
product is going to be the Zetsev product.

13:20.540 --> 13:24.060
That is the one that's more substituted because we know it to be more stable.

13:24.060 --> 13:28.500
Now in situations like this one, the more substituted alkene product tends to be the

13:28.500 --> 13:30.500
major product of the reaction.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.980
And you'll recall from the alkene lecture that Zetsev's rule states the major product

13:34.980 --> 13:40.660
of an elimination reaction will be the most substituted alkene possible.

13:40.660 --> 13:46.460
So applying Zetsev's rule to our problem of 2-bromo-3-methylbutane with hydroxide gave

13:46.460 --> 13:52.780
us the tri-substituted product in greater abundance than the monosubstituted product.

13:52.780 --> 13:57.340
By extension, Zetsev's rule accurately predicts the major products of these elimination reactions

13:57.340 --> 13:58.740
as well.

13:58.740 --> 14:02.100
But there's one more wrinkle to this story that we have to consider.

14:02.100 --> 14:07.780
You see, we can safely apply Zetsev's rule for E2 reactions when the base is particularly

14:07.780 --> 14:11.660
small like that hydroxide ion was.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.940
The picture, however, can become a bit more complicated when we use bulkier bases like

14:16.940 --> 14:19.580
tbutoxide.

14:19.580 --> 14:25.540
When we attempt to react tbutoxide with 2-bromo-3-methylbutane to obtain an elimination product,

14:25.540 --> 14:28.700
we run into a little snag in predicting what's going to happen.

14:28.700 --> 14:33.780
So here's an example of a reaction between tbutoxide ion and the same substrate as in

14:33.780 --> 14:37.860
our previous example where we used hydroxide as the base.

14:37.860 --> 14:42.980
So just like hydroxide, the tbutoxide ion has a choice of two different protons, which

14:42.980 --> 14:49.340
it can abstract, to form two different structural isomers of the alkene product.

14:49.340 --> 14:53.860
The difference in this situation is that the ratio of these products is flipped over.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.220
It's on its head.

14:55.220 --> 14:59.580
When we do this analysis, we find that we get tbutanol and bromide ion byproducts.

14:59.580 --> 15:04.740
And as the major product, we have our alkene, which has only one R group.

15:04.740 --> 15:11.220
So in this case, we've made more of the antiseptsep product or the Hoffman product.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.220
So the question here is, why did this happen?

15:13.220 --> 15:19.900
Well, the reason that it happened is because this large, bulky tbutoxide base has difficulty

15:19.900 --> 15:24.820
accessing this sterically crowded interior hydrogen.

15:24.820 --> 15:29.420
So more often than not, it simply reacts with its third choice.

15:29.420 --> 15:33.020
Can't get to the electrophilic carbon, can't get to the interior hydrogen.

15:33.020 --> 15:38.140
The only thing left to react with are these protons that are out on the edge of the molecule.

15:38.140 --> 15:42.740
And removing one of those protons results in the formation of the antiseptsep or Hoffman

15:42.740 --> 15:45.940
product.

15:45.940 --> 15:50.540
Now let's consider regiospecificity in the E1 mechanism.

15:50.540 --> 15:55.340
Just as with E2 reactions, we need to be careful to consider how an E1 might produce multiple

15:55.340 --> 15:58.140
products of varying stability.

15:58.140 --> 16:02.540
And we've already established that E1 reactions are expected to proceed through a carbocation

16:02.540 --> 16:03.740
intermediate.

16:03.740 --> 16:08.100
And this has two important influences on the products formed by such a reaction.

16:08.100 --> 16:14.260
First, the carbocation is planar, which means that they form a planar intermediate, making

16:14.260 --> 16:19.980
the even more sterically obstructed beta protons accessible to the weak base.

16:19.980 --> 16:26.500
This means E1 reactions are much less prone to form Hoffman or antiseptsep products.

16:26.500 --> 16:33.420
So the reaction of water with 2-bromo-2-methylbutane forms 2-methyl-2-butene, just as the analogous

16:33.420 --> 16:35.740
E2 reaction.

16:35.740 --> 16:40.020
But the reaction with t-butanol, a bulky weak base, has little effect.

16:40.020 --> 16:45.140
We still get the zets of product as the major species.

16:45.140 --> 16:50.300
But there's another consideration which always comes with first-order reactants, carbocation

16:50.300 --> 16:52.340
rearrangements.

16:52.340 --> 16:59.980
So the reaction of water with 2-bromo-3-4-dimethylpentane will produce a carbocation, which can not

16:59.980 --> 17:05.300
only undergo a secondary rearrangement, but will then form the tetra-substituted zetsip

17:05.300 --> 17:06.780
product.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.540
So take a look at this product.

17:08.540 --> 17:13.900
The double bond is not even on the original electrophilic carbon.

17:13.900 --> 17:24.660
Now, our explanation of these mechanisms, though, isn't quite complete.

17:24.660 --> 17:29.580
See, when we work with elimination reactions, just like with substitution reactions, we

17:29.580 --> 17:34.660
must not only consider regiospecificity, but also consider the possible effects on the

17:34.660 --> 17:39.300
stereochemistry of products.

17:39.300 --> 17:43.300
Since the product of this reaction is an alkene, of course there's no potential for a chiral

17:43.300 --> 17:50.460
center to form, but a stereocenter may yet be produced in the form of cis and trans isomers.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.360
Take the example of 2-bromo-butane.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.780
Because this is a secondary alkyl halide, it can undergo an E2 elimination in the presence

17:57.780 --> 18:04.580
of a strong base or an E1 elimination in the presence of a weak one.

18:04.580 --> 18:08.580
Let's begin by considering an E2 product, which we might generate with a strong base

18:08.580 --> 18:12.460
like t-butoxide or hydroxide.

18:12.460 --> 18:16.700
We already know that Zetsev's rule predicts the reaction to take place through deprotonation

18:16.700 --> 18:23.680
of the secondary beta proton, leading to a disubstituted alkene, 2-butene, rather than

18:23.680 --> 18:29.180
a primary hydrogen, which would lead to a monosubstituted alkene.

18:29.180 --> 18:33.740
But the 2-butene products can form two different isomers, cis or trans.

18:33.740 --> 18:38.340
Now, each of these products results when we have a different dihedral angle among the

18:38.340 --> 18:41.660
methyl and bromine substituents.

18:41.660 --> 18:46.460
You might recall that I alluded to this issue when we first introduced Newman projections.

18:46.460 --> 18:52.140
Well, here's my Newman projection of S2-bromobutane.

18:52.140 --> 18:58.780
I can place this molecule in a reactive position for an E2 by aligning either of the two beta

18:58.780 --> 19:02.020
protons anti-coplanar to the bromine.

19:02.020 --> 19:04.940
But look at what happens to the methyl substituents.

19:04.940 --> 19:11.340
Depending on which rotational state, or rotamer, is adopted, a different beta proton is removed

19:11.460 --> 19:16.940
and I get a different arrangement of substituents in the resulting alkene.

19:16.940 --> 19:23.100
With methyl groups anti-to-one another, I get the transisomer, or E2-butene.

19:23.100 --> 19:28.300
Whereas when the alternative hydrogen is aligned for the E2 reaction, methyl groups are gauche

19:28.300 --> 19:33.740
to one another, creating a less stable starting state for the reaction.

19:33.740 --> 19:37.900
So as you might guess, the major elimination product is the one formed by the most often

19:37.900 --> 19:45.940
sampled reactive rotamer in the starting material, or the E-isomer.

19:45.940 --> 19:50.100
But there are instances in which only one isomer is possible for an E2.

19:50.100 --> 19:55.460
For example, take S2-bromo R3-methylpentane.

19:55.460 --> 19:59.980
If I were to begin with this starting material, a large base like t-butoxide might give me

19:59.980 --> 20:05.460
the Hoffman or anti-Zetzep product of which only one isomer exists.

20:05.500 --> 20:10.540
But if we use a compact, strong base like hydroxide, there's only one rotameric state

20:10.540 --> 20:14.740
which will allow an E2 reaction to take place.

20:14.740 --> 20:19.940
As you can see from the Newman projection, the predicted product is actually the Z-isomer

20:19.940 --> 20:22.060
of the alkene.

20:22.060 --> 20:29.660
E1 reactions are also prone to stereospecificity, but almost always preferentially form E-isomers

20:29.660 --> 20:35.180
because carbocation have free rotation, which allows them to adopt the most stable confirmation

20:35.180 --> 20:39.740
with large groups at opposition before the elimination completes.

20:39.740 --> 20:51.780
So in most cases, this means the E-isomer.

20:51.780 --> 20:55.820
So far, we've considered elimination reactions using branched and linear alkyl halides as

20:55.820 --> 20:57.940
starting materials.

20:57.940 --> 21:02.500
All of these examples have enjoyed free rotation about the bonds between alpha and beta carbons,

21:02.500 --> 21:07.180
allowing them to adopt reactive confirmations for E2 reactions.

21:07.180 --> 21:11.340
But there's a class of alkyl halide which doesn't have this free rotation.

21:11.340 --> 21:14.500
Think about a cyclic alkyl halide.

21:14.500 --> 21:20.820
Just as with cyclic alkanes, there is an associated ring strain in smaller cyclic alkyl halides,

21:20.820 --> 21:25.300
which means that the carbon-carbon bonds making up the ring can't freely rotate, and this

21:25.300 --> 21:28.340
can cause a serious problem.

21:29.340 --> 21:38.380
Let's consider the first-order reaction between trans, 1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane, and water.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.180
Water is a very weak nucleophile, and our substrate is secondary.

21:42.180 --> 21:46.220
So when I react these two with one another, what potential products might I make?

21:46.220 --> 21:52.700
Well, the secondary carbocation produced in this E1 reaction can form one of two products,

21:52.700 --> 21:57.940
three-methylhexene, or one-methylhexene.

21:57.940 --> 22:04.300
But this carbocation can also rearrange by a hydride shift to form a tertiary carbocation,

22:04.300 --> 22:06.940
which can also produce one-methylhexene.

22:06.940 --> 22:12.260
But also a small amount of methylene-cyclohexane can occur as well.

22:12.260 --> 22:17.340
So by switching to an E2 mechanism, using hydroxide, you might be tempted to say that

22:17.340 --> 22:23.660
the major product would be one-methylcyclohexane in accordance with Zetzsev's rule.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.660
But in this case, there's a problem.

22:26.660 --> 22:31.660
The ring restricts rotation of the bond between the alpha and beta carbons, and simply will

22:31.660 --> 22:37.740
not allow the tertiary beta proton to achieve the necessary anti-coplanar alignment for

22:37.740 --> 22:40.940
the reaction.

22:40.940 --> 22:49.620
So this reaction will produce only one elimination product in the form of three-methylcyclohexane.

22:49.620 --> 22:54.540
The ability of cyclic alkyl halides to undergo E2 reactions is also severely limited by the

22:54.540 --> 23:01.100
need for the halide to be in an axial position for the proper orbital alignments.

23:01.100 --> 23:06.940
Consider the two isomers of one T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane.

23:06.940 --> 23:12.340
The trans-isomer is essentially incapable of undergoing E2 reactions, because a set of

23:12.340 --> 23:17.300
one-three-diaxial interactions is so strong that the molecule simply can't achieve that

23:17.300 --> 23:20.660
reactive confirmation.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.460
But now take a look at the cis-confirmation.

23:23.460 --> 23:29.220
Now that T-butyl group wanting to be equatorial forces the chloride-leaving group into a reactive

23:29.220 --> 23:38.780
confirmation, so the order of reactivity with respect to E2 is trans-1-T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane,

23:38.780 --> 23:46.020
then chlorocyclohexane, and finally the most reactive is cis-1-T-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane.

23:54.260 --> 23:57.900
So far I've done my best to keep the world of substitution and elimination reactions

23:57.900 --> 24:02.020
separate from one another, showing my best attempts at examples which strongly favor

24:02.020 --> 24:04.900
one process or the other.

24:04.900 --> 24:08.620
Even so, you might have already noticed that I used the exact same set of reagents to show

24:08.620 --> 24:15.620
you SN1 and E1 reactions, so clearly there's a potential here for competition.

24:15.620 --> 24:20.500
And the truth is that substitution and elimination reactions go together like coffee and donuts.

24:20.500 --> 24:25.980
They are seldom found occurring exclusively, and they often compete with one another.

24:25.980 --> 24:30.940
And the key to defining which mechanism will prevail is in the reaction conditions.

24:30.940 --> 24:35.860
Now you'll recall that the Gibbs free energy equation is a function of temperature, so

24:35.860 --> 24:41.140
the extent to which entropy contributes to a process's spontaneity is a function of

24:41.140 --> 24:42.940
temperature.

24:42.940 --> 24:48.380
Higher temperature means entropy has a greater role, and as you might expect, increasing

24:48.380 --> 24:54.300
temperature makes the increased entropy of the elimination products more favored.

24:54.300 --> 24:59.100
So if I have a reaction with competing substitution and elimination pathways, one way to tip the

24:59.100 --> 25:04.380
scales in the direction I want is to use a little bit of heat.

25:04.380 --> 25:10.220
For example, the reaction of methoxide with tube-romo-3-ethyl pentane forms the substitution

25:10.220 --> 25:13.300
product predominantly at room temperature.

25:13.300 --> 25:17.740
But there will be more of the 3-ethyl-2-pentene product forming when the reaction is run at

25:17.740 --> 25:20.260
elevated temperatures.

25:20.260 --> 25:26.540
So if we instead want to maximize the yield of the antiseptic product, 3-ethyl-1-pentene,

25:26.540 --> 25:32.140
we can substitute a bulkier base like t-butoxide in place of the methoxide, still running

25:32.140 --> 25:35.140
at higher temperatures to encourage elimination.

25:35.140 --> 25:39.380
We can actually direct the double bond to the primary carbon by careful selection of

25:39.380 --> 25:42.740
the base.

25:42.740 --> 25:48.060
The strong bases favor second-order reactions, lower temperatures favor substitution, higher

25:48.060 --> 25:53.460
temperatures with small strong bases favor elimination to form the Zetzev product, while

25:53.460 --> 26:06.020
higher temperatures with bulky bases tend to favor the antisetzev or Hoffman product.

26:06.020 --> 26:11.340
So today we've covered our second major class of organic reaction, eliminations.

26:11.340 --> 26:16.020
We got to know Zetzev again, a Russian chemist whose epic power struggle with Markovnikov

26:16.020 --> 26:20.620
at the University of Kazan in the 1870s led to much of our understanding about this class

26:20.620 --> 26:23.140
of reaction.

26:23.140 --> 26:27.860
We saw how elimination takes place when Lewis bases abstract beta protons instead of acting

26:27.860 --> 26:31.500
as nucleophiles.

26:31.500 --> 26:37.280
We looked at second-order E2 elimination reactions, in which direction takes place with a highly

26:37.280 --> 26:40.860
substituted substrate or strong base.

26:40.860 --> 26:46.460
We saw how a beta proton in an anticoplanar relationship to the leaving group can be abstracted,

26:46.460 --> 26:51.860
causing simultaneous leaving group departure to form an alkene.

26:51.860 --> 26:56.660
We also looked at E1 reactions, which take place when there is only a weak non-nucleophilic

26:56.660 --> 26:58.700
base present.

26:58.700 --> 27:07.060
These reactions progress through a carbocation intermediate, which makes them subject to rearrangements.

27:07.060 --> 27:11.220
We took a look at how the strength of the base dictates the order of the reaction.

27:11.220 --> 27:15.180
Strong bases for second-order, weaker bases for first-order.

27:15.180 --> 27:19.740
We saw how bulky bases combined with more substituted beta carbons can lead to a situation

27:19.740 --> 27:25.340
in which Zetzev's rule fails to accurately predict the major product.

27:25.340 --> 27:29.880
We also briefly discussed the idea that substitution and elimination frequently compete with one

27:29.880 --> 27:35.520
another in the same flask, and how certain reaction conditions, most notably the temperature,

27:35.520 --> 27:39.020
can be altered to promote the desired mechanism.

27:39.020 --> 27:44.580
We'll see all of these topics applied again as we begin to discuss more specific and complex

27:44.580 --> 27:46.620
elimination reactions.

27:46.620 --> 27:52.060
But before we can do that, we need to complete the trifecta of major organic reaction types.

27:52.060 --> 27:57.420
We still have to consider addition reactions, in which alkenes and alkynes can give up,

27:57.420 --> 28:02.300
some are all of their pi bonds, to be converted into a host of useful compounds, from vinyl

28:02.300 --> 28:07.040
chlorides used to make plastics to the margarine that you put on your toast this morning.

28:07.040 --> 28:07.600
I'll see you then.
