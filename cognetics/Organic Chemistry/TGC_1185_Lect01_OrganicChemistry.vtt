00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:59.720
You're lecture is Dr. Ron B. Davis, Jr. Dr. Davis is a

00:59.720 --> 01:02.480
visiting assistant professor of chemistry at Georgetown

01:02.480 --> 01:05.640
University, where he has been teaching introductory organic

01:05.640 --> 01:09.680
chemistry laboratory since 2008. He earned his PhD in

01:09.680 --> 01:13.360
chemistry from the Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Davis

01:13.360 --> 01:16.600
research has been published in such scholarly journals as

01:16.600 --> 01:21.200
proteins and biochemistry and has been presented at the annual

01:21.200 --> 01:24.960
symposium of the Protein Society. He also maintains an

01:24.960 --> 01:28.920
educational YouTube channel and provides interviews and content

01:28.920 --> 01:31.600
to various media outlets, including the Discovery

01:31.600 --> 01:35.600
Channel. At Penn State, Dr. Davis received a Delilian

01:35.600 --> 01:38.320
Fellowship and the Denmark Teaching Award.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.400
Most of our understanding of the chemistry of carbon based

01:58.400 --> 02:01.640
compounds has been accumulated since the discovery of some

02:01.640 --> 02:06.680
of the most fundamental elements less than 300 years ago. In

02:06.680 --> 02:10.040
fact, it was only about 3000 years ago that ancient Greek and

02:10.040 --> 02:13.040
Chinese thinkers were the first to postulate the existence of

02:13.040 --> 02:18.400
fundamental substances at all. But Mother Nature got a head

02:18.400 --> 02:22.360
star on us about 3 billion years ago, when the first living

02:22.360 --> 02:26.200
organic chemist on Earth came into existence. Here's one.

02:27.160 --> 02:31.240
Cyanobacteria believed by most to be the first living organisms

02:31.240 --> 02:35.400
to inhabit the face of the Earth. Fossil evidence shows that

02:35.400 --> 02:39.040
these bacteria took up residence here about 2.7 billion years

02:39.040 --> 02:44.200
ago. Now these little creatures fed, grew and self replicated.

02:44.760 --> 02:49.440
They contain lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, all the usual

02:49.440 --> 02:53.040
suspects from a modern biochemistry course. And for the

02:53.040 --> 02:57.040
basis of their biochemistry, the central element upon which they

02:57.040 --> 02:59.720
built the molecular machinery which sustained their own

02:59.720 --> 03:05.640
existence, they chose carbon. Through the process of evolution,

03:06.160 --> 03:08.920
the foundations of their biochemistry were passed on to

03:08.960 --> 03:13.280
each and every living thing that has ever lived on Earth. As

03:13.280 --> 03:16.240
unicellular organisms continued to evolve and their chemical

03:16.240 --> 03:20.160
systems grew in complexity, more ordered eukaryotic cells formed

03:20.160 --> 03:23.960
with organelles to carry out specialized functions. Then came

03:23.960 --> 03:27.360
multicellular aquatic organisms and terrestrial plant life and

03:27.360 --> 03:34.520
animals. But through 2.7 billion years of evolution, to the best

03:34.520 --> 03:39.120
of our knowledge, life as we know it has never, not once

03:39.360 --> 03:42.760
abandoned its choice of carbon as the foundation onto which it

03:42.760 --> 03:47.440
builds its most essential chemistry. With almost 100

03:47.440 --> 03:50.680
naturally occurring elements and such an expansive time frame,

03:51.200 --> 03:54.960
you might think that somewhere, sometime under some set of

03:54.960 --> 03:58.880
environmental stresses, life would try a different element and

03:58.880 --> 04:03.640
have some success. Yet all evidence points to the contrary,

04:04.080 --> 04:06.800
it simply hasn't. But why?

04:09.160 --> 04:12.280
Carbon is not the most abundant element on Earth, nor is it

04:12.280 --> 04:16.200
particularly scarce. It's easily made in the furnace of a star

04:16.240 --> 04:20.680
like our sun. But then so are the other 25 of the lightest 26

04:20.680 --> 04:25.200
elements in our universe. At the sixth smallest in size, its

04:25.200 --> 04:28.240
atoms don't have an unusually complex or simple structure to

04:28.240 --> 04:32.080
them. Can't stack up to the ferocious reactivity of elements

04:32.080 --> 04:36.840
like fluorine, nor is it rock stable like helium. At a glance,

04:36.840 --> 04:41.880
it seems that there is nothing special about carbon. But in a

04:41.880 --> 04:45.760
way, that is just what makes carbon such a perfect choice to

04:45.760 --> 04:49.880
serve as the scaffold for the chemistry of life. It strikes the

04:49.880 --> 04:53.800
right balance of properties, which make it uniquely suited to

04:53.800 --> 04:57.960
its role in living systems. And it's this balance that makes

04:57.960 --> 05:01.800
carbon the undisputed centerpiece of living systems.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.920
But carbon's story doesn't end there. Not only is it central to

05:07.920 --> 05:11.400
the chemistry of life, but it also serves as a structural basis

05:11.400 --> 05:15.400
for materials of incredible strength, fuels with tremendous

05:15.400 --> 05:18.400
amounts of stored chemical energy, and life saving

05:18.400 --> 05:24.280
medicines. Carbon's story is nothing short of incredible. So

05:24.280 --> 05:27.040
incredible that we've honored it with something no other element

05:27.040 --> 05:32.440
has its own branch of chemistry. And we call this branch organic

05:32.440 --> 05:32.920
chemistry.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.240
Today, I would like to discuss the essentials of organic

05:38.240 --> 05:43.240
chemistry. We'll be looking at what organic chemistry is, how

05:43.240 --> 05:46.960
organic chemistry is practiced, and where we can find organic

05:46.960 --> 05:52.360
chemistry operating in our world. And don't fall into the trap of

05:52.360 --> 05:56.200
thinking about the science that goes on in laboratories. Organic

05:56.200 --> 05:59.280
chemistry is going on in places many of us may not typically

05:59.280 --> 06:03.600
imagine. We can find it at work all around us in places as

06:03.600 --> 06:07.360
distant and exotic as deep within the Earth's crust, or

06:07.360 --> 06:12.280
interstellar space. It's also all around us going on right now

06:12.320 --> 06:16.400
inside countless manufacturing facilities around the world. It's

06:16.400 --> 06:19.440
powering the engines of the vehicles passing by this studio. And

06:19.440 --> 06:22.040
it's even going on in your own body right now.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.520
During our time together today, I'll be discussing what is

06:27.520 --> 06:30.720
arguably one of humanity's greatest intellectual achievements,

06:31.080 --> 06:35.560
the science of chemistry. Then we'll explore how our growing

06:35.560 --> 06:38.320
understanding of how to manipulate the molecules of life

06:38.560 --> 06:41.840
eventually led us to establish the discipline of organic

06:41.840 --> 06:48.080
chemistry. Next, we will briefly discuss the structure of the

06:48.080 --> 06:52.560
fundamental unit of all known elements, the atom. We'll also

06:52.560 --> 06:55.360
take a look at a portion of the well-known tool of chemists, the

06:55.360 --> 06:58.560
periodic table of the elements, which helps us to predict their

06:58.560 --> 07:02.160
behavior and their properties. Here we will be answering the

07:02.160 --> 07:06.080
question, what is it about carbon that makes it nature's choice

07:06.080 --> 07:10.000
to serve as the basic scaffold for many of the molecules we

07:10.000 --> 07:15.680
depend on to sustain and improve life. Finally, we'll take a

07:15.680 --> 07:18.440
look at a few real world examples of how carbon atoms come

07:18.440 --> 07:21.680
together to form the backbones of the molecules that become our

07:21.680 --> 07:26.040
building materials, food, fuels, drugs, and so much more.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.840
By the end of our discussion, I hope that you'll have a deeper

07:31.840 --> 07:35.920
appreciation of organic chemistry, of its definition, its

07:35.920 --> 07:39.160
origins, and how it helps to improve the quality of life of

07:39.160 --> 07:43.320
nearly every human on the planet. If I'm able to succeed in

07:43.320 --> 07:46.680
that endeavor, I invite you to stay for the next 35 lectures to

07:46.680 --> 07:50.920
learn even more about this well understood, but ever evolving

07:50.920 --> 07:56.760
and growing branch of chemistry. So first, let's define the

07:56.760 --> 08:01.760
science of chemistry. Scientists define chemistry as the study

08:01.760 --> 08:05.520
of matter and its properties, particularly those of atomic and

08:05.520 --> 08:10.040
molecular systems. One of the defining tenets of chemistry is

08:10.040 --> 08:13.480
the idea that all substances can be broken down into their

08:13.480 --> 08:17.040
basic elements, which can no longer be subdivided while still

08:17.040 --> 08:19.880
retaining their identity. Ancient Greek and Chinese

08:19.880 --> 08:23.240
civilizations are often credited with first theorizing the

08:23.240 --> 08:26.400
existence of fundamental elements that combine to form all

08:26.400 --> 08:30.920
other substances. Both of these civilizations postulated that

08:30.920 --> 08:36.000
air, water, earth, and fire were among these elements. Of

08:36.000 --> 08:39.440
course, today we know this list to be inaccurate. Now, the

08:39.440 --> 08:43.040
realization of this began in the 18th century, when a French

08:43.040 --> 08:46.800
chemist and nobleman named Antoine Lavoisier became the

08:46.800 --> 08:50.240
first to catalog the existence and properties of some of the

08:50.240 --> 08:55.680
elements as we know them today. Lavoisier started to develop

08:55.680 --> 08:58.640
this catalog when he challenged the two millennium old notion

08:58.640 --> 09:02.120
that water is an element. He knew that if water were an

09:02.120 --> 09:04.880
element, then he should not be able to decompose it into

09:04.880 --> 09:09.120
simpler substances. But he noted that heating water in the

09:09.120 --> 09:12.440
presence of iron in a closed system had two intriguing

09:12.440 --> 09:17.240
effects. First, it turned the iron to rust, which appeared to

09:17.240 --> 09:21.920
increase the mass of the iron sample. And second, it produced

09:21.920 --> 09:25.880
a vapor which could be collected separately and then burned in

09:25.880 --> 09:32.240
air to regenerate water. What was going on here was that the

09:32.240 --> 09:35.800
iron was acting as a sink for oxygen, pulling the oxygen out

09:35.800 --> 09:39.320
of the water to become iron oxide and leaving hydrogen gas

09:39.320 --> 09:43.800
behind as a byproduct. Any doubt that water had in fact been

09:43.800 --> 09:47.280
decomposed was eradicated when Lavoisier showed that he could

09:47.280 --> 09:51.960
burn the collected gas to reform his water. So, Lavoisier had

09:51.960 --> 09:55.920
successfully disassembled and then reassembled water in the

09:55.920 --> 10:02.160
1700s. Lavoisier's tinkering proves that contrary to ancient

10:02.160 --> 10:06.960
thought, water is not an element, but instead is made up of

10:06.960 --> 10:11.440
more basic materials in combination with each other. But

10:11.440 --> 10:14.160
Lavoisier's best efforts to decompose the resulting gases

10:14.160 --> 10:17.280
from his first experiment failed, prompting him to

10:17.280 --> 10:21.120
categorize those as elements. Now, since it could be burned in

10:21.120 --> 10:23.800
air, at least the gas that he collected, could be burned in air

10:23.800 --> 10:30.960
to produce water, he dubbed it hydrogen, meaning water maker.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.040
Lavoisier's classification techniques quickly gained favor

10:34.040 --> 10:37.240
in the scientific community and the list of identified elements

10:37.240 --> 10:42.000
rapidly grew in the decades following his work. In the late

10:42.000 --> 10:46.600
1800s, a Russian chemist by the name of Dmitry Mendeleev took

10:46.600 --> 10:50.680
notice of something extraordinary. Mendeleev realized

10:50.720 --> 10:53.560
that when he listed the known elements in order of increasing

10:53.560 --> 10:58.240
atomic mass, they formed a series of materials, some of which

10:58.240 --> 11:02.760
seemed to have similar sets of chemical and physical properties.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.760
And when he spaced these elements so that similar properties

11:05.760 --> 11:09.720
repeated every eight positions in the list, he could account for

11:09.720 --> 11:15.000
all the known elements of his day. But what is even more

11:15.000 --> 11:18.760
amazing is that the gaps left in Mendeleev's table allowed him

11:18.760 --> 11:22.240
to predict the properties of yet undiscovered elements, all of

11:22.240 --> 11:27.120
which eventually turned up. Mendeleev's true genius was to

11:27.120 --> 11:30.720
visually demonstrate this repeating pattern by wrapping

11:30.720 --> 11:34.080
the lines of atoms into rows, much like lines of text in a

11:34.080 --> 11:38.280
paragraph. And by doing this, he created a table with columns of

11:38.280 --> 11:42.640
elements sharing similar chemical properties. We call these

11:42.640 --> 11:47.320
columns from his table groups of elements. More than 200 years

11:47.320 --> 11:50.800
later, his pivotal invention has been refined and expanded into

11:50.800 --> 11:57.520
what we know as the modern periodic table. So we've seen

11:57.520 --> 11:59.960
that chemistry is the study of matter and its properties.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.240
Given that all objects in the universe can be classified as

12:03.240 --> 12:06.840
matter, and that nearly all of this matter is made up of atoms

12:06.840 --> 12:09.760
and molecules, you can understand why chemistry is an

12:09.760 --> 12:15.920
extremely broad field of study. And with such a tremendous field

12:15.920 --> 12:19.840
of cover, it's easy to see why those practicing the science

12:19.880 --> 12:23.280
divide their interest into subdisciplines, like biological

12:23.280 --> 12:28.800
chemistry, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and more. And

12:28.800 --> 12:31.520
while each subdiscipline is a topic worthy of study and

12:31.520 --> 12:34.800
appreciation, for the duration of this course, we will be

12:34.800 --> 12:38.320
interested in organic chemistry. Although there will

12:38.320 --> 12:41.280
inevitably be times when organic chemistry bleeds into these

12:41.280 --> 12:50.280
other realms. So what is organic chemistry? When most people

12:50.280 --> 12:53.520
think of the word organic, they may think of expensive

12:53.520 --> 12:56.440
salad greens, health food stores or sustainable farming

12:56.440 --> 12:59.880
techniques. But to the chemist, the word organic means

12:59.880 --> 13:04.320
something very different. Organic chemistry is most simply

13:04.320 --> 13:09.240
defined as the study of carbon based molecules. Compounds

13:09.240 --> 13:12.720
such as the hydrocarbons and gasoline, the sugars in the

13:12.720 --> 13:16.000
foods we eat, many modern materials ranging from

13:16.000 --> 13:19.480
explosives to plastics are all built on carbon based

13:19.480 --> 13:26.200
backbones, and therefore all fall into this category. The term

13:26.240 --> 13:29.840
organic as it pertains to the study of chemistry was coined in

13:29.840 --> 13:34.080
the late 1700s. It's a reflection of a common paradigm of

13:34.080 --> 13:37.840
that day, that only organisms could create these kinds of

13:37.840 --> 13:41.960
carbon based molecules. See, scientists of that day had

13:41.960 --> 13:44.760
already successfully isolated carbon based compounds like

13:44.760 --> 13:49.200
urea from biological sources. And it was commonly presumed that

13:49.200 --> 13:54.240
living things possessed a special trait known as vitality that

13:54.240 --> 13:57.080
was necessary to produce the chemicals of living systems.

13:59.560 --> 14:04.640
This dogma persisted for many decades, until 1828, when

14:04.640 --> 14:09.120
German chemist Friedrich Voller produced urea without the aid of

14:09.120 --> 14:13.800
a living organism. Voller simply heated the inorganic materials

14:13.840 --> 14:17.760
ammonia and cyanic acid in an attempt to synthesize another

14:17.800 --> 14:22.480
inorganic material called ammonium cyanate. But much to his

14:22.480 --> 14:28.440
surprise, the product of his synthesis was instead urea. Since

14:28.440 --> 14:31.680
then, Voller's synthesis has become the stuff of chemistry

14:31.680 --> 14:36.240
lore. Many chemists point to it as a seminal moment in chemistry

14:36.360 --> 14:40.240
when vitalism was disproven, and scientists began to realize

14:40.240 --> 14:43.680
organic compounds could be made and manipulated, not just in

14:43.680 --> 14:50.000
living things, but in a beaker as well. In the nearly two

14:50.000 --> 14:52.360
centuries since Voller's inspiration will all be at

14:52.360 --> 14:56.160
accidental synthesis. Organic chemists have classified and

14:56.160 --> 14:59.120
created millions of organic compounds that enhance the

14:59.120 --> 15:07.440
quality of life of nearly everyone on Earth. With over 100

15:07.440 --> 15:11.040
elements in the modern periodic table, we're forced to ask the

15:11.040 --> 15:15.440
question, What makes carbon so special? Why does carbon get

15:15.440 --> 15:19.320
its own branch of chemistry? Now, the answer to this question

15:19.320 --> 15:24.200
lies in a balance of three key factors, abundance, complexity,

15:24.680 --> 15:29.040
and stability. When we compare carbon to the other elements

15:29.080 --> 15:32.000
in the first three rows of the periodic table, we'll see that

15:32.040 --> 15:36.160
only carbon is able to blend these three factors in a unique

15:36.160 --> 15:42.400
way. Let's start by comparing abundance. If we were to make a

15:42.400 --> 15:45.280
table of the estimated relative abundance of elements in our

15:45.280 --> 15:50.000
solar system by mass, we'd see something like this. Many of the

15:50.000 --> 15:53.160
elements are so vanishingly rare that they don't even register

15:53.160 --> 15:57.520
on our chart. Hydrogen is the clear winner at about 73

15:57.520 --> 16:02.320
mass percent, followed by helium comprising 24% and then

16:02.360 --> 16:07.440
oxygen at about 1%. So out of more than 100 known elements,

16:07.480 --> 16:11.200
just this trio makes up 98% of all the matter in our solar

16:11.200 --> 16:15.920
system. But coming in at number four is carbon, making up

16:15.920 --> 16:19.560
somewhere around one half of 1% of all the matter in the solar

16:19.560 --> 16:23.160
system. Now, based on this information alone, you might

16:23.160 --> 16:25.800
expect to find subdisciplines of chemistry focusing on the

16:25.840 --> 16:30.280
chemistry of hydrogen, helium or oxygen as well. Yet these

16:30.280 --> 16:36.000
subdisciplines do not exist. These numbers are a bit different

16:36.040 --> 16:39.680
when we consider just the earth or even portions of it. Now, the

16:39.680 --> 16:42.120
truth is, we're not quite sure just how much of each element

16:42.120 --> 16:45.920
makes up the overall mass of our planet. We do know, however,

16:46.160 --> 16:50.080
that as the planet cooled more than 4 billion years ago, much of

16:50.080 --> 16:52.920
the denser elements like iron and nickel found their way to the

16:52.920 --> 16:56.800
core of the planet. Intermediate sized elements like silicon and

16:56.800 --> 17:00.600
aluminum were sorted into the crust, leaving behind even

17:00.600 --> 17:04.000
lighter elements like carbon and higher concentrations at and

17:04.000 --> 17:09.760
near the surface. So carbon is ever present near the surface of

17:09.760 --> 17:12.760
the earth in environments which might support life as we know

17:12.760 --> 17:16.960
it. But our best estimates of the amount of carbon in those

17:16.960 --> 17:20.560
environments, the world's atmosphere, oceans and crust is

17:20.560 --> 17:25.360
never more than about 1% of the total mass. This means that

17:25.360 --> 17:28.240
there's enough carbon there to work with. But if abundance were

17:28.240 --> 17:31.800
the only concern, then there would clearly be better choices.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.320
And yet, when we turn our attention to our own bodies, we

17:38.320 --> 17:42.120
see that we are actually made up of about 20% carbon by mass.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.680
This is far more than the relative abundance of carbon in our

17:45.680 --> 17:49.200
environment, far more than the oceans, the atmosphere or dry

17:49.200 --> 17:53.400
land. So carbon is available, but so are many other candidates.

17:53.760 --> 17:58.080
So what's going on here? What makes the difference? Why use

17:58.080 --> 17:58.560
carbon?

18:01.040 --> 18:03.400
Well, clearly, there's something about carbon that makes it a

18:03.400 --> 18:05.680
better choice for the structural basis of organic

18:05.680 --> 18:09.080
molecules. With such an enormous amount of carbon in

18:09.080 --> 18:12.160
biological systems relative to the environment around us, it's

18:12.160 --> 18:15.000
easy to see how the concept of vitalism was originally

18:15.000 --> 18:15.720
conceived.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.920
But if vitalism has been shown to be an invalid theory, why is it

18:20.920 --> 18:24.240
that carbon has been selected by nature to be the backbone for

18:24.240 --> 18:25.800
the molecules essential to life?

18:26.960 --> 18:30.440
Why would life go to the trouble of increasing carbon content

18:30.440 --> 18:33.840
20 fold over what was available in the environment, especially

18:33.840 --> 18:36.560
when there are much more abundant elements available, like

18:36.560 --> 18:41.160
nitrogen, which makes up 78% of our atmosphere, or oxygen and

18:41.160 --> 18:45.440
hydrogen, which combined to make up a staggering 96% of our

18:46.360 --> 18:51.360
oceans, or silicon, which comes in at a very respectable 27% of

18:51.360 --> 18:52.280
the Earth's crust?

18:54.200 --> 18:57.040
In order to answer this question, we'll have to take a look at

18:57.040 --> 19:00.080
the bonding behavior of carbon compared to other even more

19:00.080 --> 19:03.480
abundant elements and try to explain a bit better why carbon

19:03.480 --> 19:05.360
is so special when compared to them.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.320
But before we can have this discussion, we first need to

19:09.320 --> 19:11.120
consider the structure of atoms.

19:12.120 --> 19:16.120
All atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded

19:16.120 --> 19:18.600
by a cloud of negatively charged electrons.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.120
The electron clouds of two or more atoms can interact with one

19:23.120 --> 19:26.120
another in ways which can find those atoms to a fixed distance

19:26.120 --> 19:27.120
in space.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.120
We call this interaction between atoms a covalent chemical bond.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.120
Now, one of the remarkable things about Mendeleev's brain

19:36.120 --> 19:39.120
child, the periodic table of the elements, is that it actually

19:39.120 --> 19:42.120
predicts the maximum number of these covalent bonding

19:42.120 --> 19:46.120
interactions that a particular atom can form with others.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.120
If we start from the leftmost column of the table, elements

19:51.120 --> 19:54.120
of the first group can form one bond at most.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.120
Those of the second can form two, and the trend continues

19:59.120 --> 20:01.120
until we reach the fourth group.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.120
After this, the maximum number of possible bonds begins to

20:05.120 --> 20:10.120
decrease again to three, two, one, and finally, zero.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.120
This makes hydrogen a relatively uninteresting nucleus

20:15.120 --> 20:18.120
from the bonding perspective, since it can only form a single

20:18.120 --> 20:20.120
bond with another atom.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.120
So hydrogen atoms are the end-linked chains of bonded atoms.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.120
They can't bond any more or two anymore atoms to continue

20:28.120 --> 20:31.120
creating a complex structure, because doing so would require

20:31.120 --> 20:33.120
that they make a second bond.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.120
That makes hydrogen the placeholder of organic chemistry,

20:36.120 --> 20:39.120
occupying locations on a molecule in which differing groups

20:39.120 --> 20:42.120
of atoms might be placed to alter that molecule's

20:42.120 --> 20:44.120
identity and reactivity.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.120
Helium, nature's second most abundant element overall,

20:50.120 --> 20:53.120
though vanishingly rare on Earth, appears in group

20:53.120 --> 20:56.120
eight of the periodic table, making it unlikely to form

20:56.120 --> 20:58.120
any bonds at all.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.120
Helium actually exists only naturally as isolated atoms

21:02.120 --> 21:05.120
that don't commonly react with other elements.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.120
It's not essential to life at all.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.120
In fact, Helium's lack of reactivity kept its existence

21:11.120 --> 21:14.120
concealed from chemists for nearly a century after the

21:14.120 --> 21:16.120
discovery of elements like hydrogen.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.120
French astronomer Pierre Janssen first observed Helium

21:20.120 --> 21:24.120
when studying a solar eclipse in 1868, a century after

21:24.120 --> 21:26.120
Lavoisier's work.

21:26.120 --> 21:29.120
And it was only after several more decades of searching

21:29.120 --> 21:32.120
that Helium was finally found to be present on Earth.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.120
An English physicist, Sir William Ramsey, found it,

21:36.120 --> 21:39.120
trapped inside of radioactively decomposing minerals,

21:39.120 --> 21:42.120
not exactly a biologically relevant environment.

21:45.120 --> 21:48.120
And our final contender with carbon for the role of backbone

21:48.120 --> 21:50.120
molecule is oxygen.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.120
Oxygen typically makes two bonds to other atoms.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.120
In doing so, oxygen can act either as a bridge,

21:56.120 --> 22:00.120
bonding two different atoms together perpetuating a chain,

22:00.120 --> 22:04.120
or as a terminal atom, making what is known as a double bond.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.120
But once oxygen's two bonds are established,

22:08.120 --> 22:11.120
it is satisfied, and there are no additional locations

22:11.120 --> 22:14.120
available to decorate or modify an oxygen chain.

22:14.120 --> 22:17.120
Using an oxygen chain as a backbone would then lead to

22:17.120 --> 22:20.120
a rather dull set of molecules, just a set of ever-lengthening

22:20.120 --> 22:23.120
chains of oxygen atoms with no additional complexity at all.

22:23.120 --> 22:27.120
But carbon interests organic chemists because it's found

22:27.120 --> 22:29.120
in group four of the periodic table.

22:30.120 --> 22:34.120
This means that it can, and often does, form four bonds

22:34.120 --> 22:37.120
to complete its electron-shell octet.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.120
This is more bonds than any other element in the second row

22:40.120 --> 22:42.120
of the periodic table.

22:42.120 --> 22:46.120
And this allows carbon to bond to itself to form not only chains,

22:46.120 --> 22:50.120
but branched structures, loops, and many, many more.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.120
Furthermore, these complex carbon scaffolds often have

22:54.120 --> 22:57.120
remaining unsatisfied bonds, which can be terminated

22:57.120 --> 23:00.120
by hydrogen atoms, or decorated by hydrogen atoms,

23:00.120 --> 23:03.120
or decorated by hydrogen atoms.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.120
So it should be clear now that those extra bonds

23:06.120 --> 23:09.120
that carbon can form are going to make all the difference.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.120
But we aren't quite done yet.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.120
If you're keeping score, we still have nitrogen

23:14.120 --> 23:17.120
and silicon on the list of possible backbone elements

23:17.120 --> 23:19.120
for larger complex scaffolds.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.120
Nitrogen and silicon have withstood the test

23:23.120 --> 23:26.120
of both abundance and of bonding conditions

23:26.120 --> 23:29.120
in the second row of the periodic table.

23:29.120 --> 23:32.120
And silicon and silicon have withstood the test

23:32.120 --> 23:35.120
of both abundance and of bonding complexity.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.120
With nitrogen abundant in the atmosphere,

23:38.120 --> 23:41.120
able to form three bonds, while silicon makes up

23:41.120 --> 23:44.120
a large part of the Earth's crust and is able to make four bonds.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.120
So we're close.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.120
But what separates carbon from nitrogen and silicon

23:50.120 --> 23:53.120
is the last factor that we have to consider, strength.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.120
You wouldn't build a skyscraper with a frame

23:57.120 --> 24:00.120
because the structural support has to be stronger

24:00.120 --> 24:03.120
than the doors, windows, and walls which it holds in place.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.120
Organic molecules are no different.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.120
Just like a building, they need a support structure

24:12.120 --> 24:15.120
tough enough to hold the functional parts

24:15.120 --> 24:17.120
of the compound in place.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.120
Any candidate for this role will have to be tough enough

24:20.120 --> 24:23.120
to withstand the conditions which cause other parts

24:23.120 --> 24:26.120
of the compound to break their bonds and react.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.120
So the final factor leading to nature's choice of carbon

24:30.120 --> 24:33.120
for small molecule scaffolds is the stability

24:33.120 --> 24:35.120
of the carbon-carbon bond.

24:37.120 --> 24:41.120
You see, bonding is an energetically beneficial arrangement.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.120
And a bond's strength is usually measured

24:44.120 --> 24:48.120
by the amount of energy required to separate the bonded atoms.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.120
Scientists call this the bond enthalpy.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.120
So the larger the bond enthalpy, the harder it is

24:55.120 --> 24:58.120
to pull two bonded atoms apart,

24:58.120 --> 25:01.120
and the stronger the chemical bond is.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.120
If we compare the experimentally determined bond enthalpies

25:05.120 --> 25:08.120
of all first, second, and third row elements

25:08.120 --> 25:12.120
in the periodic table to other atoms of the same kind of element,

25:12.120 --> 25:16.120
we can see that only hydrogen and boron form single bonds

25:16.120 --> 25:20.120
to other atoms of the same kind with similar strengths to carbon.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.120
So hydrogen does bond to itself strongly

25:24.120 --> 25:29.120
and is very abundant, but its one bond limit rules it out.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.120
Boron can form stable bonds with itself

25:32.120 --> 25:35.120
in networks with up to three bonds.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.120
But it's so vanishingly rare in the environment

25:37.120 --> 25:39.120
that it simply can't play an important role

25:39.120 --> 25:41.120
in the chemistry of life.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.120
Our last two viable candidates, nitrogen and silicon,

25:46.120 --> 25:49.120
are finally ruled out when we consider bond strength.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.120
With bonds only about half as strong as carbon,

25:52.120 --> 25:54.120
nitrogen can't compete.

25:54.120 --> 25:58.120
And even silicon, a favorite candidate of sci-fi aficionados everywhere,

25:58.120 --> 26:01.120
as carbons alternate because of its abundance

26:01.120 --> 26:04.120
and ability to form four bonds, fails to meet the final standard.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.120
Because a covalent network of silicon atoms

26:07.120 --> 26:11.120
would simply not be stable enough to survive chemical reactions

26:11.120 --> 26:14.120
meant to modify other bonds within the molecules it would comprise.

26:16.120 --> 26:20.120
So if we consider the first three rows of the periodic table,

26:20.120 --> 26:24.120
removing elements of prohibitively low abundance,

26:24.120 --> 26:28.120
elements incapable of forming more than two bonds,

26:28.120 --> 26:32.120
and those which do not form strong single bonds to themselves,

26:32.120 --> 26:35.120
it now becomes obvious how these three factors

26:35.120 --> 26:40.120
make carbon uniquely suited to the formation of molecular scaffolds.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.120
So I hope that by now I've convinced you

26:45.120 --> 26:48.120
that carbon is nature's best available choice

26:48.120 --> 26:50.120
for the construction of molecular scaffolds

26:50.120 --> 26:53.120
because of its abundance, complex bonding

26:53.120 --> 26:56.120
and the stable bonds it forms with other carbon atoms.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.120
Now I would like to show you specifically how carbon atoms

27:00.120 --> 27:03.120
can combine to form distinct structures

27:03.120 --> 27:05.120
and how decorating these structures with other atoms

27:05.120 --> 27:09.120
can lead to a rich and diverse library of compounds.

27:11.120 --> 27:15.120
Part of what makes carbon scaffolds so prolific and diverse

27:15.120 --> 27:18.120
is the multiple ways in which the four bonds to carbon atoms

27:18.120 --> 27:20.120
can arrange themselves in space.

27:21.120 --> 27:26.120
Remember that chemical bonds are formed when electron clouds overlap

27:26.120 --> 27:29.120
and this produces a region of dense negative charge

27:29.120 --> 27:31.120
between the atom's nuclei.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.120
So these bonds made up of negatively charged electrons

27:35.120 --> 27:38.120
can be thought of as being negatively charged themselves

27:38.120 --> 27:40.120
and just as you might expect

27:40.120 --> 27:43.120
because they're made up of like charged particles they repel one another.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.120
Positioning themselves as far apart as possible

27:46.120 --> 27:48.120
around the central atom.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.120
So when a carbon atom is connected to two other atoms

27:54.120 --> 27:59.120
either by two double bonds or by a single bond and a triple bond

27:59.120 --> 28:03.120
the connected atoms are 180 degrees apart from one another

28:03.120 --> 28:06.120
forming a linear geometry among those three atoms.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.120
When a carbon atom is connected to three other atoms

28:11.120 --> 28:15.120
two atoms by a single bond and one other atom by a double bond

28:15.120 --> 28:20.120
the atoms form a planar geometry in the shape of an equilateral triangle

28:20.120 --> 28:24.120
with bond angles of 120 degrees among all of the atoms.

28:24.120 --> 28:28.120
We call this type of geometry trigonal planar.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.120
But the real magic happens when we use all four bonds

28:33.120 --> 28:36.120
to connect to four distinct bonding partners.

28:37.120 --> 28:42.120
In this case a planar geometry would require 90 degree bond angles

28:42.120 --> 28:45.120
but giving these bonds access to the third dimension

28:45.120 --> 28:48.120
allows them to separate even more from one another

28:48.120 --> 28:51.120
forming bond angles of 109.5 degrees.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.120
And we call this arrangement tetrahedral

28:55.120 --> 29:00.120
because tracing lines among all bonded atoms produces the shape of a tetrahedron.

29:01.120 --> 29:06.120
So by bonding carbon atoms together using some or all of these geometries

29:06.120 --> 29:10.120
linear trigonal planar and particularly tetrahedral

29:10.120 --> 29:15.120
we can form almost any three-dimensional arrangement imaginable.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.120
But notice that in all of the examples of carbon scaffolds shown here

29:19.120 --> 29:23.120
there are remaining bonds terminated by hydrogen atoms

29:23.120 --> 29:26.120
which could easily be replaced by other sets of atoms.

29:27.120 --> 29:31.120
This means that each carbon scaffold can act as a backbone

29:31.120 --> 29:36.120
supporting hundreds, thousands or even millions of distinct atom combinations.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.120
By designing molecules in this way

29:39.120 --> 29:44.120
chemists are able to create compounds with very specific and rationally designed shapes

29:44.120 --> 29:47.120
physical properties and reactivities.

29:48.120 --> 29:53.120
As you can probably imagine this quickly leads to a virtually limitless library of possible compounds

29:53.120 --> 29:59.120
all of which rely on the stability and geometry of their carbon scaffold to function.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.120
As we progress through the course

30:03.120 --> 30:07.120
we will take a detailed look at how building upon these scaffolds

30:07.120 --> 30:10.120
leads to libraries of compounds with extremely diverse properties.

30:10.120 --> 30:14.120
And I'd like to close our conversation today with a few examples.

30:15.120 --> 30:18.120
Consider compounds with only six carbons in their scaffold.

30:18.120 --> 30:22.120
Using these six atoms we can construct a variety of scaffolds

30:22.120 --> 30:30.120
such as straight chains, branched scaffolds, cyclic scaffolds, fused bicyclics and even more.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.120
Now let's see what we can do with just six carbon atoms in a scaffold

30:34.120 --> 30:36.120
and a little bit of imagination.

30:39.120 --> 30:43.120
Let's bring up those six carbon atoms and place them in a linear chain.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.120
If I saturate this structure with hydrogens

30:47.120 --> 30:51.120
meaning I put hydrogens at all the remaining bonding locations on the carbons

30:51.120 --> 30:54.120
I create a molecule known as hexane.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.120
Hexane is a component of motor fuels.

30:57.120 --> 31:02.120
But if I make just a few alterations inserting some oxygen atoms

31:02.120 --> 31:05.120
I create a molecule known as glucose

31:05.120 --> 31:09.120
a simple sugar found in foods and used by your body to store energy.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.120
If we make a few more changes and throw in a nitrogen atom here

31:13.120 --> 31:19.120
we create lysine, an essential amino acid which your body uses to make enzymes and tissues.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.120
But let's go back to our carbons and rearrange them.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.120
Let's create a branched chain now.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.120
This branched chain when saturated with hydrogens

31:29.120 --> 31:33.120
is isohexane, yet another component that's blended into motor fuels.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.120
If I add a little bit to it

31:36.120 --> 31:40.120
I can create leucine, yet another amino acid essential to life.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.120
But I can make another change

31:43.120 --> 31:49.120
and create isohexyl acetate, a flavor and fragrance additive that smells a bit like fruit.

31:51.120 --> 31:54.120
Let's continue. Let's take those carbons and put them into a ring.

31:55.120 --> 32:00.120
When I saturate my six-membered ring I create cyclohexane, yet another motor fuel.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.120
But that's not all cyclohexane can do.

32:03.120 --> 32:08.120
If I make a little change I can create the heart medication, cyclohexyl nitrite.

32:09.120 --> 32:12.120
Or I can make the artificial sweetener, cyclomate.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.120
One last example. Let's take those atoms again and put them into a ring.

32:17.120 --> 32:22.120
But this time let's put them into a ring where they have a different bonding structure to one another.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.120
This is called a benzene ring.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.120
And when it's saturated with hydrogens we call that molecule benzene,

32:27.120 --> 32:31.120
an industrial solvent and also one that we use in the laboratory quite frequently.

32:31.120 --> 32:36.120
But just a small change to that structure gives me aspirin, popular analgesic.

32:37.120 --> 32:42.120
Yet another change gives me TNT, a high explosive.

32:43.120 --> 32:47.120
Impressive versatility and variability, isn't it? All done with just six atoms.

32:49.120 --> 32:54.120
So all of these possibilities and countless more are accessible with just six carbon atoms.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.120
Not only can the number of carbon atoms in scaffolds be changed,

32:58.120 --> 33:02.120
but there is a long library of reactive groups made from other elements

33:02.120 --> 33:05.120
that can be bonded to these carbon scaffolds that we've discussed today.

33:06.120 --> 33:13.120
In tandem, these two factors combine to form a practically inexhaustible library of possibilities.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.120
So let's review what we've discussed today.

33:18.120 --> 33:22.120
We've explored what organic chemistry is, how it got started,

33:22.120 --> 33:25.120
and how our understanding of it has changed over the years.

33:26.120 --> 33:30.120
We've also scratched the surface of explaining how carbon's abundance,

33:30.120 --> 33:34.120
bonding complexity and bonding strength all combine to make it such a unique

33:34.120 --> 33:38.120
and versatile element for building complex small molecules.

33:39.120 --> 33:43.120
Finally, we've looked at how the decoration of these scaffolds with groups of other atoms

33:43.120 --> 33:46.120
can lead to a diverse library of useful compounds.

33:48.120 --> 33:53.120
Next time, we'll take a much more detailed look at atomic structure and chemical bonding,

33:53.120 --> 33:58.120
examining exactly why some of the trends predicted by the periodic table exist.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.120
And in doing so, we will continue to deepen our understanding of the complex geometries

34:03.120 --> 34:08.120
of the carbon frameworks on which every living thing relies.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.120
I look forward to seeing you then.
