1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,360
In the latter part of the 1830s, a desperate businessman by the name of Charles Goodyear

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,720
was near the end of his rope.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,840
Having already failed in the hardware business in Philadelphia, he had turned his attention

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,000
to a newly available material from Brazil called rubber.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,960
Like many other entrepreneurs at his time, Goodyear believed that this pliable, moldable

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,240
substance had enormous potential to be put to work in a number of potentially profitable

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
applications.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,200
But there were some problems.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,880
Despite its usefulness in waterproofing applications, rubber itself was very soft, pliable, and

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,760
tended to deform plastically, meaning that once pulled or otherwise misshapen, it retained

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,000
the new shape.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,000
Now Goodyear had worked with natural rubber for about a half a decade, seeking out ways

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,880
to strengthen it so that it could be used to produce objects which could be molded into

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,240
a desired shape, but would then retain that shape across a great range of conditions.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,320
As seems to usually be the case with great discoveries, Goodyear's breakthrough was reached

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,520
quite by accident.

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,680
There are several variations of the story, but the most inspirational is this.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,560
Being nearly bankrupt, Goodyear had attempted to remove paint from one of his rubber samples

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,520
for reuse.

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,200
To do this, he tried using nitric acid.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,880
He noticed that after removing the paint with nitric acid, the properties of his rubber

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,080
sample had changed.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,160
He realized then that treatment with various other materials might alter the structure

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:58,400
of rubber, or even become incorporated into it, changing its properties for the better.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,720
Now Goodyear wasn't much of a chemist, so he had to rely on blind trial and error to

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,040
concoct his modified rubber materials.

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:14,240
Being readily available and inexpensive, one of the modifiers he tried was elemental sulfur.

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,120
Now as the story goes, Goodyear walked into the general store in the town of Woburn, Massachusetts,

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,760
where he was then living.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,800
It was then that he accidentally dropped a sample of his latest sulfur-treated rubber

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,320
concoction onto a pot-bellied stove.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,040
In the ensuing charred mess, he noticed that some of that material's properties had changed.

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Goodyear later worked out a more controlled process for producing the material he had

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,400
first observed in the aftermath of his accident.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,560
And he finally settled on a method for production by steam-heating a mixture of natural rubber

36
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
with sulfur.

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,840
His new material was first used by his brother-in-law to induce the then sought-after ruffles in

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,400
the fabrics of men's shirts.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,880
Now it turns out that Goodyear wasn't only limited in his chemistry skills.

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,320
He didn't fare too well in the world of business either.

41
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,960
Goodyear managed to obtain an American patent for his new material, but he failed to seize

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
the same opportunity in the British market.

43
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,480
It was an English entrepreneur and a competitor of Goodyear's by the name of Thomas Hancock,

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,120
who reverse engineered his invention from one of Goodyear's own samples and obtained

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
the British patent.

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,400
Shortly thereafter, one of Hancock's associates coined the term vulcanized rubber, naming

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,680
the material for the Roman god of fire.

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,120
Perhaps some would say that Hermes, Roman god of thieves, would have been a better namesake.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,600
So vulcanized rubber became not just a world-changing material from which many durable rubber products

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,600
could be made, but also one of the first artificially modified polymers in human history.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,440
Polymers are defined as a very large set of molecules consisting of repeating units

52
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,960
known as monomers.

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,640
We've already looked at some biologically relevant polymers, including DNA, RNA, proteins

54
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,720
and starches.

55
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,080
But Goodyear's invention is noteworthy because it may have represented the first semi-synthetic

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,960
polymer created by man.

57
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,000
But it wasn't long after that that German apothecary by the name of Edward Simon managed

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to create a substance with similar properties, not by modifying an existing natural polymer,

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,520
but from individual molecules of styrene, he treated to induce polymerization.

60
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
Now, by no fault of his own, Simon lacked the insight to fully understand what he had

61
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,480
just done.

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,560
He only knew that heating styrene led to a material with properties very similar to

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
rubber.

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,560
This observation went largely unnoticed.

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,640
To those who did notice, the simplest explanation was that he had created a conglomerate of

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,640
small molecules held together in aggregates by intermolecular forces.

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,600
After all, the creation of a covalent molecule with thousands upon thousands of atoms was

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,280
not a reasonable explanation.

69
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,120
That could never happen, right?

70
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,160
It was nearly a century later that Simon's countryman, Hermann Staudinger, finally elucidated

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,760
the structure of Simon's creation.

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,960
It took some outside-of-the-box thinking to finally understand Simon's material.

73
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,200
Staudinger finally postulated publicly that the heated styrene molecules had reacted with

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,320
themselves to create immense molecules of great size.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Staudinger's initial efforts to reach this idea, or to research this idea, were met with

76
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,720
remarkable skepticism.

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,040
He found it difficult to secure the support of his colleagues, who all believed rubbers

78
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,640
were aggregates of small molecules stuck together by some messy non-covalent force.

79
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,560
Even the eminent Hermann M. L. Fisher went on record against Staudinger's theories.

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
But Staudinger stood fast, and it's a good thing that he did.

81
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,800
His theory proved true.

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,280
And having fought the good fight to prove it, he received his Nobel Prize in 1953.

83
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,240
Ultimately, it was realized that styrene molecules had been joined together through their vinyl

84
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,560
groups, creating carbon chains with hundreds or even thousands of atoms.

85
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,320
With the benefit of 100 years of additional insight, and his willingness to continue supporting

86
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,880
his theory in the face of substantial opposition, Staudinger's theory of polymers, which he

87
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,840
referred to as macromolecules, ultimately had proven true.

88
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Since the days of Staudinger's work, a tremendous amount of attention has been poured into understanding,

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
designing, and creating useful polymers.

90
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,680
From the tires on your car, to the man-made fibers in some clothing, to medical equipment,

91
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,880
body armor, food packaging, and even more, the importance of synthetic polymers to our

92
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,920
modern lifestyles simply cannot be overstated.

93
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,280
So in this lecture, we're going to take a short survey of polymer chemistry, how polymers

94
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,080
are designed, how they're made, and a few ways in which they've changed the world.

95
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,880
Synthetic polymers are classified in more than one way, but a typical method is to

96
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,480
distinguish them based upon how they're prepared.

97
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,960
From this perspective, most polymers fall into one of two general classes.

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,240
Addition polymers, also called chain growth polymers, or condensation polymers, sometimes

99
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,920
called step growth polymers.

100
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,560
So let's take a look at each of those classes one at a time.

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,600
The first class of polymers based upon their synthesis are addition polymers, also called

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,440
chain growth.

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,120
Now any polymer will be constructed from a set of small molecules known as monomers.

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,520
Now I've represented my monomers here as simply these red objects that are going to do the

105
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,040
chemistry that we would expect of a molecule, which is very small, but is a monomer.

106
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,040
To this, we're going to add another type of molecule called an initiator.

107
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,840
That's because in the case of addition polymers, my individual monomers are not reactive in

108
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,160
and of themselves.

109
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,240
But in the presence of an initiator, my monomer can react.

110
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,480
And only when attached to the chain will that new monomer become reactive again, sequestering

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,240
more and more of the monomer to the chain.

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,620
In short, addition polymers grow from one end to the other in a fashion much like this.

113
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,300
So their sizes are very predictable and very easy to manipulate.

114
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,220
A classic example of an addition polymer are those formed from alkene subunits, trading

115
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,660
less stable pi bonds for the new sigma bonds which link them together.

116
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,340
The first entirely synthetic polymer, polystyrene, falls into this class of compounds.

117
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:13,380
The process of creating addition polymers consists of three phases, the initiation, the propagation,

118
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,380
and the termination.

119
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:21,340
In the case of polystyrene, polymerization reaction can be initiated when a sample of

120
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:28,900
styrene is heated in the presence of just a small amount of benzoil peroxide.

121
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,860
Now the heat causes the benzoil peroxide to dissociate into two phenyl radicals, a process

122
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,720
encouraged by the loss of carbon dioxide gas.

123
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,380
In the second step, propagation.

124
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,460
As each monomer encounters the reactive radical at the end of a chain, a new sigma bond is

125
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,380
formed homogenically, meaning one electron from each side.

126
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,140
This regenerates the radical at the end of the lengthening chain and perpetuates the

127
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,140
reaction.

128
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:05,020
In the case of polystyrene, this process repeats itself several thousand times before the third

129
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,900
phase, termination takes place.

130
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,400
In termination, either two growing radicals react with one another or something of that

131
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,200
like forming one last sigma bond which will ultimately consume the radicals without generating

132
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,160
a new one.

133
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,280
Addition polymers are very attractive targets for commercial materials because their properties

134
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,520
can be turned or tuned by controlling the overall size of the macromolecules produced

135
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,840
in the chain growth reaction.

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,540
For example, the size of the polystyrene polymer molecules can be controlled simply

137
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,980
by altering the relative amount of benzoil peroxide initiator which is added.

138
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,460
Relatively fewer benzoil peroxide molecules means fewer growing chains.

139
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,740
And because growth can only take place at the end of an initiated chain, one expects

140
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,940
to obtain longer polymers in this kind of scenario.

141
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,760
Additionally, fewer growing chains means less likelihood that two growing chains will encounter

142
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,160
one another in a termination step.

143
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,960
Some other examples of addition polymers include polyethylene used in plastic bottles formed

144
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,040
by the addition of ethene monomers to one another.

145
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,520
Polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, most well known as a substitute for metal plumbing pipes,

146
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,960
is assembled in a similar reaction using vinyl chloride monomers.

147
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:36,900
Even the once popular cookware coating Teflon is formed by polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene.

148
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,580
Now let's take a look at the second class of polymers, condensation polymers, also

149
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,620
sometimes called step growth polymers.

150
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:52,260
This has become a very popular class of polymers because they're relatively easy to make.

151
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,980
Condensation polymers form, again, through conjoining, more than one, obviously, monomers,

152
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,000
we want long chains, so we need lots and lots of monomers.

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,080
But in the case of condensation polymers, each monomer itself is reactive without any

154
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,520
initiator necessary.

155
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,400
So in the case of condensation polymers, rather than having an initiator dictate when and

156
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:21,320
where monomers can join together, my monomers can really join together anywhere at any time.

157
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,860
So in this case, I have a growing set of ever larger and larger polymers forming as my

158
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,160
monomers become dimers, which can condense with other monomers or dimers, and so on and

159
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
so on.

160
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,980
But you'll notice that in this process, I get a wide variety of lengths in my polymers

161
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,480
as they grow.

162
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,880
So although condensation polymers are very easy to make, they are very difficult to control

163
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,800
from a polymer length standpoint.

164
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Now generally, condensation polymers differ from addition polymers in that their growth

165
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,580
is not driven by trading of pi bonds for sigma bonds, but by the formation of small molecule

166
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,740
byproducts like water or hydrochloric acid.

167
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:10,260
A perfect example of this is the formation of nylon-6, in which molecules of 6-aminohexanoic

168
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,980
acid are joined together in a reaction which produces not only an amide union between monomers,

169
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,420
but also a molecule of water as a byproduct.

170
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,400
So far in this lecture, I've shown examples of polymerization reactions in which only

171
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,960
one type of monomer is used, leading to very simple, repeating structures of that monomer.

172
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:40,440
Make no mistake, polymers like polystyrene, PVC, and nylon-6 are extremely valuable and

173
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
useful materials.

174
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,040
But we can significantly increase the complexity and therefore the tuneability of polymers

175
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,280
if we use more than one monomer in the process.

176
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,900
When we use more than one monomer to create a polymer, we call the class of compounds

177
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,180
created copolymers.

178
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,620
So the examples I'm going to show here are using only two different monomers, but we

179
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,420
could just as easily have three or four or any number of different monomers.

180
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,980
Now copolymers can be constructed using either one of our two major mechanisms for building

181
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,260
a polymer, so they're not necessarily chain growth or step growth polymers.

182
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,920
But what is true is that when I have a collection of monomers like this one where I have indicated

183
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,360
one monomer in red and one monomer in blue, they can combine in several different geometric

184
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,080
relationships, each of which can lead to a polymer with different properties.

185
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,360
Possibly the simplest example of this is what we would call an alternating copolymer, in

186
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,160
which each monomer is spaced with two of the other monomers around it, so red, blue, red,

187
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,240
blue, red, blue, all the way across.

188
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,340
The second arrangement would be what we would call a random copolymer, in which the order

189
00:14:53,340 --> 00:15:00,700
of each monomer within the overall chain is completely statistically random.

190
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,980
A third potential arrangement is what we call a block copolymer.

191
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,740
In a block copolymer, long stretches of a certain type of monomer exist, which are then

192
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:19,240
punctuated by long stretches of the other monomer or monomers within the copolymer.

193
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,800
And as one last example of a type of structure that copolymers can form, we have something

194
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,160
called a graft copolymer, in which one of the monomers serves to form the backbone while

195
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,120
the other decorates that backbone by branching away from it.

196
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,660
So an alternating polymer that we're familiar with is produced when vinyl chloride and

197
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,860
vinylidine chloride react in a radical chain growth polymerization.

198
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:54,040
In this reaction, monomers add in an alternating order, with vinyl chloride monomers reacting

199
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,880
at initiated vinylidine termini and vinylidine chloride monomers reacting at initiated vinyl

200
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,420
chloride termini.

201
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,340
The result is an alternating polymer called saran.

202
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,620
This is the polymer used to make the very popular food wrap which bears its name.

203
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,500
Isn't that remarkable?

204
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,620
Just one additional chlorine atom on every other monomer unit, and we go from PVC, which

205
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:26,220
is used in plumbing, to saran wrap, which is very flexible and is used as a food wrap.

206
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,140
But alternating polymers can just as easily be produced using condensation polymerizations.

207
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:40,660
One example of this is the polymer nylon 6-6, not to be confused with nylon 6.

208
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:50,700
Nylon 6-6 is prepared using equal parts of adipic acid and 1-6 hexane diamine.

209
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,180
By producing nylon in this way, the orientation of alternating amide bonds is reversed from

210
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,780
those in nylon 6.

211
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,060
In fact, it would be more accurate to say that the amide bonds in nylon 6 are reversed

212
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:10,340
since nylon 6-6 was actually the first of these to be prepared and patented by DuPont

213
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,100
in 1935.

214
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,740
The development of the homopolymer nylon 6 by BASF was an attempt to produce a material

215
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,900
with similar properties, which didn't infringe on DuPont's intellectual property.

216
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,460
In fact, both of these polymers were a huge success and are still used today as the backbone

217
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:38,020
for some of the most modern materials produced by both companies.

218
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,100
Random copolymers are produced by mixing monomers, but unlike alternating copolymers, growing

219
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,580
random copolymers can incorporate any of the monomers in any order, leading to a statistically

220
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,740
random distribution of monomers in the molecule.

221
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,300
An example of a random copolymer is polybutyrate, which is a polyester compound, built from

222
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,180
two distinct subunits.

223
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,020
The distinction here is that these subunits are randomly oriented throughout each polymer

224
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,620
strand.

225
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,860
But what's really special about polybutyrate isn't how it's made, but the fact that its

226
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,420
ester bonds make it fully biodegradable.

227
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,860
Plastic bags and wraps produced from this flexible, random copolymer are completely deconstructed

228
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,820
by moisture and microbes in the ground, making it a popular choice for disposable items of

229
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,260
this kind.

230
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,820
One of the more exciting advances in more recent decades has been the development of

231
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,700
block copolymers, which aim to exploit the best properties of more than one polymer by

232
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,940
linking together large regions of each, which we call domains.

233
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:53,180
For example, the block copolymer SBS is used in many modern applications, including tires

234
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,820
and running shoe soles.

235
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,460
SBS stands for polystyrene butadiene styrene.

236
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,060
So in a single molecule of this block copolymer, a domain of polybutadiene is sandwiched in

237
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,780
between two polystyrene domains.

238
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:20,580
The polystyrene blocks give this polymer great toughness, while the polybutadiene domain

239
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,180
becomes softer under high temperature conditions, allowing the material to be more easily moldable

240
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,660
like softer rubbers.

241
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,900
The result is a material which behaves more like a plastic at high temperature, but more

242
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,820
like vulcanized rubber when cooler, a perfect recipe for manufacturing tires.

243
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,420
I think Mr. Goodyear would be proud.

244
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,540
Our fourth class, graft copolymers, are characterized by a uniform backbone polymer which is decorated

245
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,420
by strands of a different polymer attached covalently along its length.

246
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,260
In many cases, graft copolymers can be designed to have certain properties of both polymers

247
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,420
which make it up.

248
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:09,660
For example, long polysaccharides like cellulose onto which other polymers are grafted.

249
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,700
This has the effect of producing a very large molecule with the properties of those smaller

250
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:22,140
grafted polymers, but retaining the biodegradability of the cellulose backbone.

251
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,220
And while we're back on the subject of Mr. Goodyear, let's take a look back at his creation,

252
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,780
knowing what we do now about polymers.

253
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,460
Natural rubber is a somewhat complex mixture created by trees to defend themselves from

254
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,540
wood-eating insects.

255
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,820
It has quite a few minor components, but the big player in its chemical properties is this.

256
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:49,020
A polyisoprene macromolecule made on long, unsaturated hydrocarbons, making it very thick

257
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,220
and insoluble in water.

258
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,820
Now the problem in Goodyear's days is that these polyisoprene macromolecules are only

259
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,580
held together by intermolecular dispersion forces stemming from their electron clouds.

260
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,300
So let's look at this.

261
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,060
These forces are enough to make the molecule viscous, but they can be overcome.

262
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:18,540
So when I pull on my natural rubber molecules, they can slide back and forth on one another.

263
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,620
Now what Goodyear had accomplished by the addition of sulfur was to cross-link the polymer molecules

264
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,180
with covalent bonds to sulfur.

265
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,500
So let me pull that polymer back together here.

266
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,980
So some of these pi bonds within the rubber were replaced by a sulfur bridge.

267
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,820
So we'll put in a few sulfur bridges, and now let's pull on that polymer again and see

268
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,340
if it deforms.

269
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,940
I can deform the polymer, but as soon as I release it, it snaps back into place.

270
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,700
This is because of the bridging solfers.

271
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,260
So the presence of these cross-links is what gives vulcanized rubber its toughness and

272
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,140
ability to retain its shape, exactly what you would hope for in a product like an automobile

273
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,700
tire.

274
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,060
It also, unfortunately, makes the material very difficult to deconstruct, meaning that

275
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,700
vulcanized rubbers are very difficult to recycle.

276
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,260
Now this is the reason that tire yards exist.

277
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,980
For many decades, non-biodegradable, non-recyclable vulcanized rubber tires were simply piled

278
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,260
up in huge tire yards with no obvious fate.

279
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,640
Today we do our best to reuse vulcanized rubber by cutting or chipping it into smaller pieces

280
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,980
for use in paving projects and other applications.

281
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,580
But melting and reforming vulcanized rubber is simply not possible.

282
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:50,120
So truly recycling a tire by making it into another tire is not a viable strategy.

283
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,480
Yet another common polymer motif is polycarbonates.

284
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,360
These polymers are found in materials as tough and rigid as bulletproof glass, and as soft

285
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,820
and supple as commercial water bottles.

286
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,420
Both of these products are made from the condensation of carbonic acid with bisphenol A to form

287
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,700
an alternating copolymer.

288
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,060
Recently, concern has arisen over the possibility that these polymers can hydrolyze back into

289
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,060
their starting materials over time, leaching bisphenol A into the water or beverage that

290
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,420
they contain.

291
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,180
The reason for so much concern is mounting evidence that bisphenol A imitates estradiol

292
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,800
in the body, potentially causing developmental or reproductive problems in those who are

293
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,240
exposed to it.

294
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,120
Some studies suggest that BPA is less than one-tenthousandth as powerful of a hormone

295
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,320
as estradiol is, suggesting that this whole controversy may be overblown.

296
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,480
Still, we simply don't know what the long-term effects of exposure to low levels of BPA might

297
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,040
do.

298
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,940
No one is sure exactly what the risks are, but one thing is undeniable.

299
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,260
Many people are sufficiently wary of BPA that they are willing to purchase products

300
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:13,700
labeled BPA-free without giving much thought to what's actually in the product.

301
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,580
The polymers industry has responded to these concerns by offering BPA-free plastics with

302
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,820
a great deal of fanfare.

303
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,700
Sounds great, doesn't it?

304
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,720
So what they don't tell you is that most of these products are still polycarbonates,

305
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:35,760
which are simply made using molecules like bisphenol S or bisphenol F in place of bisphenol

306
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,160
A in an analogous reaction.

307
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,560
Now if there is concern over a molecule like bisphenol A imitating estradiol, something

308
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,560
tells me it's only a matter of time until bisphenol S, F, and others come under similar

309
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:57,340
scrutiny, putting us right back where we were before.

310
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,980
One last hot button plastics issue that you may have heard of is the use of compounds

311
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,100
called phthalates.

312
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Phthalic acid is a small organic diacid which looks like this.

313
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,900
It's easily esterified with a number of aliphatic alcohols to produce small molecules called

314
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,780
phthalates.

315
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:23,000
Phthalates like this dibutal phthalate are sometimes added to polyvinyl chloride to soften

316
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,800
the plastic enough to make it useful over a wider range of applications.

317
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:35,080
Now plasticizers work by disrupting the packing of polymer chains, in this case in the PVC,

318
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,000
thereby softening it.

319
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,160
That new car smell that so much of us enjoy is caused by these plasticizers escaping the

320
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,780
newly prepared plastics into the air.

321
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,280
Now it's worth mentioning that polyethylene tetrothalate, commonly called P-E-T-E, is

322
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,700
used in food packaging and does not contain isolated phthalate molecules at all.

323
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,580
The phthalate portion of P-E-T-E's name refers to the monomer which is condensed in the prepared

324
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,220
polymer.

325
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,220
So in this case the phthalate is locked securely in the matrix of this non-biodegradable plastic

326
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,240
where it can't easily be released.

327
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,680
So P-E-T-E doesn't release phthalates into the environment even though phthalate is in

328
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,760
its name and PVC very often does release phthalates even though the term phthalate is nowhere to

329
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,360
be found in its name.

330
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,240
So in this lecture we grazed the surface of nearly 200 years of synthetic polymer chemistry.

331
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,260
Starting with the accidental vulcanization of rubber by Charles Goodyear during a clumsy

332
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,100
moment in 1830s Massachusetts.

333
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,740
We talked about the two major classes of polymerization reactions, addition and condensation, also

334
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:58,940
called chain growth polymerization and step growth polymerization respectively.

335
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:04,380
We saw how chain growth usually involves the reaction of alkene subunits with an activated

336
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,120
growing polymer chain until termination takes place.

337
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,640
Specifically we took a look at radical polymerization which is initiated by the dissociation of

338
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,200
a small bit of benzoyl peroxide to initiate chain growth.

339
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,160
By contrast condensation polymers tend to proceed with the formation of small molecules

340
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,960
as monomers, dimers, trimmers, tetramers and more and condense with one another forming

341
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,980
ever larger chains until the reagents are exhausted.

342
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,060
We then took a different view on polymers, classifying them not based upon the reaction

343
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:48,180
which makes them, but the morphology of the polymer chains themselves, including homopolymers

344
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,300
and the many layers of complexity added when copolymers come into play.

345
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:59,060
We saw the alternating copolymer saran and the random copolymer polybutyrate, both of

346
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:05,080
which blend monomers closely together, usually forming a polymer with totally new properties.

347
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Then we considered how graft copolymers and block copolymers can preserve certain properties

348
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,480
of each homopolymer from which they are derived, helping chemists to design polymers perfectly

349
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
suited to an intended application.

350
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,960
Finally, we looked at a few recent concerns regarding popular polymers, including the

351
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,860
estrogen emulating bisphenol compounds used in polycarbonates and the use of plasticizers

352
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,260
like phthalates.

353
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,780
Of course what we saw in this lecture is just a small slice of polymer chemistry, a field

354
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,660
made incredibly diverse by not only the vast library of monomers and linking motifs, but

355
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,380
by the sheer titanic size of the molecules involved.

356
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,380
So macromolecules bring us to a fitting end to our survey of organic compounds in their

357
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,120
reactions.

358
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,360
In our next few lessons, we're going to focus not on how new compounds are made and put to

359
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,960
use, but on how they are identified.

360
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,000
Organic chemists use a very special set of techniques to be their eyes as they navigate

361
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,400
the long and sometimes complex road to an effective synthesis, and no organic chemistry

362
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,780
course is complete without it.

363
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,220
We'll begin to develop an understanding of the techniques that have been used to verify

364
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,500
so much of the information that I've already given you.

365
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,300
From identifying specific functional groups, to discerning regioisomers and enantiomers

366
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:39,740
of small molecules, to determining full protein structures, spectroscopy is the tool that lets

367
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,660
us observe the fruits of our labor in the lab.

368
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,660
It's an exciting science in its own right, and it will be the topic of our next few lectures.

369
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,160
And I'll see you for those soon.
