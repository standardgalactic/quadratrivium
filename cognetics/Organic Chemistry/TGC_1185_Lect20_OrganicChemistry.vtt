00:00.000 --> 00:17.160
You may recall from our discussion on alkanes that the discovery of petroleum took place

00:17.160 --> 00:23.760
around 1860, drastically altering the methods used to recover and refine fuel oils.

00:23.760 --> 00:28.160
To begin today's discussion, we'll have to move farther back in time, several decades

00:28.160 --> 00:32.600
before Drake's discovery of petroleum, to a time when fuel oils were still sourced

00:32.600 --> 00:36.320
from whale and fish oil.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.480
Now Michael Faraday was an English researcher, and he's most well known for his work in

00:40.480 --> 00:42.920
the field of electromagnetism.

00:42.920 --> 00:47.680
But in 1820, he developed a keen interest in the chemistry of fuels.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.600
So interested was Michael Faraday, that he all but abandoned his very successful line

00:51.600 --> 00:56.200
of research in electromagnetism, so that he could begin deconstructing the composition

00:56.200 --> 01:02.160
of what was then commonly known as illuminating gas, a processed form of fish or whale oil

01:02.160 --> 01:06.440
commonly used in the lamps of the day.

01:06.440 --> 01:11.160
A Faraday worked for nearly five years refining his techniques for isolation of certain components

01:11.160 --> 01:13.440
from that material.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.240
Most notable among them was a liquid, which he found he could produce by pressurizing

01:17.240 --> 01:23.160
the gas to 30 atmospheres and isolating the condensate which formed.

01:23.160 --> 01:28.000
Even in Faraday's time, it was known that hydrocarbons with suboptimal amounts of hydrogen

01:28.000 --> 01:33.960
were susceptible to reactions with such reagents as chlorine gas or molecular bromine.

01:33.960 --> 01:39.640
So Faraday dutifully determined the hydrogen to carbon ratio in his isole, finding that

01:39.640 --> 01:43.560
it was extremely low.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.160
Now in his day, scientists thought that carbon had an atomic mass only half that of what

01:48.160 --> 01:50.000
it actually is.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.600
So Faraday erroneously named his new discovery bicarboret of hydrogen.

01:55.600 --> 02:02.240
In fact, carbohydrate of hydrogen or monocarboret of hydrogen would have been more appropriate.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.960
But considering the circumstances, I think we can forgive this little miscalculation.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.480
And this error notwithstanding, when comparing Faraday's bicarboret of hydrogen formula to

02:11.480 --> 02:17.120
other hydrocarbons of the day, it was very clear that his new compound had a very low

02:17.120 --> 02:23.320
hydrogen to carbon ratio.

02:23.320 --> 02:30.720
So Faraday had already isolated his new compound bicarboret of hydrogen from his lamp oil.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.120
But he wanted to go about doing some more analysis.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.560
He had combusted this material already, measuring how much carbon dioxide and water formed in

02:37.560 --> 02:41.560
the process, which gave him a rough idea of the formulas.

02:41.560 --> 02:46.120
He was off by a factor of two because of the putative mass of carbon in that day, but I've

02:46.120 --> 02:50.440
corrected that in my formulas here for my demonstration.

02:50.440 --> 02:56.040
So what I have here, as soon as I protect myself properly from it, are some vials containing

02:56.040 --> 02:57.240
molecular bromine.

02:57.240 --> 03:04.200
These colorful solutions here are Br2 contained in an inert solvent, methylene chloride.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.400
I also have samples of some of the hydrocarbons that have been isolated in Faraday's time.

03:09.400 --> 03:19.520
And those include C6H14, C6H12, C6H10, C6H8, and C6H6.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.840
Again I've corrected these formulas for the actual mass of carbon.

03:22.840 --> 03:27.520
Now I'm going to cover my hands with something a little bit to make sure that they're safe

03:27.520 --> 03:29.520
as well.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.240
And I'm going to recreate the experiment that Faraday would have done in his day, which

03:33.240 --> 03:37.560
generated such a buzz about his new bicarboret of hydrogen.

03:37.560 --> 03:44.560
What I'm going to do here first is I'm going to uncap my bromine solutions, and I'm going

03:44.560 --> 03:49.880
to add them to the various hydrocarbons that I have placed here as well.

03:49.880 --> 03:54.560
And when I do that, if a reaction takes place between the bromine and the hydrocarbon, naturally

03:54.560 --> 03:59.440
we would expect that the bromine would be something other than bromine, and the color

03:59.440 --> 04:01.240
will change.

04:01.240 --> 04:10.720
So let's start with the first hydrocarbon, C6H14.

04:10.720 --> 04:17.000
So I add my bromine, make sure that we're well agitated, you may notice that no reaction

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
is taking place.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.560
Now this was well known to Faraday.

04:19.560 --> 04:25.200
Now he also knew that if he took this other compound here, C6H12, which had a slightly

04:25.200 --> 04:32.320
lower hydrogen to carbon ratio, and added, again, molecular bromine, that a reaction

04:32.320 --> 04:33.800
took place.

04:33.800 --> 04:38.000
Clearly, no pun intended, a reaction has happened here.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.520
Move my bromine vial to the back.

04:40.520 --> 04:45.040
Now he could continue this experiment, going along all the various isolates from all the

04:45.040 --> 04:50.680
various sources available to him, including C6H10.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.640
We have our reaction gone clear.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.640
One more.

04:56.640 --> 05:06.520
Let's uncap our C6H8, again an unsaturated hydrocarbon, and a reaction takes place.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.200
Now Faraday knew all of this was happening.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.360
All these experiments had been done previously.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.840
So when he isolated a new compound and determined that its formula had even less hydrogen, he

05:15.840 --> 05:21.120
clearly predicted, and everyone thought he'd be right, that this new bicarburet of hydrogen

05:21.120 --> 05:23.840
would also react with molecular bromine.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.840
So just as any good scientist would, he validated that by adding molecular bromine.

05:27.840 --> 05:33.840
Give it a swirl to be sure that we're well mixed.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.720
We have a problem, don't we?

05:35.720 --> 05:37.600
The trend is bucked here.

05:37.600 --> 05:43.800
The C6H6 doesn't react the same way as all of the other hydrocarbons with suboptimal hydrogen

05:43.800 --> 05:46.120
to carbon ratios.

05:46.120 --> 05:52.200
So Faraday found this fascinating, and he needed to figure out what was going on.

05:52.200 --> 05:58.640
Alas, Faraday never completed his characterization of this new compound.

05:58.640 --> 06:03.680
And sadly for us chemists, Faraday's first love of electromagnetism took hold again and

06:03.680 --> 06:06.880
distracted him from his curious hydrocarbon.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.800
So Faraday had to settle for inventing electromagnetic induction, which essentially heralded the arrival

06:11.800 --> 06:14.640
of the age of widely useful electricity.

06:14.640 --> 06:19.040
Not a bad consolation prize, I suppose.

06:19.040 --> 06:23.960
Instead the world would have to wait until the 1860s, when August Kekule, a German-born

06:23.960 --> 06:29.000
scientist working in Belgium, took up the mantle of explaining the low hydrogen content

06:29.000 --> 06:34.040
and unusual stability of this compound, which had since been renamed benzene.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.560
Now this guy's a real looker, isn't he?

06:36.560 --> 06:40.800
This is how I know I would never make it as an Eastern European chemist in the 1800s.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.700
I can't pull off a beard that good.

06:44.700 --> 06:49.640
So it's known for quite some time that a compound of unusual stability and a very low hydrogen

06:49.640 --> 06:53.440
to carbon ratio could be isolated from torch fuel.

06:53.440 --> 06:58.160
Although the compound was clearly a hydrocarbon, its unusual chemical stability and reduced

06:58.160 --> 07:01.240
hydrogen content defied explanation.

07:01.240 --> 07:08.760
At least until Kekule had what he claimed in later years was a genuine revelatory dream.

07:08.760 --> 07:14.060
In an 1890 interview, near the end of his career, Kekule claimed that he had this famous

07:14.060 --> 07:19.600
vision while dozing on the upper deck of a horse-drawn bus in 1850s London.

07:19.600 --> 07:24.400
As he tells it, he dreamt of a snake biting its own tail, and woke to the revelation

07:24.400 --> 07:28.720
that benzene's formula and properties could be explained if the molecule were in fact

07:28.720 --> 07:29.720
cyclic.

07:29.720 --> 07:35.520
Now there are many who wonder to this day why Kekule would wait nearly four decades

07:35.520 --> 07:37.960
to tell such a fantastic tale.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.680
In fact, most doubt the story's validity, but the story is so colorful and inspirational

07:42.680 --> 07:47.200
that it lives on in text to this day.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.680
So whether it came by divine revelation or educated guess, we may never know.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.880
But we do know today Kekule was right.

07:55.880 --> 08:02.240
What Kekule had proposed was this, that we have a molecule which is cyclic containing

08:02.240 --> 08:05.640
spaced double bonds around that molecule.

08:05.640 --> 08:10.040
And this would explain why it would have different chemistry than all of the other conjugated

08:10.040 --> 08:13.800
alkenes or hydrocarbons as they would call them in his day.

08:13.800 --> 08:18.000
Now if you take a look at this structure, we want you to notice something important.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.760
Kekule's theory about the cyclization of a hexatriene is not beyond reproach, because

08:23.760 --> 08:29.440
benzene itself would have three double bonds if they were isolated, leading to the potential

08:29.440 --> 08:31.720
for two different isomers.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.000
Once scientists were able to figure out how to attach halogens, there are actually two

08:37.000 --> 08:42.200
potential arrangements for the addition of a halogen to a benzene ring, or more accurately

08:42.200 --> 08:44.400
a substitution.

08:44.400 --> 08:49.600
We can put two halogens at the top here where the double bond is located, meaning that our

08:49.600 --> 08:52.800
halogens will be across a double bond.

08:52.800 --> 09:00.560
But if I wanted to, I could place those halogens on opposite sides of a single bond instead.

09:00.560 --> 09:06.440
So if Kekule's theory was right that this was simply a cyclic hexatriene, then there

09:06.440 --> 09:12.880
should be two isolatable isomers of say dichlorocyclohexatriene.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.360
And yet there were not.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.840
An interesting conundrum, isn't it?

09:17.840 --> 09:22.240
Now Kekule attempted to explain this observation as a fast interconversion between the two

09:22.240 --> 09:24.120
putative isomers.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.520
But there was no revelatory dream to save him this time.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.360
He was actually wrong about that.

09:29.360 --> 09:34.960
The story of benzene was completed in 1925 when Sir Robert Robinson published a paper

09:34.960 --> 09:40.160
in the Journal of the Chemical Society postulating that what he called an aromatic sextet of

09:40.160 --> 09:46.720
electrons stabilized the ring by moving unrestricted about the entire circular pi system.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.040
This would create a ring of identical carbons joined by bonds of one and a half order and

09:51.040 --> 09:54.120
would solve the problem of why there aren't two different isomers.

09:54.120 --> 09:58.720
This theory leads us to more accurately draw benzene molecules using a circle or a dashed

09:58.720 --> 10:03.720
interior hexagon to represent the aromatic sextet of electrons.

10:03.720 --> 10:08.440
But it isn't the early 1900s, it's the 21st century and we have much more sophisticated

10:08.440 --> 10:12.320
techniques than Faraday, Kekule and even Robinson had.

10:12.320 --> 10:18.320
So let's bring those to bear on the issue of benzene stability.

10:18.320 --> 10:22.240
Far from just qualitatively observing the stability of benzene, we can use our familiar

10:22.240 --> 10:26.160
technique of calorimetry to determine its heat of hydrogenation.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.560
This is the amount of heat released when the unsaturated compound is completely saturated

10:30.560 --> 10:32.720
with hydrogen.

10:32.720 --> 10:39.480
If we conduct this experiment using cyclohexene, 13-cyclohexadiene also as controls, we can

10:39.480 --> 10:43.600
determine with relative ease that the double bonds in these systems are nearly equivalent

10:43.600 --> 10:46.760
to one another.

10:46.760 --> 10:52.000
But when we add that magical third pair of pi electrons, the heat of hydrogenation is

10:52.000 --> 10:58.300
far less than we would have expected, about 150 kilojoules per mole less.

10:58.300 --> 11:02.600
We call this discrepancy the resonance energy for benzene.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.680
To put the size of that resonance energy into perspective, it's just less than half the

11:06.680 --> 11:12.160
bond enthalpy of a covalent carbon-carbon bond.

11:12.160 --> 11:16.720
So about a century passed between Faraday's first isolation and characterization of benzene

11:16.720 --> 11:21.080
and Robinson's final description of the aromaticity that it possesses.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.100
And this opened the floodgates, and it wasn't long after this that the molecular orbital

11:25.100 --> 11:30.320
energetics of benzene and other cyclic molecules with alternating double bonds, which we collectively

11:30.320 --> 11:36.960
call anulines, were worked out by a German chemist named Erich Huckel.

11:36.960 --> 11:41.320
You see, just as we produced mathematical combinations of piatomic orbitals to model

11:41.320 --> 11:46.600
pi systems in linear conjugated compounds last time, we can use the same technique for

11:46.600 --> 11:50.080
cyclic alkenes with overlapping pi bonds.

11:50.080 --> 11:56.040
Let's start by sticking with the familiar aromatic compound benzene.

11:56.040 --> 12:01.080
Benzene consists of six sp2 carbon atoms joined in a ring.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.480
Now this ring is perfectly flat in the case of benzene, which allows all of its piatomic

12:05.480 --> 12:12.560
orbitals to combine to form one large pi system with density both above and below the ring.

12:12.560 --> 12:16.320
But remember our rules for the formation of molecular orbitals.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.040
Six atomic orbitals in means six molecular orbitals out.

12:21.040 --> 12:25.640
These orbitals all correspond to the linear addition of piatomic orbitals with varying

12:25.640 --> 12:28.720
combinations of phase.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.960
For example, when all six p orbitals are in phase, the lowest possible energy molecular

12:32.960 --> 12:34.800
orbital is obtained.

12:34.800 --> 12:39.320
We call this the pi1.

12:39.320 --> 12:44.680
But it's also possible to form five other permutations of molecular orbitals.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.400
Two possibilities exist with a single nodal plane.

12:48.400 --> 12:54.440
Let's call them the pi2 and the pi3.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.000
Two possibilities with two node planes also exist.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.960
So let's call those the pi4 and pi5.

13:03.960 --> 13:09.680
Finally, there's one possibility in which all six p orbitals are aligned anti-parallel,

13:09.680 --> 13:16.280
creating three nodal planes and a sixth possible molecular orbital, pi6.

13:16.280 --> 13:21.400
So let's take a look now at aromaticity and our famous popular benzene molecule as well

13:21.400 --> 13:24.840
as a different cyclic compound with alternating pi bonds.

13:24.840 --> 13:29.880
And what we're going to do now is analyze the energetics of those pi molecular orbitals

13:29.880 --> 13:35.000
that we just looked at, not only for benzene, but also for a different cyclic compound with

13:35.000 --> 13:37.160
multiple pi bonds.

13:37.160 --> 13:42.640
Let's use 1,3 cyclobutadiene and benzene as our subjects.

13:42.640 --> 13:49.000
So here I've drawn 1,3 cyclobutadiene with two isolated pi bonds.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.520
And yet I've drawn benzene with three delocalized pi bonds, denoted by the dashes moving all

13:54.520 --> 13:56.680
the way around the ring.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.600
And that's not an accident.

13:58.600 --> 14:03.400
So if we think about the energetics of those six molecular orbitals from benzene to start,

14:03.400 --> 14:08.240
there's a little mnemonic trick we can use to determine the relative energies of those

14:08.240 --> 14:09.400
orbitals.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.480
What we do is we draw a circle on an energy axis.

14:13.480 --> 14:18.800
And we inscribe within that circle, point down a polygon with a number of sides equal

14:18.800 --> 14:22.240
to that of the cyclic compound we'd like to analyze.

14:22.240 --> 14:28.280
For example, benzene having six atoms in the ring is going to have six corners in its polygon

14:28.280 --> 14:32.040
with one corner pointed straight down.

14:32.040 --> 14:37.160
When I do this, the corners of the polygon where they touch the circle indicate the relative

14:37.160 --> 14:43.280
energies of the six pi molecular orbitals of this particular compound.

14:43.280 --> 14:48.480
So if I draw my non-bonding energy line through the center and populate it, what I discover

14:48.480 --> 14:54.840
is that the bonding region gets all of the electrons from the pi system, all six of them.

14:54.840 --> 15:00.200
So clearly, benzene's perspective on this molecular orbital system is that it would

15:00.200 --> 15:01.200
like to have it.

15:01.200 --> 15:06.720
If I populate this, this is great because all of my electrons get to go down in energy.

15:06.720 --> 15:11.440
But what if we do a similar analysis for 1,3 cyclobutadiene, which is another angeline

15:11.440 --> 15:14.960
which looks for all intents and purposes like it should be aromatic?

15:14.960 --> 15:20.680
Well, if we do the exact same exercise, inscribing our polygon and forming our molecular orbital

15:20.680 --> 15:24.120
energies, we find something quite different.

15:24.120 --> 15:29.280
We find that when we populate it with the four pi electrons from cyclobutadiene, that

15:29.280 --> 15:32.320
two of them go into non-bonding molecular orbitals.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.920
In other words, there's little or in this case really no energetic benefit to this particular

15:36.920 --> 15:43.640
molecule being planar and forming these new molecular orbitals.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.200
But the trend actually continues.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.680
It's a predictable trend in the stability of annulings.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.640
So we've already seen 1,3 cyclobutadiene and benzene treated in this way.

15:53.640 --> 15:59.000
So let's go on through those, create their polygons and populate them.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.800
Cyclobutadiene, rather, we know is anti-aromatic.

16:01.800 --> 16:07.920
If we do the same exercise for benzene as we did previously, we see that benzene is aromatic

16:07.920 --> 16:11.400
because of the extra stability.

16:11.400 --> 16:16.840
Cyclo-octotetraene, on the other hand, will actually populate non-bonding orbitals if

16:16.840 --> 16:25.080
it's planar, whereas cyclo-decapentaene will not, making it aromatic.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.200
So you're probably beginning to notice a trend here.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.920
Well, you're not the first.

16:28.920 --> 16:29.920
Huckel was the first.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.680
That's why he was the one who got to name it, sorry.

16:32.680 --> 16:38.160
But what it turns out is happening here is that every time we add two pi electrons, we

16:38.160 --> 16:42.640
switch from anti-aromatic to aromatic, anti-aromatic to aromatic.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.360
And therefore, we can model this as a simple mathematical equation.

16:46.360 --> 16:53.200
Four n pi electrons leads to an anti-aromatic system, while four n plus two electrons leads

16:53.200 --> 16:54.520
to an aromatic system.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.720
This is the origin of Huckel's rule.

16:57.720 --> 17:02.440
But the utility of Huckel's rule extends well beyond just hydrocarbons like benzene.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.080
It can be used to explain the behavior of other cyclic systems with aligned p-orbitals

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
as well.

17:07.080 --> 17:12.360
For example, the tropillium ion, which is a carbocation consisting of a seven-membered

17:12.360 --> 17:17.240
ring with six pi electrons and a positive charge.

17:17.240 --> 17:22.320
Polygon analysis of this species shows us that it's also aromatic.

17:22.320 --> 17:26.960
In fact, the effect of resonance on the stability of tropillium is so powerful that it's one

17:26.960 --> 17:31.600
of the few carbocation which can be purchased as a stable salt and stored on a shelf in

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
the laboratory.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.920
That's right, those pesky intermediates from first-order reactions have become a starting

17:36.920 --> 17:43.200
material owing to the stabilization provided by this very special type of resonance.

17:43.200 --> 17:49.760
So cyclopentadienyl anion also contains six pi electrons, and this time a system of five

17:50.120 --> 17:51.600
molecular orbitals.

17:51.600 --> 17:56.840
And you can clearly see that in both instances all six pi electrons find homes in bonding

17:56.840 --> 18:01.800
orbitals lending extra stability to the ions.

18:01.800 --> 18:05.000
But we don't need to stop at hydrocarbons in their ions.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.800
Huckel's rule can be extended even farther to systems containing heteroatoms as well.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.760
Take the example of perol C4H5N.

18:13.760 --> 18:19.240
Now when I draw this molecule in class I usually have more than a few hands go up, and that's

18:19.240 --> 18:24.040
because as I've drawn it the lone pair of nitrogen seemed to be in an sp3 orbital, isolated

18:24.040 --> 18:25.400
on the nitrogen atom.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.760
And you could argue this molecule can't be aromatic as drawn because the pi system is

18:28.760 --> 18:32.240
encyclic, and you'd be right.

18:32.240 --> 18:37.040
To properly depict the perol I have to move that lone pair into a p-atomic orbital, allowing

18:37.040 --> 18:39.880
it to join that pi system of the ring.

18:39.880 --> 18:45.000
And in doing so I produce an aromatic system in which the amine nitrogen and hydrogen are

18:45.000 --> 18:48.200
both coplanar with the rest of the molecule.

18:48.200 --> 18:56.200
The energetic benefit of aromaticity exceeds that of orbital hybridization in this situation.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.880
The effects of aromaticity on the basicity of perol are also dramatic.

19:00.880 --> 19:06.400
Note that accepting a proton for perol means sacrificing that stabilizing aromaticity.

19:06.400 --> 19:12.240
While the same process for its close chemical cousin, pyridine, does not.

19:12.240 --> 19:16.600
So it should come as no surprise that perol is literally millions of times less basic

19:16.600 --> 19:18.160
than pyridine.

19:18.160 --> 19:23.560
This is all a powerful testament to the influence of aromaticity, and also a very obvious application

19:23.560 --> 19:27.720
of Huckel's rule in action.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.280
There are many other examples of aromatics which contain heteroatoms, like the mauving

19:31.280 --> 19:34.240
that we encountered in our nitrogen lecture.

19:34.240 --> 19:38.240
But for today we're going to turn our attention back to hydrocarbons to keep our discussion

19:38.240 --> 19:41.240
focused.

19:41.240 --> 19:45.120
Just as with all other molecules, if we want to have meaningful discussions about benzene

19:45.120 --> 19:49.360
and its derivatives, then we need to agree on a nomenclature standard.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.920
The revelation that all carbons of benzene are equivalent simplifies the process of naming

19:53.920 --> 19:56.400
them when they're substituted.

19:56.400 --> 20:01.200
Since all six carbons are identical and the pi-bonding electron density is the same, using

20:01.200 --> 20:09.080
the name 135 cyclohexatriene per the IUPAC standard is a bit misleading, so we usually

20:09.080 --> 20:14.200
default to describing this ring motif as benzene.

20:14.200 --> 20:18.160
Now just as any other hydrocarbon scaffold can be modified by replacing its hydrogen

20:18.160 --> 20:23.640
atoms with more complex substituents in functional groups, so can benzene.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.760
We'll take a look at some techniques used to accomplish these modifications next time,

20:27.760 --> 20:32.920
but for now let's focus on the nomenclature of the modified compounds.

20:32.920 --> 20:37.360
When a single substituent is attached to a benzene ring, we simply start the name with

20:37.360 --> 20:39.480
that substituent's prefix.

20:39.480 --> 20:47.640
For example, chlorobenzene, hydroxybenzene, or methylbenzene.

20:47.640 --> 20:51.440
Since all six carbons of benzene are equivalent, the position of that first modification is

20:51.440 --> 20:53.200
of no consequence.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.920
We get chlorobenzene no matter which carbon I attach my chlorine to.

20:57.920 --> 21:01.080
Attaching a single functional group to the ring prompts us to place a modifier at the

21:01.080 --> 21:02.240
end of the name.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.600
For example, benzaldehyde, or benzoic acid.

21:08.600 --> 21:14.080
Now, if this distinction between substituents and functional groups isn't confusing enough,

21:14.080 --> 21:18.080
sometimes the groups and the parent get turned on their head, and we describe the benzene

21:18.080 --> 21:24.200
ring as a substituent, so we would use the identifier phenyl or aryl in situations like

21:24.200 --> 21:25.880
this.

21:25.880 --> 21:33.960
For example, chlorobenzene is also often called arylchloride, and hydroxybenzene, sometimes

21:33.960 --> 21:35.720
called phenol.

21:35.720 --> 21:42.480
But what really spices up the nomenclature of benzene rings is when we have two or more

21:42.480 --> 21:45.440
attached substituents and functional groups.

21:45.440 --> 21:49.640
Since the attachment of a single substituent renders the remaining unmodified carbons different

21:49.640 --> 21:50.640
from one another.

21:50.640 --> 21:54.040
Let's take a look at methylbenzene.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.060
There are now three chemically distinct locations on the ring.

21:58.060 --> 22:04.640
One of them is just a bond away, another two bonds away, and a final position three bonds

22:04.640 --> 22:09.320
away on the opposite side.

22:09.320 --> 22:13.360
So where we place the second group makes a profound difference in the identity and chemistry

22:13.360 --> 22:15.520
of the new compound.

22:15.520 --> 22:21.920
For example, dimethylbenzene, commonly called xylene, can form three different isomers.

22:21.920 --> 22:30.460
One two dimethylbenzene, one three dimethylbenzene, and one four dimethylbenzene.

22:30.460 --> 22:35.080
Now often we use a more common method of nomenclature to indicate which regioisomer of the compound

22:35.080 --> 22:42.640
we're discussing using prefixes ortho, meta, and para in place of the numbered locations

22:42.640 --> 22:45.160
on the groups.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.960
The prefixes are often shortened to a single italicized letter.

22:48.960 --> 22:58.640
So here we would describe these three isomers as o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene.

22:58.640 --> 23:04.120
The nomenclature system is the source of the para in the popular pain reliever, paracetamol,

23:04.120 --> 23:06.560
also known as acetaminophen.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.840
Now notice that the two groups in this compound are attached to the benzene ring in the para

23:10.840 --> 23:12.680
arrangement.

23:12.680 --> 23:18.720
It's only when they're at that specific position relative to one another that the drug works.

23:19.720 --> 23:24.840
In fact, during the industrial scale synthesis of acetaminophen, a portion of the phenol

23:24.840 --> 23:30.440
starting material is converted to ortho-nitrophenol, which would lead to the ortho-isomer of acetaminophen

23:30.440 --> 23:32.680
in a completed synthesis.

23:32.680 --> 23:38.500
But this ortho-nitrophenol is removed before continuing because it leads to an inactive

23:38.500 --> 23:42.640
isomer of the compound.

23:42.640 --> 23:48.360
It's worth mentioning that aromatics don't have to exist as isolated rings, though most

23:48.360 --> 23:53.320
if not all of the compounds we'll be investigating will have isolated benzene motifs.

23:53.320 --> 23:58.680
A newer class of compounds has gathered considerable interest more recently.

23:58.680 --> 24:06.240
Picture two benzene rings fused along one edge, essentially sharing a carbon-carbon bond.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.360
We call this compound naphthalene.

24:09.360 --> 24:15.400
Notice that by fusing the rings we create an aromatic system in which two rings share

24:15.400 --> 24:18.320
a common pair of p-orbitals.

24:18.320 --> 24:23.800
So it should come as no surprise that naphthalene's resonance energy is about 252 kilojoules

24:23.800 --> 24:31.000
per mole, slightly less than two separate benzene rings, but substantial nonetheless.

24:31.000 --> 24:38.360
Now for planar compounds, this trend continues through tricyclics like anthracine and phenanthrene,

24:38.360 --> 24:45.040
all the way up to graphite, which is essentially a never-ending sheet of fully fused benzene

24:45.040 --> 24:46.040
rings.

24:46.560 --> 24:51.440
Now this allotrope of carbon benefits from such significant resonance stabilization that

24:51.440 --> 24:57.680
at standard temperatures and pressures, it's even more stable than diamond.

24:57.680 --> 25:02.280
In the 1980s, chemists began devising ways to impart curvature to these so-called graphene

25:02.280 --> 25:08.760
sheets by changing which edges each ring shares with others, creating new allotropes of carbon

25:08.760 --> 25:14.840
in the form of spheres, the most famous of which is hands down, the truncated icosahedron

25:14.840 --> 25:21.360
C60 molecule buckminster fillering, affectionately referred to as buckyballs, and named for the

25:21.360 --> 25:26.760
famous architect, inventor and futurist buckminster fuller.

25:26.760 --> 25:32.640
Now one can envision how the buckyball motif could act as an end cap, connecting a graphene

25:32.640 --> 25:38.240
sheet which is rolled up on itself.

25:38.240 --> 25:43.920
This structure is commonly called a carbon nanotube, and these materials show some promise

25:43.920 --> 25:49.600
in some very exciting applications, such as gas storage media and building materials,

25:49.600 --> 25:52.960
to electronics, engineering and medicine.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.280
But much of that potential is yet to be realized.

25:56.280 --> 26:00.600
Even if we never find a good use for them, I think we can all agree they are just beautiful

26:00.600 --> 26:03.680
to look at, aren't they?

26:03.680 --> 26:08.320
Now yet another useful material created from graphene sheets is what's commonly known as

26:08.320 --> 26:10.520
carbon fiber.

26:10.520 --> 26:15.320
Most of us are probably familiar with this material, which was first created in the 1980s

26:15.320 --> 26:18.960
and has since found its way into a host of applications.

26:18.960 --> 26:23.800
Many of these applications exploit carbon fibers' enormous tensile strength, which

26:23.800 --> 26:29.160
rivals that of steel, but in a material four times less dense.

26:29.160 --> 26:36.560
Now graphite consists of flat planar sheets of graphene, which can easily slide along

26:36.560 --> 26:41.540
one another's pi electron clouds, making it soft and slippery to the touch.

26:41.540 --> 26:46.440
And this is why we see it used commonly in writing instruments and lubricants.

26:46.440 --> 26:50.840
But carbon fiber, as opposed to graphite, can be thought of as a series of graphene sheets

26:50.840 --> 26:54.120
which are bunched and tangled with one another.

26:54.120 --> 26:59.360
And this bunching and tangling prevents the graphene sheets from sliding along one another,

26:59.360 --> 27:08.600
creating a material with great tensile strength rather than soft lubricating properties.

27:08.600 --> 27:13.700
So today we focused on characterizing and naming a class of compounds known as aromatics.

27:13.700 --> 27:20.280
We discussed how cyclic pi systems of 4n plus 2 pi electrons have a remarkable stability,

27:20.280 --> 27:24.520
which was recognized very early in the history of organic chemistry.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.960
We covered Huckel's Rule, which predicts that this trend continues on to larger systems

27:27.960 --> 27:31.240
as well.

27:31.240 --> 27:35.480
We examined what's commonly called the polygon rule, an extension of the mnemonic we use

27:35.480 --> 27:40.920
for linear conjugated alkenes, which is used to construct energy diagrams for cyclic pi

27:40.920 --> 27:42.520
systems.

27:42.520 --> 27:47.920
We also used this tool to demonstrate the principles on which Huckel's Rule is founded.

27:47.920 --> 27:52.840
We took a look at how aromaticity can profoundly influence the acid-base properties of organics

27:52.960 --> 27:56.240
by stabilizing conjugate acids and bases.

27:56.240 --> 28:03.280
Particularly we looked at the example of parole in comparison to pyridine.

28:03.280 --> 28:08.160
Next we tried our hand at naming some of these compounds, placing substituents ahead of benzene

28:08.160 --> 28:13.800
and functional groups after benzene in the names, and how we used the prefixes ortho,

28:13.800 --> 28:19.920
meta, and para to describe disubstituted benzene regioisomers.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.440
We then concluded by considering situations in which aromatic rings fuse together to create

28:24.440 --> 28:30.320
a new class called polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and how this naturally extends to buckminster

28:30.320 --> 28:35.320
fullerines, and carbon nanotubes, and carbon fibers, which are the focus of current research

28:35.320 --> 28:39.600
in many labs around the world.

28:39.600 --> 28:43.400
Next time we'll take a look at some of the techniques that organic chemists use to create

28:43.400 --> 28:46.200
these modified benzene rings, and I'll see you then.
