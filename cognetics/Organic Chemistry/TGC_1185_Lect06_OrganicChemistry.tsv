0	18920	In 1957, the German pharmaceutical firm Gr√ºnenthal was enjoying sizable profits from its post-war
18920	22080	sales of the antibiotic penicillin.
22080	26360	And as the company sought to reinvest those profits and continue growing its product line,
26360	34960	it developed a compound called 2-2-6-dioxo-piperidine-3-ill-1-H-isoindole-1-3-2-H-dione.
34960	37520	That's a mouthful, isn't it?
37520	41880	This compound was touted as a miracle cure for a variety of ailments, all the way from
41880	46600	insomnia to colds to headaches.
46600	51840	A global public made trusting by the miraculous benefits of drugs like penicillin welcomed
51840	55800	this new product into their medicine cabinets with open arms.
55800	61480	In the early 1960s, the indications for this new wonder drug were expanded to include morning
61480	65560	sickness in pregnant women.
65560	70160	Within months of its introduction to world markets for this particular use, thousands
70160	74480	of reports of birth defects began rolling into government offices and countries which had
74480	76840	approved its use.
76840	80960	Within a year or two, it became clear that this new indication for the drug was linked
80960	83720	somehow to this growing catastrophe.
83720	89080	Its use for this purpose was quickly stopped, though not before tens of thousands of lives
89080	93280	were tragically and directly affected.
93280	98400	The drug that I'm talking about is, of course, the now infamous thalidomide.
98400	102600	Most of us are at least familiar with the story of this drug's remarkable efficacy,
102600	106680	but also its remarkable ability to cause birth defects in growing fetuses.
106680	112120	Now, what you might not realize, however, is that these two biological effects are actually
112120	117640	the result of two different forms of the molecule sold under that trade name.
117640	122400	Today we're going to investigate the phenomenon of stereoisomerism, the key to understanding
122400	129480	what a tragedy the thalidomide accident truly was.
129480	134360	Hi.
134360	136000	Start today with an easy question, shall we?
136000	139480	Did I just wave to you with my left hand or my right hand?
140280	145120	Now I'm guessing anyone watching this lecture can easily conclude that was my right hand.
145120	147800	But how did you know that it was my right hand?
147800	152800	Well, you know that it was my right hand because, even though I have a thumb, four fingers and
152800	160800	a palm on both hands, what makes them different is the position and orientation of those substituents
160800	162240	on the hands.
162240	166680	The direction of the palm, the fingers and the thumb are unique on the right hand as
166680	168880	compared to the left.
168880	171440	If I try to superimpose them, I can't make it work.
171440	175200	If I line the palms, my thumbs are on the wrong sides.
175200	178800	Yet if I line my thumbs, now the palms don't match.
178800	185240	So in spite of the identical connectivity, I can't superimpose my hands with one another.
185240	189960	Clearly they are distinct objects which can interact with the world differently.
189960	193200	You don't believe me, just try to put a right-handed glove on your left hand.
193200	196560	It's a completely different experience than trying to put it on the right hand.
198880	203600	Now, so far we've concerned ourselves with macro-scale objects and we're not done with
203600	208680	that yet, but let's take a few minutes and turn our attention to a geometry more relevant
208680	211560	to organic chemistry, the tetrahedron.
211560	217800	See, carbon atoms can have up to four sigma bonds, meaning four different bonded substituents
217800	220920	arranged tetrahedrally about a central atom.
220920	226320	Now, when these four substituents are all distinct from one another, they actually create
226320	230840	two different possible arrangements which hold the same connectivity.
230840	234000	Okay, so let's take a look at this tetrahedral center here.
234000	237880	It's got four distinct substituents and for now we're just going to use these colors,
237880	243760	red, blue, yellow, and green to indicate that they're all different from one another.
243760	251560	Now if I were to make an exact copy of this, but interchange two of the four substituents,
251560	252840	look at what happens here.
252880	258000	I've created two structures with exactly the same connectivity, but no matter how I translate
258000	263080	and rotate them, there's no way to make them superimposed with one another.
263080	270160	Now these two hypothetical molecules have handedness, just like my hands did in our previous example.
270160	274160	And when we interchange two substituents on a central atom, just like we did here, we
274160	276880	produce a new molecule.
276880	281520	And when this happens, we call the central atom a chiral center.
281520	286280	In our current example, this is a tetrahedral center with four distinct substituents.
286280	291640	Now the result of course was that we had non-superimposable objects with identical connectivity.
291640	297080	And when this happens, we call these two entities stereoisomers of one another.
300680	305440	Now pairs of stereoisomers fall into several distinct categories and understanding each
305440	309640	of them is critical to understanding the physical and chemical properties of some of the organic
309640	312160	compounds that contain them.
312160	317560	So before we begin investigating these relationships, let me stress to you that they are just that,
317560	318720	relationships.
318720	323080	Just as you can be a brother to one person and an uncle to another, so can a given molecule
323080	329800	have various stereoisomer relationships to other similar molecules.
329800	334920	Now the first class of stereoisomers that I'd like to look at are called enantiomers.
334920	340200	In most chemistry books, you'll find them defined as non-superimposable mirror images.
340200	344480	I prefer to think of them as a pair of compounds in which all of the atom connectivity is the
344480	349160	same, but all of the stereocenters are inverted.
349160	353800	So the simplest example of our tetrahedral center with just one stereocenter, this is
353800	356600	really the only possible relationship we could develop.
356600	359640	You can't invert a fraction of a stereocenter.
359640	363320	Now this is in fact a part of the thalidomide story.
363320	369840	The thalidomide, like many drugs, contains a chiral center.
369840	375320	One of these stereoisomers of thalidomide has the desirable pharmacological properties.
375320	380280	But the other stereoisomer, which was thought to be completely innocuous at the time, was
380280	385720	in fact a powerful angiogenesis inhibitor, which is a fancy way of saying that it inhibits
385720	390680	the development of blood vessels critical to proper fetal growth.
390680	394880	And what's worse is that this angiogenesis inhibitor crosses the placental barrier with
394880	401920	startling efficiency and doomed many fetuses to abnormal development.
401920	405960	Now you'll notice that interchanging two of the four substituents produced a mirror image
405960	409480	of the original, and of course that I couldn't superimpose them.
409480	412800	So we call them enantiomers of one another.
412800	418400	But when more than one chiral center, or center of handedness, is present in a molecule, the
418400	421360	picture becomes a little bit more complicated.
421360	429320	So let's take the example of a hypothetical compound with two non-identical stereocenters.
429320	434600	In my example I have one stereocenter with red, yellow, and green substituents, and another
434600	439200	with purple, orange, and gray substituents.
439200	445560	Now inversion of both stereocenters produces that mirror image which can't be superimposed.
445560	451040	So here I've made a set of enantiomers, which you'll recall I defined as compounds in which
451040	454000	all centers are inverted.
454000	459440	But now that I have multiple stereocenters, it's possible to invert only one while leaving
459440	462600	the other one in its original state.
462600	469280	When I do this, the result is a compound with identical connectivity which is neither superimposable
469280	471400	nor a mirror image.
471400	474000	And these pairs of compounds have a different name.
474000	478560	Their relationship is called diastereomers.
478560	482480	Sets of diastereomers are distinct from sets of enantiomers in that they can, and very
482480	488400	often do, have different physical properties like boiling points, melting points.
488400	493960	A third and somewhat unusual situation arises when a compound contains two stereocenters
493960	497240	which each have the same force of substituents attached.
497240	502520	Now in this instance, it's possible to have a situation in which a complete inversion
502520	507880	of stereochemistry leads to a mirror image, but that mirror image is exactly the same
507880	509680	molecule.
509680	514320	When this happens, we don't actually have two different stereoisomers, but we have a compound
514320	517520	that still has stereocenters or chiral centers.
517520	524960	So we give them a special name, mesocompounds.
524960	528240	Now not all stereoisomers contain chiral centers.
528680	534040	Now recall our definition of stereocenter is that interchanging two groups on that center
534040	537400	changes the identity of a molecule.
537400	542000	You also may recall that in lecture two, we learned that pi bonds have restricted rotation
542000	547160	owing to the side-to-side overlap of p-atomic orbitals, which can't be interrupted unless
547160	550040	we break the pi bond.
550040	554720	So this can lead to another kind of stereoisomerism.
554800	559120	Here's a molecule of what we would call beta-butylene.
559120	563480	Now since we can't rotate pi bonds, it's possible to have a compound like this with
563480	570040	two substituents, a methyl and a hydrogen on this, a methyl and a hydrogen on this carbon.
570040	576960	And I can create a second form of this beta-butylene molecule in which my two CH3 groups are on
576960	581640	the same side of the molecule instead of the opposing sides of the molecule.
581640	586920	And any effort I make to convert this molecule to this is thwarted by the presence of the
586920	588760	pi bond.
588760	595800	So two different isomers exist, even though these are not tetrahedral centers.
595800	599600	Now the presence of the pi bond makes these two isomers distinct from one another, since
599600	604080	breaking the pi bond between the two carbons is necessary to achieve the kind of rotation
604080	607360	it would take to make them superimposable.
607360	610360	And since this sort of thing doesn't tend to happen on its own, we'll see later that
610360	617280	it takes a special set of circumstances to encourage that change.
617280	622800	Now since multiple isomers of compounds with stereocenters are possible, naturally we need
622800	626720	to come up with a labeling system to distinguish them from one another.
626720	634480	And several systems exist, but the most commonly employed is the con-angled pre-log convention.
634480	640440	In 1950, as the phenomenon and significance of chirality was just becoming understood,
640440	646240	two English chemists, Robert Kong and Christopher Engeld, began cooking up a methodology for
646240	651800	quickly and unambiguously distinguishing one stereoisomer from another by name.
651800	656880	A third chemist, named Vladimir Prelog, entered the discussion during a social event thrown
656880	660880	by the British chemical company Imperial Chemical Industries.
660880	664240	And this is one of those great moments in history in which the wallflowers among us
664240	666200	can really be proud.
666200	672120	Because as Prelog himself put it, everybody danced except for Engeld, Kahn and myself.
672120	678000	Not being proficient dancers, we drank beer in discussed chemistry.
678000	682200	Now I love this story, not only because it combines two of my favorite things, chemistry
682200	687720	and beer, but because the product of the discussion was a two-year collaboration leading to what
687720	693560	is today the most used method of communicating stereochemistry in naming organic compounds,
693560	698880	the Kahn Engeld prelog convention.
698880	703640	Kahn Engeld prelog convention gives us a way to assign a rank to all the substituents around
703640	706120	a particular stereocenter.
706120	710760	And we can then use these ranks to describe the geometric arrangement of a compound quickly
710760	712840	and easily.
712840	716920	So since the first step is ranking the substituents, let's concern ourselves with that for the
716920	719680	moment.
719680	724760	The system that Kahn Engeld and Prelog suggested was one of a sequential comparison of atoms
724760	729400	within the competing substituents around that central atom.
729400	733120	And the rules take a bit of getting used to, but in fact once you do get used to it they're
733120	734960	quite simple.
734960	740360	In short, we start from the chiral center and move out one bond at a time, comparing all
740360	746000	atoms encountered and the substituent with the first instance of the heavier atom wins
746000	748320	priority.
748320	753240	Any time a double or triple bond is encountered, the doubly or triply bonded atom is counted
753240	757440	twice or three times, respectively.
757440	759520	Now let's take a look at this rule in action.
759520	762640	And we're going to consider just the ranking of substituents for the moment and we'll add
762640	766320	those spatial arrangements later.
766320	770760	Let's begin with a molecule we've all heard of, this is Freon 151.
770760	776240	It's also called chlorofluoroethane and it contains a chiral center right there.
776240	785520	This carbon has four distinct substituents, chlorine, fluorine, CH3, and a hydrogen.
785520	790520	So to rank each of these substituents using the Kahn Engeld pre-log convention, I simply
790520	795000	move one bond out from the carbon and make a note of the atom I encounter.
795000	799840	In this case, a chlorine, a fluorine, a carbon, and a hydrogen.
799840	805400	Now the atomic numbers of these are 17, 9, 6, and 1 respectively.
805400	811440	So I can distinguish each of my substituents here based upon the first atom that I've encountered.
811440	819400	So I'll rank chlorine as 1, fluorine as 2, my CH3 group as 3, and my hydrogen as 4.
819400	823080	I've completed my ranking using Kahn Engeld pre-log.
823080	825800	But not all molecules are as simple as Freon.
825800	830160	Let's take the example of a naturally occurring compound called limonene.
830160	833280	You'll find limonene in the peels of citrus fruits.
833280	837240	And I've drawn for you here the line angle formula, but to do our Kahn Engeld pre-log
837240	841440	analysis I'm going to convert this into a more expanded formula.
841440	843040	Now take a look at this structure.
843040	844600	Can you find the chiral carbon?
844600	849920	Remember, it's a tetrahedral center with four unique substituents.
849920	852480	It's right there.
852480	853480	Hydrogen.
853480	854920	Here's our second substituent.
854920	858920	And then the other two substituents actually are parts of this loop, one and the other.
858920	863760	And they're distinct from one another, which means this is genuinely a chiral center.
863760	865480	So let's start our analysis.
865480	868200	One bond out gives me three carbons and a hydrogen.
868200	875440	So I can assign my lowest priority substituent, but I still have three other competing substituents.
875440	877600	So let's go another bond out.
877600	882840	When I do that, I have a situation where I have a double bonded carbon, which means I
882840	887720	count it twice, whereas here I have carbons and hydrogens.
887720	893840	So when I take my inventory of all the bonded atoms that I've encountered, I have CCC for
893840	901560	this one, CHH for my substituent on the left side, and CHH for my substituent on the right
901560	902840	side.
902840	906740	So as I take a quick scan here, I see a tie and then I see a win.
906740	911480	So this substituent is going to be my top ranked substituent.
911480	917120	But I'm not done yet because I still have a tie for the second and third position, which
917120	921240	means I've got to go another bond length away.
921240	927600	When I do this, on the left hand side of the molecule, I get CHH, and on the right side,
927600	934800	I encounter another double bond to a carbon, meaning it's counted twice, or CCH.
934800	938880	So the substituent on the right side would be ranked number two and a substituent on
938880	940080	the left number three.
940080	944040	Now there's another gotcha to this system that I'd like to point out.
944040	948400	This is a favorite when I write an exam question, actually, and that is that the tendency becomes
948400	952400	to look for that heavy atom and say, that must be the top ranked substituent.
952400	956720	And a great example of this is a fluoxetine molecule, also marketed under the trade name
956720	958960	Prozac.
958960	962040	Fluoxetine contains a chiral center right here.
962040	965880	And if we looked at this and gave it a quick glance, we might notice there's a nitrogen
965880	966880	up here.
966880	970560	I've had a low carbon in hydrogen since the heavy atom is on the upward pointing substituent.
970560	973400	That must be a higher rank.
973400	978720	But the truth is, it's not, because con-ingled pre-log requires that I move sequentially,
978720	981920	one bond at a time, and make my comparison.
981920	984480	Once I have a win, I stop counting.
984480	992480	So my first bond out lets me assign the one and four to the oxygen and the hydrogen, respectively.
992480	998920	And to break the tie between my carbons, I go one more bond to get CHH on my top and
998920	1002160	CCC off to the left here.
1002160	1006520	So this substituent has won, and I never even encounter the heavy atom.
1006520	1011280	So it's crucial when doing this ranking that you go bond by bond and stop as soon as you
1011280	1012480	found a difference.
1012480	1018960	This is how the con-ingled pre-log works.
1018960	1023520	So the ranking system proposed by con-ingled and pre-log gives us the basis for assigning
1023520	1028440	a universal stereochemistry designation to particular chiral centers.
1028440	1033040	But we have yet to define exactly how we use these rankings to define the geometry around
1033040	1035320	those stereocenters.
1035320	1041680	The most common use of these rankings is what's called the RS system of nomenclature.
1041680	1048160	In this system, each chiral center is given a designation of R or S, depending upon the
1048160	1054240	arrangement of rank substituents around the center, and it's done in the following way.
1054240	1058760	After we've ranked all four substituents, we place the fourth ranked substituent at
1058760	1061000	the back of the molecule.
1061000	1067680	And next we draw a curved arrow passing through the first, second, and third rank substituents.
1067680	1073640	If that arrow traces out a clockwise rotation, we call this the R enantiomer, from the Latin
1073640	1076680	for rectus or right.
1076680	1081760	If instead it traces out a counterclockwise path, we call it the S enantiomer from the
1081760	1086160	Latin for sinister or left.
1086160	1090960	So let's try this system out on the two enantiomers of 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane, remember freon
1090960	1091960	151.
1091960	1096720	Now again, we'll identify the chiral center and rank the four substituents with chlorine
1096720	1103680	as 1, fluorine as 2, carbon as 3, and hydrogen as 4.
1103680	1108280	In this case, the lowest ranked substituent is already pointed to the back, I can simply
1108280	1111680	draw my arrows and assign my stereochemistry.
1111680	1117320	So the molecule on the left is S, 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane, and the molecule on the right
1117320	1122080	is R, 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane.
1122080	1126000	Let's try that same exercise with limonene, the compound responsible for that strong aroma
1126000	1127920	of citrus fruits.
1127920	1132600	And you'll recall limonene has a single chiral center, and it's located here.
1132600	1135880	Now I've drawn the limonene structure with the hydrogen in the back of the molecule as
1135880	1142840	well, so I'm ready to determine its RS designation without having to rotate the molecule any further.
1142840	1147720	Counting for my substituents 1 through 3, I draw a circle which is clockwise.
1147720	1152920	So this enantiomer of limonene has an R stereocenter.
1152920	1158360	Of course we can draw a limonene with the S stereocenter simply by reflecting this molecule.
1158360	1162480	And the enantiomer of limonene actually doesn't smell like citrus at all, but more like
1162480	1165640	pine tar or turpentine.
1165640	1170200	So one very useful aspect of the RS system is actually how simple it is to tell when
1170200	1176920	you're dealing with enantiomers or mesocompounds in cases with two similar chiral centers.
1176920	1182320	So let's have another look at 2,4-dichloropentane as an example.
1182320	1189120	Here I have two chiral centers in the molecule, but is this molecule chiral overall?
1189120	1190720	The answer is no.
1190720	1200920	If I assign chirality to each stereocenter in this example, I find that I have 2R4S2,4-dichloropentane.
1200920	1211040	Now the mirror image of this molecule is 2S4R2,4-dichloropentane, which is exactly the same molecule.
1211040	1216280	A simple translation and rotation allows me to overlay the two molecules.
1216280	1221800	But the other two possibilities here are the RR and SS enantiomers, and these are in
1221800	1226480	fact chiral because they are not superimposable with their mirror images.
1226480	1230840	So these two are a set of enantiomers.
1230840	1237600	Now, con-angle pre-law convention is not only used in tetrahedral chiral centers, but also
1237600	1242960	in designating the stereoisomers which contain double bonds, which are not chiral, like our
1242960	1243960	beta-butylene.
1244120	1248280	So here are my two different stereoisomers of beta-butylene.
1248280	1253400	And we've already heard cis and trans mentioned a few times as a means of conveying the relationships
1253400	1258920	between the substituents along this double bond which has restricted rotation.
1258920	1262360	So there are two different isomers here which cannot interconvert easily because of the
1262360	1265160	pi bond.
1265160	1270640	In one of them, the larger groups are at opposition, and in the other one, the larger groups are
1270640	1272520	next to one another.
1272520	1277200	And because the second substituent in this case is hydrogen, it's very easy to tell when
1277200	1280760	I say trans or cis exactly what I'm talking about.
1280760	1285440	Clearly I'm talking about the non-hydrogen-based substituents.
1285440	1289000	So we would call this a cis-trans nomenclature system.
1289000	1293360	But what happens when we get to a more complex molecule that doesn't necessarily have hydrogens
1293360	1296360	bonded to all of its stereocenter carbons?
1296360	1299520	Let's take this example here.
1299520	1303720	At this point, I've got a molecule which actually has one of its sp2 carbons bearing
1303720	1310280	two different substituents, in this case a ch3-ch2 group and a chlorine group.
1310280	1316720	So looking at each of the two carbons in the sp2 system, the first one is very easy to determine.
1316720	1322040	My higher priority substituent, which I'll use in my naming, is clearly the ch3.
1322040	1323720	But how do I determine the other two?
1323720	1327800	Well, this is the problem that con angle pre-log solves.
1327800	1334640	If I turn my attention to that carbon and its substituents, I reach a carbon and a chlorine.
1334640	1338280	So clearly the chlorine has higher priority.
1338280	1343440	So these two higher priority substituents are as far apart as possible.
1343440	1345760	They're on opposite sides of the molecule.
1345760	1349840	And so we use the letter E to designate this isomer.
1349840	1354400	Had they been on the same side, we would have designated it as a Z isomer.
1354800	1359280	And these names come from the German meaning same and opposite.
1359280	1364480	So let's apply this to a different type of molecule, one that you might find in nature.
1364480	1370440	Geranial is a compound produced by flowers, as is the compound neral.
1370440	1374640	But they produce different floral smells, distinctly different.
1374640	1379880	And yet when we take a look at these two molecules, we see that the bond connectivity is identical.
1379880	1382280	So what's the source of the difference here?
1382280	1386840	Well, the source of the difference is that they are stereoisomers of one another.
1386840	1389960	If I take a look at the line angle formula for geranial,
1389960	1396120	and I choose my two highest con angle pre-log substituents compared to that of neral,
1396120	1401920	in geranial they're at opposition to one another, meaning this would be an E stereoisomer.
1401920	1405520	Whereas in neral, they're on the same side of the molecule,
1405520	1408880	meaning that they would be Z stereoisomer.
1408920	1412160	So in this case, just as in the case of limonene,
1412160	1416920	inverting a stereocenter causes a completely different smell to form in the molecule.
1416920	1419960	They clearly react differently with U.
1423160	1428080	So the difference between smelling like a lemon or a pine tree, or different kinds of flowers,
1428080	1432400	all comes down to something as simple as the inversion of a stereocenter.
1432400	1433800	That's remarkable.
1434800	1442880	So let's wrap up our discussion today by taking one last look at thalidomide from a stereochemistry perspective.
1442880	1448200	We know now that it's the R-antimer of thalidomide, which has the desirable sedative properties,
1448200	1453720	but the S-antimer causes the defects in developing fetuses.
1453720	1459240	So if I wanted to draw the stereoisomer of this molecule with the desirable pharmacological properties,
1459320	1464680	I'd have to first rank all four substituents using conical pre-law.
1464680	1473000	I have one group attached by a nitrogen, one by a hydrogen, and two groups attached by carbons.
1473000	1482040	Of those two groups attached by carbon, one has a C-H-H set of bonds, and the other O-O-N.
1482040	1485640	So I now have all the information I need to rank my substituents.
1485640	1488840	And now I just need to place the lowest in the back
1488840	1493480	and draw the remaining three in a clockwise fashion to complete the structure.
1493480	1497800	I've drawn the sedative version of thalidomide.
1497800	1504120	So the logical question one might ask here is, if we know that the R-antimer of thalidomide has favorable properties
1504120	1512600	and the S-antimer is terribly, terribly toxic, can we simply remove the S-antimer from the product?
1512600	1515960	Well, in the case of thalidomide, this is unfortunately not possible.
1515960	1519320	And the reason why goes back to our last lecture on acid-base chemistry.
1520120	1523400	See, because the hydrogen on the chiral center is weakly acidic,
1523400	1526200	it can be removed by the weak bases in your bloodstream.
1527080	1530520	And it's then replaced to the molecule from both sides,
1530520	1535000	meaning that it can actually reform the S-antimer in your bloodstream.
1535640	1540360	So any attempt to get pure arthalidomide into the bloodstream would only result in its conversion
1540360	1544760	back to what we call a racemic mixture or an equal mixture of the two enantiomers
1544760	1545880	within a matter of minutes.
1548680	1551080	But everything we learn today is not in vain.
1551080	1553480	There are many pharmaceutical products in use today,
1554200	1558920	things as simple as anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, opiates like methadone,
1558920	1564120	and even our antidepressant, fluoxetine, all of which contain sets of stereoisomers.
1564120	1567800	In some cases, only one of which has the desired pharmacological property.
1568600	1571720	But because we are aware of the phenomenon of chirality,
1571720	1576600	we know that we need to test both of those for toxicity before we put our drugs on the market.
1576600	1577960	A lesson learned from Thalidomide.
1581720	1583160	So let's review what we've learned today.
1584120	1588440	We've explored the idea of handedness and how chemists have given this phenomenon
1588440	1590120	a different name, chirality.
1591480	1594920	We saw how tetrahedral centers and molecules can be chiral
1594920	1597880	if they contain four distinct bonded substituents.
1598680	1602680	And we saw how handedness can be inverted by interchanging two of those substituents
1602680	1606040	on such a chiral center, creating sets of stereoisomers.
1608600	1612280	We took a look at some examples of stereoisomers, including enantiomers,
1612280	1614440	in which all the chiral centers have been inverted.
1615320	1620200	We looked at diastereomers, in which some but not all of the chiral centers have been inverted.
1621080	1625400	And we also saw a special case in which equal and opposite chiral centers
1625480	1630120	invert rendering a molecule A chiral, even though it has those chiral centers in it.
1631000	1635080	We've explored how it is possible for compounds to have stereoisomers,
1635080	1636760	even when they don't have chiral centers.
1637400	1641720	Most notably, this happens when compounds have double bonds with distinct substituents
1641720	1643720	on those sp2 hybridized carbons.
1645400	1649640	Now, next we met Robert Kahn, Chris Engeld, and Vladimir Prelog,
1649640	1653640	who devised a system for ranking substituents around stereocenters
1653640	1657240	so that we could have a simple convention for describing them to one another.
1659560	1663000	And we saw how chiral centers are categorized by the direction in which
1663000	1666200	the three highest priority substituents are seen
1666200	1669480	when the lowest priority substituent is in the back of the molecule,
1670520	1673240	R for clockwise, S for counterclockwise.
1675320	1678440	Then we took a look at stereoisomers containing double bonds,
1678440	1681400	and how they can be described using E and Z designations,
1681960	1685800	and how substituents ranked using the Kahn Engeld Prelog convention
1685800	1688920	allow us to determine our priorities for that naming system as well.
1691000	1694520	And finally, we used the example of thalidomide to demonstrate
1694520	1698360	the power of stereochemistry and the profound differences in properties,
1698360	1703320	which can result from a change as simple as reflecting just one chiral center.
1706680	1708920	Next time we're going to begin a series of lectures,
1709000	1712040	in which we categorize, name, and explore the structures
1712040	1714520	of various classes of organic compounds.
1714520	1724840	I'm looking forward to that, and I'll see you then.
