1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,280
In the 1700s and early 1800s, the science of organic chemistry had not yet been conceived.

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,440
But the industrial revolution was in full swing.

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,880
And to put all the new tools and technologies born of this age to best use required activities

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,640
take place indoors and at night.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,000
This of course led to an increasing demand for sources of artificial light.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,920
During this time, the preferred lamp fuels were oils sourced from whales.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,640
Whale oil was obtainable through commercial whaling, and it burned brightly if not totally

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
cleanly.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,320
Being a complex, biologically sourced material, the refinement of whale oils into usable fuels

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,160
was always a bit of a roll of a dice.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,320
Some samples burned a bit more or less brightly than others, and with varying degrees of that

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,040
unpleasant odor.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,680
So not the most desirable traits in a chemical product, but it was the best available option

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,080
in its day.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,040
The cleanest and brightest burning of these oils was that from the nose of the sperm whale.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,640
And this material fetched the equivalent of 200 modern US dollars per gallon at its peak

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,920
value in the mid-1800s.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,320
This made commercial whaling a very attractive enterprise.

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
Whaling operations worldwide were growing dramatically during this time.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,840
And probably without a true appreciation for the damage they were doing, whalers around

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,560
the world were aggressively hunting these majestic creatures to the brink of extinction.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,800
By the late 1840s, dwindling populations forced whalers to chase smaller and smaller sperm

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,680
whales into more and more remote locations in a futile attempt to prolong this profitable

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,320
business.

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,080
The sperm whale species may very well have been hunted to extinction at this time.

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,440
But just before this happened, they were bailed out by an unlikely group of saviors, a geologist,

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,400
a retired railroad conductor, and an American entrepreneur.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:19,180
See, in 1849, Dr. Abraham Gessner, a Canadian geologist, devised a method for the extraction

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,460
of a new liquid fuel from coal and oil shale that he dug from the ground.

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,460
His product consisted of compounds called hydrocarbons, which consist of just two elements, hydrogen

31
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,300
and carbon, but bonded together in various ways.

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,860
Now, these compounds are fundamentally different from those in whale oil, yet when burned they

33
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,180
have properties that are remarkably similar.

34
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,020
And his new discovery he dubbed kerosene.

35
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,460
This kerosene outperformed even the purest sperm whale oil in the light and heat that

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,460
it could produce, as well as its shelf life.

37
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,460
So the result was inevitable.

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,740
Demand for kerosene rose through the 1850s and 60s, and demand for sperm whale oil simultaneously

39
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,060
plummeted.

40
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,020
Without a vast army of whaling ships perpetually thinning their numbers, the sperm whale species

41
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,340
began to recover.

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,060
Then, in 1865, Edwin Drake, an American railroad conductor who had been forced into early retirement

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,700
by an illness, struck another blow to the commercial whale oil industry when he discovered

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,540
a massive underground supply of an oily substance in the fields of Pennsylvania.

45
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,260
Just like Gessner's coal and oil shale, this new substance, called petroleum, literally

46
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,940
meaning oil of rocks, contains a vast assortment of hydrocarbons, including the compounds needed

47
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,740
to produce kerosene.

48
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,980
The difference was the remarkable size of this deposit.

49
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,300
With a new, massive source of raw material needed to produce kerosene, the future was

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,780
looking bright for sperm whales.

51
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,540
And the third and final nail in the coffin of the whale lamp oil industry was delivered

52
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,460
by legendary American entrepreneur John D. Rockefeller.

53
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,860
Sensing the opportunity provided by a virtually limitless supply of raw material discovered

54
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,260
by Drake to produce a superior product, the one discovered by Gessner.

55
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,820
Rockefeller pounced on this situation and entered that oil business in 1870.

56
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,180
Now, Rockefeller is famous, or infamous, for some of his business tactics.

57
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,740
But whether you love him or hate him, he had an undeniable talent for marketing.

58
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,500
And in a very savvy business move, Rockefeller played on the superior consistency of his

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,100
product by naming his company Standard Oil.

60
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,180
Essentially, promising his customers safer and more consistent performance from his kerosene

61
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,100
compared to the alternative products of the day, like whale oil.

62
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,420
Kerosene was now king, and the sperm whales weren't complaining.

63
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,300
So this is the story of how a geologist, train conductor, and a businessman unwittingly joined

64
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,660
forces to save one of the most precious animal species that the world has ever known.

65
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,260
And they did it using organic compounds called hydrocarbons.

66
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:19,420
One class of hydrocarbons is alkanes, the topic of today's lecture.

67
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,500
So what was it about this new kerosene fuel which made it so superior to the oil from

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,180
the nose of a sperm whale?

69
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,780
Well, one reason is that petroleum consists mainly of a class of hydrocarbons.

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,020
And what makes hydrocarbons so special is that there is a vast, complex library of molecules

71
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,740
making the class up, yet the fundamental rules governing their behavior are very simple

72
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,580
and very few.

73
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,620
Now, this makes hydrocarbons easier to refine into blends of compounds with exactly the

74
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,200
chemical and physical properties that we want for a given application.

75
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:02,540
Many commonly used modern materials, including natural gas, propane, gasoline and kerosene,

76
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,260
and even major components of modern lubricants and asphalt used to make roads are all produced

77
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,460
by the isolation of specific groups of hydrocarbons from petroleum.

78
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,700
So let's begin our journey to understanding the chemistry of hydrocarbons by taking a look

79
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:24,820
at the simplest class of hydrocarbons called alkanes.

80
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,380
So now that we're familiar with at least a few reasons why hydrocarbons are historically

81
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,460
and commercially important compounds, let's turn our attention to their chemistry.

82
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,200
So here are the four simplest normal alkanes as we call them.

83
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Alkanes are defined as hydrocarbons which contain only sp3 hybridized carbon atoms.

84
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,480
So to create these kinds of molecules, I'm going to use carbon and hydrogen, the simplest

85
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,300
combination of which is methane, natural gas.

86
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,180
This has a molecular formula of CH4.

87
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,940
Next on my list would be two carbons.

88
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:08,180
And to saturate this completely with hydrogens, I need a C2H6 molecular formula.

89
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,500
Continuing on to another familiar compound, propane, I have C3H8.

90
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,380
And butane, the type that you might find in a typical cigarette lighter, is C4H10.

91
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:29,300
So all of these alkanes have the exact same generic formula, CNH2N plus 2.

92
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,420
The 2N being because there are two hydrogens on every interior carbon, and the plus 2 because

93
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,940
the terminal carbons must have three hydrogens.

94
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,820
Now after the first four linear alkanes were discovered, chemists seem to have come to

95
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,340
their senses and settled on a more systematic naming system.

96
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,940
Again, the first four are based upon historical notes.

97
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,420
But after this, we reach a metric style prefix system, where we attach them to the front

98
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,660
of the name, ending the name with the suffix, AIN.

99
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,420
So here are my methane, propane, and butane again, followed by my more systematic names,

100
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:16,140
pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane.

101
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:24,020
And the list continues in this fashion until we run out of carbons to look at.

102
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,860
One can imagine how dull the science of hydrocarbons might actually be if there were only one type

103
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,180
of hydrocarbon that existed for every number of carbons.

104
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,340
And limiting ourselves to ever-lengthening straight chains like I did in the last slide

105
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,100
only provides one distinct hydrocarbon for each molecular formula.

106
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:51,740
Fortunately, this is only the case for the first three, methane, ethane, and propane.

107
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,860
When we reach four carbons, new connectivities become possible, and the number of possibilities

108
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,460
quickly grows as we add more carbons.

109
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,380
Let's take a look.

110
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,780
In the case of four carbons, I can draw two different carbon chains onto which I can build

111
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,220
my alkane, one perfectly straight and one slightly branched.

112
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,420
When I increase my carbon to five, I find that there are three potential isomers.

113
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,380
Moving on to six, I have a total of five possible isomers, and introducing a seventh carbon

114
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,620
leads me to nine possible isomers.

115
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,980
So you can see here that the number of potential isomers is growing very rapidly as I add additional

116
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
carbons.

117
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,860
This trend continues.

118
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,460
In fact, this trend continues very, very rapidly.

119
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,300
You'll notice here that if I increase the number of carbons beyond seven, I reach eight

120
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
carbons.

121
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,500
This is a very familiar compound for us, octane, which has seventeen potential arrangements

122
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,860
of the carbon atoms.

123
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,620
If I continue much farther, I have to rescale my plot because there are so many possibilities

124
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,820
for the next addition that all the others appear to be just little bumps in my diagram.

125
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,540
Finally, I reach a compound, the composition of the kerosene that we talked about earlier

126
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,260
with 10,000 or more potential combinations.

127
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,220
And if we go just a little bit farther to 21 carbons, we have almost one million different

128
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,860
ways to connect those 21 carbons together.

129
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,100
Take the sum of all the possibilities, and every alkane from one carbon to 21 carbons,

130
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,140
you can make more than one and one half million different combinations.

131
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,620
Okay, so I hope I have your attention now.

132
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,020
Alkanine chemistry and the structures that they comprise may be simple at their most

133
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,940
basic levels, but the complexity builds rapidly with the addition of more and more carbons.

134
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,140
So now that we've developed an appreciation for how complex those structures of alkanes

135
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,820
can be, I think that we can all agree that a system of nomenclature is in order so that

136
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,340
we can unambiguously define which structure or structures we're talking about.

137
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:08,580
Now, much like the base names of linear alkanes, some of the simpler branched alkanes have

138
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,340
common names as well.

139
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,880
For example, there are two isomers of butane.

140
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,220
We have the now familiar linear or normal isomer, which we simply call butane, but

141
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,140
we also have the branched version, which is called isobutane.

142
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,140
We call it this because iso is the prefix for similar, so because they have similar

143
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,420
molecular formulas, they have similar names.

144
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,940
Let's take another example and look at pentane.

145
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,780
There are three isomers of pentane, again the normal, one with the single carbon branched,

146
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,260
which we call isopentane, and another one called neopentane.

147
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:51,060
Now, using common names for isomers of butane and pentane seems like a pretty good idea.

148
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,660
There are, after all, just a few extra structural isomers to consider for each.

149
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,140
But a quick look back at the sheer number of possibilities that form as alkanes grow

150
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,860
larger reminds us just how unwieldy a system like that would be.

151
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,180
I know I don't want to have to memorize one and a half million possible names for a chemistry

152
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,580
exam, and I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't either.

153
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,020
Enter the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, commonly referred to as

154
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
IUPAC.

155
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,580
IUPAC is a professional standards agency, which makes recommendation on the standardization

156
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,860
of all things chemistry, including nomenclature.

157
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,860
So, IUPAC has come up with a method of nomenclature, which is highly systematized, and so it doesn't

158
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:40,820
require that we memorize millions of names, but rather just a few simple, important rules.

159
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,900
So let's take a stab at giving an IUPAC name to this molecule, isopentane, which we've

160
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,460
already seen.

161
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,540
Now, the first rule that we're going to do is find the longest continuous carbon chain

162
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,020
within this molecule, and the way that I've arranged it is not that hard to find.

163
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,060
We have a four carbon continuous chain running through this hydrocarbon.

164
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,100
Now, I could just as easily as drawn have chosen my four carbon chain in this way, but

165
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,460
as we'll see by the end of this slide, the name will actually be unaffected by my choice.

166
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,900
So I'm going to go back to having my basic hydrocarbon chain all the way across the screen

167
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,540
left to right.

168
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,820
So I'm going to call this a butane, even though it's got five carbons total.

169
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,580
And that's because I'm going to give a name to the branched portion of the molecule as

170
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:35,020
well, and I'm going to use the standard prefixes from my previous slide on naming hydrocarbons.

171
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,100
So a branch which contains one carbon is called a methyl.

172
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,860
Next I need to tell my viewer exactly where that methyl group is on the molecule.

173
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,500
So I have to number the parent chain sequentially from one end to the other in a way that gives

174
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
the lowest possible number to the substituents.

175
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,460
In this case, I have two options.

176
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,620
I can name it or number it from left to right, or I can number it from right to left.

177
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,780
Now, in this numbering system, you see that I have a two for the methyl group using my

178
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:14,420
first choice and a three as the position of the methyl group as my second choice.

179
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,820
So I'm going to go with my instincts here and take my first choice, giving the methyl

180
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,300
group the lowest possible address on this molecule.

181
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,820
Now that I've done all of this, I'm ready to construct a name for this compound.

182
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,540
And I do this by naming my substituents alphabetically, including their address.

183
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,660
If there's more than one, I'll use dye, tri, or tetra to indicate that.

184
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,420
Their numerical address will go at the front of the name, and ultimately I will end with

185
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,260
the name of the parent compound, which I determined at the beginning of the exercise.

186
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:53,500
So this molecule would be called two-methyl butane.

187
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,020
Now let's apply these rules to a more sophisticated molecule.

188
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,060
Let's try this one out in for size.

189
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,340
We're going to follow the same set of rules as we did previously.

190
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,900
We find that we have a six-membered carbon chain, which contains an ethyl group because

191
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:14,500
of the two carbons, one, two, and a methyl group, which has a single carbon.

192
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,340
Now I have to number my parent chain in such a way that these two substituents get the

193
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,380
lowest possible numbers.

194
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,140
And I achieve this by starting at the right and working my way to the left, giving me

195
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:31,260
two, four, as opposed to the alternate direction, which would give me a three, five.

196
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,840
Now I'm ready to construct my name, being sure that I list my substituents alphabetically.

197
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,360
So even though ethyl has a higher number, it appears first in the name.

198
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,080
This is four ethyl, two-methyl hexane.

199
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,400
Let me challenge you with one more.

200
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,440
How about this one?

201
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,440
In step one, we're going to find the longest continuous carbon chain, which looks like

202
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
this, right?

203
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,080
It's a hexane, isn't it?

204
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Dramatic pause.

205
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,000
No, it's not, is it?

206
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,780
Remember, these molecules have got saturated sp3 hybridized carbons, whose bonds can rotate.

207
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,360
So I'm not restricted to choosing the longest carbon chain that runs left to right.

208
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,360
I need the longest carbon chain overall, which is actually seven carbons in length.

209
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Once I've determined that, I'll take an inventory of all my substituents, in this case four

210
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,600
methyl groups.

211
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,640
I'll come up with my numbering system, which gives them the lowest address on that parent

212
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:37,280
hydrocarbon, and then construct my name, two, three, four, five, tetramethyl heptane.

213
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,880
So what is it about kerosene and other petroleum products that make them so versatile?

214
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,280
It allowed Rockefeller to produce such a consistent product.

215
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,800
The answer to this question lies in the effect that size and structural isomerism have on

216
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,920
the properties of alkanes, like their volatility, heats of combustion, viscosity, and others.

217
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,520
Alkanes don't have polar bonds, which can affect the attractive forces between them.

218
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,880
See, they only have their electron clouds, which are soft and polarizable.

219
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,140
What that means is that the electrons in the cloud around the molecule have a lot of motion,

220
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,500
and as they move, intermittent charges can build up.

221
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,440
So we call these intermittent charges intermittent dipoles.

222
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,200
As one forms in one molecule, it has a tendency to induce a second intermittent dipole in

223
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,800
a neighboring molecule, provided they're close enough.

224
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,200
These two intermittent dipoles cause the compounds to attract one another very slightly, resulting

225
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,400
in higher boiling points and increased viscosity.

226
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,760
Now we call this type of attractive force London dispersion forces.

227
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,200
So one can imagine that longer alkanes with larger electron clouds can produce stronger

228
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,160
dispersion forces than their shorter counterparts, and this is clearly manifested in the phase

229
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,360
behavior of hydrocarbons.

230
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,680
See smaller chains make up methane, ethane, propane, and butane, which we easily recognized

231
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,200
as gases at typical pressures and temperatures.

232
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,720
While pentane, hexane, heptane, and of course octane, we all know to be liquids.

233
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,400
Now chemists use the term volatility to describe the tendency of a compound of vaporize.

234
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,400
So we would say that methane is a more volatile compound than pentane, or that octane is less

235
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,880
volatile than propane.

236
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,760
But this term shouldn't be confused with the more colloquial meaning of volatility,

237
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,880
which is taken to be unstable, unpredictable, or explosive.

238
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,760
In organic chemistry, it's actually possible for a compound to be very stable as well as

239
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,240
very volatile.

240
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,400
But the trend in volatility doesn't stop where we left off.

241
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,840
The boiling points of each hydrocarbon I just mentioned systematically increases as the

242
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,960
chains lengthen and the dispersion forces increase, attracting similar molecules to

243
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,960
one another.

244
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,880
But branching also has a predictable effect on physical properties.

245
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,520
As hydrocarbons of the same mass become increasingly branched, they boil at ever lower and lower

246
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,160
temperatures.

247
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,880
And this is a reflection of the reduced surface area contact possible between those branched

248
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
molecules.

249
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,760
And just take a look back at butane and isobutane, and you can easily see why isobutane is added

250
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,520
to camping cookstove fuel to prevent it from freezing when pressurized on cold nights.

251
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,920
In fact, isobutane has a boiling point that's about 10 degrees centigrade lower than that

252
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,840
of n-butane.

253
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,040
And this effect is actually more pronounced when we compare n-pentane to its highly branched

254
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,440
isomer, neopentane.

255
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,240
The difference in boiling points there is about 25 degrees centigrade.

256
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,080
Now, alkanes are not terribly reactive from the organic chemistry standpoint.

257
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,800
Their lack of polarity leads to structures which don't tend to participate in most reactions,

258
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,920
but it does give them the ability to dissolve a wide array of more reactive compounds.

259
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,200
For this reason, liquid phase alkanes are commonly used in the organic chemistry lab

260
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,080
as solvents.

261
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
Pentane and hexane, for example, are staple materials found in almost every organic chemistry

262
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
lab.

263
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,680
But among the reactions which can be undertaken with alkanes is, of course, combustion with

264
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,200
oxygen, which leads to a mixture of carbon dioxide and water in an irreversible process.

265
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,320
And this is one of the processes that we rely on to power engines, provide heat, and give

266
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,440
us light.

267
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,600
But chemists rely on combustion for a different purpose.

268
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,880
We can use it as a means of comparing the stability of similar compounds, and this type

269
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,600
of experiment is called calorimetry.

270
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,200
When calorimetry, a device known as a calorimeter, is a sealed system which is charged with a

271
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,440
known amount of a given compound and enough oxygen to completely combust it.

272
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,240
If the combusted materials produce the same products, in the case of hydrocarbons, this

273
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,800
would be CO2 and water, then any difference in the heat released must be a result of differences

274
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,920
in the stability of the starting material.

275
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,320
Before heat released means a less stable compound was combusted.

276
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,200
So let's start by comparing some straight chain or normal alkanes, like octane, one

277
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,160
of the principal components of motor fuels like gasoline.

278
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,880
Let's compare its stability to heptane, yet another component of gasoline that most of

279
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,480
us would put in our cars.

280
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,400
When identical molar amounts of octane and heptane are combusted in a calorimeter, the

281
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,600
temperature of the calorimeter increases just slightly more for the octane sample.

282
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,960
So you might be tempted to conclude that higher octane motor fuels have more energy,

283
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,960
but you'd be wrong.

284
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,060
You see, we have to account for the fact that heptane is a smaller molecule, which contains

285
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,400
only seven carbon atoms compared to octane's eight carbon scaffold.

286
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,800
In fact, when we normalize the heat released to the number of carbon atoms present, or

287
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,680
in an even more practical way, by the volume of liquid fuel, the energy released by the

288
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,180
combustion of these normal alkanes is essentially identical.

289
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,480
But branching is another story.

290
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,260
See, instead of simply extending normal alkanes, perpetually adding CH2 after CH2 group, branching

291
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,880
introduces a differing inventory of bonds.

292
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,720
Increased branching means that we're introducing more of those stable carbon-carbon bonds that

293
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,800
we talked about back in lecture one.

294
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,840
Moreover, we're doing it without adding extra atoms.

295
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,240
So combustion, for example, of butane versus isobutane in a calorimeter should result in

296
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,200
a greater temperature change for the calorimeter containing in butane.

297
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,560
So if you had any doubt about why that isobutane is in your cookstove fuel, it's definitely

298
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,180
to keep it from freezing.

299
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,800
Your isobutane blended cookstove fuel actually contains just slightly less energy than a

300
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,600
pure and butane cookstove wood.

301
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,040
But that's the trade-off for fuel that vaporizes better in the cold.

302
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,640
Now the differences in these heats of combustion for structural isomers are actually quite

303
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,140
small.

304
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,580
The difference in the heat of combustion between octane and iso-octane, for example, is only

305
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,400
about 1% of the total energy released by each of these molecules.

306
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,000
So this very small difference is actually fortuitous from an engineering and fuel-blending

307
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,640
perspective, because mixing various hydrocarbons isn't really done to alter the energy content

308
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,600
of a fuel, but rather to alter other properties of the fuel without worrying too much about

309
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,000
changing the amount of energy it can provide.

310
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Hydrocarbon fuels are actually blended not to adjust the amount of energy they contain,

311
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,120
but rather to adjust the conditions under which they release that energy.

312
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,160
The octane ratings are meant to communicate how resistant a fuel blend is to detonating

313
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,480
under heat and pressure without the aid of a spark.

314
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,920
Now since gasoline engines are designed to detonate fuel using a spark plug at a specific

315
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,760
time in the engine cycle, it would be potentially damaging to use a fuel which would detonate

316
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,240
prematurely under the heat and pressure conditions inside the cylinder.

317
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,920
So engines which run on higher compression rates require fuels which are more resistant

318
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,880
to detonation under that pressure.

319
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,760
So this is why more branched hydrocarbons are blended into them.

320
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,000
If a fuel blend has a detonation resistance equal to that of pure iso-octane, it's given

321
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,800
an octane rating of 100.

322
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,520
If it's equal to that of pure N-heptane, it receives a rating of zero.

323
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,880
Of course combustion is a rather inelegant type of reaction, obliterating all the carbon-carbon

324
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,800
bonds in alkanes and eradicating those complex scaffolds which make organic compounds so

325
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,320
versatile and useful.

326
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,360
But our ultimate starting point for organic chemistry, alkanes, are fairly unreactive

327
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,840
molecules.

328
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,120
Fortunately, there is a way to introduce a more reactive motif to alkanes without completely

329
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,120
smashing the carbon framework to bits.

330
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,520
So let's stop thinking like automotive engineers, start thinking like synthetic organic chemists.

331
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,200
With such a large supply of varied hydrocarbons available, they make an attractive entry point

332
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,600
to organic synthesis for many different carbon scaffolds.

333
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,280
Despite their relatively low reactivity, alkanes are frequently used for this purpose in labs

334
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,040
and chemical plants around the world.

335
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,720
Now one of the most important uses from synthetic organic chemistry standpoint is as a starting

336
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,920
material used in the synthesis of a set of compounds called alkyl halides.

337
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,480
Because carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are so stable, we have to use an unusual

338
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,800
trick to get them to react.

339
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,240
We have to present them with a highly reactive atom of a halogen, like fluorine, chlorine,

340
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,200
iodine, or bromine.

341
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:03,400
For my example today I'm going to use chlorine and the simplest of all hydrocarbons, methane.

342
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,360
So the mechanism for this reaction begins with the activation of a halogen molecule by a photon

343
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,000
of a very specific wavelength.

344
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,280
It's usually somewhere in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.

345
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,640
We usually represent this kind of activation in a reaction scheme with the characters H

346
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,420
nu, which are actually variables representing Planck's constant and frequency, which when

347
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,560
multiplied together yield the amount of energy in a particular photon.

348
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:35,000
So I'll be using this notation to show any light-activated reactions that we consider.

349
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,760
Now when a halogen molecule like chlorine absorbs this photon, the bond between the

350
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,200
two halogen atoms breaks, sending one bonding electron to each atom.

351
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,480
And we call this sort of bond-breaking homolytic, because the bond breaks symmetrically.

352
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,280
This is also called the initiation step of the reaction.

353
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,720
So the result of the process is two halogen atoms, each of which contains an unpaired electron.

354
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,760
Now species with unpaired electrons are referred to as radicals.

355
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,920
In our example, these two chlorine radicals only have seven valence electrons, and they

356
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,080
want desperately to fill that octet.

357
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,560
Now one chlorine radical accomplishes this by removing a hydrogen from the alkyl halide

358
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,400
generating a new alkyl radical.

359
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,560
So now our alkyl radical has a carbon with an incomplete octet.

360
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,760
But if it finds a second halogen molecule to react with, it can satisfy that alkyl

361
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,940
radical, generating a new chlorine radical which can continue the reaction.

362
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,800
This phase of the reaction is called propagation.

363
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,480
And during propagation, new product is forming, but new chlorine radicals are also forming,

364
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,000
carrying on a chain reaction.

365
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,760
Finally at some point, the chain reaction terminates when two alkyl radicals react in

366
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,120
a homogenic bond formation, homogenic meaning forming equally from both sides.

367
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,720
So just like homolytic bond breaking sends two bonding electrons in separate ways, so

368
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,520
homogenic bond formation takes place when the new bond forms from two electrons, one

369
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,160
from each bonding partner.

370
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,680
So at the end of this reaction, we've reacted an alkane with chlorine by a photoactivated

371
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,400
reaction to form hydrochloric acid and then alkyl halide, and also a small amount of determination

372
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,960
product.

373
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Now this is a very distinctive reaction, not only because it's a photoactivated radical

374
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,000
reaction, but because it's a chain reaction.

375
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So we turn to this technique to modify alkanes because their remarkable stability requires

376
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,160
this kind of extreme measure.

377
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,600
So you might take a look at our radical halogenation reaction and ask yourself, what happens when

378
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,400
there are multiple carbons in the hydrocarbons starting material?

379
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,820
After all, methane only has one carbon which can react, but what about propane, or even

380
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,920
larger hydrocarbons?

381
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,800
These larger hydrocarbons contain chemically distinct carbons, which we call primary, secondary,

382
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:16,320
tertiary, and quaternary based upon whether they're connected to one, two, three, or four

383
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,960
other carbons respectively.

384
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,900
That's a valid question, and the answer to the question is that the halogenation will

385
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:29,200
always occur preferentially at the most substituted carbon possible.

386
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,480
The obvious exception here is quaternary carbons because they don't have a bonded hydrogen

387
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,360
which is required for the reaction to take place.

388
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,720
But in our example, propane has a primary and secondary radical which can form, and

389
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,720
even though there are two potential carbons onto which a radical could form as a primary

390
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,560
and only one which could become secondary, we still get the chlorine atom in greatest

391
00:29:53,560 --> 00:30:00,160
abundance on that secondary carbon.

392
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Now to understand why this happens, we need to invoke a phenomenon called hyperconjugation.

393
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,560
So to do this, I'm going to bring up an ethyl radical.

394
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,720
Now I've chosen an ethyl radical because it's the simplest example of this phenomenon.

395
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,040
And when we look at our ethyl radical, what you'll notice is that on one side we have

396
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,540
our single electron, which makes it a radical, in a p-atomic orbital.

397
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,680
But what you'll also notice is that in the adjacent carbon, there's a carbon-hydrogen

398
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,040
bond which I have aligned with that p-atomic orbital.

399
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:40,200
And when this type of alignment occurs, it allows an electron to very transiently jump

400
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,400
from that bond over to the carbon which is missing an electron, essentially giving it

401
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,160
a little bit of satisfaction that it has an octet for just a split instant in time.

402
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,840
And if you expand this process to occur when there is not just one carbon next to our radical,

403
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,000
but two or three, you can begin to see how the addition of these extra carbons and the

404
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,640
bonds that they have to other substituents can increase the stability of our radical

405
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,720
through hyperconjugation, which sort of fools the radical into thinking that it's got a

406
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,920
full octet, even if just for an instant.

407
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,840
So as we look back now at Rockefeller's standard oil operation, it becomes clear to us exactly

408
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,320
what gave his product that trademark consistency.

409
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,320
While his competitors were selling animal products or are less refined, more unpredictable

410
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,000
mixtures of fuels, causing their customers to wonder whether the next can of fuel would

411
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,280
be the one which burns a little bit too vigorously and sets their roof on fire, Rockefeller's

412
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,160
customers could rest assured that they would receive the same mixture of branched and linear

413
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,760
alkanes of the proper lengths to give them just the right physical and chemical properties

414
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,880
for their intended purpose.

415
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,600
So today we've discussed the basic molecular formula of alkanes, that all hydrocarbons

416
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,240
of this class consist entirely of hydrogen and sp3 hybridized carbon, and that they

417
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,160
have a molecular formula of CnH2n plus 2.

418
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,480
We also touched on the concept of structural isomerism and demonstrated how the ability

419
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,880
of carbon to form these highly branched chains leads to millions of realistic possible alkanes

420
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,080
structures with just a few carbon atoms.

421
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,440
We also took a brief look at how chemists have come to name alkanes and their structural

422
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,880
isomers in a way in which the IUPAC convention allows us to unambiguously name millions of

423
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,160
complex alkanes with just a few simple rules.

424
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,880
We've also discussed how structure affects physical properties of alkanes, most notably

425
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:52,240
how increasing size and decreasing branching lead to lower volatility and increased viscosities.

426
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,480
We also visited a few chemical reactions involving alkanes, including combustion in

427
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,640
oxygen, which destroys the carbon chain, and free radical halogenation, which can produce

428
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:10,160
new organic compounds called alkyl halides while leaving the hydrocarbon chain intact.

429
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,400
We were also introduced to the phenomenon of hyperconjugation, which helps us to explain

430
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,480
why radical halogenations tend to occur at more substituted carbons on the hydrocarbon.

431
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,280
And finally, we took a look at how a Canadian geologist, a powerful American business magnate,

432
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,320
and a retired railroad engineer all got together in the mid-19th century and used diverse alkan

433
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,280
components to forever change the commercial, economic, environmental landscape of America

434
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
and the world.

435
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,920
And to say the sperm whale species is a bonus.

436
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,320
But our story of the geometric complexity of hydrocarbons is far from over.

437
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,800
In our next lecture, we'll investigate the structural and chemical implications of wrapping

438
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,240
our carbon chains into loops, forming what are sometimes called cycloalkanes.

439
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,880
I'll see you then.
