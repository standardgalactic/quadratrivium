1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,640
Potent alcoholic beverages from the waste product of yeast, drinkable water from the

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,960
sea, gasoline from crude oil.

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,280
Humanity has always had a deep interest in the purification of liquids to obtain commodities

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,600
of great value.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,040
One of the earliest and most effective techniques to purify liquids relies on two simple physical

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:45,520
changes, boiling and condensation, which combine to create a familiar technique called distillation.

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,080
Most of us are predominantly familiar with this technique as a method of producing beverage

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
alcohol.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,020
This application has been employed for so long that its true origins in human history

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,560
are lost to the ages.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,500
What is certain is that many early civilizations independently discovered this trick, which

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,320
can be used to produce a beverage from such varied sources as fermented rice, bananas,

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,080
or even milk.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,800
But ethanol is just one of many liquids which we find particularly useful in its purified

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
state.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,800
In the 4th century BC, Aristotle observed this phenomenon related to water and wrote

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,780
on it in his work Meteorologica.

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,520
He wrote, salt water, when it turns to vapor, becomes sweet, and the vapor does not form

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
salt water again when it condenses.

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,280
Wine and all fluids that evaporate and condense into a liquid state become water.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,640
Now, by sweet, what Aristotle meant was drinkable.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,800
He had observed that seawater, wine, and all other common solutions of his day could be

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,820
made into fresh, potable water simply by boiling it, then recondensing the vapor in a new container.

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,220
Now, clearly seawater and freshwater were made from the same basic substance and modified

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:10,020
only by some admixture, which could be removed by this process.

26
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,980
Of course, in his day, Aristotle only had access to aqueous solutions, so his observation

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,700
that all fluids become water in this process would be a bit erroneous from a modern perspective.

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,240
But he did demonstrate an understanding that liquids can be vaporized, collected and recondensed

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,360
to form a liquid of a different composition than the original, a primary tenet of the

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,040
technique of distillation.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,960
Now, Aristotle's observations weren't merely academic, either.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,720
His ideas were applied in the centuries following his death.

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,400
For example, Greek sailors, according to the accounts from Alexander of Aphrodisius, boiled

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,060
seawater and suspended large sponges from the mouth of bronze vessels above them to

35
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,660
obtain drinking water.

36
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,500
Now, here Alexander is describing the desalination of seawater.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,940
In the middle of the 1600s, an Englishman and physician named John French played a critical

38
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,500
role in thrusting distillation from the realm of an alchemical art to a chemical science.

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
He very eloquently writes in his now famous work, The Art of Distillation,

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,600
I shall not stand here to show where the art of distillation had its origin as being a thing,

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,600
little conducing to our ensuing discourse, but let us understand what distillation is.

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,100
In yet another of my favorite quotes of all time, French writes,

43
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,800
Before you take yourself to the work, propound to yourself what you seek and enter not upon

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,800
the practice until you are first well versed in the theory.

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,500
A more telling quotation of those times could not possibly exist.

46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
French has always been on my list of top ten scientists I'd like to sit down for a beer

47
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
with, though perhaps in his case a whiskey would be a more appropriate drink.

48
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,500
In his time, French's work was the most influential universal compendium of distillation theory

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,100
and techniques that was ever published, a true asset to the growing science of chemistry.

50
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,900
Today, it offers us a fascinating insight into the change in thinking which was going on during his day,

51
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,600
a shift from the artistic and romantic descriptions of the alchemical world

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,600
to the factual and detailed observations of the chemical world.

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,000
But distillation is not simply an ancient technique relegated to the pages of history.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Modern fuels are particularly pertinent example of a more recent societal change made possible by this purification method.

55
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,700
A fantastic example of this is the refining of crude oil into useful materials.

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,700
And we owe a great deal of that practice to J.D. Rockefeller's standard oil company and his competitors.

57
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,900
You see, there's a good reason why we refer to fossil fuels as petroleum distillates.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,600
It's because the refining process primarily relies on distillation to separate components of crude petroleum

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,100
based on little more than their boiling points.

60
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,900
Rockefeller's true genius was not to employ the technique. Now, that had been done long ago.

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,600
But what really helped to make Rockefeller successful was his realization that in addition to lamp oil,

62
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,300
he could use distillation to collect and sell many of the other products of various volatilities

63
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,300
which other companies simply treated as waste.

64
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
And this included octane for gasoline.

65
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,800
So just imagine that gasoline was once considered a waste product.

66
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,500
So distillation has found many uses through the ages, from producing potable water and alcoholic beverages

67
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
to refining oil and gasoline.

68
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,000
It also finds use frequently in the organic chemistry laboratory

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,500
as a method for isolating liquids of varying volatility from one another.

70
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,500
The applications of distillation go on and on, but in this lecture we'll take French's advice

71
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,500
and first take a look at the fundamental laws governing this influential chemical technique.

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
First, a bit of background on the process of vaporization.

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,200
All liquids exist naturally in equilibrium with just a little bit of their vapor,

74
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
even at temperatures well below their boiling points.

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Now, the exact amount of vapor varies from one substance to the next

76
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,200
and depends on how well molecules of the same kind stick together through intermolecular attractions.

77
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,900
For example, under a given set of conditions, water will exert a lower vapor pressure than will acetone

78
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,900
because the water molecules can hydrogen bond to themselves,

79
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,900
causing them to prefer the liquid phase more than the gas.

80
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
This is easily observed.

81
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Just place a drop of water next to a drop of nail polish remover on a countertop

82
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,900
and see which one evaporates first.

83
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,600
We measure the amount of vapor above a liquid in terms of the pressure that that vapor exerts.

84
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,600
So this property of liquids has come to be known as vapor pressure.

85
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
The higher the vapor pressure of a given liquid,

86
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
the faster and more easily it will be converted to the gas phase.

87
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Now, we often report vapor pressures in units of torr.

88
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,300
One torr is equal to one millimeter of mercury in a barometer.

89
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,300
So, 760 torr is equal to one atmosphere of pressure,

90
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,300
the likes of which we would experience on a lab bench.

91
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Now, increasing the temperature of a sample means increasing the kinetic energy in the molecules which make it up.

92
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,300
So, increasing the temperature of a liquid,

93
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,300
gives more of its molecules enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid and become a gas.

94
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
This increases the vapor pressure of the sample.

95
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:56,300
When a liquid is heated to a temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the externally applied pressure,

96
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,300
like the 760 torr of pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere, for example, the liquid boils.

97
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,300
When the pressure we are working against is one atmosphere,

98
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,300
we refer to this temperature as the liquid's normal boiling point.

99
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,300
This is most easily observed by heating a sample of pure water.

100
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,300
At room temperature, water's vapor pressure is only about 3% out of atmospheric pressure.

101
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,300
But as the temperature increases, more and more water increases.

102
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:35,300
But as the temperature increases, more and more water vapor can be seen forming at the liquid's surface,

103
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
until the water reaches 100 degrees centigrade,

104
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:45,300
at which point its vapor pressure is now one atmosphere, or 760 torr, and boiling takes place.

105
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
But that's pure water.

106
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,300
And our goal today is to show how we can separate mixtures of liquids from one another using this process.

107
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,300
So let's call on a few more great minds from the 1800s to help us with that.

108
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Raoul's law, named for French chemist François-Marie Raoul, states that

109
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,300
the vapor pressure exerted by a component in a mixture of miscible liquids

110
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,300
is equal to its normal vapor pressure when pure, times its mole fraction in the mixture.

111
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,300
In other words, the vapor pressure of each component is proportional to the fraction of sample molecules it makes up.

112
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:33,300
So a solution which is 50% water at room temperature will only exert a vapor pressure of 1.5 torr instead of 3 torr.

113
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Dalton's law, named for John Dalton, tells us that the sum of the partial vapor pressures exerted by all of the components of such a system

114
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,300
is equal to the total vapor pressure exerted by that system.

115
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,300
In other words, vapor pressures are additive.

116
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,300
For example, if our water was diluted to 50% using ethanol, we would have to include the vapor pressure of the ethanol

117
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,300
and the total vapor pressure of our mixture as well.

118
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,300
Now, ethanol's vapor pressure is about 50 torr at room temperature.

119
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,300
So it contributes 25 torr to the vapor pressure of the mixture according to Raoul's law,

120
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,300
giving the mixture about 26.5 torr total vapor pressure in accordance with Dalton's law.

121
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,300
So varying the amount of each liquid making up the mixture can alter that mixture's vapor pressure.

122
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Finally, we're going to use ideal gas law, which is actually a combination of several other laws relating pressure,

123
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:44,300
volume, abundance, and temperature, all through a constant called the ideal gas constant, which we represent by the letter R.

124
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,300
So let's start our discussion about the process of vaporization and how it applies to distillation

125
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,300
in an object lesson using benzene and toluene to fairly simple hydrocarbons.

126
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Now, I'll be using numbers for toluene and benzene, but I'll be representing the molecules as blue spheres and red spheres

127
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,300
throughout this demonstration so that we keep our attention on the physical behavior of the molecules

128
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
and not the structures of them themselves.

129
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,300
So here I have a beaker that's filled with benzene and toluene.

130
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,300
And this mixture of benzene and toluene is 50 mole percent of each.

131
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Now that means that if I model my blue spheres as toluene and my red spheres as benzene,

132
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
I can begin to follow them as they change from the liquid to the vapor state.

133
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,300
Now, at a given temperature, the vapor pressure of toluene is normally 300 Tor.

134
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,300
And at the same temperature, the vapor pressure of pure benzene is normally 1200 Tor.

135
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,300
So I can use Raoult's law to calculate the vapor pressure exerted by each in my mixture.

136
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:55,300
For example, the vapor pressure exerted by toluene is equal to chi, the Greek letter chi, which is its mole fraction,

137
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
times the vapor pressure it would exert if it were pure.

138
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,300
In other words, the toluene should exert a vapor pressure of 150 Tor.

139
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Now, a similar calculation for benzene allows me to predict that its vapor pressure above the liquid should be equal to 600 Tor.

140
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,300
And a quick check using Dalton's law tells me that this liquid will be boiling maybe on a cloudy day here in Washington D.C.

141
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,300
when the vapor pressure or when the atmospheric pressure is 750 Tor, which equals the vapor pressure.

142
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Now, here's the interesting part.

143
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,300
If I take the vapor pressures of my liquids and use the ideal gas law, which allows me to predict that the pressures they exert

144
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,300
is proportional to the number of moles in the gas phase,

145
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:49,300
I calculate that the mole fraction of benzene in the vapor phase is 80 mole percent, not 50 mole percent.

146
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,300
So this means that in the headspace above my liquid, whatever vapor does form at this temperature,

147
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,300
is actually going to be enriched in benzene, which is the more volatile of the two components.

148
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Now, this is very important to distillation and how it allows us to separate liquids.

149
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,300
So let's say that I could take a sample of benzene and toluene and place it in an apparatus in which it can vaporize

150
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,300
and in which that vapor is then channeled into a new region in space where it is then condensed back into a liquid.

151
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Well, if I can do that, then the liquid I collect should be of the same composition as the vapor in that original sample.

152
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:37,300
So we use a device like this called the simple still, which consists of what we call a boiling flask, which is heated.

153
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:45,300
A still head whose job is to direct the vapor into another downward-facing region, which we call a west condenser.

154
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Now, the west condenser has a water jacket to keep it cold, which induces condensation,

155
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,300
but that condensed vapor rolls downhill into a new receiving flask,

156
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,300
and it's directed that way through a flow controller or a vacuum adapter in this case.

157
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,300
So knowing what we know about how a mixture of benzene and toluene will vaporize,

158
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,300
if I run my still by adding heat to the boiling flask,

159
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,300
I expect that the vapor which is moving through the system will be enriched in the benzene,

160
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,300
and therefore at the end of my distillation run, when I remove my receiving flask,

161
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
it should contain 80 mole percent benzene.

162
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,300
So I've enriched my sample in the more volatile component through distillation.

163
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,300
So now that we've talked a little bit about the theory behind simple distillation, let's take a look at one in progress.

164
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,300
So I've constructed here a simple distillation apparatus, the type of which you might find running in an organic chemistry lab.

165
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Currently, I'm distilling a mixture of 50-50 ethanol and water.

166
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Now the apparatus consists of not only the elements we looked at previously in our slides,

167
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,300
but a few other practical pieces that help it work.

168
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
The first is this device called a lab jack, and the lab jack gives me a little bit of clearance

169
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,300
so that I can raise and lower my heat source when I need to.

170
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,300
On top of the lab jack is a stir plate.

171
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Now this is also a heating plate, but I'm not using the heat,

172
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,300
because remember we talked about this in our previous lecture,

173
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,300
that it's not a good idea to put anything with organic solvents directly on top of a hot plate.

174
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,300
And since I'm working with ethanol, which in certain concentrations is flammable, I can't do that.

175
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Instead, I've used a device which is called a thermowell.

176
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,300
A thermowell is a ceramic heater, and I'm controlling it with a little controller in the back here,

177
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,300
which is hidden from view, which regulates how much current is reaching the thermowell.

178
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
So that's how I set the temperature of the still just the way I like it.

179
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Now right now, I have a round bottom boiling flask, which is clamped in place.

180
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,300
So this is the lowest piece of glassware in my apparatus,

181
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,300
and so I've clamped it on a ring stand so that when I lower the lab jack,

182
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
my heat source is removed from my organic sample.

183
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
So this is all about safety up to this point.

184
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Now about the distillation.

185
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
The boiling flask contains a mixture of boiling water and ethanol.

186
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,300
And if you look very closely, you can actually see the vapor condensing within the still head here,

187
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,300
and a great deal of it is falling back into the boiling flask, and that's okay.

188
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,300
But some of that vapor traverses the still head into this arm,

189
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,300
which is in a downward sloping direction and is in line with a water-cooled condenser.

190
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,300
So this condenser here, actually, if I get wiped away some of the condensation that's on it,

191
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
you might be able to see this, has two concentric tubes.

192
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,300
The outside tube is actually plumbed to cold water,

193
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,300
which is circulating because of a pump that I have underneath the table.

194
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,300
So it's constantly keeping the inner portion of this column cold.

195
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,300
That's why the vapor is condensing in this cold region and rolling downward,

196
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,300
where my vacuum adapter is directing the flow into a receiving flask.

197
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:00,300
You may notice that it's dripping downward, and that's actually the origin of the term distill.

198
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
It's from the Latin meaning to drop downward.

199
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,300
So if I'm really enriching my sample here in ethanol,

200
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,300
I should be able to detect that in the temperature of the vapor as it moves through the still head.

201
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,300
So I have an infrared thermometer here,

202
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
and I've placed a few white stickers on my apparatus

203
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:23,300
so that I can get the proper reflection of the IR light to measure the temperatures going on in this still.

204
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Now if I point my thermometer directly at the boiling flask,

205
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,300
I see that at least the surface of the boiling flask is somewhere around 80 degrees centigrade,

206
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,300
77 according to my thermometer.

207
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,300
But if the vapor which is moving into the condenser is of a different composition,

208
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
then it should be a different temperature.

209
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,300
If I've increased the concentration of the more volatile component,

210
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,300
I should see a decrease in temperature as it moves up into the still head.

211
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,300
So let's take a look at the still head temperature, at least on the outside of the still head.

212
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,300
See, it's moving around quite a bit as the vapor sort of moves and swirls inside,

213
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,300
but my reading never exceeds about 70 degrees.

214
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
So even though I've been measuring the temperatures of the outside of the still,

215
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,300
or the glass surface, rather than the actual liquid and vapor,

216
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
we can see the trend occurring here,

217
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
that it's much warmer down here where the boiling liquid is

218
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
compared to the temperature of the vapor which is moving through the still head.

219
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Now if this were a pure liquid, that should not be the case,

220
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,300
because boiling means that the liquid and the vapor are in thermal equilibrium with one another,

221
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
which clearly they aren't,

222
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,300
and that is the source of the purification that we get during a distillation.

223
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,300
So we've seen how we can separate or at least enrich a sample

224
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,300
in a more volatile component using simple distillation.

225
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,300
But what if we want a really highly purified sample of a particular liquid?

226
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Remember, in our calculations before, with benzene and toluene,

227
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,300
we determined that we would only get a distillate of about 80 mole percent benzene,

228
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:04,300
but what if we need one that's 90 or 95 or even practically 100 percent benzene?

229
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,300
We have a tool that we can use to predict exactly how liquids and vapors will behave

230
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,300
to determine the outcome of a distillation and whether or not we need to take extra measures.

231
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Now for that we use something called a liquid vapor composition plot.

232
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:26,300
And a liquid vapor composition plot, simply put, is a phase diagram for a binary liquid system at boiling,

233
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,300
as opposed to a binary solid system which is melting like we looked at last time.

234
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,300
So remember, we were operating in a specific temperature,

235
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,300
boiling a mixture of benzene and toluene, which was 50 mole percent benzene,

236
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,300
but created a vapor that was 80 mole percent benzene.

237
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:52,300
So at that given temperature on my plot, I can place those two percentages of benzene.

238
00:19:52,300 --> 00:20:00,300
Here 50 for the liquid and here 80 for my vapor composition.

239
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,300
But these calculations in this experiment have been done many, many times over

240
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,300
at many, many different compositions of benzene and toluene.

241
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,300
So if we plot similar results for different compositions at their boiling points,

242
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,300
we start to see a pattern emerge within the plot and connecting the dots gives us

243
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:24,300
what looks a lot like our phase diagrams for a binary system that we've seen before.

244
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,300
So this is the origin of the liquid vapor composition plot.

245
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,300
It's a tool which allows me to predict the outcome of a distillation

246
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:37,300
without ever having to go into the lab and run one.

247
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,300
So let's say that I really do want a very, very pure sample of benzene.

248
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Can I use distillation to achieve that?

249
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Well, our calculations would suggest otherwise for a 50 mole percent mixture with toluene.

250
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,300
But what if I were to collect that distillate and then redestill it?

251
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Well, I could build an apparatus like the one I've shown you here in which I have a boiling flask

252
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,300
and then an intermediate flask which is a collection flask for a first round of distillation

253
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,300
but is a boiling flask for a second round of distillation.

254
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Now, if I were to run a system like this, I would expect my 50 mole percent benzene

255
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,300
to collect in the first flask as an 80 mole percent benzene solution.

256
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,300
But that 80 mole percent benzene solution, when heated,

257
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I would expect to distill yet again and form a new condensate which is even more enriched.

258
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:33,300
Now, just how enriched it is, I can determine using my liquid vapor composition plot.

259
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Now, it turns out it's 97 mole percent, so let's see how I figured that out.

260
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Using the liquid vapor composition plot, I started with a liquid of 50 mole percent,

261
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,300
which gives me a vapor of 80 mole percent, which gives me a condensate of 80 mole percent in the receiving flask.

262
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Now, I'm going to heat that 80 percent liquid that I've recondensed.

263
00:21:53,300 --> 00:22:01,300
That creates a vapor which recondenses to form a liquid with a composition of 97 mole percent benzene.

264
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Now, I've set it up here as two sequential distillations,

265
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,300
but we'd really like to be able to do this in a system in which we can run a single run

266
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,300
without having to build all of this, or take it apart and clean all of this at the end,

267
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
or use two different sources of heat.

268
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,300
So, in short, is there a simpler way that we can do this?

269
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,300
The answer is yes, and we call it a fractional distillation.

270
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
This is a fractional distillation scheme,

271
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,300
and I've really only changed my simple distill by one very important thing.

272
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,300
I've added what's called a fractionating column to it,

273
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,300
and the insertion of this fractionating column gives lots and lots of surface area

274
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,300
onto which my vapor as it ascends the column can condense and then revaporize,

275
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,300
and then condense and revaporize as it climbs up the column.

276
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,300
So, if I charge this flask with 50 mole percent benzene and then run my fractional distill,

277
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,300
let's take a look at what goes on inside this region, this fractionating column that I've added.

278
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,300
As I heat the sample, I'll see vapor beginning to ascend,

279
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,300
but every time it condenses along the walls, falls into a slightly warmer region

280
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,300
and revaporizes, it becomes more and more enriched in the more volatile component,

281
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
in our case, benzene.

282
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,300
At the, or near the base of that column, it's as though I were doing a simple distillation.

283
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
I get about 80 mole percent.

284
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,300
But if you look carefully about midway up that column,

285
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,300
you'll notice that far fewer of my toluene molecules are making it to this location on the column.

286
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,300
And if you go even higher, near the very, very top, really none of them are.

287
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,300
So, if I run this particular column as I've depicted it here,

288
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
collecting the vapor that exits through the top of the column,

289
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,300
I expect to get what is essentially 100% pure benzene in a single distillation,

290
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,300
starting with 50 mole percent benzene.

291
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
So, here's how I was able to do that.

292
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
I started with 50 mole percent,

293
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,300
but my column here is running not as though a single round of distillation had taken place,

294
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
creating an 80% benzene distillate,

295
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
but rather as though a second one had taken place,

296
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,300
giving 97% and then yet again a third one had taken place,

297
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:26,300
finally getting me right around the limit of my diagram here to about 100% benzene.

298
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Now, when I do a single run in a fractional still,

299
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,300
which gives me a distillate of a purity that resembles that

300
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,300
of something that's been distilled twice or three times,

301
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,300
I report on the efficiency of my still using a term called theoretical plates.

302
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Simply put, a 97% pure distillate would mean that my fractional still operates at two theoretical plates,

303
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,300
because it's as though I had distilled and redestilled a second time.

304
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,300
If instead my fractional still gives me 100% pure benzene in the first run,

305
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
then it's three theoretical plates,

306
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:06,300
because it's as though I've gone over and down three times on my liquid vapor composition plot.

307
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,300
So, I've made a small change to my simple still setup from last time,

308
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,300
inserting not only the fractionating column itself, which is here,

309
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,300
but I've also, you'll notice, packed a little bit of steel wool inside.

310
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,300
And the purpose of that packing is to give extra surface area on to which multiple rounds

311
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:28,300
of condensation and vaporization can take place as my sample ascends the column.

312
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,300
In fact, if you look very closely, you'll see plenty of condensation falling back down,

313
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,300
because it's formed before the vapor actually reaches the sidearm.

314
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,300
So, only the most volatile of components can get to the top.

315
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Now, again, in this case, I have 50-50 ethanol and water in my boiling flask.

316
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,300
So, if I take a look at the temperature of the boiling liquid,

317
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,300
it's no surprise that the temperature is somewhere around the mid-80 degrees centigrade.

318
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,300
But as my sample ascends the column, let's say about halfway up,

319
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I've got another sticker here so I can measure my temperature.

320
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Now, in this case, the temperature of the ascending vapor is no longer in the high-80s.

321
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Now, it's about 80 degrees.

322
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:22,300
And finally, at the top, if I measure the actual temperature of the vapor which is reaching my west condenser,

323
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:30,300
I see that that vapor has a temperature of about 75 degrees.

324
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,300
So, what I've shown you here is proof that as the vapor ascends,

325
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,300
the boiling point of the associated combination of ethanol and water continually decreases.

326
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Now, knowing that the boiling point of ethanol is lower than that of water,

327
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:49,300
it should come as no surprise that my distillate, that is, that liquid which is dripping down from the far side,

328
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,300
is dramatically enriched in ethanol.

329
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,300
In fact, it's just about 95% ethanol by volume.

330
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Now, powerful though distillation is as a technique, it does suffer from limitations.

331
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,300
You may have seen this product for sale before.

332
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,300
It's a grain alcohol beverage which is labeled 190 proof.

333
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Now, that means the mixture is 95% ethanol by volume and 5% water.

334
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,300
If you ever saw this product on the store shelf, you might have wondered to yourself,

335
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,300
if you're going to make alcohol that strong, why not just go for broke and make it 200 proof

336
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,300
or 100% absolutely pure alcohol?

337
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Now, there's in fact a very good reason that the manufacturer decided to stop at 95%.

338
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:42,300
It's because ethanol and water simply cannot be distilled beyond that proportion.

339
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:49,300
You see, Raoult, Dalton's and ideal gas laws are just that, predictions based on ideal behavior

340
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,300
in which gas molecules don't interact with one another significantly.

341
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:59,300
And as you can imagine, the truth is often quite different from that.

342
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,300
So because these laws are not rigorously accurate models,

343
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,300
we often see distortions in the behavior of systems which we're trying to distill.

344
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Ethanol and water is actually a rather mild example of this.

345
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,300
The liquid vapor phase diagram for this system looks like this.

346
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,300
With a small local minimum at about 95% ethanol.

347
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,300
It looks an awful lot like something we saw earlier, doesn't it?

348
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Right, it looks just like the eutectic point in melting of solids,

349
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:35,300
which was very interesting because it was the only composition at which the liquid and solid were of the same composition.

350
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:42,300
When the analogous feature is seen in a liquid vapor system, we call that mixture an azeotrope.

351
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,300
This is derived from Greek terms, meaning no change on boiling.

352
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:54,300
It's a very appropriate name because the vapor above the liquid is of exactly the same composition as that liquid,

353
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,300
making distillation of such a mixture futile.

354
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:05,300
A fractionating column, which reaches the moon, would not be sufficient to obtain pure ethanol by distillation.

355
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:11,300
We'd have to resort to other means to chemically dry the azeotrope to make it 100% ethanol.

356
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:18,300
From the perspective of an alcoholic beverage, it simply isn't worth all of the extra effort to remove that last little bit of water

357
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:26,300
from a product which is most likely going to be mixed right back in with another aqueous solution to prepare a drink.

358
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,300
So let's sum up what we've covered today.

359
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:38,300
We started with a mathematical explanation for why vapors above boiling mixtures tend to be enriched in the more volatile component.

360
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:47,300
We relied on the concept of vapor pressure and Raoult's, Dalton's, and ideal gas laws to support our prediction.

361
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:55,300
We used the results of these calculations to construct a phase diagram, which is commonly called a liquid vapor composition plot.

362
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:02,300
And we explored how these plots can be used to graphically predict the outcome of a distillation.

363
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Next, we investigated a commonly used simple distillation apparatus, which diverts vapor from boiling mixtures into a condenser,

364
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:16,300
which then directs the recondensed liquid into a separate collecting flask.

365
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:25,300
We also looked at a fractional distillation apparatus, which differs by the insertion of a special column between the boiling flask

366
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:32,300
and still had, allowing multiple rounds of vaporization and condensation to take place in a single run.

367
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:43,300
This increased efficiency can be compared to the liquid vapor composition plot to give it a numerical value in the form of theoretical plates.

368
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Next, we covered the phenomenon of azeotropes, which are undistillable mixtures of liquids which form because of non-ideal behaviors.

369
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,300
We saw how they manifest themselves as a local minimum within the liquid vapor composition plot,

370
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:07,300
making the vapor and boiling liquid identical in composition, thereby rendering distillation ineffective.

371
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:14,300
So over our last two lectures, we've covered all of the phrases which we commonly encounter in the lab, solid, liquid, and vapor,

372
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:24,300
and how transitioning from one state to the other can be used to purify and sometimes even identify substances in the lab.

373
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,300
In our next lecture, we will return our attention to a different physical property, solubility.

374
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:36,300
We'll see how this property can also be used as a very effective tool for isolation of non-volatile organic compounds

375
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,300
in a process known as liquid-liquid extraction.

376
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
I'll see you then.

377
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Thank you.
