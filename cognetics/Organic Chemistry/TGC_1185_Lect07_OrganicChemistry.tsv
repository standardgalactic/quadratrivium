0	19280	In the 1700s and early 1800s, the science of organic chemistry had not yet been conceived.
19280	22440	But the industrial revolution was in full swing.
22440	27880	And to put all the new tools and technologies born of this age to best use required activities
27880	30640	take place indoors and at night.
30640	36000	This of course led to an increasing demand for sources of artificial light.
36000	40920	During this time, the preferred lamp fuels were oils sourced from whales.
40920	45640	Whale oil was obtainable through commercial whaling, and it burned brightly if not totally
45640	47640	cleanly.
47640	53320	Being a complex, biologically sourced material, the refinement of whale oils into usable fuels
53320	57160	was always a bit of a roll of a dice.
57160	61320	Some samples burned a bit more or less brightly than others, and with varying degrees of that
61320	63040	unpleasant odor.
63040	67680	So not the most desirable traits in a chemical product, but it was the best available option
67680	71080	in its day.
71080	76040	The cleanest and brightest burning of these oils was that from the nose of the sperm whale.
76040	81640	And this material fetched the equivalent of 200 modern US dollars per gallon at its peak
81640	83920	value in the mid-1800s.
83920	88320	This made commercial whaling a very attractive enterprise.
88320	92160	Whaling operations worldwide were growing dramatically during this time.
92160	96840	And probably without a true appreciation for the damage they were doing, whalers around
96840	102560	the world were aggressively hunting these majestic creatures to the brink of extinction.
102560	107800	By the late 1840s, dwindling populations forced whalers to chase smaller and smaller sperm
107800	113680	whales into more and more remote locations in a futile attempt to prolong this profitable
113680	115320	business.
115320	120080	The sperm whale species may very well have been hunted to extinction at this time.
120080	126440	But just before this happened, they were bailed out by an unlikely group of saviors, a geologist,
126440	131400	a retired railroad conductor, and an American entrepreneur.
131400	139180	See, in 1849, Dr. Abraham Gessner, a Canadian geologist, devised a method for the extraction
139180	144460	of a new liquid fuel from coal and oil shale that he dug from the ground.
144460	150460	His product consisted of compounds called hydrocarbons, which consist of just two elements, hydrogen
150460	154300	and carbon, but bonded together in various ways.
154300	159860	Now, these compounds are fundamentally different from those in whale oil, yet when burned they
159860	163180	have properties that are remarkably similar.
163180	167020	And his new discovery he dubbed kerosene.
167020	171460	This kerosene outperformed even the purest sperm whale oil in the light and heat that
171460	176460	it could produce, as well as its shelf life.
176460	178460	So the result was inevitable.
178460	184740	Demand for kerosene rose through the 1850s and 60s, and demand for sperm whale oil simultaneously
184740	187060	plummeted.
187060	192020	Without a vast army of whaling ships perpetually thinning their numbers, the sperm whale species
192020	194340	began to recover.
195340	202060	Then, in 1865, Edwin Drake, an American railroad conductor who had been forced into early retirement
202060	206700	by an illness, struck another blow to the commercial whale oil industry when he discovered
206700	212540	a massive underground supply of an oily substance in the fields of Pennsylvania.
212540	217260	Just like Gessner's coal and oil shale, this new substance, called petroleum, literally
217260	223940	meaning oil of rocks, contains a vast assortment of hydrocarbons, including the compounds needed
224020	226740	to produce kerosene.
226740	229980	The difference was the remarkable size of this deposit.
229980	235300	With a new, massive source of raw material needed to produce kerosene, the future was
235300	237780	looking bright for sperm whales.
237780	243540	And the third and final nail in the coffin of the whale lamp oil industry was delivered
243540	248460	by legendary American entrepreneur John D. Rockefeller.
248460	253860	Sensing the opportunity provided by a virtually limitless supply of raw material discovered
253860	259260	by Drake to produce a superior product, the one discovered by Gessner.
259260	264820	Rockefeller pounced on this situation and entered that oil business in 1870.
264820	270180	Now, Rockefeller is famous, or infamous, for some of his business tactics.
270180	274740	But whether you love him or hate him, he had an undeniable talent for marketing.
274740	279500	And in a very savvy business move, Rockefeller played on the superior consistency of his
279500	283100	product by naming his company Standard Oil.
283100	288180	Essentially, promising his customers safer and more consistent performance from his kerosene
288180	293100	compared to the alternative products of the day, like whale oil.
293100	298420	Kerosene was now king, and the sperm whales weren't complaining.
298420	303300	So this is the story of how a geologist, train conductor, and a businessman unwittingly joined
303300	308660	forces to save one of the most precious animal species that the world has ever known.
308660	312260	And they did it using organic compounds called hydrocarbons.
312260	319420	One class of hydrocarbons is alkanes, the topic of today's lecture.
319420	323500	So what was it about this new kerosene fuel which made it so superior to the oil from
323500	325180	the nose of a sperm whale?
325180	330780	Well, one reason is that petroleum consists mainly of a class of hydrocarbons.
330780	337020	And what makes hydrocarbons so special is that there is a vast, complex library of molecules
337020	342740	making the class up, yet the fundamental rules governing their behavior are very simple
342740	344580	and very few.
344580	350620	Now, this makes hydrocarbons easier to refine into blends of compounds with exactly the
350620	355200	chemical and physical properties that we want for a given application.
355200	362540	Many commonly used modern materials, including natural gas, propane, gasoline and kerosene,
362540	368260	and even major components of modern lubricants and asphalt used to make roads are all produced
368260	373460	by the isolation of specific groups of hydrocarbons from petroleum.
373460	377700	So let's begin our journey to understanding the chemistry of hydrocarbons by taking a look
377700	384820	at the simplest class of hydrocarbons called alkanes.
384820	388380	So now that we're familiar with at least a few reasons why hydrocarbons are historically
388380	395460	and commercially important compounds, let's turn our attention to their chemistry.
395460	400200	So here are the four simplest normal alkanes as we call them.
400200	405700	Alkanes are defined as hydrocarbons which contain only sp3 hybridized carbon atoms.
405700	410480	So to create these kinds of molecules, I'm going to use carbon and hydrogen, the simplest
410480	414300	combination of which is methane, natural gas.
414300	418180	This has a molecular formula of CH4.
418180	420940	Next on my list would be two carbons.
420940	428180	And to saturate this completely with hydrogens, I need a C2H6 molecular formula.
428180	433500	Continuing on to another familiar compound, propane, I have C3H8.
433500	440380	And butane, the type that you might find in a typical cigarette lighter, is C4H10.
440380	449300	So all of these alkanes have the exact same generic formula, CNH2N plus 2.
449300	455420	The 2N being because there are two hydrogens on every interior carbon, and the plus 2 because
455420	458940	the terminal carbons must have three hydrogens.
458940	462820	Now after the first four linear alkanes were discovered, chemists seem to have come to
462820	467340	their senses and settled on a more systematic naming system.
468340	471940	Again, the first four are based upon historical notes.
471940	476420	But after this, we reach a metric style prefix system, where we attach them to the front
476420	480660	of the name, ending the name with the suffix, AIN.
480660	486420	So here are my methane, propane, and butane again, followed by my more systematic names,
486420	496140	pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane.
496140	504020	And the list continues in this fashion until we run out of carbons to look at.
504020	508860	One can imagine how dull the science of hydrocarbons might actually be if there were only one type
508860	513180	of hydrocarbon that existed for every number of carbons.
513180	517340	And limiting ourselves to ever-lengthening straight chains like I did in the last slide
517340	523100	only provides one distinct hydrocarbon for each molecular formula.
523580	531740	Fortunately, this is only the case for the first three, methane, ethane, and propane.
531740	536860	When we reach four carbons, new connectivities become possible, and the number of possibilities
536860	539460	quickly grows as we add more carbons.
539460	541380	Let's take a look.
543820	548780	In the case of four carbons, I can draw two different carbon chains onto which I can build
548780	554220	my alkane, one perfectly straight and one slightly branched.
554220	560420	When I increase my carbon to five, I find that there are three potential isomers.
560420	567380	Moving on to six, I have a total of five possible isomers, and introducing a seventh carbon
567380	570620	leads me to nine possible isomers.
570620	575980	So you can see here that the number of potential isomers is growing very rapidly as I add additional
575980	576980	carbons.
576980	579860	This trend continues.
579860	583460	In fact, this trend continues very, very rapidly.
583460	587300	You'll notice here that if I increase the number of carbons beyond seven, I reach eight
587300	588300	carbons.
588300	593500	This is a very familiar compound for us, octane, which has seventeen potential arrangements
593500	595860	of the carbon atoms.
595860	600620	If I continue much farther, I have to rescale my plot because there are so many possibilities
600620	605820	for the next addition that all the others appear to be just little bumps in my diagram.
605820	610540	Finally, I reach a compound, the composition of the kerosene that we talked about earlier
610540	614260	with 10,000 or more potential combinations.
614260	619220	And if we go just a little bit farther to 21 carbons, we have almost one million different
619220	622860	ways to connect those 21 carbons together.
622860	628100	Take the sum of all the possibilities, and every alkane from one carbon to 21 carbons,
628100	632140	you can make more than one and one half million different combinations.
632140	635620	Okay, so I hope I have your attention now.
635620	639020	Alkanine chemistry and the structures that they comprise may be simple at their most
639020	645940	basic levels, but the complexity builds rapidly with the addition of more and more carbons.
645940	650140	So now that we've developed an appreciation for how complex those structures of alkanes
650140	654820	can be, I think that we can all agree that a system of nomenclature is in order so that
654820	661340	we can unambiguously define which structure or structures we're talking about.
662340	668580	Now, much like the base names of linear alkanes, some of the simpler branched alkanes have
668580	670340	common names as well.
670340	673880	For example, there are two isomers of butane.
673880	679220	We have the now familiar linear or normal isomer, which we simply call butane, but
679220	684140	we also have the branched version, which is called isobutane.
684140	688140	We call it this because iso is the prefix for similar, so because they have similar
688140	691420	molecular formulas, they have similar names.
691420	693940	Let's take another example and look at pentane.
693940	698780	There are three isomers of pentane, again the normal, one with the single carbon branched,
698780	704260	which we call isopentane, and another one called neopentane.
704260	711060	Now, using common names for isomers of butane and pentane seems like a pretty good idea.
711060	715660	There are, after all, just a few extra structural isomers to consider for each.
715660	720140	But a quick look back at the sheer number of possibilities that form as alkanes grow
720140	724860	larger reminds us just how unwieldy a system like that would be.
724860	729180	I know I don't want to have to memorize one and a half million possible names for a chemistry
729180	733580	exam, and I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't either.
733580	738020	Enter the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, commonly referred to as
738020	739020	IUPAC.
739020	744580	IUPAC is a professional standards agency, which makes recommendation on the standardization
744580	747860	of all things chemistry, including nomenclature.
747860	753860	So, IUPAC has come up with a method of nomenclature, which is highly systematized, and so it doesn't
753860	760820	require that we memorize millions of names, but rather just a few simple, important rules.
760820	765900	So let's take a stab at giving an IUPAC name to this molecule, isopentane, which we've
765900	767460	already seen.
767460	772540	Now, the first rule that we're going to do is find the longest continuous carbon chain
772540	777020	within this molecule, and the way that I've arranged it is not that hard to find.
777020	781060	We have a four carbon continuous chain running through this hydrocarbon.
781060	786100	Now, I could just as easily as drawn have chosen my four carbon chain in this way, but
786100	791460	as we'll see by the end of this slide, the name will actually be unaffected by my choice.
791460	796900	So I'm going to go back to having my basic hydrocarbon chain all the way across the screen
796900	799540	left to right.
799540	804820	So I'm going to call this a butane, even though it's got five carbons total.
804820	808580	And that's because I'm going to give a name to the branched portion of the molecule as
808580	815020	well, and I'm going to use the standard prefixes from my previous slide on naming hydrocarbons.
815020	822100	So a branch which contains one carbon is called a methyl.
822100	826860	Next I need to tell my viewer exactly where that methyl group is on the molecule.
826860	831500	So I have to number the parent chain sequentially from one end to the other in a way that gives
831500	835500	the lowest possible number to the substituents.
835500	837460	In this case, I have two options.
837460	843620	I can name it or number it from left to right, or I can number it from right to left.
843620	848780	Now, in this numbering system, you see that I have a two for the methyl group using my
848780	854420	first choice and a three as the position of the methyl group as my second choice.
854420	857820	So I'm going to go with my instincts here and take my first choice, giving the methyl
857820	863300	group the lowest possible address on this molecule.
863300	866820	Now that I've done all of this, I'm ready to construct a name for this compound.
866820	873540	And I do this by naming my substituents alphabetically, including their address.
873540	878660	If there's more than one, I'll use dye, tri, or tetra to indicate that.
878660	882420	Their numerical address will go at the front of the name, and ultimately I will end with
882420	887260	the name of the parent compound, which I determined at the beginning of the exercise.
887260	893500	So this molecule would be called two-methyl butane.
893500	896020	Now let's apply these rules to a more sophisticated molecule.
896020	898060	Let's try this one out in for size.
898060	902340	We're going to follow the same set of rules as we did previously.
902340	907900	We find that we have a six-membered carbon chain, which contains an ethyl group because
907900	914500	of the two carbons, one, two, and a methyl group, which has a single carbon.
914500	918340	Now I have to number my parent chain in such a way that these two substituents get the
918340	920380	lowest possible numbers.
920380	924140	And I achieve this by starting at the right and working my way to the left, giving me
924140	931260	two, four, as opposed to the alternate direction, which would give me a three, five.
931260	936840	Now I'm ready to construct my name, being sure that I list my substituents alphabetically.
936840	941360	So even though ethyl has a higher number, it appears first in the name.
941360	946080	This is four ethyl, two-methyl hexane.
946080	948400	Let me challenge you with one more.
948400	950440	How about this one?
950440	955440	In step one, we're going to find the longest continuous carbon chain, which looks like
955440	956440	this, right?
956440	959080	It's a hexane, isn't it?
959080	960080	Dramatic pause.
960080	962000	No, it's not, is it?
962000	968780	Remember, these molecules have got saturated sp3 hybridized carbons, whose bonds can rotate.
968780	972360	So I'm not restricted to choosing the longest carbon chain that runs left to right.
972360	978360	I need the longest carbon chain overall, which is actually seven carbons in length.
978360	982680	Once I've determined that, I'll take an inventory of all my substituents, in this case four
982680	984600	methyl groups.
984600	988640	I'll come up with my numbering system, which gives them the lowest address on that parent
988640	997280	hydrocarbon, and then construct my name, two, three, four, five, tetramethyl heptane.
997280	1000880	So what is it about kerosene and other petroleum products that make them so versatile?
1000880	1005280	It allowed Rockefeller to produce such a consistent product.
1005280	1009800	The answer to this question lies in the effect that size and structural isomerism have on
1009800	1016920	the properties of alkanes, like their volatility, heats of combustion, viscosity, and others.
1016920	1020520	Alkanes don't have polar bonds, which can affect the attractive forces between them.
1020520	1025880	See, they only have their electron clouds, which are soft and polarizable.
1025880	1031140	What that means is that the electrons in the cloud around the molecule have a lot of motion,
1031140	1034500	and as they move, intermittent charges can build up.
1034500	1038440	So we call these intermittent charges intermittent dipoles.
1038440	1043200	As one forms in one molecule, it has a tendency to induce a second intermittent dipole in
1043200	1046800	a neighboring molecule, provided they're close enough.
1046800	1052200	These two intermittent dipoles cause the compounds to attract one another very slightly, resulting
1052200	1056400	in higher boiling points and increased viscosity.
1056400	1062760	Now we call this type of attractive force London dispersion forces.
1062760	1067200	So one can imagine that longer alkanes with larger electron clouds can produce stronger
1067200	1072160	dispersion forces than their shorter counterparts, and this is clearly manifested in the phase
1072160	1074360	behavior of hydrocarbons.
1074360	1079680	See smaller chains make up methane, ethane, propane, and butane, which we easily recognized
1079680	1083200	as gases at typical pressures and temperatures.
1083200	1089720	While pentane, hexane, heptane, and of course octane, we all know to be liquids.
1089720	1095400	Now chemists use the term volatility to describe the tendency of a compound of vaporize.
1095400	1100400	So we would say that methane is a more volatile compound than pentane, or that octane is less
1100400	1102880	volatile than propane.
1102880	1106760	But this term shouldn't be confused with the more colloquial meaning of volatility,
1106760	1110880	which is taken to be unstable, unpredictable, or explosive.
1110880	1115760	In organic chemistry, it's actually possible for a compound to be very stable as well as
1115760	1118240	very volatile.
1118240	1121400	But the trend in volatility doesn't stop where we left off.
1121400	1125840	The boiling points of each hydrocarbon I just mentioned systematically increases as the
1125840	1130960	chains lengthen and the dispersion forces increase, attracting similar molecules to
1130960	1133960	one another.
1133960	1137880	But branching also has a predictable effect on physical properties.
1137880	1142520	As hydrocarbons of the same mass become increasingly branched, they boil at ever lower and lower
1142520	1144160	temperatures.
1144160	1148880	And this is a reflection of the reduced surface area contact possible between those branched
1148880	1149880	molecules.
1149880	1155760	And just take a look back at butane and isobutane, and you can easily see why isobutane is added
1155760	1160520	to camping cookstove fuel to prevent it from freezing when pressurized on cold nights.
1160520	1165920	In fact, isobutane has a boiling point that's about 10 degrees centigrade lower than that
1165920	1168840	of n-butane.
1168840	1173040	And this effect is actually more pronounced when we compare n-pentane to its highly branched
1173040	1174440	isomer, neopentane.
1174440	1180240	The difference in boiling points there is about 25 degrees centigrade.
1181240	1186080	Now, alkanes are not terribly reactive from the organic chemistry standpoint.
1186080	1190800	Their lack of polarity leads to structures which don't tend to participate in most reactions,
1190800	1195920	but it does give them the ability to dissolve a wide array of more reactive compounds.
1195920	1200200	For this reason, liquid phase alkanes are commonly used in the organic chemistry lab
1200200	1202080	as solvents.
1202080	1205840	Pentane and hexane, for example, are staple materials found in almost every organic chemistry
1205840	1207840	lab.
1208840	1213680	But among the reactions which can be undertaken with alkanes is, of course, combustion with
1213680	1220200	oxygen, which leads to a mixture of carbon dioxide and water in an irreversible process.
1220200	1224320	And this is one of the processes that we rely on to power engines, provide heat, and give
1224320	1226440	us light.
1226440	1229600	But chemists rely on combustion for a different purpose.
1229600	1233880	We can use it as a means of comparing the stability of similar compounds, and this type
1233880	1238600	of experiment is called calorimetry.
1238600	1244200	When calorimetry, a device known as a calorimeter, is a sealed system which is charged with a
1244200	1249440	known amount of a given compound and enough oxygen to completely combust it.
1249440	1253240	If the combusted materials produce the same products, in the case of hydrocarbons, this
1253240	1258800	would be CO2 and water, then any difference in the heat released must be a result of differences
1258800	1261920	in the stability of the starting material.
1261920	1267320	Before heat released means a less stable compound was combusted.
1267320	1272200	So let's start by comparing some straight chain or normal alkanes, like octane, one
1272200	1276160	of the principal components of motor fuels like gasoline.
1276160	1279880	Let's compare its stability to heptane, yet another component of gasoline that most of
1279880	1283480	us would put in our cars.
1283480	1288400	When identical molar amounts of octane and heptane are combusted in a calorimeter, the
1288400	1294600	temperature of the calorimeter increases just slightly more for the octane sample.
1294600	1299960	So you might be tempted to conclude that higher octane motor fuels have more energy,
1299960	1302960	but you'd be wrong.
1302960	1307060	You see, we have to account for the fact that heptane is a smaller molecule, which contains
1307060	1311400	only seven carbon atoms compared to octane's eight carbon scaffold.
1311400	1316800	In fact, when we normalize the heat released to the number of carbon atoms present, or
1316800	1321680	in an even more practical way, by the volume of liquid fuel, the energy released by the
1321680	1328180	combustion of these normal alkanes is essentially identical.
1328180	1329480	But branching is another story.
1329480	1336260	See, instead of simply extending normal alkanes, perpetually adding CH2 after CH2 group, branching
1336260	1339880	introduces a differing inventory of bonds.
1339880	1343720	Increased branching means that we're introducing more of those stable carbon-carbon bonds that
1343720	1345800	we talked about back in lecture one.
1345800	1351840	Moreover, we're doing it without adding extra atoms.
1351840	1357240	So combustion, for example, of butane versus isobutane in a calorimeter should result in
1357240	1362200	a greater temperature change for the calorimeter containing in butane.
1362200	1366560	So if you had any doubt about why that isobutane is in your cookstove fuel, it's definitely
1366560	1368180	to keep it from freezing.
1368180	1373800	Your isobutane blended cookstove fuel actually contains just slightly less energy than a
1373800	1376600	pure and butane cookstove wood.
1376600	1383040	But that's the trade-off for fuel that vaporizes better in the cold.
1383040	1386640	Now the differences in these heats of combustion for structural isomers are actually quite
1386640	1388140	small.
1388140	1392580	The difference in the heat of combustion between octane and iso-octane, for example, is only
1392580	1397400	about 1% of the total energy released by each of these molecules.
1397400	1401000	So this very small difference is actually fortuitous from an engineering and fuel-blending
1401000	1406640	perspective, because mixing various hydrocarbons isn't really done to alter the energy content
1406640	1411600	of a fuel, but rather to alter other properties of the fuel without worrying too much about
1411600	1417000	changing the amount of energy it can provide.
1417000	1421200	Hydrocarbon fuels are actually blended not to adjust the amount of energy they contain,
1421200	1426120	but rather to adjust the conditions under which they release that energy.
1426120	1431160	The octane ratings are meant to communicate how resistant a fuel blend is to detonating
1431160	1435480	under heat and pressure without the aid of a spark.
1435480	1439920	Now since gasoline engines are designed to detonate fuel using a spark plug at a specific
1439920	1445760	time in the engine cycle, it would be potentially damaging to use a fuel which would detonate
1445760	1451240	prematurely under the heat and pressure conditions inside the cylinder.
1451240	1455920	So engines which run on higher compression rates require fuels which are more resistant
1455920	1458880	to detonation under that pressure.
1458880	1462760	So this is why more branched hydrocarbons are blended into them.
1462760	1468000	If a fuel blend has a detonation resistance equal to that of pure iso-octane, it's given
1468000	1470800	an octane rating of 100.
1470800	1478520	If it's equal to that of pure N-heptane, it receives a rating of zero.
1478520	1483880	Of course combustion is a rather inelegant type of reaction, obliterating all the carbon-carbon
1483880	1488800	bonds in alkanes and eradicating those complex scaffolds which make organic compounds so
1488800	1491320	versatile and useful.
1491320	1496360	But our ultimate starting point for organic chemistry, alkanes, are fairly unreactive
1496360	1497840	molecules.
1497840	1503120	Fortunately, there is a way to introduce a more reactive motif to alkanes without completely
1503120	1506120	smashing the carbon framework to bits.
1506120	1512520	So let's stop thinking like automotive engineers, start thinking like synthetic organic chemists.
1512520	1517200	With such a large supply of varied hydrocarbons available, they make an attractive entry point
1517200	1520600	to organic synthesis for many different carbon scaffolds.
1520600	1525280	Despite their relatively low reactivity, alkanes are frequently used for this purpose in labs
1525280	1528040	and chemical plants around the world.
1528040	1533720	Now one of the most important uses from synthetic organic chemistry standpoint is as a starting
1533720	1539920	material used in the synthesis of a set of compounds called alkyl halides.
1539920	1544480	Because carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are so stable, we have to use an unusual
1544480	1546800	trick to get them to react.
1546800	1552240	We have to present them with a highly reactive atom of a halogen, like fluorine, chlorine,
1552240	1554200	iodine, or bromine.
1554200	1563400	For my example today I'm going to use chlorine and the simplest of all hydrocarbons, methane.
1563400	1568360	So the mechanism for this reaction begins with the activation of a halogen molecule by a photon
1568360	1570000	of a very specific wavelength.
1570000	1574280	It's usually somewhere in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.
1574280	1578640	We usually represent this kind of activation in a reaction scheme with the characters H
1578640	1584420	nu, which are actually variables representing Planck's constant and frequency, which when
1584420	1588560	multiplied together yield the amount of energy in a particular photon.
1588560	1595000	So I'll be using this notation to show any light-activated reactions that we consider.
1595000	1598760	Now when a halogen molecule like chlorine absorbs this photon, the bond between the
1598760	1604200	two halogen atoms breaks, sending one bonding electron to each atom.
1604200	1610480	And we call this sort of bond-breaking homolytic, because the bond breaks symmetrically.
1610480	1615280	This is also called the initiation step of the reaction.
1615280	1621720	So the result of the process is two halogen atoms, each of which contains an unpaired electron.
1621720	1625760	Now species with unpaired electrons are referred to as radicals.
1625760	1629920	In our example, these two chlorine radicals only have seven valence electrons, and they
1629920	1635080	want desperately to fill that octet.
1635080	1640560	Now one chlorine radical accomplishes this by removing a hydrogen from the alkyl halide
1640560	1643400	generating a new alkyl radical.
1643400	1647560	So now our alkyl radical has a carbon with an incomplete octet.
1647560	1652760	But if it finds a second halogen molecule to react with, it can satisfy that alkyl
1652760	1659940	radical, generating a new chlorine radical which can continue the reaction.
1659940	1662800	This phase of the reaction is called propagation.
1662800	1667480	And during propagation, new product is forming, but new chlorine radicals are also forming,
1667480	1671000	carrying on a chain reaction.
1671000	1675760	Finally at some point, the chain reaction terminates when two alkyl radicals react in
1675760	1682120	a homogenic bond formation, homogenic meaning forming equally from both sides.
1682120	1686720	So just like homolytic bond breaking sends two bonding electrons in separate ways, so
1686720	1691520	homogenic bond formation takes place when the new bond forms from two electrons, one
1691520	1696160	from each bonding partner.
1696160	1701680	So at the end of this reaction, we've reacted an alkane with chlorine by a photoactivated
1701680	1708400	reaction to form hydrochloric acid and then alkyl halide, and also a small amount of determination
1708400	1710960	product.
1710960	1715480	Now this is a very distinctive reaction, not only because it's a photoactivated radical
1715480	1719000	reaction, but because it's a chain reaction.
1719000	1724000	So we turn to this technique to modify alkanes because their remarkable stability requires
1724000	1729160	this kind of extreme measure.
1729160	1733600	So you might take a look at our radical halogenation reaction and ask yourself, what happens when
1733600	1737400	there are multiple carbons in the hydrocarbons starting material?
1737400	1741820	After all, methane only has one carbon which can react, but what about propane, or even
1741820	1743920	larger hydrocarbons?
1743920	1750800	These larger hydrocarbons contain chemically distinct carbons, which we call primary, secondary,
1750800	1756320	tertiary, and quaternary based upon whether they're connected to one, two, three, or four
1756320	1758960	other carbons respectively.
1758960	1763900	That's a valid question, and the answer to the question is that the halogenation will
1763900	1769200	always occur preferentially at the most substituted carbon possible.
1769200	1773480	The obvious exception here is quaternary carbons because they don't have a bonded hydrogen
1773480	1777360	which is required for the reaction to take place.
1777360	1783720	But in our example, propane has a primary and secondary radical which can form, and
1784000	1788720	even though there are two potential carbons onto which a radical could form as a primary
1788720	1793560	and only one which could become secondary, we still get the chlorine atom in greatest
1793560	1800160	abundance on that secondary carbon.
1800160	1805160	Now to understand why this happens, we need to invoke a phenomenon called hyperconjugation.
1805160	1810560	So to do this, I'm going to bring up an ethyl radical.
1810560	1814720	Now I've chosen an ethyl radical because it's the simplest example of this phenomenon.
1814720	1819040	And when we look at our ethyl radical, what you'll notice is that on one side we have
1819040	1824540	our single electron, which makes it a radical, in a p-atomic orbital.
1824540	1829680	But what you'll also notice is that in the adjacent carbon, there's a carbon-hydrogen
1829680	1834040	bond which I have aligned with that p-atomic orbital.
1834040	1840200	And when this type of alignment occurs, it allows an electron to very transiently jump
1840320	1845400	from that bond over to the carbon which is missing an electron, essentially giving it
1845400	1851160	a little bit of satisfaction that it has an octet for just a split instant in time.
1851160	1855840	And if you expand this process to occur when there is not just one carbon next to our radical,
1855840	1861000	but two or three, you can begin to see how the addition of these extra carbons and the
1861000	1865640	bonds that they have to other substituents can increase the stability of our radical
1865640	1869720	through hyperconjugation, which sort of fools the radical into thinking that it's got a
1869720	1871920	full octet, even if just for an instant.
1878920	1883840	So as we look back now at Rockefeller's standard oil operation, it becomes clear to us exactly
1883840	1887320	what gave his product that trademark consistency.
1887320	1891320	While his competitors were selling animal products or are less refined, more unpredictable
1891320	1895000	mixtures of fuels, causing their customers to wonder whether the next can of fuel would
1895000	1900280	be the one which burns a little bit too vigorously and sets their roof on fire, Rockefeller's
1900280	1904160	customers could rest assured that they would receive the same mixture of branched and linear
1904160	1908760	alkanes of the proper lengths to give them just the right physical and chemical properties
1908760	1912880	for their intended purpose.
1912880	1917600	So today we've discussed the basic molecular formula of alkanes, that all hydrocarbons
1917600	1923240	of this class consist entirely of hydrogen and sp3 hybridized carbon, and that they
1923240	1929160	have a molecular formula of CnH2n plus 2.
1929160	1933480	We also touched on the concept of structural isomerism and demonstrated how the ability
1933480	1938880	of carbon to form these highly branched chains leads to millions of realistic possible alkanes
1938880	1944080	structures with just a few carbon atoms.
1944080	1948440	We also took a brief look at how chemists have come to name alkanes and their structural
1948440	1953880	isomers in a way in which the IUPAC convention allows us to unambiguously name millions of
1953880	1959160	complex alkanes with just a few simple rules.
1959160	1963880	We've also discussed how structure affects physical properties of alkanes, most notably
1963880	1972240	how increasing size and decreasing branching lead to lower volatility and increased viscosities.
1972240	1976480	We also visited a few chemical reactions involving alkanes, including combustion in
1976480	1982640	oxygen, which destroys the carbon chain, and free radical halogenation, which can produce
1982640	1990160	new organic compounds called alkyl halides while leaving the hydrocarbon chain intact.
1990160	1994400	We were also introduced to the phenomenon of hyperconjugation, which helps us to explain
1994400	2001480	why radical halogenations tend to occur at more substituted carbons on the hydrocarbon.
2002480	2008280	And finally, we took a look at how a Canadian geologist, a powerful American business magnate,
2008280	2014320	and a retired railroad engineer all got together in the mid-19th century and used diverse alkan
2014320	2019280	components to forever change the commercial, economic, environmental landscape of America
2019280	2021280	and the world.
2021280	2025920	And to say the sperm whale species is a bonus.
2025920	2030320	But our story of the geometric complexity of hydrocarbons is far from over.
2030320	2034800	In our next lecture, we'll investigate the structural and chemical implications of wrapping
2034800	2040240	our carbon chains into loops, forming what are sometimes called cycloalkanes.
2040240	2040880	I'll see you then.
