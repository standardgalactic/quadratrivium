00:00.000 --> 00:17.860
We've spent some time now learning about the discovery of how electromagnetic waves in

00:17.860 --> 00:22.920
and near the visible spectrum can interact with organic molecules and how we can observe

00:22.920 --> 00:28.240
that interaction in a way which gives us information about the structure of the molecules involved.

00:30.600 --> 00:35.000
We learned how Newton's use of a prism to separate light into its constituent wavelengths

00:35.000 --> 00:39.840
introduced the western world to the idea that visible light was made up of multiple color

00:39.840 --> 00:42.120
components.

00:42.120 --> 00:46.600
We saw how the discoveries of Herschel and Ritter demonstrated that there were other

00:46.600 --> 00:50.560
types of light just outside of that visible spectrum as well.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.360
We've talked about how all three of these portions of the spectrum, ultraviolet, visible,

00:55.360 --> 01:00.560
and infrared, interact with small molecules in the tremendous utility that these phenomena

01:00.560 --> 01:06.720
have as tools for the identification of organic compounds.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.360
So far we've investigated how to determine the extent of conjugation in a compound with

01:11.360 --> 01:17.800
UV visible spectroscopy, the presence of functional groups using IR spectroscopy, and the handedness

01:17.800 --> 01:21.920
of compounds using polarimetry.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.120
But short of comparing the fingerprint region of IR spectra to those of known standards,

01:27.120 --> 01:33.160
we don't really have a way to probe the connectivity of functional groups within a molecule.

01:33.160 --> 01:37.280
So if we're making an entirely new molecule, for which there is no reference spectrum yet

01:37.280 --> 01:43.400
in the literature, how are we going to confirm its identity?

01:43.400 --> 01:48.760
In this lecture, we will move on to yet another region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.440
To get our answer, we're going all the way to the long wavelength end of the spectrum,

01:53.440 --> 02:01.620
beyond infrared, past microwaves, all the way to the radio portion of the spectrum.

02:01.620 --> 02:05.920
But before we get to our radio waves today, we'll need to try to better understand a property

02:05.920 --> 02:10.800
of atoms that we haven't really discussed and which we usually think of as more within

02:10.800 --> 02:14.280
the realm of physics than organic chemistry.

02:14.280 --> 02:17.480
That property is magnetism.

02:17.560 --> 02:22.720
The magnetic properties of nuclei were not well understood by Newton, Ritter, and Herschel,

02:22.720 --> 02:27.080
and they went largely unaddressed during the development of optical spectroscopy techniques

02:27.080 --> 02:30.560
in the 1800s.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.520
But in the early 1900s, that all changed.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.600
In large part due to the efforts of Isidore Rebe, an American physicist who is credited

02:38.600 --> 02:43.600
with having the revelation that atoms have certain magnetic properties which can be used

02:43.600 --> 02:47.800
to discern them from one another in a given molecule.

02:47.800 --> 02:54.920
So to get started today, let's take one more step back and consider magnetism in general.

02:54.920 --> 03:00.120
But before we get to our radio frequency radiation, I'd like to show you this.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
It's a compass.

03:01.120 --> 03:07.200
It's a device with which most of us, especially navigators, pilots, hikers, are familiar.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.200
A small magnetized needle is mounted on an axis which allows it to turn so that it can

03:12.200 --> 03:17.120
align itself with whatever sort of magnetic field it's in.

03:17.120 --> 03:21.480
Of course, in the case of my compass needle, this field is generated by the Earth's rotating

03:21.480 --> 03:22.720
inner core.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.840
Now, physicists have several different units used to measure the intensity of a magnetic

03:26.840 --> 03:32.560
field, one of which is Tesla, named for the famous and somewhat eccentric physicist Nikola

03:32.560 --> 03:34.920
Tesla.

03:34.920 --> 03:40.000
At its surface, the Earth's magnetic field measures about 50 milli-Tesla.

03:40.120 --> 03:45.200
Here, close to Washington, D.C., this weak but ever-present field points about 11 degrees

03:45.200 --> 03:47.800
to the west of true north.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.880
When I place this compass within the field, the needle aligns itself with that field,

03:52.880 --> 03:55.160
giving me an indication of its direction.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.680
So, let's assume for a moment that I could somehow remove the influence of the Earth's

03:59.680 --> 04:00.800
magnetic field.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.720
Now, I can't remove the Earth's magnetic field because I can't stop the core from spinning.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.560
But what I can do is use these rare Earth magnets to pull this needle out of alignment.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.240
Now, if there were no magnetic field, I would expect that any arrangement whatsoever of

04:15.240 --> 04:18.160
this needle in space would be of equal energy.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.240
So any alignment is possible.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.840
But as soon as I remove my rare Earth's magnetic field and allow the Earth's magnetic field

04:24.840 --> 04:30.720
to take over once again, this guy back out of alignment, snaps right back.

04:31.280 --> 04:36.000
So as soon as I place my compass back in the field, the energy of the aligned state becomes

04:36.000 --> 04:41.520
lower in energy than any of the other misaligned states, causing the needle to reliably and

04:41.520 --> 04:45.720
predictably take on that lower energy orientation.

04:45.720 --> 04:52.720
Now, the reason I'm showing you this, this rather mundane little magnetic tool, is that

04:52.720 --> 04:58.400
it's a very good analogy for the behavior of certain atomic nuclei.

04:58.400 --> 05:03.840
At atomic nuclei have a property that physicists call magnetic spin.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.440
I specifically mentioned physicists here because I refuse to lay the blame for this one on

05:07.440 --> 05:09.840
chemists.

05:09.840 --> 05:14.920
Spin, you see, is a very unfortunate choice of terminology, as it doesn't actually refer

05:14.920 --> 05:19.760
to a rate of rotation as one might assume from classical mechanics.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.280
It's a common point of confusion in the study of NMR, so let's be sure we clear that up

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
right away.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.560
Now for our discussion, it'll suffice to say this.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.840
Certain atomic nuclei have a spin quantum number of one-half, which is just a fancy

05:33.840 --> 05:38.240
way of saying that there are two possible magnetic states.

05:38.240 --> 05:43.480
Such nuclei contain what is known as a magnetic dipole, or a magnetization which can behave

05:43.480 --> 05:48.520
much like an atom-sized bar magnet or compass needle.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.880
Finally, those neutrons that I encouraged you to overlook way back at the beginning of the

05:53.880 --> 05:56.720
course are about to become relevant.

05:56.720 --> 06:02.200
This is because isotopes, or atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons,

06:02.200 --> 06:07.600
have different magnetic properties, and nearly every element has at least one isotope, which

06:07.600 --> 06:10.080
is spin one-half.

06:10.080 --> 06:16.840
This includes protons, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, and fluorine-19.

06:16.840 --> 06:21.680
But for this lecture, we're going to confine ourselves to protons, with the caveat that

06:21.680 --> 06:25.600
the same magnetic tricks I'm about to show you can be pulled with at least one isotope

06:25.600 --> 06:33.720
of practically every commonly encountered element.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.800
So let's take a look at a hydrogen nucleus.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.160
So the magnetic dipole of certain atomic nuclei behaves in much the same way as our compass

06:42.160 --> 06:47.520
needle did, randomly orienting itself in the absence of an external magnetic field.

06:47.520 --> 06:52.080
But as soon as a magnetic field is applied, which we represent as these lines, specific

06:52.080 --> 06:57.080
orientations of the nuclear dipole become more stable.

06:57.080 --> 07:02.800
Now where the analogy deviates from our macroscopic example of our compass and needle is that

07:02.800 --> 07:10.760
spin one-half atomic nuclei can align their dipoles either parallel to or anti-parallel

07:10.760 --> 07:16.600
to a magnetic field in which they reside, leading to a distribution of those two states

07:16.600 --> 07:20.920
in the population.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.160
But the energies of the parallel state, often called the alpha spin state and the anti-parallel

07:26.160 --> 07:31.840
alignment, sometimes called the beta spin state, differ by an amount which can be calculated

07:31.840 --> 07:36.480
and is referred to as the Zaman splitting energy.

07:36.480 --> 07:41.320
The Zaman splitting energy is a function of the intensity of the external magnetic field

07:41.680 --> 07:47.200
and an intrinsic property of the nucleus called its gyromagnetic ratio.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.960
Now by intrinsic, I mean that, for example, all protons in the universe have the exact

07:51.960 --> 07:55.080
same gyromagnetic ratio.

07:55.080 --> 08:00.960
So for a nucleus of a given type, the stronger the external magnetic field, the greater the

08:00.960 --> 08:07.880
energy difference between the alpha and beta spin states will be.

08:07.880 --> 08:13.000
Now on our way to understanding how NMR works in laboratories of the 21st century, we first

08:13.000 --> 08:17.880
have to make a pit stop in the 1940s and 50s when the science was still being developed

08:17.880 --> 08:21.000
by Rebi and his contemporaries.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.560
This historical context is going to help us to better understand the more complex instruments

08:25.560 --> 08:27.320
of today.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.560
So let's say that we have a collection of protons in a fairly strong external magnetic

08:31.560 --> 08:33.480
field.

08:33.480 --> 08:37.920
We expect that these protons will arrange themselves in a collection of alpha and beta

08:37.920 --> 08:44.840
spin states, with just a very slight excess in the lower energy alpha state.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.080
Let's say that we place our protons in a 1.4 Tesla magnetic field.

08:49.080 --> 08:55.720
That's a field about 28,000 times as strong as the Earth's, powerful but attainable with

08:55.720 --> 08:59.120
a suitable electromagnet.

08:59.120 --> 09:06.320
First on the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton, 42.577 MHz per Tesla, I can calculate the

09:06.320 --> 09:11.440
Zaman splitting energy difference between those two states.

09:11.440 --> 09:16.120
Since the proton is the most frequently used nucleus in NMR experiments, we report field

09:16.120 --> 09:20.820
strengths in Tesla or rarely in Tesla, more often we actually use the resonance frequency

09:20.820 --> 09:24.240
of a proton in that field.

09:24.240 --> 09:29.800
For example, our 1.4 Tesla magnet should bring a proton into resonance with a radiation

09:29.800 --> 09:32.920
of 60 MHz in frequency.

09:32.920 --> 09:38.320
So you'll notice that most modern spectrometers have a frequency splashed across the side in

09:38.320 --> 09:40.040
large fonts.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.080
This is the frequency that's indicated there.

09:43.080 --> 09:48.120
It's a photon of that specific frequency, one with a wavelength of about 5 meters, which

09:48.120 --> 09:52.920
carries just the right amount of energy to cause a proton in the alpha spin state to

09:52.920 --> 10:00.360
flip into the beta spin state, absorbing the photon in the process.

10:00.360 --> 10:04.360
So early spectrometers attempting to take advantage of this phenomenon consisted of

10:04.360 --> 10:13.320
a powerful electromagnet, a radio frequency transmitter, and a radio frequency receiver.

10:13.320 --> 10:18.200
A sample of organic material is placed into the magnetic field and irradiated with a constant

10:18.200 --> 10:22.080
wave of a specific radio frequency.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.480
In keeping with our example, that would be 60 MHz.

10:25.480 --> 10:30.600
And this is how continuous wave NMR gets its name.

10:30.600 --> 10:36.240
The current to the electromagnet is slowly increased as the exiting radio wave is monitored

10:36.240 --> 10:38.320
at the receiver.

10:38.320 --> 10:44.440
In our very simple example, at one very specific field strength, the radio wave will be absorbed

10:44.440 --> 10:49.800
in the spin state transition from alpha to beta, manifesting itself as a reduced radio

10:49.800 --> 10:52.560
wave intensity at the receiver.

10:52.560 --> 11:01.520
So this is the basic design of a continuous wave NMR spectrometer.

11:01.520 --> 11:06.800
So if you've been following so far, you probably have at least one very important question.

11:06.800 --> 11:12.280
If all protons have exactly the same gyromagnetic ratio, and the field in the NMR experiment

11:12.280 --> 11:17.320
is perfectly uniform, how is it that this technology is good for anything other than

11:17.320 --> 11:20.400
simply detecting the presence of protons?

11:20.400 --> 11:26.960
How can it possibly distinguish one proton on a molecule from another?

11:26.960 --> 11:30.800
The answer to this very important question lies in a different term in the Zeeman splitting

11:30.800 --> 11:31.800
equation.

11:31.800 --> 11:37.680
It's not the gyromagnetic ratio which differs from one proton to the next, but rather the

11:37.680 --> 11:44.560
exact strength of the external field at a given nucleus.

11:44.560 --> 11:49.880
You see, we started with the very unrealistic example of a collection of isolated protons

11:49.880 --> 11:54.700
with no other atoms or even electrons present in the system.

11:54.700 --> 11:58.320
The obvious difference between this model system and the ones which a chemist might

11:58.320 --> 12:03.760
want to study is that there are electron clouds and atoms of other kinds bonded to the protons

12:03.760 --> 12:06.880
that we want to analyze.

12:06.880 --> 12:13.280
And the real key to understanding how NMR gives us information lies in another phenomenon,

12:13.280 --> 12:15.920
like shielding by electrons.

12:15.920 --> 12:20.560
You see, I told a little white lie back there, at least a lie of omission.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.840
I already told you the Zeeman splitting is a function of gyromagnetic ratio and the external

12:24.840 --> 12:30.360
field strength, but what I left out was the fact that electron clouds have this interesting

12:30.360 --> 12:37.200
ability to attenuate or weaken the external field ever so slightly.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.800
Now we can think of this as a new term in the Zeeman equation in which I account for

12:41.800 --> 12:47.440
a small reduction in field strength due to the shielding of the electron cloud at that

12:47.440 --> 12:51.520
particular nucleus.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.680
Let's take a look at some examples to see if we can drive this point home.

12:54.680 --> 13:00.400
We're going to look at some hypothetical NMR spectra for four different compounds,

13:00.400 --> 13:05.240
methane, chloromethane, dichloromethane, and chloroform.

13:05.240 --> 13:10.000
So essentially what I've done here is started from methane and then slowly added one chlorine

13:10.000 --> 13:13.840
atom at a time to pick it here in green until I reach the point where I have three chlorines

13:13.840 --> 13:15.960
attached.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.600
So let's start by thinking about methane and its electron cloud.

13:20.600 --> 13:25.160
Now the electron cloud in a methane molecule is very symmetrical, isn't it?

13:25.160 --> 13:27.880
There are no particularly electronegative elements.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.160
The carbon-hydrogen bonds are essentially nonpolar.

13:31.160 --> 13:35.320
And so there really is no distortion in this electron cloud.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.800
That means that if I plot its absorption versus the applied field strength in a continuous

13:39.800 --> 13:46.800
wave NMR spectrometer, I expect that it will take a fairly high field to overcome the shielding

13:46.800 --> 13:51.520
that these protons are experiencing.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.280
But if I move along to say chloromethane, where I've replaced one of those hydrogens

13:55.280 --> 14:00.560
with a more electronegative chlorine atom, there's now a dipole within this molecule

14:00.560 --> 14:07.400
and it's pulling electrons toward the chlorine and therefore away from the remaining hydrogens.

14:07.400 --> 14:12.240
So its electron cloud may look more like this with a bit of a distortion because that chlorine

14:12.240 --> 14:15.320
is pulling some of it more towards itself.

14:15.320 --> 14:21.120
So with reduced shielding, I expect that I need a lower applied field strength to create

14:21.120 --> 14:25.160
resonance and indeed that's what I see.

14:25.160 --> 14:30.440
And this trend continues through dichloromethane which has two dipoles and therefore an electron

14:30.440 --> 14:35.800
cloud which is even more deshielded at those protons.

14:35.800 --> 14:40.640
And of course its NMR spectrum would reflect that in an even weaker applied field necessary

14:40.640 --> 14:42.280
for resonance.

14:42.280 --> 14:47.080
And finally chloroform where I have three of these dipoles has got a very, very deshielded

14:47.080 --> 14:52.440
proton which will resonate at an even lower applied field.

14:52.440 --> 14:58.320
Because of this, lower applied fields causing resonances at the, down here at the left-hand

14:58.320 --> 15:03.440
side of the spectrum, we refer to this side of the spectrum as downfield, whereas we refer

15:03.480 --> 15:08.120
to the higher field portion of the spectrum sometimes as upfield.

15:08.120 --> 15:13.960
So a more shielded hydrogen like those in methane resonates upfield, a more deshielded

15:13.960 --> 15:18.720
hydrogen like those in chloroform will resonate downfield.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.800
So the density of the electron cloud at a particular nucleus can cause its peak to shift

15:23.800 --> 15:26.160
within the NMR spectrum.

15:26.160 --> 15:31.080
So we call this phenomenon chemical shift.

15:31.080 --> 15:35.240
So we've established that protons in different chemical environments will resonate at distinct

15:35.240 --> 15:39.880
applied fields because of the effects like shielding.

15:39.880 --> 15:44.080
But what happens when a researcher in a lab across the country or across the globe tries

15:44.080 --> 15:46.800
to reproduce my experiment?

15:46.800 --> 15:51.400
What happens if his or her spectrometer produces a field strength or radio wave frequency different

15:51.400 --> 15:54.320
than mine?

15:54.320 --> 15:59.080
Well of course all shifts of all the protons will be different making comparisons somewhat

15:59.080 --> 16:00.680
difficult.

16:00.680 --> 16:04.880
So we need a method of reporting data which can be easily translated from one spectrometer

16:04.880 --> 16:06.620
to the next.

16:06.620 --> 16:14.120
We need to normalize the resonance frequencies to account for different applied field strengths.

16:14.120 --> 16:18.040
We start this process by agreeing to a reference standard.

16:18.040 --> 16:24.080
In the case of proton NMR, we use a compound called tetramethylsilane.

16:24.080 --> 16:29.160
We use this compound because the very low electronegativity of silicon pushes electrons

16:29.160 --> 16:33.680
toward the methyl groups producing a strong consistent resonance frequency which is so

16:33.680 --> 16:39.680
far up field that it rarely interferes with the signals of interest.

16:39.680 --> 16:44.120
So the differences in field needed to produce resonance in the protons of most organic molecules

16:44.120 --> 16:48.980
is just a small fraction of 1% of the total field strength.

16:48.980 --> 16:53.720
So to make the numbers more manageable, we report chemical shift in parts per million

16:53.720 --> 17:02.120
from the absolute resonance frequency of that reference compound, TMS or tetramethylsilane.

17:02.120 --> 17:08.960
So a proton resonating in a field which is 99.9999% of the strength needed to bring TMS

17:08.960 --> 17:14.760
into resonance is said to be resonating at 1.0 ppm chemical shift.

17:14.760 --> 17:21.960
A proton at 99.9998% of the field strength of TMS would be at 2.0 ppm chemical shift

17:21.960 --> 17:26.480
and so on.

17:26.480 --> 17:30.720
Treating the x-axis of my spectrum in this way not only gives me easier numbers to work

17:30.720 --> 17:35.480
with but allows me to compare data collected on one instrument with data collected on another

17:35.480 --> 17:39.680
instrument even if it uses a different magnetic field strength.

17:39.680 --> 17:46.700
So parts per million has become the standard unit for NMR spectroscopy.

17:46.700 --> 17:52.500
So we've considered the behavior of a hypothetical collection of protons in a magnetic field.

17:52.500 --> 17:57.560
We then graduated to real, albeit very simple, organic compounds like methane and its halogenated

17:57.560 --> 18:03.200
derivatives, all of which have only one type of proton in them.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.580
But what happens when a compound has more than one kind of proton?

18:07.580 --> 18:13.180
How would we expect a continuous wave NMR spectrum to look for a compound like that?

18:13.180 --> 18:15.920
Let's answer that question with an example.

18:15.920 --> 18:21.380
Let's take a look at ethyl chloride or chloroethane.

18:21.380 --> 18:26.780
Now chloroethane has two chemically distinct protons.

18:26.780 --> 18:30.700
These I've highlighted in red are adjacent to the chlorine atom and of course there are

18:30.700 --> 18:33.940
three others that are farther away.

18:33.940 --> 18:38.540
Now if I locate the resonance frequency for these two protons, I notice something very

18:38.540 --> 18:40.620
interesting has taken place.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.940
It's not a single peak.

18:42.940 --> 18:47.960
Even though these are identical and should produce a single absorption, I actually see

18:47.960 --> 18:52.480
a peak which has four distinct lobes.

18:52.480 --> 18:59.120
Now the origin of these lobes is the interaction of these two protons with their neighbors.

18:59.120 --> 19:04.120
See every proton, remember, is a small bar magnet and that means that whether they're

19:04.120 --> 19:10.480
aligned parallel to or anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field will cause them to interact

19:10.480 --> 19:13.740
differently with the adjacent protons.

19:13.740 --> 19:18.620
So if I consider the effect of these protons, which I've highlighted in blue, they can interact

19:18.620 --> 19:25.140
with the hydrogens of interest by being all spin up, there are actually three different

19:25.140 --> 19:34.140
ways that I can combine them with two spins up and one spin down and of course there will

19:34.140 --> 19:42.920
also be three potential ways to combine them with two spins down and one spin up.

19:42.920 --> 19:48.640
And the final permutation that's possible with three is to have all spin down.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.800
So in the case where all of the neighbors are spin up, they add just a little bit of

19:52.800 --> 19:58.000
magnetic field to what's experienced by those causing the signal and that means it requires

19:58.000 --> 20:03.720
just a little bit less of an applied magnetic field to cause resonance.

20:03.720 --> 20:09.300
That's why what should be, in theory, a single signal is actually split into four.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.500
So these are the source of that multiplicity.

20:12.500 --> 20:17.980
Similarly, I can look at the resonance frequency of these three hydrogens and say they must

20:17.980 --> 20:22.740
be coupled to or interacting with my red hydrogens.

20:22.740 --> 20:28.420
Now with two hydrogens interacting, I have the possibility of having them both spin up,

20:28.420 --> 20:34.760
two possibilities in which I have one up, one down, and my final possibility in which

20:34.760 --> 20:38.240
they're both spin down.

20:38.240 --> 20:44.000
So in this case, my blue hydrogens should create a resonance with three lobes.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.520
So we refer to this phenomenon as magnetic coupling and the resulting shape of the peaks

20:49.520 --> 20:53.020
as multiplets.

20:53.020 --> 20:59.080
They follow a rule known as the n plus one rule which simply states that we have n plus

20:59.080 --> 21:04.040
one lobes per multiplet where n is the number of coupled hydrogens.

21:04.040 --> 21:09.800
So my red hydrogens are coupled to three neighbors creating a peak with four lobes.

21:09.800 --> 21:15.140
My blue hydrogens are coupled to two neighbors creating a peak with three lobes.

21:15.140 --> 21:20.080
In most simple situations where we're dealing with saturated compounds with free rotation,

21:20.100 --> 21:25.540
this rule holds pretty well.

21:25.540 --> 21:29.180
So let's take a look at some multiplet features that we may see in an MR specter as we go

21:29.180 --> 21:30.180
forward.

21:30.180 --> 21:34.660
Of course the simplest where n equals one we call a doublet.

21:34.660 --> 21:38.980
When there are two coupled partners, we get what we call a triplet.

21:38.980 --> 21:43.900
Three produces a quartet and so on with four making a quintet and five making a sextet

21:43.900 --> 21:44.900
and so on.

21:44.900 --> 21:49.580
Now in many cases they become so complex around this point that we stop referring to them

21:49.580 --> 21:55.240
by their individual names and simply refer to them collectively as multiplets.

21:55.240 --> 21:59.040
Now the intensity of the lobes within the multiplet is also useful information.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.440
So we'd like to be able to predict that as well and we can.

22:02.440 --> 22:07.440
For example a doublet is always one to one whereas a triplet is one to two to one and

22:07.440 --> 22:11.680
a quartet one to three to three to one and the pattern continues, remember this is because

22:11.680 --> 22:18.080
of all the different permutations of alpha and beta spin states for the coupling partners.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.100
Now what's really great is if you forget this pattern you can easily recreate it using a

22:22.100 --> 22:25.060
geometric mnemonic.

22:25.060 --> 22:28.300
That geometric mnemonic is known as Pascal's Triangle.

22:28.300 --> 22:33.620
So we can simply create a series in which we add adjacent numbers as we go down so one

22:33.620 --> 22:38.540
plus two equals three, for example here three plus three equals six, etc.

22:38.540 --> 22:42.600
And Pascal's Triangle allows us to predict the multiplicity in any instance where we have

22:42.600 --> 22:47.720
multiple coupling partners in simple situations like these.

22:47.720 --> 22:53.740
So we're now ready to get just a small taste of the power NMR has to reveal structural

22:53.740 --> 22:54.740
information.

22:54.740 --> 23:00.620
We're going to begin with a very simple example but one which clearly shows how we can gather

23:00.620 --> 23:07.620
structural information which would not be available to us from the UV-Vis, IR or polarimetry

23:07.620 --> 23:09.780
experiments that we have covered so far.

23:09.780 --> 23:14.740
We're going to do it using a relatively simple molecule or set of molecules and that is the

23:14.760 --> 23:18.080
structural isomers of chloropropane.

23:18.080 --> 23:26.280
So let's construct some hypothetical NMR spectra for the two different isomers of chloropropane.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.200
We'll start with two chloropropane.

23:28.200 --> 23:34.080
So here I have my chlorine attached at the central atom and because of this I'm going

23:34.080 --> 23:37.880
to have a spectrum which has two different resonances.

23:37.880 --> 23:42.120
Now it's worth mentioning here I've exaggerated the multiplicities a little bit, I've spaced

23:42.120 --> 23:45.340
them out a little bit wider than you might see them in an actual spectrum so that they're

23:45.340 --> 23:51.140
easy for us to see but their position within the spectrum is accurate.

23:51.140 --> 23:56.260
So we see that there are two different kinds of protons in this two chloropropane.

23:56.260 --> 24:01.740
First there are the six methyl protons which are all exactly the same as one another.

24:01.740 --> 24:06.060
Now because they're chemically identical to one another they don't couple to each other

24:06.060 --> 24:12.060
but they do have one coupling partner in this proton right here in the center of the molecule.

24:13.000 --> 24:19.400
And it has its own resonance which is split by its six non-equivalent neighbors.

24:19.400 --> 24:24.640
So just as we would expect from our previous discussions on multiplicity we have a very

24:24.640 --> 24:30.600
large doublet which corresponds to these six hydrogens highlighted in blue and a relatively

24:30.600 --> 24:37.320
small multiplet produced by this single hydrogen which is split by many coupling partners.

24:37.320 --> 24:41.960
Now if we take a closer look we can see the multiplicity is exactly as we would predict

24:41.980 --> 24:50.100
using Pascal's Triangle and that this is actually a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and plus 1 right this is

24:50.100 --> 24:51.660
a septet.

24:51.660 --> 24:58.340
So our septet at 3.7 parts per million tells us we have a proton with many coupling partners

24:58.340 --> 25:04.740
very close to an electron withdrawing group and our doublet at 1.1 parts per million tells

25:04.740 --> 25:09.940
us that we have some protons which have a single coupling partner and that those protons

25:09.940 --> 25:16.520
are farther away from the electron withdrawing group because they resonate upfield.

25:16.520 --> 25:21.780
So how can we use this spectrum in comparison to say one chloropropane and distinguish between

25:21.780 --> 25:24.540
these two compounds?

25:24.540 --> 25:27.980
Let's take a look at one chloropropane right now.

25:27.980 --> 25:32.300
So when I put my chlorine at the end of the molecule rather than in the center it has

25:32.300 --> 25:38.260
very important and profound effect on the number of resonances that I see.

25:38.260 --> 25:41.380
My spectrum is a little bit more complicated now isn't it?

25:41.380 --> 25:45.600
That's because by placing the chlorine at the end I've created three distinct chemical

25:45.600 --> 25:48.480
environments for the protons in the molecule.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.900
Those that are directly on the carbon bearing the chlorine, those one bond away and those

25:52.900 --> 25:55.100
that are two bonds away.

25:55.100 --> 26:00.760
So I expect to see three distinct resonances which I do but not only that their multiplicities

26:00.760 --> 26:04.240
are different than those in my previous example.

26:04.240 --> 26:11.000
So in this case I have a triplet that is way upfield which tells me I've got some hydrogens

26:11.000 --> 26:17.340
that are very far away from any electron withdrawing groups and have two non-equivalent neighbors

26:17.340 --> 26:20.960
to which they are magnetically coupled.

26:20.960 --> 26:25.560
I also have a little bit more complicated multiplet here.

26:25.560 --> 26:31.920
This one would be called a sexted and that tells me that I've got some protons which

26:31.920 --> 26:38.800
are a little bit closer to the electron withdrawing group and are coupled to five distinct partners.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.160
One, two, three, four, five.

26:43.160 --> 26:48.760
Finally I have another triplet which is farther downfield telling me that I must have some

26:48.760 --> 26:52.640
protons that are very close to the electron withdrawing chlorine and are coupled to two

26:52.640 --> 26:57.880
partners which is a perfect description of these two protons highlighted in red coupled

26:57.880 --> 27:02.120
to their neighbors in blue.

27:02.120 --> 27:08.880
So this spectrum having a triplet at .8, a sexted at 1.6 and another triplet at 3.3 allows

27:08.880 --> 27:15.640
me to very clearly and unambiguously assign that it's one chloropropane.

27:15.640 --> 27:19.600
So let's review the material from this lecture.

27:19.600 --> 27:26.080
We started by considering a property of atomic nuclei known as spin and how certain isotopes

27:26.080 --> 27:31.280
of certain atoms have a spin of one half, giving them two possible spin states when

27:31.280 --> 27:34.160
an external magnetic field is applied.

27:34.160 --> 27:39.280
There's the low energy parallel state called alpha and the high energy anti-parallel state

27:39.280 --> 27:43.040
called beta.

27:43.040 --> 27:48.000
We discussed how the energy difference between these states known as the Zeeman splitting

27:48.000 --> 27:53.360
corresponds to the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum and is proportional

27:53.360 --> 27:59.920
to the strength of the magnetic field with which the nuclei are aligning themselves.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.680
We took a look at the design of early spectrometers in which a continuous radio frequency wave

28:04.680 --> 28:09.620
is shined on a sample as the strength of an applied field is varied until resonance is

28:09.620 --> 28:15.240
achieved resulting in an absorption of the radio wave.

28:15.240 --> 28:19.800
We then looked at how the shielding and induced fields provided by electrons can cause the

28:19.800 --> 28:24.800
magnetic field at protons within a molecule to be slightly different, leading us to the

28:24.800 --> 28:27.960
calculations of chemical shift.

28:27.960 --> 28:34.460
Finally, we discussed the phenomenon of magnetic spin-spin coupling in which non-equivalent

28:34.460 --> 28:39.600
nuclei which are three bonds away from one another can share magnetization splitting

28:39.600 --> 28:46.000
resonances into a set of lobes called a multiplet.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.220
Next time, we'll take our discussion into the new millennium and look at what is known

28:50.220 --> 28:53.160
as pulsed or Fourier transform NMR.

28:53.160 --> 28:58.240
We'll also take a brief look at a few other techniques used to characterize molecules,

28:58.240 --> 29:02.320
specifically x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.960
I'll see you for that discussion next time.
