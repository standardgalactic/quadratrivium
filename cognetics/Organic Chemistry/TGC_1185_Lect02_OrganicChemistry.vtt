00:00.000 --> 00:18.400
Chemical bonds form the basis for not only organic chemistry, but indeed for all of chemistry.

00:18.400 --> 00:23.840
And as we saw last time, just how important bonding is in determining the chemical properties

00:23.840 --> 00:26.040
of elements.

00:26.040 --> 00:32.080
So with the cosmos consisting of fewer than 100 naturally occurring elements, lack of

00:32.080 --> 00:37.080
a way to bond multiple atoms of those elements together to create more complex materials

00:37.080 --> 00:39.280
would lead to a pretty dull universe.

00:39.280 --> 00:44.560
Now, fortunately for us, chemical bonding provides a way to take relatively simple

00:44.560 --> 00:51.080
atom and combine it with other atoms, thereby creating a set of combinations so vast that

00:51.080 --> 00:55.280
it's virtually infinite.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.960
Bonding is, in fact, much more than just a way to connect atoms together.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.320
Bonding has a way of changing atoms themselves in ways which alter their physical properties

01:04.320 --> 01:11.560
and reactivity, and it can do so so profoundly that many materials of identical atomic composition

01:11.560 --> 01:15.000
have drastically different chemical and physical properties.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.880
Let's take the example of carbon, the star of our show.

01:18.880 --> 01:25.240
Now, carbon atoms are so keen to bond to other atoms that atomic carbon is essentially unheard

01:25.520 --> 01:29.400
of under the conditions we experience here on Earth.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.520
And even when pure, a sample of carbon will take on one of several different bonding schemes,

01:34.520 --> 01:40.720
which lead to some very familiar but strikingly different materials from our everyday lives.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.040
This is graphite.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.680
It's the principal component of bituminous coal, valued for its softness, giving it the

01:47.680 --> 01:50.280
properties of a good lubricant.

01:50.280 --> 01:55.040
It also makes up the lead in modern pencils, which isn't really lead at all.

01:55.040 --> 02:00.800
It consists of pure carbon in a bonding arrangement which looks like this.

02:00.800 --> 02:05.320
It consists of vast sheets of carbon atoms bonded together along a plane.

02:05.320 --> 02:09.040
Now, take a look at this sample of carbon.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.080
This familiar form of carbon is diamond.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.960
And diamond is famous for its clarity and its hardness, exactly the opposite from graphite,

02:17.960 --> 02:20.880
which is valued for being dark and soft.

02:21.440 --> 02:25.880
Now, diamond gets these properties not because its composition is any different.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.960
They're both pure carbon.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.440
It gets the different properties because of the nature of the bonds holding the atoms

02:32.440 --> 02:33.440
together.

02:33.440 --> 02:38.480
Now, we call materials like these, these samples of pure elements, which differ only by the

02:38.480 --> 02:42.680
way in which their atoms are bonded, allotropes.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.920
And these two allotropes of carbon offer a clear example of just how critical it is

02:46.920 --> 02:53.280
to understand chemical bonding in order to understand how organic compounds will behave.

02:53.280 --> 02:59.320
So, let's investigate exactly why and how atoms bond to one another, and see if we can't

02:59.320 --> 03:04.320
explain why graphite and diamond have such drastically different properties, even though

03:04.320 --> 03:08.440
they're made up of exactly the same types of atoms.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.120
So let's take a look at an atom.

03:14.720 --> 03:22.040
Now, atoms are comprised of three types of subatomic particles, positively charged protons,

03:22.040 --> 03:27.800
uncharged neutrons, and negatively charged electrons.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.440
Niels Bohr is most famous for many of his scientific accomplishments, but the most notable is his

03:32.440 --> 03:39.560
model of the atom, in which a dense, positively charged nucleus containing protons and neutrons

03:39.640 --> 03:46.680
is surrounded by a cloud of very small, fast-moving electrons carrying negative charges.

03:46.680 --> 03:51.960
Now, each of these three particles plays a role in the properties of a given atom.

03:51.960 --> 03:57.120
So most of us have seen cartoon representations, which look like the one I have here.

03:57.120 --> 04:02.000
But in truth, the relative positions of the particles in this particular model are accurate.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.280
The scale has been drastically distorted to make the system easier for us to view.

04:07.720 --> 04:13.480
Now, in reality, if the electron cloud were the size I've represented here, the nucleus

04:13.480 --> 04:19.760
itself would only be about 40 microns wide, about the size of a dust mite, a little bit

04:19.760 --> 04:22.520
smaller than the width of a human hair.

04:22.520 --> 04:28.280
Now, instead, let's bring that nucleus back to the scale that we used today.

04:28.280 --> 04:34.520
If I use this nucleus as my scale, the electron cloud surrounding it is going to be several

04:34.520 --> 04:36.360
kilometers wide.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.680
OK, so let's go back to our representation, the way that it was, so that we can study

04:40.680 --> 04:42.680
these different parts of the atom.

04:42.680 --> 04:48.280
Now, protons in the center provide the atom with its identity.

04:48.280 --> 04:52.640
Our example here is a nucleus with six protons, so this would be a carbon atom.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.080
Regardless of the number of other subatomic particles in the structure, the nucleus with

04:57.080 --> 05:01.360
six protons will always be carbon.

05:01.360 --> 05:07.000
The green neutrons that accompany those protons at the center of the atom do not alter its

05:07.000 --> 05:08.400
identity.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.960
So our example here has a carbon atom with six neutrons.

05:11.960 --> 05:17.680
So this would be an isotope of carbon, which we call carbon 12.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.840
But if I add an extra neutron to the nucleus, I still have carbon, but it's got a little

05:22.840 --> 05:27.600
bit more mass, and we call this carbon 13.

05:27.600 --> 05:33.240
If I add yet another neutron, still carbon, but now it's carbon 14.

05:33.240 --> 05:39.040
So we call these combinations of neutrons that can accompany a specific number of protons

05:39.040 --> 05:42.240
in the nucleus isotopes.

05:42.240 --> 05:47.040
So neutrons have their place in organic chemistry, but it's really not in today's lecture, because

05:47.040 --> 05:52.640
they don't have a tendency to affect the chemical properties of elements very strongly.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.920
So we're going to concentrate more on protons and electrons for the rest of the day.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.200
So let's get on to the electrons now.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.460
Electrons most directly affect the charge of an atom, and in order for this atom here

06:04.460 --> 06:10.560
to be neutral, we have to have the same number of electrons as we do protons.

06:10.560 --> 06:16.760
So our central nucleus has six protons giving it a positive charge of six.

06:16.760 --> 06:23.000
Therefore our electron cloud must have six electrons as well to create a neutral atom.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.560
And when the number of electrons in the cloud is not equal to the number of protons, we'll

06:27.560 --> 06:33.960
have a charged species resulting from that, and we call these charged species ions.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.200
So if I were to add an extra electron to my atom here, I now have seven electrons and

06:39.200 --> 06:46.280
six protons, meaning I'll have a negatively charged species, which we call an anion.

06:46.280 --> 06:52.000
If instead I remove two electrons, so now I have my original six protons and only five

06:52.000 --> 06:58.560
electrons, I form something called a cation, which carries a positive charge.

06:58.560 --> 07:03.200
Now as the discrepancy in the population of electrons and protons grows, so does the

07:03.200 --> 07:05.520
charge in the ion.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.080
For example, a carbon atom with seven electrons in its cloud would have a net charge of negative

07:09.080 --> 07:13.880
one, and a carbon atom if it could have eight electrons in its cloud would have a charge

07:13.880 --> 07:17.600
of negative two, etc.

07:17.600 --> 07:22.640
Now what I'd like to focus on now is what made Bohr's model truly unique when compared

07:22.640 --> 07:24.840
to its predecessors.

07:24.840 --> 07:29.760
And this is that Bohr's model was the first to suggest that electrons are not spread evenly

07:29.760 --> 07:34.240
through the volume of an atom, but rather that they only made up the outer portion of

07:34.240 --> 07:36.480
the atom.

07:36.480 --> 07:42.360
Now furthermore, he suggested that there are distinct energy levels around the nucleus,

07:42.360 --> 07:46.120
each of which can only hold a finite number of those electrons.

07:46.120 --> 07:51.320
And they fill sequentially from the smallest to the largest.

07:51.320 --> 07:56.320
He also postulated that each energy level was divided into specific volumes which could

07:56.320 --> 08:02.320
only hold two electrons each, and we call those volumes orbitals.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.560
Now as we'll often do for clarity in this course, we'll concern ourselves only with

08:06.560 --> 08:10.360
the first three rows of the periodic table.

08:10.360 --> 08:15.280
So when we apply this constraint, we see that there are three rows in the table, each of

08:15.280 --> 08:21.280
which represents the filling of a different energy level by those electrons.

08:21.280 --> 08:25.880
Now if we limit ourselves to neutral atoms, meaning the addition of electrons must match

08:25.880 --> 08:31.080
the rate at which we add the protons, each of the first three rows of the periodic table

08:31.080 --> 08:35.080
represents the filling of those different energy levels.

08:35.080 --> 08:40.120
Since energy levels fill from lower to higher, only the highest energy level in any atom

08:40.120 --> 08:42.160
can be unfilled.

08:42.160 --> 08:46.240
We call that outermost energy level the valence shell.

08:46.240 --> 08:52.240
So let's begin constructing an atom by adding protons and electrons to our hypothetical atom.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.520
One pair at a time, tracking our progress through the periodic table.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.320
Our first pair gives us a hydrogen atom.

08:59.320 --> 09:04.200
Now obviously the first energy level will be the valence shell for this atom.

09:04.200 --> 09:08.020
Currently it has one electron in that first level.

09:08.020 --> 09:14.620
With the addition of a second pair, another proton and another electron takes us to helium.

09:14.620 --> 09:18.660
Now helium has two electrons in the first energy level, so the first energy level is

09:18.660 --> 09:21.900
still the valence shell.

09:21.900 --> 09:27.620
But as we prepare to continue, we notice that the first energy level is completely filled.

09:27.620 --> 09:32.460
So the third electron has to be placed in the second energy level.

09:32.460 --> 09:35.860
So now we've begun a new row in the periodic table.

09:35.860 --> 09:40.620
A row of elements with their valence shell in the second energy level.

09:40.620 --> 09:45.300
Now the second energy level is much larger than the first, so it can hold as many as

09:45.300 --> 09:47.220
eight electrons.

09:47.220 --> 09:58.700
So as we progress through beryllium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon, we see

09:58.700 --> 10:01.580
that the same energy level is being populated.

10:02.580 --> 10:06.740
And as we round out our trip through the first three rows, we begin populating the third

10:06.740 --> 10:12.220
energy level, which can also hold only eight electrons.

10:12.220 --> 10:21.740
Now the filling of this energy level comprises sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus,

10:21.740 --> 10:26.220
sulfur, chlorine, and argon.

10:26.220 --> 10:30.860
Now in truth, the third energy level can hold even more electrons, but it's usually

10:30.860 --> 10:35.420
just these eight which are of interest to us in introductory organic chemistry courses.

10:35.420 --> 10:39.420
So we're going to stop populating our periodic table there.

10:39.420 --> 10:44.700
So what is it about the structure of atoms, which really drives chemical bonds to form?

10:44.700 --> 10:50.220
And why is it that there's a periodic trend in the number of bonds atoms tend to form?

10:50.220 --> 10:54.380
Now the answer to these questions is deeply rooted in a concept which we'll visit time

10:54.380 --> 10:58.580
and time again in this course, a concept called free energy.

11:01.700 --> 11:06.220
The free energy of a substance is simply a measure of its stability.

11:06.220 --> 11:11.420
It tells us something about how much potential the system has to do work.

11:11.420 --> 11:16.020
And just as physical processes tend toward lower energy states, like a ball rolling down

11:16.020 --> 11:22.220
a hill, or heat transferring from a hot radiator into a cold room, it's the more stable states

11:22.220 --> 11:26.620
of matter which will tend to form in chemical processes as well.

11:26.620 --> 11:31.900
Now this concept was developed by American chemist Willard Gibbs in the late 1800s.

11:31.900 --> 11:36.940
And Gibbs modeled the free energy of a system as a function of two important factors.

11:36.940 --> 11:41.980
So let's take a look at a process which will actually allow us to demonstrate how these

11:41.980 --> 11:43.220
factors push a reaction.

11:43.220 --> 11:48.180
And I'm going to start with an organic compound with which most of us are familiar.

11:48.180 --> 11:53.300
This is a molecule of propane, the type of which you might find in a backyard grill.

11:53.300 --> 11:56.780
So you probably didn't think that you were doing organic chemistry the last time you

11:56.780 --> 12:01.420
grilled a steak on your patio, but the truth is actually something different.

12:01.420 --> 12:05.300
You see, propane can react with oxygen.

12:05.300 --> 12:10.340
And when one molecule of propane reacts with five molecules of oxygen gas, it produces a

12:10.340 --> 12:12.220
few things.

12:12.220 --> 12:15.480
First it produces carbon dioxide.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.500
It also produces a little bit of water.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.420
But it also produces something else.

12:21.420 --> 12:24.780
In fact, what we're after is not the carbon dioxide or the water.

12:24.780 --> 12:30.020
When we start our barbecue grill, what we're after is another byproduct of the reaction,

12:30.020 --> 12:32.020
heat.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.100
Now chemists have a different name for this.

12:34.100 --> 12:39.460
We call it enthalpy, and we represent it with the letter H.

12:39.460 --> 12:44.220
We can determine the approximate enthalpy change during a reaction simply by taking an

12:44.220 --> 12:50.760
inventory of all the bonds broken and all the bonds formed in our reaction.

12:50.760 --> 12:56.280
So in the case of reacting propane with oxygen in what we call a combustion reaction, the

12:56.280 --> 13:01.480
breaking of two carbon-carbon single bonds, eight carbon-hydrogen single bonds, and five

13:01.480 --> 13:08.540
oxygen-oxygen double bonds actually releases more energy than the formation of six carbon-oxygen

13:08.540 --> 13:12.360
double bonds and eight hydrogen-oxygen single bonds.

13:12.360 --> 13:17.440
So we can use this bond inventory to predict that this reaction should generate heat.

13:17.440 --> 13:22.080
Now the second byproduct of this reaction is randomness, and this is something you may

13:22.080 --> 13:25.280
not have thought of quite as much before.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.880
Think about this as being the exhaust from the burning of the propane.

13:28.880 --> 13:34.440
Now you'll notice that I've converted one molecule of propane, five molecules of oxygen

13:34.440 --> 13:39.880
into three molecules of carbon dioxide, and four molecules of water.

13:39.880 --> 13:45.400
So I've increased the randomness, or what chemists call entropy of the system, because

13:45.400 --> 13:51.800
I've turned six molecules of gas into seven, so I'm making larger quantities of smaller

13:51.800 --> 13:54.840
molecules throughout my reaction.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.520
It is these parameters, the enthalpy and the entropy of a reaction, which we can use to

13:59.520 --> 14:02.560
estimate the driving force behind the process.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.520
So let's take a look at how we actually do this.

14:05.520 --> 14:10.480
The Gibbs free energy equation for any system at any state is simple.

14:10.480 --> 14:16.680
The Gibbs free energy is equal to the enthalpy of that system minus the absolute temperature

14:16.680 --> 14:23.600
at which that system currently rests, so this would be temperature in Kelvin's, multiplied

14:23.600 --> 14:28.880
by the total entropy for that system in a given state.

14:28.880 --> 14:33.760
Now the problem with this is that we don't actually know this number.

14:33.760 --> 14:39.960
We can't calculate absolute entropies or absolute enthalpies for a given system.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.520
But remember that chemical reactions are all about change.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.120
There's an initial state and a final state, and it's the difference in the free energy

14:47.120 --> 14:51.020
between those two that really matters.

14:51.020 --> 14:56.600
So if I take the Gibbs energy equation for the final state of a reaction and the Gibbs

14:56.600 --> 15:02.720
energy equation for the initial state of the materials in my reaction, I can simply subtract

15:02.720 --> 15:08.960
one from the other, and this gives me a more usable equation in the form of the difference

15:08.960 --> 15:13.760
in free energies, equaling the difference in enthalpies, minus the absolute temperature

15:13.760 --> 15:16.600
times the difference in entropies.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.640
Now this is a long equation with a lot of letters, so chemists like to shorten it by

15:20.640 --> 15:24.360
using the Greek symbol delta to represent change.

15:24.360 --> 15:29.000
And when we do this, we get the familiar form of the Gibbs free energy equation.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.560
Delta G equals delta H minus T delta S.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.520
Okay so that's enough math for a moment.

15:34.520 --> 15:38.080
Let's apply this to the system that we looked at earlier.

15:38.080 --> 15:43.600
Remember we took propane and reacted it with five equivalents of oxygen to produce seven

15:43.600 --> 15:47.040
equivalents of exhaust gases or products.

15:47.040 --> 15:52.560
And in doing so we create some heat, we increase the randomness of the system.

15:52.560 --> 15:57.880
So in this case, because it releases heat, the system's energy has gone down.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.400
So the sign of my enthalpy change will be negative.

16:02.400 --> 16:07.100
And because I've increased randomness, the delta S term of my equation will necessarily

16:07.100 --> 16:08.660
be positive.

16:08.660 --> 16:13.220
So in this case, I've got an equation where my free energy change is equal to a negative

16:13.220 --> 16:16.620
number minus a positive number.

16:16.620 --> 16:20.660
In other words, delta G has to be negative for this process.

16:20.660 --> 16:26.460
So reactions which trend in this fashion, releasing heat and increasing randomness, tend to be

16:26.460 --> 16:29.540
what we call spontaneous.

16:29.540 --> 16:34.260
Now spontaneous is a little bit different than the term that we use colloquially.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.420
When chemists talk about spontaneous processes, we're talking about a process which is favored

16:38.420 --> 16:42.980
simply because the energy of the products is lower.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.740
Now we can think of that as a situation where a reaction is going downhill.

16:46.740 --> 16:52.380
So don't let this name fool you because sometimes the term spontaneous invokes thoughts of speed.

16:52.380 --> 16:57.540
But here we're using it to mean proceeding without any outside perturbation.

16:57.540 --> 17:01.540
So a spontaneous reaction will eventually happen on its own.

17:01.540 --> 17:03.340
But it may not happen at all.

17:03.340 --> 17:07.780
For example, ordinary temperatures and pressures, the conversion of diamond into graphite is

17:07.780 --> 17:10.100
actually spontaneous.

17:10.100 --> 17:14.180
But thankfully, it takes geologic time scales for this to occur.

17:14.180 --> 17:21.700
So on the time scale of a human lifetime, your diamond jewelry is safe.

17:21.700 --> 17:27.620
So one can easily guess that entropy or disorder, it's not on the side of chemical bonding.

17:27.620 --> 17:31.660
So bonds attach freely moving atoms into higher order structures.

17:31.660 --> 17:36.180
So there's an entropic penalty for bonding which must be overcome somehow if we expect

17:36.180 --> 17:38.700
a bond to form at all.

17:38.700 --> 17:43.700
So the key to chemical bonding is its effect on the enthalpy of a system, or the energy

17:43.700 --> 17:46.660
released when a bond forms.

17:46.660 --> 17:51.940
If this process of fixing atoms in space relative to one another is going to be spontaneous,

17:51.940 --> 17:58.100
there must be something about the linkage which lowers the chemical potential energy.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.620
But what's the driving force?

18:00.620 --> 18:05.580
Well, the answer to that question is the octet rule.

18:05.580 --> 18:10.540
An observation first made by Irving Langmuir in 1919.

18:10.540 --> 18:14.820
He noted that atoms of smaller elements seem to have an unusual stability when the outermost

18:14.820 --> 18:19.140
energy level of their electron cloud was filled with electrons.

18:20.100 --> 18:25.100
Now octet rule might be a somewhat unfortunate choice of a name since it creates the conundrum

18:25.100 --> 18:30.220
that the first principle energy level can only hold two electrons, not eight.

18:30.220 --> 18:34.300
But the general spirit of the rule holds even for that energy level.

18:34.300 --> 18:40.340
Having a full outer energy level, or valence shell, lowers the energy of an atom.

18:40.340 --> 18:45.300
So you probably noticed in our previous discussion on energy levels in the electron clouds that

18:45.300 --> 18:52.780
only helium, neon, and argon naturally have these completely filled outer energy levels.

18:52.780 --> 18:59.300
This makes helium, neon, and argon particularly stable and unreactive, earning this column

18:59.300 --> 19:03.980
of the periodic table the moniker noble gases.

19:03.980 --> 19:08.540
But of our first 18 elements, only three of them have a naturally filled valence shell

19:08.540 --> 19:11.860
when they're isolated neutral atoms.

19:11.860 --> 19:16.900
So how is it that the atoms of other elements under consideration today can achieve a similar

19:16.900 --> 19:17.900
condition?

19:17.900 --> 19:21.780
And the answer to that question is chemical bonding.

19:21.780 --> 19:28.460
Now so far we've established that very few elements in their isolated, neutral state

19:28.460 --> 19:30.780
naturally have filled outer energy levels.

19:30.780 --> 19:35.660
And we've also noted that having such a filled outer energy level lends extra stability to

19:35.660 --> 19:37.300
atoms.

19:37.300 --> 19:42.120
So all other atoms aspire to have the electron configuration of a noble gas, and we call

19:42.120 --> 19:45.380
this tendency the octet rule.

19:45.380 --> 19:49.660
I've already mentioned that the most available method for atoms to create that full valence

19:49.660 --> 19:51.340
shell is a bond.

19:51.340 --> 19:53.220
But what is bonding?

19:53.220 --> 19:58.940
Well, chemical bonding, simply defined, is an energetically beneficial interaction between

19:58.940 --> 20:05.420
atoms which requires them to maintain a specific distance from one another in space.

20:05.420 --> 20:09.900
Bonds are so small, and when bonded, the distance is between them so short that a special unit

20:09.900 --> 20:13.100
of distance has to be created, called an angstrom.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.540
And we use this unit of distance to measure bond length.

20:16.540 --> 20:20.980
It's about one ten billionth of a meter.

20:20.980 --> 20:25.860
In introductory chemistry courses, we often teach that there are two kinds of bonds, ionic

20:25.860 --> 20:27.860
and covalent.

20:27.860 --> 20:32.780
But the truth is that there's a continuum of bonds, with ionic at one extreme and covalent

20:32.780 --> 20:34.580
at the other.

20:34.580 --> 20:39.180
And these two modes of bonding are distinct, but both are driven by the same drive for

20:39.180 --> 20:42.420
atoms to obtain that full valence shell.

20:42.420 --> 20:49.220
And the easiest way to understand this continuum of bonds is to first discuss the extremes.

20:49.220 --> 20:55.620
Ionic bonding occurs when atoms of significantly different electro-negativity come together.

20:55.620 --> 21:01.140
Simply put, electronegativity is a measure of how hungry an atom is for electrons.

21:02.140 --> 21:07.100
And in general, if we neglect the noble gases, electronegativity increases as we move from

21:07.100 --> 21:12.100
left to right across the periodic table, because the nuclei of atoms are becoming increasingly

21:12.100 --> 21:15.740
positively charged.

21:15.740 --> 21:19.620
Electronegativity also increases from bottom to top of the periodic table, because the

21:19.620 --> 21:24.620
electron clouds are becoming smaller, screening the nucleus from the outermost electrons the

21:24.620 --> 21:26.620
least.

21:27.620 --> 21:32.300
For example, fluorine is the most electronegative of all elements, because within the second

21:32.300 --> 21:36.300
row it has the most positively charged nucleus with nine protons.

21:36.300 --> 21:40.580
And because it's small electron cloud with only two energy levels, makes the positively

21:40.580 --> 21:45.060
charged nucleus better able to attract that extra electron.

21:45.060 --> 21:49.820
If we move down and across our small portion of the periodic table, at the opposite end

21:49.820 --> 21:56.100
we find sodium, which has just one weakly held electron in its outermost energy level.

21:56.100 --> 22:00.060
This means that sodium is instead very eager to give up an electron.

22:00.060 --> 22:05.180
And we call sodium either very electropositive or not very electronegative.

22:05.180 --> 22:06.940
Either description works.

22:06.940 --> 22:11.980
The combination of these two elements leads to a classic example of an ionic bond.

22:11.980 --> 22:16.500
An atom of sodium having just one electron in its outermost energy level gives up that

22:16.500 --> 22:21.020
electron to achieve a full outer energy level.

22:21.020 --> 22:25.740
And fluorine, on the other hand, having seven electrons in its outer energy level, needs

22:25.780 --> 22:28.140
to gain one to achieve an octet.

22:28.140 --> 22:32.820
And adding one more gives it eight electrons in its valence shell.

22:32.820 --> 22:37.300
So if sodium is very electropositive and needs to lose the electron to achieve an octet,

22:37.300 --> 22:41.780
the fluorine is very electronegative, needs to gain an electron to achieve an octet, it

22:41.780 --> 22:45.340
seems obvious that the two can strike a deal.

22:45.340 --> 22:49.780
The unwanted electron from sodium is fully transferred to the fluorine, giving both an

22:49.780 --> 22:54.420
octet, but also ionizing them in the process.

22:54.420 --> 22:57.740
So sodium now has a charge of plus one.

22:57.740 --> 23:00.340
And fluorine now has a charge of minus one.

23:00.340 --> 23:05.260
And it's the electrostatic attraction between these two ions, which holds them together.

23:05.260 --> 23:10.140
And we call this ionic bonding.

23:10.140 --> 23:14.020
The alternative end of the bonding spectrum is the covalent bond.

23:14.020 --> 23:19.100
When we pair two atoms of very similar electronegativity, neither is particularly willing to exchange

23:19.100 --> 23:21.740
electrons with the other.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.740
There are two atoms of fluorine.

23:23.740 --> 23:29.740
With equal electronegativity, neither is willing to donate an electron to form an ionic bond.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.900
But there is a second solution to the problem.

23:32.900 --> 23:36.580
The sharing of electrons rather than the transfer.

23:36.580 --> 23:40.140
So if the two fluorine atoms come together in an arrangement in space which allows them

23:40.140 --> 23:45.580
to share one extra electron each, each atom has been fooled into thinking it has its own

23:45.580 --> 23:46.940
octet.

23:46.940 --> 23:51.820
And this is the driving force behind covalent bonding.

23:51.820 --> 23:55.100
But the complexity of electron sharing doesn't stop there.

23:55.100 --> 24:00.300
Two oxygen atoms, for example, must each donate two electrons to a bond, joining these atoms

24:00.300 --> 24:02.560
in an oxygen molecule.

24:02.560 --> 24:08.140
We call this arrangement a double bond, since two pairs of electrons are shared.

24:08.140 --> 24:12.780
So now that we understand the process by which fully ionic and fully covalent bonds help

24:12.780 --> 24:18.180
atoms to satisfy their octets, let's turn our attention back to that continuum of bonds

24:18.180 --> 24:19.860
that I mentioned earlier.

24:19.860 --> 24:24.260
Naturally, oxygen atoms need not bond only to other oxygen atoms.

24:24.260 --> 24:29.600
We can instead envision a system in which an oxygen atom satisfies its octet by bonding

24:29.600 --> 24:33.220
covalently to two hydrogen atoms.

24:33.220 --> 24:38.860
In this case, we've bonded a more electronegative oxygen to a less electronegative hydrogen

24:38.860 --> 24:40.380
atom.

24:40.380 --> 24:43.940
And the electronegativities of each are not as drastically different as in our sodium

24:43.940 --> 24:50.740
fluoride example, but they're not exactly the same as in our example of oxygen gas either.

24:50.740 --> 24:55.300
So we expect sharing to take place, but the sharing is unequal, meaning that the bonding

24:55.300 --> 25:01.500
electrons spend more time in the proximity of the more electronegative oxygen atom.

25:01.500 --> 25:06.140
The result of this is what we call a polar covalent bond, which gives water its high

25:06.140 --> 25:09.740
polarity among common solvents.

25:09.740 --> 25:13.180
As the course progresses, we'll see many examples in which the relative polarity of

25:13.180 --> 25:16.860
bonds is the driving factor in chemical reactions.

25:16.860 --> 25:21.580
So it's important to understand this type of bonding early in the course.

25:21.580 --> 25:25.500
In the previous section, we concerned ourselves only with the principal energy levels of an

25:25.500 --> 25:29.620
atom's electron cloud and how they affect the bonding behavior of different pairs of

25:29.620 --> 25:31.740
atoms.

25:31.740 --> 25:36.160
But the representation that we used to show the relative energy of electrons didn't really

25:36.160 --> 25:41.160
convey their true positions around the atom, just their approximate energies.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.680
Simply put, our diagrams conveyed the energetics of bonding, but didn't finish the story by

25:45.680 --> 25:51.000
telling us about the spatial arrangement of those bonds about the central atom.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.440
To understand this geometry of bonding, we need to invoke one more fundamental component

25:55.440 --> 25:59.880
of atomic structure, atomic orbitals.

25:59.880 --> 26:03.360
You see, all valence electrons are not equal.

26:03.360 --> 26:07.480
There's more to defining the orbits of electrons than just the principal energy level in which

26:07.480 --> 26:09.960
they reside.

26:09.960 --> 26:14.520
In order to show the specific volume of space in which each electron resides within an energy

26:14.520 --> 26:21.400
level, we have to introduce a second level of organization, atomic orbitals.

26:21.400 --> 26:25.400
Once again, we're graced by the simplifying fact that our discussion only entails the

26:25.400 --> 26:30.080
first three rows of the periodic table, through which relatively simple progressions of atomic

26:30.080 --> 26:32.080
structure evolve.

26:33.080 --> 26:37.680
Now, all energy levels contain a single S orbital.

26:37.680 --> 26:42.320
And S orbitals are spherical in shape, and increase in size with increasing principal

26:42.320 --> 26:44.280
energy level.

26:44.280 --> 26:48.360
This is to say that the one S orbital is smaller than the two S, which again is smaller than

26:48.360 --> 26:51.360
the three S.

26:51.360 --> 26:56.760
And since each S orbital can only hold two electrons, the remaining six electrons, from

26:56.760 --> 27:01.720
the second and third principal energy levels, have to find another home.

27:01.720 --> 27:07.040
And they do this in an array of three distinct P orbitals per level.

27:07.040 --> 27:14.240
Now, just like S orbitals, P orbitals increase in size with increasing principal energy level.

27:14.240 --> 27:19.560
But unlike S orbitals, P orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell, with a node at the nucleus

27:19.560 --> 27:21.080
of the atom.

27:21.080 --> 27:26.080
So if we were to plot out the energy of all the atomic orbitals in argon, the largest of

27:26.080 --> 27:31.200
the atoms under consideration today, we would see something like this.

27:31.200 --> 27:39.880
This would be a one S2, two S2, two P6, three S2, three P6 configuration.

27:39.880 --> 27:44.120
Now notice that all three P orbitals of any given energy level are slightly higher in

27:44.120 --> 27:49.760
energy than the corresponding S orbital, but equal in energy to one another.

27:49.760 --> 27:54.840
Now chemists use the word degenerate to describe energetically equivalent orbitals like these

27:54.840 --> 27:56.280
groups of P orbitals.

27:56.400 --> 28:01.360
So I'll be using this word from time to time as well.

28:01.360 --> 28:06.640
And now that we understand the size and shape of atomic orbitals, we can begin to understand

28:06.640 --> 28:12.200
how these regions of space can overlap to produce new covalent bonds.

28:12.200 --> 28:16.720
The two major classes of covalent bonds pervade the science of organic chemistry, and we

28:16.720 --> 28:20.600
call these classes sigma bonds and pi bonds.

28:20.880 --> 28:26.840
Sigma bonds form whenever orbitals overlap along the internuclear axis, such as two esatomic

28:26.840 --> 28:29.640
orbitals overlapping.

28:29.640 --> 28:33.800
Atoms with available P orbitals can also accomplish this type of bonding by overlapping one lobe

28:33.800 --> 28:36.480
of a P orbital.

28:36.480 --> 28:41.440
Placing electron density directly between the two positively charged nuclei screens

28:41.440 --> 28:45.600
them from repelling one another, creating a very strong bond.

28:45.600 --> 28:50.520
In fact, sigma bonds are so stable that they're always the first type of bond to form between

28:50.520 --> 28:52.560
two atoms.

28:52.560 --> 28:57.320
It does, however, create a bond around which the attached atoms can spin, like the axle

28:57.320 --> 29:03.680
of a vehicle, giving these bonds what chemists call free rotation.

29:03.680 --> 29:08.840
But pi bonds, on the other hand, form when P atomic orbitals overlap in a side-to-side

29:08.840 --> 29:12.320
fashion as shown here.

29:12.320 --> 29:17.520
Now notice that there's no electron density along that internuclear axis, but rather above

29:17.520 --> 29:20.720
and below the bonded atoms.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.240
This makes pi bonds a little bit weaker than sigma bonds, but also gives them some very

29:25.240 --> 29:30.560
interesting properties, like restricted rotation, and in many cases greater reactivity since

29:30.560 --> 29:33.680
their electrons are easier to remove.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.440
So we'll explore both of those properties a little bit later in the course.

29:37.440 --> 29:42.080
So far we've discussed atomic structure, the energetics driving bonding, and some of the

29:42.080 --> 29:45.800
simpler ways in which orbitals can overlap to form new chemical bonds.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.600
We've covered quite a bit, but there's still one last very important process which helps

29:49.600 --> 29:56.960
us explain exactly why atoms take on the geometries they do when bonding.

29:56.960 --> 30:01.760
So let's begin by taking a look at a methane molecule.

30:01.760 --> 30:06.040
Now you'll notice that I've drawn the atoms here around a central carbon of methane in

30:06.040 --> 30:13.280
a tetrahedral arrangement, and all four bonds are evenly spaced around that central carbon.

30:13.280 --> 30:19.360
We know this is true from experimentation, but the atomic orbitals, those S and P orbitals

30:19.360 --> 30:24.400
that I showed you previously, they don't have this tetrahedral geometry.

30:24.400 --> 30:29.040
So if the sigma bonds holding each hydrogen to the central carbon were produced by either

30:29.040 --> 30:33.360
a P orbital or an S orbital from the central carbon, the resulting molecule would have

30:33.360 --> 30:42.040
a very unusual geometry, and yet here we have this beautiful elegantly symmetrical molecule.

30:42.040 --> 30:47.040
That elegant simple symmetry of methane was actually a puzzle to chemists until the renowned

30:47.040 --> 30:54.560
physical chemist Linus Pauling published a theory on orbital hybridization in 1931.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.600
Pauling postulated that atomic orbitals could combine with one another, creating new sets

30:58.600 --> 31:03.280
of orbitals with some S character and some P character.

31:03.280 --> 31:09.400
So according to Pauling's new idea, any number of S and P atomic orbitals can combine to

31:09.400 --> 31:13.320
form an equal number of degenerate hybrid orbitals.

31:13.320 --> 31:18.520
And these new orbitals are neither S nor P, but a mixture of the two, having properties

31:18.520 --> 31:20.200
of both.

31:20.200 --> 31:24.440
And this led Pauling to refer to them as hybrid orbitals.

31:24.440 --> 31:30.920
For example, one S and one P orbital can combine to form two SP hybrid orbitals.

31:30.920 --> 31:37.320
Each of the new hybrid orbitals has about 50% S character and 50% P character.

31:37.320 --> 31:41.400
The influence of both contributing atomic orbitals is evident.

31:41.400 --> 31:46.920
Both can form sigma bonds and are at a 180 degree angle to one another.

31:46.920 --> 31:51.560
Now this phenomenon extends to hybridization of one S and two P orbitals to form three

31:51.560 --> 31:54.800
equivalent SP two orbitals.

31:54.800 --> 31:59.480
These orbitals would be 120 degrees apart, and it also applies to the combination of

31:59.480 --> 32:06.640
one S and three P orbitals to form four SP three hybrid orbitals, all of equal energy

32:06.640 --> 32:12.560
and identical geometry spaced 109.5 degrees apart.

32:12.560 --> 32:17.320
So in the case of SP three hybridization, the hybrid orbitals all point at the corners

32:17.320 --> 32:19.480
of this tetrahedron.

32:19.480 --> 32:25.040
This leads chemists to call atoms like methane, at least the central carbon of methane, tetrahedral

32:25.040 --> 32:26.040
atoms.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.960
Now remarkably Pauling's theory was spot on.

32:29.960 --> 32:34.600
Hybridization is a perfect explanation for the symmetry of the methane gas molecule.

32:34.600 --> 32:40.400
It's four identical carbon-hydrogen bonds spaced evenly can only be explained by Pauling's

32:40.400 --> 32:43.960
new hybridization theory.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.080
So let's sum up what we've covered today.

32:47.080 --> 32:51.880
We've discussed the structure of the atom, how positively charged nuclei are surrounded

32:51.880 --> 32:57.600
by a highly ordered cloud of orbiting negatively charged electrons.

32:57.600 --> 33:02.600
We consider the octet rule, and how it is an atom's desire to have a full valence shell

33:02.600 --> 33:06.920
which drives the process of chemical bonding.

33:06.920 --> 33:11.720
We saw how atoms of drastically different electronegativity can exchange electrons completely

33:11.720 --> 33:18.880
to form ionic bonds, which are then held together by an electrostatic attraction.

33:18.880 --> 33:24.600
We also took a look at purely covalent bonds, in which atoms of identical electronegativity

33:24.600 --> 33:29.320
share one or more pairs of electrons between themselves to increase their valence electron

33:29.320 --> 33:33.960
count without altering their charge.

33:33.960 --> 33:38.120
We also talked about how smaller differences in electronegativity between covalently bonded

33:38.120 --> 33:42.120
atoms can lead to what are known as polar covalent bonds.

33:42.120 --> 33:46.920
We studied how the principal energy levels of larger atoms can be divided into finer structures,

33:46.920 --> 33:51.000
which are used to explain the two types of chemical bonding most often encountered in

33:51.000 --> 33:52.840
organic chemistry.

33:52.840 --> 33:57.800
How strong, freely rotating sigma bonds form along the inter-nuclear axis of the two bonded

33:57.800 --> 34:04.360
atoms, and how somewhat weaker rotation-restricting pi bonds form by a side-to-side overlap of

34:04.360 --> 34:06.600
p orbitals.

34:06.600 --> 34:11.240
And finally, we took a look at how hybridization of atomic orbitals can create sets of hybrid

34:11.240 --> 34:17.680
orbitals which explain the observed geometries in most organic molecules.

34:17.680 --> 34:22.240
So now that we understand a bit about the process and geometries of chemical bonding,

34:22.240 --> 34:27.520
our next task will be to put some atoms together into molecules and survey a few of the many

34:27.560 --> 34:30.760
ways that chemists draw the resulting molecules.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.120
This is our topic for next time, and I'll see you then.
