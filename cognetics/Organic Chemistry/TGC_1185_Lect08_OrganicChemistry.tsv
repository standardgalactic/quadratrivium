0	18280	In 1928, a Scottish chemist by the name of Alexander Fleming noticed something strange
18280	20240	in his laboratory.
20240	25480	He saw that a culture plate containing Staphylococcus bacteria had been left open overnight
25480	27800	and had been contaminated by mold.
27800	32720	Now, we can all thank Fleming for his keen powers of observation, as rather than simply
32720	37600	throw the plate away, he decided to examine it.
37600	42720	What Fleming saw was that the mold had produced a zone of inhibition around itself.
42720	48080	Clearly, the mold was producing and excreting something which was protecting its biospace
48080	50920	from the Staphylococcus.
50920	55720	So Fleming cultured the mold and determined that it was the presence of a bacterium called
55720	60120	Penicillium Rubens, which inhibited the growth of that Staphylococcus.
60120	65840	Now, he grew up a culture of that Penicillium Rubens, filtered the broth of that culture
65840	69000	and dubbed that filtrate Penicillin.
69000	73440	The age of modern antibiotic discovery had begun.
73440	78520	Now, it wasn't long before it was discovered that Penicillin was safe for human injection
78520	85120	or ingestion, and that its antibacterial properties remained intact in the bloodstream of humans.
85120	88840	And by World War II, this drug was being mass produced for use in protecting injured
88840	91360	soldiers from infection.
91360	96960	In 1945, its structure was determined by noted British x-ray crystallographer and Nobel
96960	99680	laureate Dorothy Hodgkin.
99680	105880	The floodgates of mass production were opened in 1957, when John C. Sheehan completed the
105880	110280	first total synthesis of Penicillin at MIT.
111280	116600	Now, since the discovery of Penicillin, its characterization in mass production, thousands
116600	120560	of antibiotic compounds have been discovered and put into use for medical purposes all
120560	122000	around the world.
122000	126480	But it all started with a botched experiment in the basement of St. Mary's Hospital in
126480	127480	1928.
127480	132360	Now, there's no doubt in my mind that all of our lives have been touched by an antibiotic
132360	134120	in some way or another.
134120	137840	And by the end of today's lecture, I hope you'll have a new perspective on exactly
137840	143600	how Penicillin, the seminal antibiotic compound, functions at the molecular level.
143600	144600	Let's get started.
147280	152240	Previously, we discussed linear and branched alkanes, in which the connectivity of carbon
152240	157960	atoms in these hydrocarbons leads to millions of possible geometric isomers.
157960	163680	But we left out one obvious type of connectivity, cyclization.
163680	167040	In light of the fact that the carbon can bond so well to itself, you might have already
167040	172320	asked yourself the question, can a chain of atoms turn back on itself and create a cyclic
172320	173840	chain?
173840	177640	The answer is not only yes, but frequently.
177640	184800	We see these cyclic chains in a variety of organic compounds, from medicines to explosives.
184800	188400	Today we're going to focus on the structure of cyclic hydrocarbons.
188400	193600	So let's get started by examining the simplest possible cyclic hydrocarbon, one with three
193600	195560	carbon atoms.
195560	198760	And don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity of this structure.
198760	203280	This compound has found uses as a starting material in many organic syntheses, as well
203280	205920	as medical applications as an anesthetic.
205920	211680	So this deceptively simple molecular structure belongs to a very powerful and versatile organic
211680	212680	compound.
212680	221000	If we start by taking a look at the linear cousin of our cyclic three-membered compound,
221000	224960	propane, what we want to do is cyclize this compound.
224960	229280	So I'm going to turn the carbon-carbon bonds in such a way that I can bring it together
229280	234440	and form my new cyclic compound with three carbon atoms.
234440	239120	Now cyclizing this compound, we can see that we have to bond the two terminal atoms together,
239120	240880	which has several consequences.
240880	246640	First, the terminal carbon atoms must each give up a hydrogen to make space available
246640	248800	for the cyclizing bond.
248800	256960	Now this means that the generic formula for my cyclic alkane is CnH2n compared to CnH2n
256960	262680	plus 2 as in its analogous linear hydrocarbon.
262680	266720	Next I want you to notice that even though all the carbons are sp3 hybridized, and so
266720	270360	they should have free rotation, that they in fact do not.
270360	274980	This ring structure prohibits the carbon-carbon bond axis from rotating.
274980	280500	So this lends a new type of isomerism, one in which the side of the ring to which a substituent
280500	283620	is attached makes a difference.
283620	288020	See when they're placed on the same side of the ring, we have to use the term cis to
288020	291940	describe their relationship, whereas when they're placed on opposite sides of the ring
291940	297900	like this, we have to use the term trans.
297900	303260	Now the IUPAC system of nomenclature for cycloalkanes is very similar to that for linear alkanes
303260	306260	with just a few basic modifications.
306260	310620	First the root name is given the prefix cyclo, as an indication that the parent chain is
310620	312380	in fact cyclic.
312380	316780	So our three-membered ring depicted here would be named cyclo-propane.
316780	326500	Similarly, rings of increasing size would be named cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane.
326500	331660	Our next consideration is that those cyclic alkanes with a single substituent don't require
331660	337020	a number to give that substituent its location on the ring, and this of course stems from
337020	341320	the fact that all carbons on any unsubstituted ring are equivalent.
341320	346580	So we would name this molecule methylcyclobutane.
346580	351440	Now when two identical substituents are bonded to the ring, we designate their locations
351440	355820	using one as the first and then proceeding around the ring in a manner which gives the
355820	360220	lowest second number to the other substituent.
360220	367540	For example, we begin by naming this compound 1-3-dimethylcyclobutane.
367540	372340	Now when two or more different substituents are present, we number the ring atoms, starting
372340	377580	with a substituent which comes first alphabetically, and then proceed around the ring in a direction
377580	381420	leading to the lowest possible substituent numbers.
381420	390020	For example, we would name this compound 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclobutane.
390020	392340	But there's more to this structure.
392340	396900	Because the carbon-carbon bonds can no longer freely rotate, placing my two substituents
396900	401500	on the same side of the ring produces an isomer which is distinct from that when I place
401500	404660	substituents on opposite sides of the ring.
404660	409060	And again, to distinguish the isomers, we have to name them cis for the same side and
409060	412020	trans for the opposite sides.
412020	416100	And I'm sure that you've also wondered about our discussion on chirality.
416100	421180	Can such molecules have a chiral center which must be ranked by the Conningold pre-log convention
421180	423620	and given R and S designations?
423620	425500	Well, absolutely.
425500	429300	So let's try working with cyclic compounds which don't contain a mirror plane like the
429300	432340	1-3-dimethylcyclobutane example.
432340	437420	How about 1-2-dimethylcyclobutane?
437420	442860	Now in this case, the cis isomer has equal and opposite chiral centers, which makes it
442860	445980	superimposable with its own mirror image.
445980	448340	This means it's a mesocompound.
448340	452060	In other words, the chiral centers are equal and opposite.
452060	454940	But the trans isomer doesn't meet this requirement.
454940	462020	The non-canceling chiral centers on trans 1-2-dimethylcyclobutane means that this compound is expected
462020	473180	to exist as a set of enantiomers, RR and SS, each of which is distinct from the other.
473180	477900	In addition to new nomenclature and isomerism, small cyclic alkanes, like those containing
477900	484300	three to ten atoms, come with another consideration, and this affects their reactivity.
484300	489660	You'll notice that in cyclopropane, the carbon-carbon bonds must be 60 degrees since the three atoms
489660	496380	are necessarily coplanar, yet we already know that sp3 carbons ideally form bond angles
496380	499620	of 109.5 degrees.
499620	504380	Now the fact that the ring structure forces bond angles into suboptimal geometries is
504380	506940	known as angle strain.
506940	509940	We sometimes also call this bier strain.
509940	514900	It's named for a notable chemist and a Nobel Prize winner, Adolf von Beyer, who first proposed
514900	516500	the concept.
516500	521820	Now also, if I turn cyclopropane on its side and produce a Newman projection along one
521820	527620	of the carbon-carbon bonds, it also becomes clear that all the substituents of this cyclic
527620	534740	compound are locked in an eclipsed conformation, and the inability to achieve a staggered conformation
534740	538700	is referred to as torsional strain.
538700	543620	When we combine these two forms of strain, the angle and the torsional, we get an overall
543620	547420	measure of instability known as ring strain.
547420	552740	It's the total energetic cost of having CH2 groups forced into the geometry dictated
552740	558580	by the ring, as opposed to freely rotating CH2 groups as you would have in a hypothetical
558580	563020	linear alkane.
563020	568940	So let's consider the conformation in ring strains associated with a few small cycloalkanes.
568940	575380	Cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane.
575380	581260	First, imagine that I could somehow create a linear alkane with no end.
581260	586980	It could, in theory, achieve perfect 109.5 degree bond angles throughout, and a perfectly
586980	592820	staggered conformation for all substituents, which in this case are hydrogens.
592820	598060	If such a molecule existed, I could determine its free energy and use that as my reference
598060	601940	point for a perfect ring strain free hydrocarbon.
601940	609940	Now let's pit each of our cycloalkanes against this ideal alkane and see how they do.
609940	614420	Cyclopropane has only three ring atoms, and since three points define a plane, these atoms
614420	616940	are locked in a planar arrangement.
616940	623500	That results in 60 degree bond angles and 0 degree substituent dihedral.
623500	629900	These two factors combined lead to a ring strain value of 115 kilojoules per mole.
629900	635460	Now normalizing this to the number of CH2 groups in the molecule gives me 38.3 kilojoules
635460	640740	per CH2.
640740	643300	Cycloputane, on the other hand, has four ring atoms.
643300	647580	So looking down on the ring from above, we might estimate that its bond angles are exactly
647580	649100	90 degrees.
649100	650900	But we'd be wrong.
650900	656700	A 90 degree bond angle would require 0 degree substituent dihedral angles.
656700	662820	And unlike cyclopropane, cycloputane can twist or pucker just slightly in an attempt to remove
662820	668300	that torsional strain, even though that increases angle strain in the process.
668300	673500	So this results in a slightly puckered conformation in which all ring atom bond angles are about
673500	678460	88 degrees and all substituent dihedral are about 20 degrees.
678460	684700	This is slightly better than cyclopropane, but it's still a far cry from our ideal geometry.
684700	690980	So the total ring strain in cycloputane is about 110 kilojoules per mole, which corresponds
690980	697620	to 27.6 kilojoules per CH2.
697620	702260	Now when we get to cyclopentane, we're starting to get close to ideal bond angles, but we're
702260	703940	not quite there.
703940	709660	A flat 5-membered ring would have angles of about 108 degrees, but remember those eclipsing
709660	716180	interactions cause cyclopentane to pucker in very much the same way cycloputane does.
716180	720980	Now in its most stable conformation, four atoms are nearly coplanar and a fifth atom
720980	725860	is raised out of the approximate plane defined by the other four.
725860	730980	This leads to an arrangement commonly called the envelope conformation for cyclopentane.
730980	735340	This is because tracing out the surface created by the atoms leads to a shape that reminds
735340	739340	us of an open envelope.
739340	744340	So average carbon-carbon bond angles and dihedral angles in cyclopentane are beginning to approach
744340	747580	ideal values, but they're not quite there yet.
747580	751300	So there's still going to be some ring strain associated with this motif, but it's going
751300	755220	to be significantly reduced compared to cycloputane.
755220	761180	In fact, cyclopentane has a total ring strain of 27.2 kilojoules per mole, or only about
761180	767220	5.4 kilojoules per CH2.
767220	770100	Now our next example is cyclohexane.
770100	775340	And when we reach a cyclic hydrocarbon of six atoms, something special happens.
775340	781380	I can produce a conformation in which I have four coplanar atoms, one atom rising up above
781380	785940	the plane and one atom falling down below the plane.
785940	789940	We call this the chair conformation because we can imagine it as a lounge chair with a
789940	793300	headrest and footrest.
793300	800540	The chair conformation of cyclohexane produces a ring with 109.5 degree bond angles throughout
800540	806420	and ideal 60 degree bond dihedral angles among all of its substituents.
806420	811620	So with cyclohexane, we've come full circle as it were, to a situation in which there's
811620	815300	essentially no energetic penalty for ring formation.
815300	821660	So chair cyclohexane's ring strain is effectively 0 kilojoules per mole, which naturally leads
821660	826860	to 0 kilojoules per CH2.
826860	831460	So it might seem on casual observation that once we've passed the six carbon mark, we've
831460	836180	achieved the necessary flexibility to overcome any energetic penalties incurred by the act
836180	838900	of ring closure.
838900	843380	Organic chemists however rarely observe things casually and detailed consideration shows
843380	845980	that this is not the case.
845980	850420	Now construction of a model of cyclohexane shows pretty clearly that the addition of
850420	855940	a seventh atom to the ring creates a geometric problem, one in which bond angles of the ring
855940	860740	carbon atoms can no longer be optimized while also avoiding eclipsing interactions among
860740	863100	its substituents.
863100	867620	And this of course leads to a less stable cyclic alkane.
867620	871820	So just as three, four, and five membered rings have systematically decreasing ring
871820	876780	strain, seven, eight, and nine membered rings also have increasing ring strain associated
876780	879620	with them.
879620	884700	Even with the addition of more atoms and therefore more conformational flexibility, it's impossible
884700	890700	to produce the unique harmony of 109.5 degree bond angles and completely staggered substituent
890700	893620	relationships in cyclohexane.
893620	897940	In other words, the virtually non-existent ring strain of cyclohexane, and therefore
897940	902820	its unusual stability, cannot be recreated with any other number of ring atoms, up to
902820	908020	and including 16 carbons.
908020	911100	So what does all this have to do with the action of penicillin?
911100	917260	Well, penicillin works by inhibiting an essential enzyme called transpepsidase.
917300	922500	Now transpepsidase is used by certain types of pathogenic bacteria to build their cell
922500	924060	walls.
924060	928340	But when a molecule of penicillin interacts with the enzyme, a four-membered ring called
928340	933900	a lactam ring, which contains a nitrogen, so it's not just four carbons, but that nitrogen
933900	939060	is also sp3 hybridized, so it's subject to much of the same ring strain as a cyclobutane
939060	940060	would be.
940060	945900	Now that ring opens as it reacts with the enzyme's active site, and that active site
945900	950620	is the region where the cell wall reinforcing bonds are normally made.
950620	956180	So by bonding to the enzyme, penicillin chemically modifies the active site, causing the enzyme
956180	958180	to malfunction.
958180	962220	And it can do this with remarkable efficiency, because the formation of the new bond to the
962220	968040	enzyme is energetically driven by the opening of the four-membered lactam ring.
968040	973300	And this guarantees that the process proceeds with a reduction in overall free energy,
973300	977820	and therefore it's spontaneous.
977820	984420	So we just saw how a strained ring of sp3 atoms can give a molecule powerful chemistry.
984420	990820	But lack of strain can be every bit as important of a feature in a biologically relevant molecule.
990820	995420	For example, it's lack of strain which makes a cyclohexane such a pervasive motif in the
995420	997540	chemistry of life.
997540	1001920	We see this structure in powerful hormones, like human sex hormones, testosterone and
1001920	1003620	estrogen.
1003620	1008620	We see it in the antibiotic drug Tobromycin, and in the metabolite, anacetol, which can
1008620	1014180	be modified to make chemicals with varied uses ranging from explosives to investigational
1014180	1017440	anti-cancer drugs.
1017440	1023620	So this ubiquity and versatility that makes cyclohexane the gold standard of cyclic alkanes
1023620	1025740	in any organic chemistry course.
1025740	1028380	And ours is not going to be an exception.
1028380	1032580	So let's take a little bit of time now and explore cyclohexane's conformational behavior
1032580	1033580	just a bit.
1033580	1038700	Okay, so here's a cyclohexane molecule in the chair conformation.
1038700	1045700	Now you can see that I've got my forcoplanar atoms, I have my headrest, and I have my footrest.
1045700	1051940	Now I can approximate this ring of carbon atoms with a circle if I tilt the molecule slightly.
1052140	1056460	When I do this, you can see that there are two distinct substituent positions, one above
1056460	1061620	and below the ring, and another which runs around the perimeter of the ring.
1061620	1066220	And since these positions are distinct from one another, we can give them special names.
1066220	1068060	We call them axial.
1068060	1073540	If they're up and down, we call them equatorial if they're along the perimeter.
1073540	1076140	But molecules aren't static entities.
1076140	1080060	They're bonds vibrate and twist under the influence of thermal energy.
1080100	1084540	And because of this, cyclohexane's capable of a remarkable transformation known as a
1084540	1086540	ring flip.
1086540	1091860	Now when a ring flip takes place, the headrest and footrest of my imaginary chair are going
1091860	1093460	to interchange.
1093460	1098260	And in doing so, they'll create a second chair conformer in which all of the axial substituents
1098260	1103700	are now equatorial, and all of the equatorial substituents are now axial.
1103700	1105220	So let's take a look at this.
1105220	1109620	Right now I have axial, white, and equatorial, red.
1109620	1113580	And now I'm going to do my ring flip.
1113580	1115380	Remarkable transformation, isn't it?
1115380	1120220	All my red atoms have now become axial, all my white atoms equatorial.
1120220	1122900	And I can ring flip right back the way I was.
1122900	1123900	Very simply.
1123900	1128580	No bonds are broken or formed, so this is simply a conformational change as a result
1128580	1130900	of bond rotation.
1130900	1133940	Now I did that ring flip pretty quickly.
1133940	1138340	So let's slow it down a little bit and explore this really important conformational change
1138340	1141980	a bit slower.
1141980	1146740	As a ring flip begins, one of the carbon atoms moves into a coplanar arrangement with the
1146740	1148620	four others.
1148620	1151820	We call this a half chair conformation.
1151820	1156700	And you'll notice that adopting that conformation increases the ring carbon bond angles and
1156700	1159820	also creates new eclipsing interactions.
1159820	1164660	So this is a very high energy state, and in fact it represents a transition state between
1164660	1168900	the chair conformation and the intermediate for our ring flip process called the twist
1168900	1171900	boat.
1171900	1176180	In a twist boat conformation, the foot rest of my original chair is now level with my
1176180	1177660	head rest.
1177660	1182500	But there's a slight twist to the structure which gives it its name.
1182500	1186940	Now recovering the ideal bond angles within the ring to form a boat conformation means
1186940	1191860	that I have to create some eclipsing interactions between certain substituents, and the ring
1191860	1195180	flip tries to attenuate these by twisting ever so slightly.
1195180	1197980	So this is the boat conformation.
1197980	1204460	It represents a transition state between the two different twist boat intermediates.
1204460	1208340	Now the ring flip completes with the twist boat passing again through the half chair
1208340	1213660	transition state on its way to the alternate chair conformation.
1213660	1218540	And generally speaking, although conformers like the twist boat do exist, they have a
1218540	1221220	much higher energy than the chair conformation.
1221220	1227300	So chemists tend to model cyclohexane conformational equilibria as two state systems with only
1227300	1230460	one chair or the other being possible.
1230460	1236220	So we're going to make this assumption ourselves in many cases.
1236220	1239660	Now you may find that somewhat uninteresting at the moment because all of the substituents
1239660	1240740	are the same.
1240740	1242740	They're all hydrogens.
1242740	1246820	But what happens if we're dealing with a substituted cyclohexane molecule with various
1246820	1249380	groups attached to the ring?
1249380	1253720	At this point, the ring flip becomes very, very important conformational change because
1253720	1261060	it will alter the location of that substituent from an axial to an equatorial or back again.
1261060	1265700	So let's keep our discussion as simple as possible and focus on the conformational behavior
1265700	1269180	of a very simple substituted cyclohexane.
1269180	1271660	This is methylcyclohexane.
1271660	1275660	Now as you can imagine, a methyl group is much larger than a hydrogen.
1275660	1279660	So we expect that this methyl substituent, which I've marked in red, will want to take
1279660	1285380	up a position which gives it the largest volume of free space.
1285380	1290620	So if I draw a cyclohexane in the chair conformation that looks like this with its methyl group
1290620	1296140	in an axial position, is this really the best representation of the molecule?
1296140	1301860	The way that I've constructed this, the methyl group is close in space to two other hydrogens.
1301860	1305940	With the physical collisions of these larger groups with one another, we call one-three
1305940	1311220	diaxial interactions because the influencing substituents are on positions of the ring,
1311220	1315100	which would be one and three if we were labeling it as disubstituted.
1315100	1321380	In the case of methylcyclohexane, the diaxial interactions among these groups can be relieved
1321380	1323460	by a ring flip.
1323460	1328140	Notice that the ring flip places my larger methyl group in the equatorial position and
1328140	1332620	in the case of methylcyclohexane, having it out here where there's more space, lowers
1332620	1339260	its energy by about seven and a half kilojoules per mole, which corresponds to a 20 to 1 excess
1339260	1346220	of the equatorial conformer over the axial conformer.
1346220	1351260	So if it's my goal to approximate the chemical and physical properties of methylcyclohexane,
1351260	1359300	the best single representation that I can offer is that of the equatorial conformer.
1359300	1364020	Now you might have noticed in my previous example that the cyclohexane ring on testosterone
1364020	1369460	is not an isolated ring structure, but rather it's part of a larger network of rings, all
1369460	1374180	of which are bonded together in a very specific geometry.
1374180	1379300	So when two carbon or two hydrocarbon rings share one or more atoms, we call them bicyclic
1379300	1385820	systems and by extension we might call a molecule like the testosterone tetracyclic molecule
1385820	1390660	because it actually has four rings, each of which shares atoms with others.
1390660	1394940	Now today I'd like to show you just the most basic bicyclic systems in detail and show
1394940	1400300	you how we name them and how their connectivity can have a profound influence on their geometry
1400300	1406580	and therefore their behavior.
1406580	1411180	So let's begin by considering the different types of bicyclic structures.
1411180	1413380	There are actually three that we'll talk about today.
1413380	1415860	The first is sphero.
1415860	1421300	We define a sphero bicyclic structure as one which contains a single common carbon.
1421300	1426700	So here I have what we can view as two six-membered rings which are being conjoined by a single
1426700	1428860	atom that they share in common.
1428860	1434660	An example of this is a molecule cannabis spiran, also called cannabis spirone, which
1434660	1438660	is found in marijuana plants.
1438660	1445340	We can see very clearly that there is a sphero carbon here which creates this bicyclic motif.
1445340	1452180	Now the second type is a fused bicyclic and my example here is a molecule called decolin.
1452180	1457660	These fused bicyclics contain two adjacent carbons which fuse the rings together and
1457660	1460980	when this happens we call them bridgehead carbons.
1460980	1466020	So here I have two common carbons directly bonded to one another.
1466020	1470740	When this happens we call it a fused ring and a classic example of a fused system is
1470740	1472660	again our testosterone molecule.
1472660	1475300	We can see the fused motif right here.
1475300	1478900	Finally there's a third way to combine two rings and that is in a bridged motif.
1478900	1483940	And in the bridged motif we have two non-adjacent bridgehead carbons.
1483940	1488020	So in this case my two bridgehead carbons are not bonded to one another but are connected
1488020	1491580	through other atoms on all sides.
1491580	1493940	Example of this is the familiar molecule camphor.
1493940	1497100	You can see the motif right there.
1497100	1501940	So let's take a moment and think about how chemists actually think about bicyclics.
1501940	1506460	We call these structures bicyclic because we can create them mentally by combining two
1506460	1508020	rings together.
1508020	1511800	Now this is not how they're actually synthesized but rather this is how we think about them
1511800	1513860	from a structural perspective.
1513860	1516940	So we're not going to do a reaction here but I am going to show you what happens when we
1516940	1520700	put two rings together in our minds.
1520700	1524420	For this example I'm going to use five-membered rings.
1524420	1528940	The first example I bring my five-membered rings together and combine them at a single
1528940	1530620	common atom.
1530620	1535220	So that single bridgehead carbon is a spiro compound.
1535220	1540540	If I take my two five-membered rings and combine them at adjacent carbon atoms I now
1540540	1542980	have a fused system.
1542980	1548260	And again if I take my two rings and conjoin them at non-adjacent atoms I have what we
1548260	1550060	would call bridged.
1550060	1554180	So this is the way that we think about these kinds of systems.
1554180	1556240	Finally of course we need to know how to name them.
1556240	1561380	So if we know how we think about them naturally the next task at hand is to figure out how
1561380	1563900	to tell other people about them.
1563900	1568380	So we name these compounds using a system that is very akin to other IUPAC names but
1568380	1571140	we have a few extra considerations here.
1571140	1575860	For example in the spiro compound that I've just created I need to communicate how many
1575860	1580540	carbons are present in all of the bridges within the molecule.
1580540	1584940	So I have a bridge here which consists of four carbon atoms.
1584940	1589060	And I have a second bridge which also consists of four carbon atoms.
1589060	1593700	So my goal is to tell my reader that I have two bridges of four connected through a spiro
1593700	1595180	carbon.
1595180	1599100	So I start by naming my compound a spiro compound.
1599100	1606340	And then in brackets I indicate the size of each bridge separated by a period.
1606340	1611580	Finally I count all of the atoms within the molecule and use that to generate the final
1611580	1612580	name.
1612580	1618460	So in this case I have nine atoms in the total molecule meaning this is a spiro, four, four,
1618460	1619460	no name.
1619460	1625420	In the case of a fused bicyclic I have a bridge of three in my example here.
1625420	1630500	I have a second bridge of three and I have two directly connected bridgehead carbons
1630500	1633980	which can be thought of as a bridge of zero.
1633980	1639620	So to distinguish this system from the spiro I call it a bicyclo and I give the length
1639620	1644060	of all three bridges even though one of them is zero.
1644060	1648460	So this compound is a bicyclo 330.
1648460	1652540	And finally counting all of the atoms within the molecule I can get the root of the name
1652540	1659020	this is a bicyclo 330 octane molecule.
1659020	1661340	Alright now let's name our bridge compound.
1661340	1663660	We'll do exactly what we did with the fused.
1663660	1672100	We have a bridge of two, another bridge of two, and now a bridge of one.
1672100	1676940	So I'm going to call this also a bicyclo system because it, just like the fused, has two bridgehead
1676940	1678780	carbons.
1678780	1683420	What the distinction here is that I don't have any zeros in my brackets.
1683420	1690020	So this bicyclo 2, 2, 1 compound clearly has to be bridged, it's not fused.
1690020	1693700	And finally I do exactly what I've done for my other two which is I take an inventory
1693700	1696860	of the total number of atoms within that scaffold.
1696860	1706860	This is a bicyclo 2, 2, 1 heptane molecule.
1706860	1711180	So in this lecture we discussed the general formula of cyclic alkanes and how closing
1711180	1718780	a loop of carbons removes two hydrogens and gives us the general formula CnH2n.
1718780	1723420	We discussed nomenclature of this new class of hydrocarbons and we also touched on how
1723420	1728420	cyclization creates new geometric relationships among hydrogens and substituents known as
1728420	1731780	cis and trans.
1731780	1735940	We covered the phenomenon of ring strain, a combination of the two factors of angle
1735940	1738860	strain and torsional strain.
1738860	1744500	We saw how three, four and five-membered rings are unable to fully relieve this strain, making
1744500	1749180	them more unstable than their normal chain counterparts.
1749180	1754160	And we also noted that although more stable than very small cycloalkanes, rings of seven
1754160	1759380	atoms and more are also unable to achieve zero ring strain.
1759380	1764300	We then met cyclohexane, a very special cyclic hydrocarbon with virtually no ring strain
1764300	1765780	at all.
1765780	1769860	And we saw how its chair conformation can interconvert between two different conformers
1769860	1774780	which interchange axial and equatorial substituents.
1774780	1779460	We also considered how the size of substituents on substituted cyclohexanes can affect the
1779460	1784500	equilibrium between the two chair conformers, with larger groups pushing the equilibrium
1784500	1788180	in favor of their equatorial conformers.
1788180	1793780	Finally, we looked and named a few bicyclic hydrocarbons.
1793780	1800180	We saw how spirobicyclics contain two rings conjoined at a single carbon atom, fused bicyclics
1800180	1807660	share adjacent bridgeheads, and how bridged bicyclics share non-adjacent bridgeheads.
1807660	1813860	Along the way, we also saw how a laboratory error in an English basement in 1928 ultimately
1813860	1820260	led decades later to the discovery of the reaction between penicillin and transpepsinase.
1820260	1824980	And it's this reaction which gives this history-altering drug its antibiotic properties.
1824980	1829140	And it's our understanding of this reaction, which gave birth to a whole class of antibiotics.
1829140	1834620	And it's all driven by the energy released when a strain ring opens.
1834620	1838500	Next time, we're going to turn our attention back to linear and branched hydrocarbons,
1838500	1843020	but we're going to explore the effects of the presence pi bonds.
1843020	1843620	I'll see you then.
