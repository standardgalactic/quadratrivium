0	16120	Well, last time I gave an unfair amount of attention to beer when we had our lecture
16120	18240	on aldehydes and ketones.
18240	22440	So in this lecture, I'm going to try to give wine its due attention.
22440	27960	Now most of us know the conversion of grapes into wine introduces new flavors and smells.
27960	33680	And we also know that as wine ages, its flavor profile and bouquet are expected to change,
33680	40400	usually for the better at first with flavors mellowing and pleasing aromas intensifying.
40400	44320	Now the complexity of wine starts with the many chemical processes which take place
44320	46280	during fermentation.
46280	52400	One of these is the formation of new pleasant smelling organic compounds called esters.
52400	57880	Esters and also organic acids contain a functional group or motif that we can look at here on
57880	58880	our hologram.
58880	60360	So let's pull that up now.
60360	65800	Now the motif that defines these two classes of compounds has a carbonyl, which would be
65800	70440	a carbon double bonded to an oxygen, just like we saw in aldehydes and ketones.
70440	75360	But the carbonyl carbon is also bonded to an sp3 oxygen.
75360	81280	So this motif is distinct from our ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and ethers in the sense
81280	87400	that it combines more than one oxygen atom into a single organic motif.
87400	92440	Now we can see this motif in compounds, which give wine some of its pleasing aromas.
92440	98920	For example, this molecule is pentyl acetate, and it has the aroma of pears.
98920	104000	But if we change a little bit of the R groups attached to this motif, we get ethyl butyrate,
104000	111480	which is reminiscent of pineapple, or octyl acetate, which is more of an orange like aroma.
111480	117200	So you can see that they all contain the same internal structure with the carbonyl and the
117200	119040	sp3 oxygen.
119040	122600	But what's changing here is the identity of the attached R groups.
122600	124440	But the complexity doesn't stop there.
124440	129960	See, over time, esters and others like them can interconvert chemically inside the bottle.
129960	134280	And this creates a changing mixture, which stimulates your nose and your palate differently
134280	141080	through time, making the experience that a wine offers change as the years go by.
141080	146720	Now another type of compound, which can affect the flavors of wines, are organic acids, and
146720	151060	they share a very similar structure to esters.
151060	156040	So let's go back to that motif we just looked at, where we have a carbonyl to which there
156040	159120	is also bonded an sp3 oxygen.
159120	163400	Now keeping this motif in mind, see if you can find it in the following molecules.
163400	169760	This is tartaric acid, which is responsible for giving wine a sort of tart flavor.
169760	173720	But if we change the molecule up, we get malic acid.
173720	177880	And malic acid is actually the flavor of green apples.
177880	182280	We can change the structure slightly again and get lactic acid, which is responsible
182280	187920	for more of a milky flavor in mouthfeel in wines.
187920	193360	So just like esters, these acids are formed, consumed, and even interconverted as the contents
193360	200120	of a bottle of wine age, making the same vintage taste different from one year to the next.
200120	204520	So with a little bit of time, organic chemistry can improve that bottle of wine that you so
204520	209120	carefully sought out during your last visit to Napa.
209120	213640	But an overly protective connoisseur might hold that bottle a little bit too long with
213640	216520	disastrous consequences.
216520	221520	See wine's a complex mixture of many classes of organic compounds, including quite a bit
221520	223920	of the alcohol ethanol.
223920	228280	Now I venture to say that most of us already knew that much, but what you may not realize
228280	233040	is that in addition to all those pleasant tasting and smelling components, every wine
233040	238400	bottle also has a sinister gang of microbial chemists at work in it.
238400	242400	Microbes like this one, called acetobacter.
242400	247160	Now acetobacter quickly set up residents in grapes when they're still in the vine.
247160	254120	And they're practically impossible to remove, and they simply love to drink your wine.
254120	260000	So the growth of these bacteria is held at bay by the careful exclusion of vital oxygen
260000	264360	and the addition of some sodium metabysulfite.
264360	270500	Sodium metabysulfite is a flavorless inorganic material which slowly decomposes into antibacterial
270500	276360	sulfur dioxide under acidic conditions, inhibiting microbial growth while not particularly affecting
276360	279080	the flavor of the wine.
279080	283920	But slowly with time and just a little bit of oxygen permeating the seal of the bottle,
283920	290120	acetobacter eventually overwhelms the preservative and metabolically converts the wine's ethanol
290120	293760	into acetic acid for energy.
293760	298840	This process destroys the flavor profile that the vinter works so tirelessly to create
298840	304960	and demotes your favorite bottle of wine to the ranks of what we commonly call wine vinegar.
304960	310760	Now we've already considered the oxidation of ethanol to ethanol also known as acid aldehyde.
310760	313960	This is a process which chemists perform on the bench and which you perform in your own
313960	317120	bloodstream after a night on the town.
317120	321440	Today, among other things, we're going to take a look at the next step in this oxidation
321440	328160	process, that of acid aldehyde to acetic acid.
328160	333680	Now all of these compounds, the complex esters and acids that form that perfect bottle, as
333680	339200	well as the acetic acid, which ultimately causes its devise, are members of a subset
339200	344720	of organic compounds which contain not one, but two oxygen atoms.
344720	350080	But these two types of compounds don't find their only home in the beverage industry.
350080	353720	Carboxylic acids are a primary component of compounds that we come into contact with every
353720	360160	day, including many detergents like the loric acid you might find in your shampoo bottle,
360160	366280	the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen, and the commonly used food preservative benzoic
366280	369080	acid.
369080	374560	Esters include compounds like isoamyl acetate, the fragrance and flavor component of bananas,
374560	379480	and also, coincidentally, a signaling hormone which is released from the stinger of an attacking
379480	382080	bee to call for backup.
382080	385880	So I'm guessing this means that beekeepers aren't particularly fond of banana flavored
385880	388920	anything, especially on a work day.
388920	394400	Now esters also find use in the drug industry in a cleverly designed class of compounds
394400	400960	known as pro-drugs, which include heart medications, antivirals, and more.
400960	405440	Because they're at the end of the line in many natural oxidative processes, simple
405440	410280	carboxylic acids were discovered very early in the history of organic chemistry.
410280	414120	So some of them have common names which will actually serve as the basis for their more
414120	418880	modern IUPAC substituent prefixes, so let's take a look at those now.
418880	423240	Let's start just by looking at the four simplest carboxylic acids.
423240	425560	The simplest of all is formic acid.
425560	430400	This takes its name from the Latin word for ant, because it was first isolated from the
430400	434680	venom of fire ants.
434680	440200	Another common carboxylic acid is acetic acid, which gets its name from the Latin word for
440200	444680	acid itself, because this was the very first compound which was characterized which had
444680	448360	these properties.
448360	450840	Next is propionic acid.
450840	454960	Propionic acid takes its name from the Greek, meaning first fat.
454960	459640	This is because it was the first organic acid which was isolated which wouldn't dissolve
459640	461840	in water.
461840	466600	And finally, the next largest would be butyric acid, which gets its name because it was first
466600	469720	isolated from butter.
469720	472720	Now you can see the commonalities here in all of these structures.
472720	479880	They all contain the essential carbonyl group, to which is bonded an sp3 oxygen.
479880	484360	And there's one more crucial part of the structure which makes them carboxylic acids.
484360	489920	That is that they have a hydrogen attached to that sp3 oxygen.
489920	495720	So this is the structural motif which makes carboxylic acids carboxylic acids.
495720	499400	So now that we have a better understanding of the structures of carboxylic acids and
499400	503560	how some of them are named, let's take a look at some esters of similar size and you'll
503560	509760	probably notice quite a few of these names reproducing themselves.
509760	513520	Take the example of the simplest possible ester, methylformane.
513520	515360	Notice the name, formate.
515360	522040	It gets that name because our ester contains an R group which is simply one carbon, methyl,
522040	526040	and it also has this carbonyl carbon which is by itself.
526040	530920	So one carbon sort of gets this prefix form a lot of the time.
530920	535120	So methylformate is a natural choice for the name.
535120	541920	Very similarly we have ethylacetate which takes the acetate name from the two carbons
541920	546520	that are in the carbonyl containing portion of the structure.
546520	551560	Next is propylpropionate and just like that butylbutyrate.
551560	556000	Now it's not necessary for both sides of the ester to have the same number of atoms as
556000	559880	they do in my examples here, for example 4 and 4, 3 and 3.
559880	563560	They could just as easily be a mixture of two different chain lengths.
563560	567400	But the nomenclature system would stay basically the same.
567400	573920	And what defines them all is the presence of a carbonyl group attached to an sp3 oxygen
573920	583640	but this time the sp3 oxygen contains that second R group rather than a hydrogen.
583640	588400	So let's take a look at how we name acids and esters from an IUPAC perspective as opposed
588400	590080	to their traditional names.
590080	594160	We're going to use the rules that we have devised before for many other classes of
594160	599160	organic compounds but in the case of acids we always want to be sure that the carbonyl
599160	604080	carbon is included in the parent chain because it's a functional group.
604080	607800	We always want to give it the lowest number for the same reason and we'll name our parent
607800	614440	compound using the suffix oic acid to indicate the presence of this functional group.
614440	616400	So let's work an example here.
616400	621000	Let's try to name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature.
621000	625120	First thing I'm going to do is find my organic acid group here it is.
625120	630240	And then I'm going to label the longest attached carbon chain which I haven't done yet.
630240	631240	Did you catch this?
631240	635520	There's a longer chain so I have to use this one as my parent.
635520	640960	So this will be a pentanoic acid because it's a five carbon chain terminating in an
640960	644440	organic acid functional group.
644480	650160	I have one substituent with a single carbon so this is a methyl substituent.
650160	653920	And again because the carboxylic acid is a functional group it receives priority in
653920	655480	numbering.
655480	660040	So I'll number my parent chain in this way one to five in my example here from right
660040	662600	to left.
662600	669160	Now I can construct my name using the standard rules three methyl one pentanoic acid but
669160	674080	because the organic acid necessarily terminates a chain see it has two bonds to oxygen here
674080	678480	one bond to oxygen here leaving only one bond to go to the chain.
678480	687200	It's really not necessary to include the one so we omit this three methyl pentanoic acid.
687200	692360	The IUPAC nomenclature of esters is similar but there's one very important change and
692360	698560	that is that we have to remember that there is an R group attached to an oxygen now and
698560	703360	that oxygen won't have an address because it's not part of the parent carbon chain.
703360	709120	So that sp3 oxygen now becomes an address in and of itself otherwise we'll be following
709120	715040	the same essential nomenclature rules ultimately naming it a carboxylate.
715040	719400	Let's do an example.
719400	721840	Let's name this ester.
721840	726080	Again we want to first find the functional group and the parent carbon chain which would
726080	731200	include the carbonyl so I've highlighted that here in orange.
731200	737360	Now I have a butanowate because I have four carbons but I now have an ethyl substituent
737360	742400	on the sp3 oxygen rather than simply a hydrogen.
742400	746720	I also of course have this chloro group out here on the parent carbon chain now remember
746720	753480	the substituent on the sp3 oxygen always gets priority in the naming so in this case
753480	758840	I'll number my chain and I'll move the ethyl to the front of the name followed by my three
758840	763400	chloro for the substituent followed by my butanowate.
763400	771440	So this is ethyl three chloro butanowate.
771440	774280	So now that we've talked a little bit about nomenclature let's move on and think about
774280	777720	the properties of acids and esters.
777720	781640	Specifically let's take a look at a carboxylic acid here propionic acid and we'll break
781640	785080	its structure down and see if we can use that to explain some of the observations that we
785080	788800	make when we work with it in the laboratory.
788800	794880	Now propionic acid has carbon oxygen double bond with a dipole right here a carbon oxygen
794880	799600	single bond dipole here and also an OH dipole here.
799600	803000	So there are a number of polar bonds in this molecule which means that it's going to have
803000	805120	very high polarity.
805120	812840	It's also got oxygens with lone pair electrons and a very important OH motif.
812840	816680	This means that it is not only a hydrogen bond acceptor but can also be a hydrogen bond
816680	818000	donor.
818000	823520	So one molecule of propionic acid can easily create hydrogen bonds to another molecule
823520	825240	of propionic acid.
825240	831160	This leads to relatively high boiling points and means that acids tend to be either very
831160	836400	low volatility liquids or usually even solids around room temperature.
836400	843960	Now by comparison esters like this methyl acetate have the carbon oxygen double bond
843960	849800	dipole and actually two CO single bond dipoles but you notice that even though they have
849800	856720	all these polar bonds within the motif that they are lacking one very important piece
856720	863520	of the motif that we saw previously and that is there's no OH motif there's no OH bond
863520	864760	here.
864760	869360	That means that even though this methyl acetate can be a hydrogen bond acceptor through its
869360	875040	oxygens it has no way of donating a hydrogen and that means that with another methyl acetate
875040	880520	molecule they really can't interact in this way and what this means is that esters tend
880520	885680	to have lower boiling points than do their similar sized carboxylic acids.
885680	890040	So notice here that methyl acetate's boiling point is closer to that of pentane a hydrocarbon
890040	894120	of similar size than it is to propionic acid.
894120	900400	So this allows us to explain in some ways why it is that esters seem to be so important
900400	905120	in the aromas of wines whereas we see that acids tend to be more important toward the
905120	907200	flavors of wines.
907200	914840	It's a simple question of volatility you can't smell that which doesn't vaporize.
914840	918000	So let's survey all the boiling points from some of the oxygen containing compounds we've
918000	920040	looked at so far.
920040	924760	When we do we can see which types of bonds within the motif are most important to increasing
924760	926960	boiling points.
926960	931760	Notice that if I take pentane with no oxygens at all I get the lowest boiling point of all
931760	936840	but that simply adding sp3 oxygens or even carbonyls that can't hydrogen bond to other
936840	941120	molecules of the same kind I have only a modest increase in boiling point.
941120	946800	For example an ether, methyl acetate, butanol and methyl ethyl ketone.
946800	951400	But as soon as I introduce that OH group there allowing these molecules to hydrogen bond
951400	956760	to other molecules of the same type we see a drastic rise in the boiling points and therefore
956760	961840	we see a very different type of chemical behavior as well as physical behavior.
961840	967120	Now another very important difference between carboxylic acids and esters is their acid base
967120	969120	behavior.
969120	972920	Carboxylic acids get their name of course because they have an acidic hydrogen but they're
972920	977480	also amphoteric being ever so slightly basic.
977480	982280	So let's take a look at a carboxylic acid acting as a base for a moment.
982280	987560	Here is acetic acid a very simple carboxylic acid which has a carbonyl oxygen which is
987560	994200	at least in theory capable of donating an electron pair to form a new bond to a proton.
994200	999560	Now when it does this it creates this very unstable looking species but this very unstable
999560	1004240	looking species also has resonance stabilization.
1004240	1008820	Not a lot but just enough to make it possible.
1008820	1013120	So what we're dealing with is the equilibrium between the acid and a conjugate base with
1013120	1017320	this very slight resonance stabilization but which is otherwise not very favorable looking
1017320	1018840	structure.
1018840	1021840	So it has a pKa of around negative seven.
1021840	1027560	This is a very strong acid right here a protonated carboxylic acid has acid strengths that begin
1027560	1031160	to rival things like hydrochloric acid some of the stronger mineral acids that we know
1031160	1035440	of but they can form under extreme conditions.
1035440	1041880	Of course carboxylic acids are much better at acting as acids and in that case they lose
1041880	1049480	their acidic hydrogen which is the OH to form a resonance stabilized carboxylate.
1049480	1055600	This is a fairly stable anion and therefore the pKa of a neutral carboxylic acid is somewhere
1055600	1056600	around five.
1057400	1061080	Now think about that compared to an alcohol with a pKa of around sixteen or seventeen
1061080	1067960	so we're talking about something that's millions of times more acidic.
1067960	1072400	Esters on the other hand although they are still considered as amphoteric can act as
1072400	1074480	a base in very much the same way.
1074480	1078440	Again my carbonyl oxygen here has lone pair electrons which you can use to form a new
1078440	1086520	bond and again create this resonance stabilized but somewhat unstable looking conjugate acid.
1086520	1092880	So in this case the pKa of our protonated esters it rivals that of our protonated carboxylic
1092880	1097840	acids at about negative seven but the real difference comes when we try to look at the
1097840	1100880	acidity of a neutral ester.
1100880	1106640	In this case there is no OH to be deprotonated so instead the most acidic hydrogen is here
1106640	1111640	one bond away from our carbonyl motif.
1111640	1117240	Now to deprotonate this we have to rely again on resonance stabilization to make it possible
1117240	1122680	but even this resonance stabilization doesn't make our deprotonated ester even remotely
1122680	1126840	as stable as a deprotonated carboxylic acid.
1126840	1132560	Consequence of this is that we have an acid, well not an acid, an ester which has a pKa
1132560	1135560	of about twenty five.
1135560	1141560	Now carboxylic acids are the end of the line as oxidation of primary alcohols goes.
1141560	1145720	They can be produced using our now familiar aqueous chromic acid reaction in which one
1145720	1153280	round of oxidation produces an aldehyde followed by hydration and a second round of oxidation.
1153280	1158320	You may remember that last time we learned pyridinium chlorochromate or PCC could be
1158320	1163760	used to halt ethanol oxidation at the acid-aldehyde stage, indeed it could do this for any primary
1163760	1165400	alcohol.
1165400	1170840	But if we instead wanted to continue oxidation to the extreme and reach a carboxylic acid
1170920	1176640	we can treat that primary alcohol with aqueous chromic acid and in this way not only would
1176640	1182280	a primary alcohol like ethanol be oxidized to an aldehyde like ethanol but it would then
1182280	1189080	be oxidized again to ethanoic acid which we commonly know as acetic acid.
1189080	1193760	But carboxylic acids don't have to be created from starting materials that have oxygen in
1193760	1194760	them.
1194760	1200160	Now certain alkenes can also be oxidized to form acids using a suitable oxidizing agent
1200160	1202400	as well.
1202400	1207080	Consider for example 2-butene which can be reacted with potassium permanganate under acidic
1207080	1211840	conditions to produce two molecules of acetic acid.
1211840	1216280	This reaction takes place to an intermediate which we would call a viscinal dial and the
1216280	1221880	viscinal dial quickly splits under acidic conditions to form two carboxylic acids, in
1221880	1224840	this case two molecules of acetic acid.
1224840	1231920	So we sometimes refer to this technique as oxidative cleavage of a double bond.
1231920	1235560	No discussion of carboxylic acids and esters is complete without mentioning one of the
1235560	1240920	most prolific chemists of the 1800s and someone whose contributions to the science we've
1240920	1243480	already begun to explore in earlier lectures.
1243480	1249200	I'm speaking of Hermann and Milfischer, a revered German chemist whose work on carbohydrates
1249200	1253720	will be one of the highlights of our lecture on that topic.
1253720	1258080	Now far from being just a carbohydrate chemist, Fischer was driven to synthesize many of the
1258080	1263560	small biologically relevant molecules we encounter on an almost daily basis.
1263560	1268880	These include caffeine found in coffee and tea and the theobromine found in chocolate.
1268880	1274320	He's also well known for developing a technique for producing an ester from a carboxylic acid
1274320	1281200	under very mild reaction conditions, a reaction which bears his name to this day.
1281200	1286720	This reaction called the Fischer esterification is a condensation reaction, meaning that it
1286720	1289720	forms water as a byproduct.
1289720	1295240	It relies on a strong mineral acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid.
1295240	1300760	Now just like ketone and aldehyde carbonyls, in this protonated state the carbon of a carboxylic
1300760	1306800	acid becomes significantly electrophilic and can be attacked by even weak nucleophiles
1306800	1310160	like a neutral alcohol.
1310160	1314680	This attack forms a tetrahedral intermediate, which can take on two different tautomeric
1314680	1320840	states, one in which the attacking alcohol oxygen is protonated and one in which a hydroxyl
1320840	1324720	oxygen of the original acid is protonated.
1324720	1328760	So the departure of an alcohol from this original tautomer would constitute a simple
1328760	1331800	reversal of the first step.
1331800	1337120	But if instead a water can depart from the second tautomer, thereby you get a protonated
1337120	1343560	ester, which quickly loses the catalytic proton to become neutral again.
1343560	1347840	So one of the great benefits of Fischer esterifications when compared to other methods of the day
1347840	1351960	is that none of the reagents are sensitive to water, notoriously difficult substance
1351960	1355040	to exclude from organic reactions.
1355040	1359880	But this benefit comes at a cost, that the reaction is an equilibrium, which only very
1359880	1362920	slightly favors product formation.
1362920	1368640	So Fischer esterifications usually require the use of one reagent in extremely high concentrations
1368640	1373640	to ensure that the other is almost completely converted.
1373640	1378840	Now in yet another twist, the nearly equal energies of the reactants and products means
1378840	1383880	that we can turn the Fischer esterification reaction around, reversing the roles of product
1383880	1385760	and reactant.
1385760	1390360	So we can exploit Le Chatelier's principle and turn a Fischer esterification into an
1390360	1395640	ester hydrolysis, simply by changing the solvent from alcohol to water.
1395640	1404320	The product of this reaction should be a nearly complete conversion of ester to acid.
1404320	1408320	So let's take a look at an interesting ester that you may have already encountered and
1408320	1409320	not even known it.
1409320	1414120	There's a popular antiviral drug that's on the market today, it's called Tamiflu.
1414120	1418760	And Tamiflu itself contains an ester motif, and it's part of a very interesting class
1418760	1422160	of compounds called prodrux.
1422160	1425520	This is a molecule called Oseltamivir.
1425520	1431480	Now Oseltamivir, you'll notice, has an ester motif.
1431480	1436120	Here's another molecule that's very similar, called Oseltamivir carboxylic, which I've
1436120	1440160	drawn as a carboxylic acid, but could just as easily have been drawn in its deprotonated
1440160	1442520	state.
1442520	1446080	What's interesting about these two molecules is the properties that they have.
1446080	1452040	So it turns out Oseltamivir, when you swallow it, about 80% of that molecule gets from your
1452040	1453640	GI tract into your bloodstream.
1453640	1458800	This is a pretty good delivery for a drug molecule.
1458800	1465300	Whereas Oseltamivir carboxylate is only about 5% absorbed, meaning that for every 20 molecules
1465300	1468840	of this that you swallow, only one of them ultimately makes it all the way into your
1468840	1469840	bloodstream.
1469840	1474240	Now here's another interesting factoid.
1474240	1479040	Oseltamivir does absolutely nothing to help you get over the flu.
1479040	1482720	Whereas Oseltamivir carboxylate does.
1482720	1487240	It actually binds to the capsids of viruses and thereby sort of prevents them from adhering
1487240	1491400	to the cell so that they can inject their RNA into their damage.
1491400	1495080	But remember, Oseltamivir carboxylate is not absorbed into your bloodstream where it could
1495080	1496400	help you.
1496400	1498040	So are we, is all lost here?
1498040	1502040	Is there no reason to continue looking at or working with either one of these molecules?
1502040	1503800	I don't think so.
1503800	1509320	They differ by, again, only one functional group, this ethyl ester and this carboxylic
1509320	1510480	acid.
1510480	1520720	But we know how to convert one into the other so we can exploit the properties of both molecules.
1520720	1522960	This is the way that Tamiflu works.
1522960	1527300	Oseltamivir is put into a pill or capsule which a patient swallows.
1527300	1531020	This molecule reaches the patient's GI tract where it is transferred into the bloodstream
1531020	1537580	very efficiently but where it also can't do anything to help fight a viral infection.
1537580	1543860	But in your bloodstream naturally is water and also enzymes from your liver which specialize
1543860	1548540	in hydrolyzing this bond in the same way that a fissurist verification would.
1548540	1554380	So once this molecule is already in your bloodstream, your body converts it from the ethyl ester
1554380	1556780	into the carboxylic acid.
1556780	1561820	Oseltamivir carboxylate can now do its job having been delivered as a different molecule
1561820	1563380	altogether.
1563380	1568580	So this strategy constitutes what we call a pro-drug and you'll find uses of them in
1568580	1572620	many different therapies, not just antivirals.
1572620	1577420	So we know that esters can be chemically broken down to acids by enzymes in our body or in
1577420	1581700	a beaker using aqueous acid as an a fissurist verification.
1581700	1586300	But there's yet another method available for hydrolyzing esters which was in use long before
1586300	1588180	beakers even existed.
1588180	1595100	See, soap making is a process nearly as old as or possibly even older than recorded history
1595100	1599940	with the first credible historical sources of these recipes being on a Babylonian tablet
1599940	1603940	which is nearly 5,000 years old.
1603940	1610100	So early soap makers deserve credit as some of the first, albeit unwitting, organic chemists
1610100	1612900	of the human race.
1612900	1616820	The traditional making of soap uses a reaction which accomplishes nearly the same result
1616820	1622340	as an acidic ester hydrolysis reaction, but it does so irreversibly and with remarkable
1622340	1625220	ease and efficiency.
1625220	1630900	You may recall that animal fats and vegetable oils contain compounds known as triacylglycerides.
1630900	1635540	We've already seen how Sabatier in his contemporaries toyed with the saturation of these alkyl chains
1635540	1638820	using hydrogenation reactions.
1638820	1643260	But triacylglycerides are useful for much more than just a food source.
1643260	1648540	When the ester bonds are broken in these molecules, several useful compounds can result, including
1648540	1652340	those used in soap.
1652340	1657580	So instead of relying on the acidity to increase the electrophilicity of an ester, suponification
1657580	1662460	relies on the removal of a proton from water to produce a stronger nucleophile in the form
1662460	1664900	of hydroxide.
1664980	1669500	This is easily accomplished even in ancient times by allowing rainwater to percolate through
1669500	1673740	wood ashes, which creates a material known as lye.
1673740	1678860	Modern chemists would probably call this potassium hydroxide.
1678860	1685660	The hydroxide from lye is a much better nucleophile than water, and it attacks the carbonyl of
1685660	1690300	neutral esters easily to form a tetrahedral intermediate.
1690300	1695660	Just as with the acidic mechanism, this intermediate is now faced with two options, lose a hydroxide,
1695660	1703900	go back to starting materials, or lose an alkoxide as it recovers its carbonyl bond.
1703900	1709060	So now we can see the secret to the irreversibility of suponification and why it's so easy to
1709060	1711580	run this reaction to completion.
1711580	1716460	The final step in the mechanism involves the transfer of a proton from the resulting carboxylic
1716460	1724100	acid, the pKa of about 5, to the byproduct alkoxide, which has a conjugate acid pKa of
1724100	1727300	about 16.
1727300	1732700	With pKa values this drastically different, clearly the proton transfer is not only fast,
1732700	1737820	but irreversible, and the products obtained are alcohol and the carboxylate salt of an
1737820	1740540	organic acid.
1740540	1745540	This carboxylate salt is no longer reactive and can be isolated from the resulting glycerol,
1745540	1749580	so our soap preparation is complete.
1749580	1752940	But suponification is not limited to the hydrolysis of fats.
1752940	1757660	It can be used to disassemble a range of esters into carboxylates and alcohols, and so it
1757660	1766260	gives us yet another tool to break down practically any small organic ester that we desire.
1766260	1767740	I think it's time now.
1767740	1772060	We've finally amassed a substantial arsenal of techniques for the inner conversion of
1772060	1778180	hydrocarbons, alkyl halides, and oxygen-containing compounds that we can begin to appreciate
1778180	1783220	and participate in a synthetic design problem.
1783220	1789300	So let's pretend that we're chemists attempting to synthesize adipic acid, a dicarboxylic
1789300	1793780	acid used frequently in the manufacture of nylon.
1793780	1799060	But let's simplify this problem and say we have only cyclohexanol and other common inorganic
1799060	1801100	reagents to work with.
1801100	1806860	Now your instinct might be to begin by considering cyclohexanol and all the different compounds
1806860	1813420	one could make from it, then consider how each of those might be modified.
1813420	1818980	But even our small arsenal of techniques leads to a hopelessly complex diagram of potential
1818980	1822860	reactions which could take us far too long to consider.
1822860	1827340	Not only that, but a typical lab will have an inventory of reagents, all of which could
1827340	1829700	be considered as starting materials.
1829700	1834840	So the number of permutations of reactions grows so rapidly that it becomes absolutely
1834840	1836340	overwhelming.
1836340	1837500	So is all hope lost?
1837500	1839940	Well, of course not.
1839940	1843980	Just like solving a maze can be much simpler if you start from the destination and work
1843980	1850420	backwards, so can a synthesis puzzle be better attacked in that way?
1850420	1856660	One way which chemists attack this is to use a technique that we call retro-synthetic analysis.
1856660	1861940	So if we turn our attention from the starting material to the product and ask ourselves
1861940	1870460	what could I make this material from, usually we find just a few realistic possibilities.
1870460	1875940	Contemplating the reaction in this way, in reverse, it's called retro-synthetic analysis.
1875940	1883220	And often block arrows are used to distinguish this kind of analysis from a forward synthesis.
1883220	1890260	For example, adipic acid can be produced in a single step using only two of our techniques,
1890260	1900420	either the oxidation of a dialdehyde or the oxidative cleavage of a cyclic alkene.
1900420	1905380	Now let's take a look at these two and ask ourselves how might we prepare these potential
1905380	1906380	intermediates?
1906380	1911900	Well, the needed dialdehyde could be produced by oxidation of a corresponding diol, but
1912020	1916340	we're two steps along our retro-synthesis and this product isn't looking much like
1916340	1918860	our available starting material, is it?
1918860	1923340	Ah, but cyclohexene shows promise.
1923340	1929100	It more closely resembles the starting material because of the six-membered ring that it has.
1929100	1933980	Now a quick survey of methods for preparing alkenes reminds us that we can prepare them
1933980	1939780	by elimination reactions involving the appropriate alcohol under acidic conditions.
1939780	1945540	So what appears to be an overwhelming synthetic problem is now solved in just a few short
1945540	1951220	steps using retro-synthetic analysis.
1951220	1956180	So today we concluded our tour of oxygen-containing compounds by covering carboxylic acids and
1956180	1957900	esters.
1957900	1964740	We discussed how both of these motifs contain an sp3 oxygen connected to a carbonyl carbon.
1964740	1969540	How carboxylic acids stand alone among compounds we've looked at so far and how acidic they
1970300	1975500	are and how replacement of that acidic hydrogen converts the motif to what is known as an ester
1975500	1982180	with drastically different solubility, volatility, and acid-base properties.
1982180	1985060	We took a look at two ways to prepare carboxylic acids.
1985060	1991060	First, by the oxidation of aldehydes with chromic acid, emulating the action of acetylbacter,
1991060	1995260	and second we saw how they can be prepared by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with
1995260	1999300	hot potassium permanganate.
1999300	2003700	Then we took a look at the Fischer's Derrification, which allows us to produce esters from an organic
2003700	2007100	acid and an alcohol.
2007100	2011300	We also saw how this process can be reversed to get the acid and alcohol back in a process
2011300	2014540	called acid hydrolysis.
2014540	2019020	We discussed how enzymes in your body can accelerate the same process in your bloodstream,
2019020	2022940	prompting medical researchers to use esters frequently in a class of pharmaceuticals
2022940	2028180	known as pro-drugs, including products like Tamiflu, which have significantly improved
2028180	2033660	bioavailability over the active compound alone.
2033660	2038420	Next we covered saponification, an age-old process in which a strong hydroxide solution
2038420	2041860	is used to promote hydrolysis of esters.
2041860	2045460	This process is most well-known for its use in the production of soap products, but is
2045460	2048580	applicable to a wide range of organic reactions.
2048580	2054100	And finally, we were introduced to a technique known as retro-synthetic analysis, in which
2054100	2058740	we navigate a synthetic problem backwards in order to minimize the number of reactions
2058740	2062340	that we have to consider.
2062340	2066380	As we close the book on oxygen-containing motifs, we'll move forward and add yet another
2066380	2069780	highly influential element to our discussion.
2069780	2073300	Nitrogen is next on our tour of common functional groups.
2073300	2073860	I'll see you then.
