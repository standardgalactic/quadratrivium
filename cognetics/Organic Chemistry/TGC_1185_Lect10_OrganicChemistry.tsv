0	17280	The field of industrial refrigeration has had obvious impacts on global economies, health,
17280	19200	and so much more.
19200	22680	Just think about how many times in the past week you've reached for a medicine or a meal
22680	26240	which was not freshly prepared for you.
26240	29800	The need to cool materials as a means of preserving them has been commonplace since
29800	32760	the beginning of recorded history.
32760	37320	But for most of that recorded history, the cooling of foodstuffs was accomplished by transporting
37320	44980	ice and snow from higher elevations or by digging of cellars or other rudimentary methods.
44980	50360	In 1826, American Frederick Tudor founded a company shipping ice from the cold pond
50360	57160	waters of Massachusetts to regions as far away as the Caribbean, Europe, and even India.
57160	62720	So high was the demand for this product in the 1800s and so lucrative was Tudor's enterprise
62720	67000	that he was famously able to ride out one additional business failure after another,
67000	75160	relying on his sole thriving company to become the world's first and probably only ice magnate.
75160	80200	But transportation of ice isn't the oldest recorded method of cooling foodstuffs.
80200	84560	The people of India had discovered centuries before Tudor that the contents of clay pots
84560	90080	could be cooled by allowing the water to permeate into the clay of the containers and then placing
90080	95760	those containers outside to allow the water to evaporate from their surfaces.
95760	100160	You see, evaporation of a liquid means its conversion from the liquid state to the vapor
100160	107160	state and this process requires that heat be absorbed by that evaporating material.
107160	111960	And the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, leads us to the conclusion that
111960	118760	any heat absorbed by evaporating material must be removed from the solid material left behind.
118760	123440	So as water evaporates from the pots, the pots themselves are cooled.
123440	128680	This method of refrigeration is known as evaporative cooling.
128680	133240	As you might expect, effective evaporative cooling requires that quite a bit of material
133240	135840	be converted from the liquid to the vapor state.
135840	141240	And in the technique I just described to you, the coolant, which is water, vaporizes and
141240	143240	then is lost to the atmosphere.
143240	147240	If you want to cool again or any further, you have to get more liquid water and repeat
147240	149560	the process.
149560	154880	But in 1835, an American inventor named Jacob Perkins patented a system in which vaporized
154880	160400	refrigerant was not allowed to escape, but was piped into a different region of an apparatus
160400	166600	where it was recondensed, allowing it to be pumped back into the cooling chamber and revaporized.
166600	170560	The vapor compression refrigeration system had been born.
170560	177440	Now, in 1835, Perkin had to use what was available to him as a refrigerant, highly flammable,
177440	181000	somewhat toxic, and rather expensive ether.
181000	186920	Naturally, his invention was not viable competition for the ice shipping industry for these reasons.
186920	191160	Paying extra money for a refrigerator, which was somewhat likely to blow up, didn't seem
191160	194000	like a good investment to most people.
194000	196800	But the engineers of this era didn't give up.
196800	200440	And over the next century, experimentation with different refrigerants and compression
200440	202120	systems continued.
202120	207920	Still, none could provide safe, cost-effective, reliable cooling the way that imported ice
207920	210320	could.
210320	214680	But near the end of the 19th century, this changed with the introduction of a new class
214680	219800	of refrigerants called alkylhalides.
219800	224960	As the name implies, alkylhalides can be thought of as alkanes, in which one or more of the
224960	228400	hydrogen atoms has been replaced with a halogen.
228400	234040	This is from column 7 of the periodic table containing fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and
234040	235040	iodine.
235040	239400	Now, we've already seen ways in which a halogen can be introduced to a carbon-containing
239400	243000	scaffold via radical halogenation.
243000	246880	And we've even performed an analysis on the chiral center of one of these compounds in
246880	249240	the form of Freon 151.
249240	258800	Today, we're going to see exactly why anyone would want to create such a compound.
258800	264640	As you just saw, we commonly refer to simple alkylhalides as alkylfluorides, chlorides,
264640	269040	bromides, or iodides, depending on which halogen is attached.
269040	273280	Do not, however, let this fool you into thinking that the halogens are ionized as they are
273280	278560	in inorganic materials, like sodium chloride, for example, and table salt.
278560	282440	These are, in fact, covalently bonded to the carbon atom.
282440	288680	Now, in addition to classifying alkylhalides by which halogen is attached, organic chemists
288680	293200	frequently classify alkylhalides based upon the substitution of the carbon bearing the
293200	294440	halogen.
294440	296520	We call this atom the alpha carbon.
296520	301960	Now, if there are no other carbons attached to this alpha carbon, we call the compound
301960	304240	a methylhalide.
304240	309280	One alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon is a primary alkylhalide.
309280	314120	Two attached groups is a secondary, and three would be called a tertiary alkylhalide.
314120	319920	Now, when the exact identity of an alkyl group is not of consequence, we sometimes simply
319920	324880	use the abbreviation R to indicate a generic alkyl group is present.
324880	331240	So, the molecule commonly called propylchloride would be considered a primary alkylhalide
331440	333400	because of its single R group.
333400	339080	Next is isopropylchloride, which has two R groups attached to the carbon bearing the
339080	340080	chlorine.
340080	344360	So, this would be an example of a secondary alkylhalide.
344360	349480	And finally, here's a structure of the simplest tertiary alkylhalide, t-butylchloride.
349480	356000	Now, from an IUPAC naming perspective, halogens are treated exactly as any alkyl substituent
356000	364000	would be, using the prefixes fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo to define them.
364000	373000	So, using the IUPAC naming convention, propylchloride becomes one chloropropane.
373000	378520	Isopropylchloride becomes two chloropropane.
378520	385680	Antibutylchloride will be two chloro, two methylpropane.
385680	390360	Now halogens are much larger and more electronegative than hydrogen, and their presence on the molecule
390360	393400	has two important effects.
393400	397040	The first is related to the size of the halogen atoms.
397040	402560	The size of the halogen atoms has a profound effect on the boiling point of whichever methylhalide
402560	403560	I'm dealing with.
403560	408640	So, here I've drawn for you some structures for all of the common methylhalides that we'll
408640	410440	encounter in this course.
410440	412480	I've also used methane here as a reference.
412600	415040	So, this is CH4.
415040	419640	But we can attach a fluorine in place of one hydrogen to create methylfluoride, a chlorine
419640	422720	to create methylchloride, etc.
422720	427280	And when we take a look at the boiling points of these compounds, there's a very clear and
427280	428920	obvious trend.
428920	433720	And that is that the larger the attached halogen atom is, the higher the boiling point of the
433720	436960	associated methylhalide will be.
436960	440760	And the reason for this is easier to see if I change these models from this ball and stick
440760	444040	format to what we call a space-filling model.
444040	449760	And the space-filling model is fairly clear to see that the electron cloud around methyliodide
449760	455160	is much larger than that around methylbromide, which is larger than chloride, etc., all the
455160	456960	way down to methane.
456960	462520	So, we're dealing with a situation where the polarizability increases as we add larger
462520	467960	and larger halides, causing their boiling points to increase as well as a result of stronger
467960	469480	dispersion forces.
470200	474520	Now let's take a look at another property of these alkylhalides, and that is the polarity
474520	476800	of the bond.
476800	480840	Now we know that halogens are more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen, so we expect that
480840	485840	a bond dipole will exist with some negative charge over here near the halogen and a bit
485840	490160	of positive charge on the associated alpha carbon.
490160	496320	But when we survey the bond dipoles of these common methylhalides, what we notice is that
496320	501520	fluorine actually has a slightly less polar bond with carbon than does chlorine.
501520	503640	Now, what's the reason for this?
503640	504640	Right?
504640	507960	Didn't I just tell you not too long ago that fluorine is the most electronegative element
507960	508960	of all?
508960	515600	Well, the reason that the bond polarities are so similar among these alkylhalides is because
515600	519840	bond dipoles are also a function of the distance between the two atoms.
519840	524080	So I've got to consider the length of these bonds, which is easier to see in the ball-and-stick
524080	525080	model.
525600	530880	So even though fluorine is my most electronegative element of the bunch, it actually has the
530880	533840	shortest bond of any of the methylhalides.
533840	538000	And the consequence of these bond lengths is that they counteract that electronegativity
538000	543480	difference just a bit, and it's a fairly happy coincidence actually that most of these carbon-halogen
543480	547900	bonds have similar bond polarity, makes them a little bit more predictable from a reactivity
547900	548900	standpoint.
548900	553640	Okay, so we've already seen this slide in which we've compared the boiling points of
553640	558060	methylhalides as a function of how large the attached halogen is.
558060	562080	But it also stands to reason that with three additional positions on the alpha carbon,
562080	567080	that we should consider what happens when we add more than one halogen to our alkylhalide.
567080	571640	So let's do this using chlorine as an example.
571640	575840	Instead of just one chlorine as on methyl chloride, I can have two chlorines attached
575840	580200	to the alpha carbon in a compound called methylene chloride.
580200	586440	Three attached chlorines creates chloroform, and four creates a compound commonly known
586440	589000	as carbon tetrachloride.
589000	593960	So if I look at the effect of adding additional chlorine atoms to my molecule as a function
593960	597240	of boiling points, it's very clear what's going on here.
597240	602240	Methane itself has a very low boiling point of negative 161 degrees centigrade.
602240	607760	Adding a chlorine gives me methyl chloride rather with a boiling point of negative 24.
607760	611600	I get to methylene chloride with a boiling point of 40, and adding additional chlorines
611600	618480	continues to cause an increase in the boiling point to 61 and 77 degrees centigrade respectively,
618480	623520	all because of that extra electron cloud that's brought to each of these compounds by adding
623520	627040	additional chlorine atoms.
627040	631960	Now carbon tetrachloride is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure, and it was a popular
631960	636760	garment dry cleaning solvent in the late 1900s, but it's fallen out of favor recently
636760	640200	due to environmental and health concerns.
640200	645880	Perhaps ironically, its popular replacement, perchloroethylene, certainly does look very
645880	647400	similar, doesn't it?
647400	652320	Indeed, perchloroethylene is used in dry cleaning now, but it's currently under scrutiny for
652320	657080	its potential health and environmental impacts.
657080	661680	The first occurrence of alkyl halides in refrigeration was methyl chloride.
661680	664960	It was put into use near the beginning of the 20th century.
664960	669760	But methyl chloride's toxicity and flammability meant that a leaking refrigerator compressor
669760	672480	could easily spell disaster.
672480	677720	So methyl chloride shares many of the dangers that Perkins' original ether coolant did.
677720	683720	It would appear that alkyl halides just weren't destined for this application.
683720	688760	But near the end of the 1920s, a researcher by the name of Thomas Midgley Jr., working
688760	694440	for the Frigidaire Division of General Motors, devised a new alkyl halide compound.
694440	700960	Midgley's contribution was a method used to synthesize dichloro-difluoromethane.
700960	706280	And in doing so, he managed to create a compound with the useful physical properties he wanted,
706280	712240	but which was also not flammable or appreciably toxic.
712240	717560	Midgley and his contemporaries dubbed this class of refrigerants CFCs.
717560	722480	Lauded as a revolution in refrigeration technology, Midgley's creation became the gold standard
722480	724200	of refrigerants.
724200	729280	And before long, the era of mass-scale ice shipping was over, as thousands of refrigerators
729280	735360	worldwide were using and leaking these compounds into the atmosphere.
735360	740480	Now, we're all probably familiar with CFCs and the potentially calamitous environmental
740480	743480	effect they have in the upper atmosphere.
743480	746200	This may be one of chemistry's greatest ironies.
746200	750160	These compounds were designed to make life on the ground safer in the form of refrigerators
750160	752840	which won't poison or incinerate us.
752840	756280	But they ultimately began to produce a hole in the most vital protective layer of the
756280	760640	upper atmosphere, the Earth's ozone layer.
760640	764480	You see, Midgley's invention may have been much safer near the surface of the Earth,
764480	768880	but as those dense vapors from this propellant and refrigerant slowly migrate into the upper
768880	774560	atmosphere, they mingle with solar radiation and a naturally occurring layer of gas known
774560	777040	as ozone.
777040	782560	In the upper atmosphere, ozone forms and decomposes naturally in an equilibrium process,
782760	788400	absorbing dangerous UVC light from the sun as it does so.
788400	792520	What Midgley and his contemporaries couldn't possibly have predicted is that when freon
792520	798000	reaches this layer of the atmosphere and is exposed to high-energy UV radiation, one
798000	802160	of the carbon-chlorine bonds breaks.
802160	806920	This bond cleavage takes place in a homolytic process which is reminiscent of our radical
806920	810600	halogenation reaction like we might use to create freon.
811400	816320	But it divides the bonding electron pair between departing chlorine atoms and the carbon atoms
816320	818680	to which they're bonded.
818680	823760	Now the distinction here is that carbon-chlorine bonds are stronger than chlorine-chlorine
823760	828520	bonds, so higher-energy UV light is required.
828520	833360	So carbon-chlorine bonds which are regarded as generally stable at the Earth's surface
833360	840720	are anything but stable in the upper atmosphere where those high-energy photons are available.
840720	845680	And just like the photolysis of chlorine, this bond-breaking mechanism in freon creates
845680	851560	a very reactive radical chlorine atom with only seven valence electrons.
851560	855080	Now we see where we get into environmental trouble with CFCs.
855080	859000	We know from our free radical halogenation discussion just how reactive these chlorine
859000	862640	radicals can be.
862640	867560	But today it has a new partner to react with, ozone gas.
867560	873480	And chlorine radicals participate in the breaking down of ozone into molecular oxygen, producing
873480	876480	a molecule of chlorine monoxide.
876480	881920	And this chlorine monoxide then reacts with atomic oxygen which is also naturally present
881920	884240	in the stratosphere.
884240	889720	This produces another molecule of oxygen and very unfortunately regenerates that chlorine
889720	892480	atom.
892480	898680	So the chlorine radical generated by light-activated homolytic bond cleavage in the upper atmosphere
898680	902120	catalyzes the decomposition of protective ozone.
902120	907160	At the end of the process, the radical catalyst is reproduced and can move on to decompose
907160	910400	yet another molecule of ozone.
910400	916640	And in this way, a single chlorine radical can break down about 100,000 ozone molecules
916640	921400	before it's naturally consumed in a reaction with other atmospheric gases which are naturally
921400	924720	present.
924720	931240	This non-natural acceleration of ozone decomposition causes a decrease in overall ozone levels,
931240	936000	which allows potentially unsafe radiation to pass through the upper atmosphere reaching
936000	938240	the Earth's surface.
938240	943960	So the bad news here is that CFCs have disturbed the natural equilibrium between ozone production
943960	947420	and depletion in the stratosphere.
947420	954500	The good news is that equilibrium is a dynamic process and as those CFCs are naturally consumed,
954500	958980	the original equilibrium should re-establish itself, replenishing the ozone layer over
958980	962100	time.
962100	965580	Now there's little that we can do about the CFCs which have already been released into
965580	969900	the environment, but in order to avoid the negative effect of these chlorine radicals
969900	976220	on ozone, modern refrigerants have been designed without the use of carbon-chlorine bonds.
976220	980900	These new refrigerants are commonly called hydrofluorocarbons.
980900	985620	Now in a twist of fate, which we should probably expect by now, there are mounting concerns
985620	990540	today regarding the use of hydrofluorocarbons because of their ability to act as a greenhouse
990540	996860	gas, trapping reflected infrared light and contributing to global warming.
996860	1002980	So after carcinogenic carbon tetrachloride, flammable and toxic methyl chloride, ozone
1002980	1009700	depleting CFCs and supergreen house hydrofluorocarbons, why do we keep turning to compounds like
1009700	1013460	alkyl halides for these applications?
1013460	1018060	The answer is, tune ability of alkyl halide volatility.
1018060	1023420	Their relative stability and our ability to methodically and predictably modify the boiling
1023420	1028100	points of these organic compounds has made them a very difficult option to abandon in
1028100	1033100	a number of applications, not the least of which is refrigeration.
1033100	1039820	Now, alkyl halides are also valued in synthetic organic chemistry for their balance of stability
1039820	1042180	and reactivity.
1042180	1046480	Many alkyl halides will keep in a bottle on a shelf for years, but can be converted into
1046480	1051800	other useful reagents in a matter of minutes or hours in the laboratory.
1051800	1056860	The key to this balance of stability and reactivity lies in the fact that carbon halogen bonds
1056860	1062380	are inherently fairly strong but polarized.
1062380	1067140	Average carbon fluorine and carbon chlorine bond enthalpies are actually similar to that
1067140	1069220	of carbon-carbon bonds.
1069220	1072340	Even carbon bromine bonds are quite strong.
1072340	1079260	This means that in the absence of other reagents, most alkyl halides have a long shelf life.
1079260	1084680	But unlike carbon-carbon bonds, carbon halogen bonds are polar.
1084680	1089200	The more electronegative halogen pulls those bonding electrons closer to itself, creating
1089200	1093320	that mild permanent charge separation across the bond.
1093320	1098240	And as you can see from our table, carbon fluorine, carbon chlorine, and carbon bromine
1098240	1103280	bonds are all very similar in polarity, since that less electronegative bromine has a longer
1103280	1107940	bond length, for example, and iodine's monstrous size isn't really enough to make up for its
1107940	1113320	lower electronegativity, making its bond just a little bit less polar than the others.
1113960	1118720	Now, more often than not, we find that chlorine and bromine strike just the right mix of bond
1118720	1124600	strength and polarity, so they're usually the go-to alkyl halides for the types of reactions
1124600	1128720	we'll soon consider.
1128720	1133140	Although so far we've examined some alkyl halides which contain many bonded halogen atoms,
1133140	1137720	exploited for their physical properties, synthetic organic chemists more frequently
1137720	1143280	like to use alkyl halides containing only one or just a few halogens so that subsequent
1143280	1146480	chemical reactions are more site-directed.
1146480	1151680	Furthermore, in the low pressure, high energy environment of the troposphere, radicals can
1151680	1156520	easily form, but they're far less common in the lab.
1156520	1160200	Organic chemists much more frequently rely on the tendency of halogens to accept the
1160200	1165360	full bonding pair in a process known as heterolytic bond cleavage.
1165360	1170280	Accepting both electrons from the bond produces a halide ion, which is more stable than a
1170280	1175620	halogen radical, and a positively charged hydrocarbon species also, which we call a
1175620	1178640	carbocation.
1178640	1185180	The tendency of this process to happen spontaneously in an alkyl halide is a result of two factors.
1185180	1191480	One is the stability of the halide ion, and the other the stability of the resulting carbocation.
1191480	1196100	So the key to predicting how a particular alkyl halide will react lies in being able
1196100	1202200	to understand the factors contributing to the stability of those two products.
1202200	1204720	Let's start by focusing on the halide ion.
1204720	1207640	Fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide.
1207640	1213140	They all have a single charge and a complete octet in their outermost energy level.
1213140	1216480	So they're all fairly stable from an octet rule perspective.
1216480	1220160	Yet there's a steady trend of increasing stability in this set of ions as we go from
1220160	1223080	smaller to larger.
1223100	1228980	So what's giving the iodide ion more stability than bromide, and bromide more than chloride?
1228980	1234540	The answer to the question comes in the form of a familiar topic, polarizability.
1234540	1237700	You'll recall that we discussed this concept when we talked about the volatility of these
1237700	1241180	compounds.
1241180	1245260	Iodine with five valence shells has a large electron cloud, which gives its electrons a
1245260	1248380	lot of freedom to move within that cloud.
1248380	1252700	This means that at any instant in time I might find a small region of greater electron density
1252720	1257680	here, and then later here, and then later yet over here.
1257680	1262280	So the negative charge of an iodide ion is distributed over a very large volume of its
1262280	1263920	electron cloud.
1263920	1270800	And remember that as a general rule, distributing charge means more stability.
1270800	1273040	Now let's take a look at bromide.
1273040	1277080	Bromide has a smaller cloud, but it still carries the same negative charge compared
1277080	1278720	to iodine.
1278740	1283420	So the negative charge of bromide is less distributed in a smaller volume of space,
1283420	1285620	making it less stable.
1285620	1290460	And this trend continues to chloride and ultimately fluoride, with negative charge density becoming
1290460	1297180	progressively more and more intense, resulting in less and less stable ions.
1297180	1303820	So in general, t-butyl iodide, more rapidly dissociates into a halide and carbocation,
1303820	1309280	and does t-butyl bromide, which does so faster than t-butyl chloride, which outpaces t-butyl
1309280	1313080	fluoride.
1313080	1316880	Next we have to take a look at the resulting carbocation and its substitution.
1316880	1322080	You see, carbocations contain a positively charged carbon atom, with only three bonds
1322080	1324040	to itself.
1324040	1328800	So the charged carbon has only six valence electrons, therefore it doesn't have a complete
1328800	1330800	octet.
1330820	1337620	Instead it has three coplanar sp2 hybridized orbitals bonded to either hydrogens or r-groups,
1337620	1340300	and a vacant p-orbital.
1340300	1346660	Now we observe in the lab that just like radicals and alkenes, the carbocations of higher substitution
1346660	1349980	are also more stable.
1349980	1355980	In other words, tertiary carbocations, having three r-groups like this t-butyl cation, form
1356000	1361040	more readily than do secondary carbocations like this isopropyl cation.
1361040	1368040	Similarly, primary carbocations like ethyl cation are rarely ever seen in the laboratory.
1368040	1375360	And finally, methyl cations, which have no r-groups, are the least stable of all.
1375360	1379560	So what's the reason for this trend in carbocation stability?
1379560	1383480	Well the answer is a very familiar topic, hyperconjugation.
1383480	1388180	So to explain this, let me bring up the structure of a carbocation.
1388180	1393340	Remember carbocations have the three r-groups or hydrogens attached to them at 120 degree
1393340	1398500	angles within the plane, and the vacant p-orbital is oriented straight up and down.
1398500	1403300	So if one of the adjacent r-groups is in fact an alkyl group, there should be a carbon with
1403300	1407580	another bonding orbital adjacent to my empty p-orbital.
1407580	1413340	And it's the electron density from this bond to the adjacent carbon that can hop or slightly
1413340	1416200	share with that empty p-orbital.
1416200	1419960	And it's this crosstalk that distributes that charge and attenuates a little bit of
1419960	1424080	that positive charge right in the middle of the carbocation.
1424080	1431080	So if we enhance this effect by going from one to two to ultimately three r-groups,
1431080	1435760	we continually stabilize the charge as we add each group.
1435760	1441200	So the rate of formation of a carbocation by an alkyl halide has two important influencing
1441200	1442200	factors.
1442940	1448500	First it gets faster as the halogen gets larger, and second it gets faster as the carbocation
1448500	1451460	gets more substituted.
1451460	1455940	Now it should be emphasized here that this is a general rule and that there will be exceptions,
1455940	1460380	particularly when we start to consider the effect that solvents can have on reactions.
1460380	1465780	But for now this is a good general rule to get us started.
1465780	1470340	Now carbocations and species like them make regular appearances in many common reaction
1470340	1471620	mechanisms.
1471620	1475280	So it's worth shining the spotlight on them for a bit longer and showing you at least
1475280	1478480	one very unusual property of these species.
1478480	1483880	Their ability to rearrange one or more of their bonds to increase their stability.
1483880	1488480	Now we just finished discussing what a profound effect the substitution of a carbocation
1488480	1494480	can have on its stability, with tertiary cations being more stable than secondary and so on.
1494480	1499440	Now we're already gaining an understanding of molecules natural tendency to take on lower
1499460	1506460	energy forms through chemical processes, and carbocations are no exception to this rule.
1507220	1514220	Carbocations sometimes can alter their own structure through a process known as rearrangement.
1514420	1519700	These rearrangements can take place in two ways, secondary meaning that they take place
1519700	1525540	after the formation of the carbocation, or concerted meaning that it takes place at the
1525540	1528140	same time that the carbocation forms.
1529000	1532960	They can take place by those two mechanisms, and they can also take place in two different
1532960	1538080	ways, one known as hydride shifts, and one known as alkyl shifts.
1538080	1540400	So let's take a look at some of those now.
1540400	1544680	The first type of shifts I'd like to show you is a secondary hydride shift.
1544680	1549520	So this will take place after the formation of a carbocation, and will involve, as you
1549520	1553120	can probably figure out, the movement of a hydrogen.
1553120	1557720	So I've drawn for you here a secondary carbocation, secondary because the carbon which holds
1557800	1562540	the charge is bonded to two R-groups, one I've actually designated as an R-group, and
1562540	1567460	the other I've expanded a bit so that you can see what's about to happen.
1567460	1570380	Now let's make a duplicate of this molecule here.
1570380	1575500	So I have a secondary carbocation, which is adjacent to a tertiary carbon, right?
1575500	1580140	One, two, and then three R-groups attached to the adjacent carbon.
1580140	1585380	So knowing that this is a tertiary carbon and this is a secondary carbon, this carbocation
1585400	1590720	would much rather have its charge on the adjacent carbon, and it's able to get it there using
1590720	1593360	something called a hydride shift.
1593360	1600120	Now in a hydride shift, this attached hydrogen and its bonding electrons will both migrate
1600120	1605160	to the adjacent carbon, and in doing so, it will relocate the positive charge to the
1605160	1606800	more substituted carbon.
1606800	1610640	So let's watch that happen.
1610640	1613040	The consequence of my hydride shift should be obvious.
1613040	1615900	I've made a tertiary carbocation.
1615900	1621580	So when we draw reactions as line angle structures, we might see a carbocation like this, but
1621580	1625620	when we continue to analyze the reaction, discover that the product seems to have formed
1625620	1628460	from a carbocation that looks like this.
1628460	1632540	And the reason for that is that a hydride shift has occurred to change my secondary
1632540	1636780	carbocation into a tertiary carbocation.
1636780	1641620	Another very commonly encountered carbocation rearrangement is known as a secondary alkyl
1641620	1642740	shift.
1642840	1647680	This has a tendency to occur in a secondary carbocation which has an adjacent quaternary
1647680	1648680	carbon.
1648680	1652960	You see now my adjacent carbon doesn't have a hydrogen at all, but rather has only r-groups
1652960	1654760	attached.
1654760	1660240	So this secondary carbocation, which would like to be tertiary, can't achieve that by
1660240	1664200	a hydride shift because there's just no hydrogen to shift.
1664200	1669320	And when this is the case, there's one other mechanism which can take place, and that is
1669340	1674860	that the entire alkyl group can shift, including its bonding electrons to the associated quaternary
1674860	1676460	carbon.
1676460	1681780	And when this process takes place, not only do I alter the location of the positive charge,
1681780	1686780	but I've actually retooled the entire carbon framework of this molecule.
1686780	1691460	Well, in this case a carbocation, but the resulting molecule.
1691460	1695860	So what this will look like in a line angle formula is if I have a carbocation which appears
1695880	1702400	to have a secondary carbocation adjacent to a quaternary carbon, I'll actually, usually,
1702400	1707040	see a product that looks as though it formed from this tertiary carbocation, and it's
1707040	1710440	the consequence of this alkyl shift.
1710440	1715080	The third type of secondary rearrangement that I'd like to talk about is called a ring
1715080	1716720	expansion.
1716720	1720400	And in a ring expansion, it's very similar to an alkyl shift.
1720400	1725440	The difference being that my carbocation is now adjacent to a strained ring in the form
1725460	1727620	of a cyclobutane.
1727620	1732940	And we know that cyclobutane contains a great deal of ring strain, or buyer strain.
1732940	1736980	And that it would rather be a five-membered ring than a four-membered ring.
1736980	1742180	And the presence of an adjacent carbocation gives it just that opportunity.
1742180	1747540	All we have to do is complete an alkyl shift, which sort of drags the rest of the ring along
1747540	1748620	with it.
1748620	1753740	And when that occurs, not only do I relocate the positive charge, but I also expand the
1753740	1755720	ring.
1755720	1761280	So I've turned my cyclobutane ring into a cyclopentane ring.
1761280	1765940	So again, when I'm working out a reaction and I see a carbocation which looks like this,
1765940	1770400	I should be thinking about products which might form from a carbocation which instead
1770400	1772480	looks like this.
1772480	1778520	Now, both hydride and alkyl shifts are not limited to secondary carbocations.
1778520	1782080	There's another class of these rearrangements, which we call concerted rearrangements, or
1782080	1783860	primary alkyl shifts.
1783860	1787980	And these take place in the example of isobutyl chloride.
1787980	1791780	If I were to suggest that the chloride ion can be formed from this molecule producing
1791780	1797860	a carbocation, you should be suspicious, because simply breaking the carbon-chlorine bond produces
1797860	1800060	a primary carbocation.
1800060	1803740	And we know that primary carbocation is almost never formed, because they're just not stable
1803740	1806100	enough.
1806100	1811500	But what if the adjacent hydrogen could shift not after the carbon-chlorine bond had broken,
1811500	1813440	but in concert with it?
1813440	1819200	We could bypass the primary carbocation completely, forming a tertiary carbocation through that
1819200	1821880	concerted rearrangement.
1821880	1825240	Of course, we can make the natural extension of this and suggest that a concerted alkyl
1825240	1832000	shift is possible, and molecules like 2, 2-dimethyl-1-chlorobutane as well.
1832000	1836240	All of these carbocation rearrangements can be either a supreme annoyance against which
1836240	1843980	we have to guard, or a clever trick used to devise ingenious pathways to desired products.
1843980	1847900	In either case, when they're possible, they have to be accounted for during synthetic
1847900	1850060	design.
1850060	1853900	Whether these processes are friend or foe, we'll see very soon that they can have a profound
1853900	1858460	impact on the outcome of a synthesis.
1858460	1861060	So let's review what we've discussed today.
1861060	1864820	We've defined alkyl halides, which can be thought of as hydrocarbons in which one or
1864840	1870760	more hydrogen atoms are replaced by a halogen substituent.
1870760	1875000	We examine both common and IUPAC systems for naming these compounds, and how halogens are
1875000	1880360	treated just like any other alkyl substituents in systematic nomenclature.
1880360	1884800	We talked about how the presence of larger, more polarizable halogen atoms decreases the
1884800	1889960	volatility of alkyl halides, allowing chemists like Midgeley to tune the physical properties
1889960	1894720	of refrigerants and advance the science of refrigeration, ultimately all but ending the
1894720	1898740	global ice shipping industry.
1898740	1903060	Finally we discussed a bit about the reactivity of alkyl halides, and we investigated how the
1903060	1907980	homolytic cleavage of carbon chlorine bonds adds a catalyst to the upper atmosphere of
1907980	1912980	the Earth, accelerating ozone depletion and threatening the environment.
1912980	1917500	And we also took a look at how carbon halogen bonds behave in solution in the lab, rather
1917500	1919660	than in the upper atmosphere.
1919660	1924620	How these alkyl halides are set up to undergo a heterolytic bond cleavage to produce halide
1924620	1929840	ions, and carbocation of varying stabilities depending on the size of the halide ion and
1929840	1935080	the substitution of the carbocation.
1935080	1938720	Finally we tackled the phenomenon of carbocation rearrangements.
1938720	1943520	We saw how these commonly formed reaction intermediates are most stable when their charged carbon
1943520	1945440	is more substituted.
1945440	1949800	And we even saw how they can alter their structures through hydride and alkyl shifts
1949800	1955100	and ring expansions in search of more stable states.
1955100	1959940	So now that we have a basic understanding of why and how alkyl halides can react, we're
1959940	1964140	ready to take it to the next level and start considering exactly what we can make from
1964140	1968540	this versatile class of starting materials by combining them with other reagents.
1968540	1973180	In the next few lectures we'll see how the breaking of a carbon halogen bond can be a
1973180	1977980	part of many different chemical reaction mechanisms, all of which can be used to produce a host
1977980	1979360	of useful compounds.
1979360	1982640	It's finally time to start designing a synthesis.
1982640	1983400	I'll see you next time.
