1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
Today, I'm going to show you how to do the impossible.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,840
Okay, it's a little bit dramatic, but not entirely inaccurate.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,240
Now what would you say if I told you that I know how to deprotonate an alkane?

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:34,160
Now remember, the hydrogens of an aliphatic alkane, like the hydrogens in a molecule of ethane, for example,

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,840
are the single weakest acids of any compound that we've studied to date, with a pKa of somewhere around 60.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,240
Now that's literally trillions of times less acidic than alkenes,

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,960
which are themselves trillions of times less acidic than alkynes,

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,680
which are an extraordinarily weak acid in their own right.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,720
But if we could deprotonate an alkane, just imagine what a powerful nucleophile the resulting carbanion would be.

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,440
It's a tempting target, isn't it? But how do we do it?

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,240
So if we were to have a go at creating such a motif using proton transfer,

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,440
we would need a base whose conjugate acid has a pKa of at least 60.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,560
But what would such a base be? Right, the only option would be deprotonated alkane,

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
so we're right back at our original problem.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,320
Okay, you've got me here. This is a little bit of a trick question.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,680
It really is just about impossible to deprotonate an alkane under any kind of sensible laboratory conditions.

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,120
But there is a class of compounds which can be made to act like carbanions.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,120
In order to do this, we have to abandon the safety and simplicity of the first few rows of the periodic table.

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
We have to use a remarkable marriage between the usual suspects of organic chemistry,

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,400
like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and a newcomer to our discussion, metals.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:10,480
Today we're going to investigate a small slice of a field known as organometallic chemistry.

22
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,080
Now, before I continue, I need to advise you that we're only going to look at a very small set of organometallic compounds and reactions.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,040
Organometallic chemistry is used in a wide variety of applications, as we'll soon see,

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,200
and it's a science worthy of its own graduate level course when considered in its entirety.

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,120
Organometallic chemistry as a proper science got its start in a familiar place,

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,920
the lab of Alexander Butlarov at the University of Kazan in 1800s Russia.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,080
Butlarov had noticed that dialkyl zinc reagents, or chemicals containing

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,040
two organic alkyl groups bonded directly to a zinc atom through their carbons,

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,880
could be used to produce alcohols from ketones by transferring their alkyl group

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,960
to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,760
No doubt excited about the prospect of developing a new method for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds,

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Butlarov passed this project on to his protege, Alexander Zetsiv.

33
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,760
Zetsiv was able to apply his chemistry to several new substrates, but always with limited success.

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,680
These zinc-based reagents proved to be unpredictable and difficult to work with,

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
and as the sun set on Zetsiv's career, he seemed no closer to developing

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,800
reliable methods or rules for their use in synthesis.

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,000
It would appear that this particular line of research was destined for obscurity.

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:45,280
Then, in 1900, a young French graduate student by the name of Victor Grignard

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,440
blew the lid off of organometallic chemistry when he devised a powerful,

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,840
versatile, and adaptable organometallic reagent for use in the reliable production

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
of carbon-carbon bonds, which had eluded Butlarov and Zetsiv.

42
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,320
Grignard's story is truly inspirational for anyone struggling with their schooling.

43
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,800
He took a long and winding road through his college education,

44
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,680
and after starting as a secondary education student,

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,880
he failed to pass a standardized math examination, which landed him in the military for a short time.

46
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
When he returned from his service, he managed to move ahead with his education,

47
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,080
ultimately finding himself working in the lab of Philippe Barbier

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,760
at the University of Lyon in France in the late 1890s.

49
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,640
It was there, in Barbier's lab at Lyon, conducting experiments for his doctoral dissertation

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,760
that Grignard acted on a hunch, replacing the zinc from the only widely known class

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,520
of organometallics of the day with what he believed would be more reactive magnesium.

52
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,880
One of his first reactions was the combination of isoamyl bromide

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,240
with magnesium followed by carbon dioxide.

54
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,080
And the reaction produced what Grignard himself described as, quoting here,

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,840
a colorless liquid, distinctly of acidic character, with an odor of perspiration,

56
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
and at the same time of butter.

57
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,360
So it sounds like Grignard was really suffering for his science,

58
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,840
having chosen the reaction which produces the fragrance reminiscent of sweaty butter.

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,320
Nonetheless, I'm sure he was glad that he did, since his work not only earned him his doctorate,

60
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,200
but one half of the Nobel Prize 12 years later.

61
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,520
His co-recipient was his countryman Sabatier for his metal-catalyzed hydrogen addition reactions.

62
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,320
So let's take a look at a Grignard reaction. In fact, one of the original Grignard reactions

63
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
conducted by Victor Grignard himself.

64
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,800
Now this is a bit of an oversimplification, but it all holds true what's going on.

65
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,040
Victor Grignard started with the reagent isoamyl bromide, which is an alkyl halide.

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,720
To this he added magnesium. So when mixed with magnesium, isoamyl bromide

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,360
creates this new compound where the magnesium has been inserted between the carbon and bromine atoms.

68
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,640
So the consequence of this is, we placed our metal next to a carbon.

69
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
Now here's where organometallic chemistry really starts to differ from what we're used to seeing.

70
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,840
Magnesium has a very low electronegativity. And because of that, it creates a very strong

71
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,080
dipole with the negative end pointed towards the carbon. So this very high electron density

72
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,520
near the carbon to which the magnesium is bonded makes it act more like a carbon ion.

73
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,520
So we can think of it as being this even though we know that this species is very difficult to generate.

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,080
So Grignard mixed this Grignard reagent which acts like a carbon ion with carbon dioxide,

75
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
which has a very electrophilic carbon, the only carbon in the molecule of course.

76
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,240
So when we combine a very powerful nucleophile which acts like a carbon ion with a very good

77
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,280
electrophile such as carbon dioxide, we should all be well aware of what's going to happen next.

78
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,760
Nucleophilic attack creates a new carbon-carbon bond. And acidifying gives us our final product,

79
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,960
isocoprolic acid or isoamyl acid. Of course when Grignard made it, his reagent was not a

80
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,840
carbon ion but an alkyl magnesium bromide reagent, which means that we also have to

81
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,760
account for the magnesium in the bromine. Now what happens to them during the nucleophilic attack

82
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,080
is a bit complicated and case specific. But at the end of the reaction, the byproduct is magnesium

83
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,840
hydroxy bromide. So here we can see one of the driving forces behind the Grignard reaction.

84
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,160
Notice that what started as a neutral magnesium atom is now a magnesium 2 plus ion with a full octet.

85
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,680
So powerful is the desire for magnesium to have that octet that it can be used to drive carbon-carbon

86
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,200
bond formation. Grignard continued his research and discovered that his new nucleophile could be

87
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:30,240
used reliably to produce acids from carbon dioxide, secondary alcohols from aldehydes,

88
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:39,760
and also tertiary alcohols from ketones. In fact, Grignards are extremely versatile offering not

89
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:49,040
only ways to make alcohols and acids but also aldehydes from amides, tertiary alcohols from esters,

90
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,960
and many, many other reactions. It seems that when Grignard reagents are involved,

91
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,160
it's pretty much open season on anything with a carbonyl group.

92
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,480
But there is much more to the Grignard reaction. Easy though it is to run, there are certain

93
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,280
special considerations which must be taken to ensure its success, two in particular.

94
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:21,280
First, the Grignard reagent itself is only stable in ether solvents like diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.

95
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,960
Second, the reaction mixture has to be kept extraordinarily free of protic solvents including

96
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,880
water. So let's consider each of these two restraints individually then collectively.

97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,840
One of the great limitations of Grignard reactions is that alkyl magnesium halide reagents

98
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:51,120
can only form in ether solvents. But why is this? The answer lies in the ability of solvents to

99
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,200
coordinate metals. Now what I mean by this is that the solvent must have oxygen atoms with

100
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,880
lone pairs which can stabilize the Grignard by donating electrons to form a stabilizing

101
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:12,000
metal oxygen interaction in solution. That alkyl magnesium halide motif is so polar that it needs

102
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
a solvent which will be able to arrange its dipole beneficially to interact with the positive

103
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,600
charge density at the magnesium. For this purpose ether solvents are just the ticket.

104
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,840
Nonpolar solvents like hexanes or benzene are not capable of forming these kinds of

105
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,440
stabilizing interactions so they are clearly out as a solvent.

106
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,640
So Grignard reagents are polar. They're really polar. We get that. So why can't we use more

107
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,840
polar solvents like ethanol to dissolve them for reactions? Certainly ethanol has enough

108
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:55,040
polar oomph to get this reagent to form in solution, right? Well it does but with one devastating caveat.

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,920
Unlike ether, ethanol is protic and has a pKa of about 17. Remember, Grignards react like

110
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:13,360
carbon ions whose conjugate acid has a pKa of about 60. So a Grignard reagent might form an ethanol

111
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,960
for just a split second before reacting with that ethanol to form ethoxide and a hydrocarbon.

112
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,480
Clearly this is not a good way to make a Grignard. Now ethers like diethyl ether

113
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,520
and tetrahydrofuran are special because they strike a balance between their ability to

114
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,080
solvate a Grignard with their inability to react with it. And this is why they have been the preferred

115
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,760
solvent for this sort of reaction from 1900 right up until today. But using ether and THF

116
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,840
tetrahydrofuran isn't enough because these solvents are slightly polar. So ether can dissolve a small

117
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:59,040
bit of water itself. In fact, when left opened a bottle of ether will absorb about 1.5% of its

118
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,000
own mass in water from the atmosphere. So a bottle of ether left open by a careless colleague or

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,720
even simply one which has been opened and closed enough times to allow a small amount of air into

120
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:20,080
it can contain enough water to effectively ruin a Grignard synthesis. Our solution to this is to use

121
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,560
ether which has been chemically dried before use. And we accomplish this through the use of inorganic

122
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,960
drying agents like magnesium sulfate or a special kind of material called molecular sieves which

123
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,760
act like little mineral sponges absorbing the water from the ether and trapping it as a solid

124
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,560
complex which we can simply filter or decant to separate. Grignard reagents are an incredibly

125
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,920
versatile tool for attaching new carbons to electrophiles. So let's take a moment and summarize

126
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,320
just a few of the tools in the Grignard toolbox and their limitations. First, Grignards are made

127
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,560
using alkyl halide and magnesium metal mixed in an ethereal solvent. But they're not limited to

128
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,280
aliphatic R groups. Commonly used Grignards include unsaturated groups also like allyl

129
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,600
magnesium bromide and phenyl magnesium bromide. Grignard reagents provide a way to

130
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,640
access the kind of reactivity we would expect to get from an aliphatic carbanion without the

131
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,320
fuss of having to deprotonate one of the least acidic hydrogens known to man, the alkane CH bond.

132
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,080
Grignards can be reacted with carbon dioxide to form organic acids,

133
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,520
with aldehydes to form secondary alcohols and with ketones to form tertiary alcohols.

134
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,000
They can attack secondary imines to form secondary amides with varying degrees of branching.

135
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,960
Carbonyl compounds with leaving groups like acid chlorides attached to the carbon can undergo

136
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,240
multiple attacks by Grignard reagents, resulting in the addition of two alkyl groups giving us

137
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,840
an alternate route to make secondary or tertiary alcohols. So far today we've discussed the use

138
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,440
of metals to activate hydrocarbons and turn them into nucleophiles. Of course, organometallic

139
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,560
chemistry is far more varied and complex as a subject than just this small window on the science

140
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,240
would appear to imply. Organometallics have found their first few applications in the world of

141
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,920
organic synthesis, but their real potential cannot be appreciated until we take a look at another one

142
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:36,720
of their uses, catalysis. The use of organometallics harkens back to our old friend Sabatier, who

143
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,680
developed the technique for hydrogenating fats using platinum metal and who incidentally shared

144
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,160
the Nobel Prize with Victor Grignard. In modern laboratories, the reduction of alkenes to

145
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,880
alkanes is still a widely used technique, but the heterogeneous nature of Sabatier's method

146
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,520
leaves a lot to be desired. Hydrogenating double bonds at the surface of a solid catalyst may work

147
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,720
well on industrial scales, but in the laboratory a reaction which takes place in solution is far

148
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:17,520
more desirable. If we had access to a homogeneous catalyst, one which could be dissolved in

149
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,040
organic solvents along with substrates, we could run reactions much more efficiently and cleanly

150
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,840
in the lab, wasting less reagents and amplifying our yields. But the problem with this is that

151
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,880
metals themselves are not generally soluble in the kinds of solvents that one would use to dissolve

152
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:43,440
an alkene. But in 1966, a British chemist by the name of Jeffrey Wilkinson published a paper

153
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,320
outlining a way to solubilize a large transition metal like rhodium by bonding it to organic

154
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:59,600
molecules which we call ligands. These ligands are specially designed to be strong Lewis bases

155
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,360
which donate stabilizing electron pairs to the metal ion, forming a complex which gives it the

156
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,400
solubility characteristics of the ligands while retaining the catalytic activities of the metal.

157
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,400
Wilkinson's work is generally regarded as the seminal work in the field of organometallic

158
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,360
chemistry. His discoveries in this field launched an age of investigation into metal

159
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,400
ligand interactions that continues to this day in labs around the world. Wilkinson's work

160
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,640
has inspired the creation of some really exciting and exotic looking complexes.

161
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,120
You'll see extensions of his work in such life-changing compounds as

162
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,040
contrast reagents used for MRI imaging. The magnetic properties of many large metals make

163
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,600
them useful as tools to enhance the sensitivity of MRI imaging machines. But the problem is

164
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,200
that most heavy metals are highly toxic by themselves or don't accumulate in the necessary

165
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,800
tissues for them to be useful. The gadolinium ion is one perfect example of this.

166
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,680
Now when gadolinium is in its plus three state, it's a powerful atomic-sized magnet

167
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,520
and its presence is easily detected by such complex magnetic instruments as the MRI you

168
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,400
may see in a hospital. Unfortunately the gadolinium itself is very toxic and doesn't accumulate well

169
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:30,640
where we need it. So one solution to this problem is to complex metal ions with organic ligands

170
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,160
which render them far less toxic and also can cause them to selectively accumulate in areas

171
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,720
of interest in the body assisting in the imaging process. A classic example of this is the complex

172
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,480
of gadolinium-3 which is marketed under the trade name Dota-REM. Now gadolinium itself is an f-block

173
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,840
metal and its three plus ion contains seven electrons filling its f-sub shell or its outermost

174
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,120
sub-shell. Now electrons like their space so those seven outermost electrons in the f-block

175
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,600
of or in the f orbitals of gadolinium are unpaired and this gives it a tremendously powerful

176
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,240
magnetization. So this tiny little ion of gadolinium is producing an extremely powerful

177
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,000
magnetic field but only at atomic distances. Now Dota-REM is an ingenious way to exploit the

178
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,600
magnetic properties of gadolinium ions like this without dealing with toxicity issues and

179
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,080
solubility problems. Now this is accomplished using a complex organic ligand which looks like this.

180
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:47,120
Now we call molecules with large rings of many atoms like this one macro cycles and the key to

181
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,040
Dota-REM's safety and efficacy is not only this macrocyclic ligand which sits on top of the metal

182
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:00,640
but it allows it to attach its carboxylates around the edges. So these nitrogens and carboxylates

183
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,920
contain lone perelectrons and regions of dense negative charge which coordinate to the gadolinium

184
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:15,920
three ion. So this forms a cage around the ion preventing it from reacting with anything as it

185
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,760
circulates in your bloodstream and the ligands also have the effect of changing the solubility

186
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,120
characteristics of the complex presenting an organic phase instead of an ionic phase

187
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and this helps the Dota-REM accumulate in tumor cells. Now the final piece of the puzzle is this

188
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
last little bit of space on the bottom which is complexed to the oxygen of a water molecule.

189
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,080
So we place our water molecule under there you can see how close it is to the protected gadolinium

190
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:56,480
ion. The proximity of the water molecule to that gadolinium three makes it very easy to detect

191
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,200
using an MRI machine and physicians can then use MRI techniques to look for the magnetic effects

192
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,160
of the gadolinium three on the water molecule inside the patient thereby helping them locate

193
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:18,720
an image problem areas. Now not to be outdone by modern chemists nature herself has also devised

194
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,400
ways to use organic molecules which help not just humans but all other known species to get the

195
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,480
benefits of the chemistry of metals while coping with their inherent toxicities.

196
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,040
So let's take a look at a subunit of the structure of human hemoglobin it's a pretty big molecule

197
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:44,880
isn't it but if I remove all the protein atoms we see that leftover is a large cyclic ligand

198
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,360
known as a porphyrin and this porphyrin coordinates an iron atom in the center from four planar

199
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,920
positions. This metal ligand complex is commonly called heme and is the namesake of the oxygen

200
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,560
carrying protein hemoglobin. Now free iron is toxic in the blood but it's the coordination

201
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,000
of these four nitrogen atoms and also two histidines which come in from the protein itself

202
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,440
which give this molecule its life-sustaining ability to bind transport and release oxygen in the body

203
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,400
without being toxic to us. Now the heme ligand not only plays a role in oxygen carrying ability

204
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,600
of hemoglobin but its highly conjugated structure also makes it highly colored. Now when the iron

205
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,960
with the iron in place rather the heme takes on a familiar deep red color that we associate with

206
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:45,040
oxygenated blood but when physical trauma causes cells in the body to rupture and die the exposed

207
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:52,000
heme from their hemoglobin has to be cleaned up and this is done by enzymes which first break open

208
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,200
the ligand and this breaking of the ring forms a new compound known as biliverdin. It's a dark

209
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:07,280
green colored compound. The biliverdin is then further reduced into a compound known as bilirubin

210
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,200
which is yellow in color and this is the process of cleaning up a porphyrin ligand and it's also

211
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,480
what we commonly associate with the process of bruising. So the colors that you see underneath

212
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,320
the skin are actually the free heme from the traumatized cells being cleaned up by your own body

213
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,280
but nature's gone far beyond just using iron ions and porphyrin ligands to get jobs done.

214
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:40,400
Another great example is hemosyanin. Now rather than hemoglobin hemosyanin still transports oxygen

215
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,000
does this in crustaceans crabs and lobsters those sorts of animals but it does so using two copper

216
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,920
ions coordinated directly to a protein matrix which gives these lobsters crabs and other marine

217
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,080
animals a very different blood chemistry than mammals. So in this case the protein itself

218
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,400
is acting as the ligand for the copper ions which carry oxygen. Let's look at one more example

219
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:14,400
vitamin B12. Now vitamin B12 includes a compound called cobalamin and as the name implies cobalamin

220
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,120
has a cobalt ion complex in its center. Now this vitamin is used in the body to conduct

221
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,160
essential functions including synthesis of folic acid and again it's all dependent on having the

222
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:35,600
ligand in place to coordinate that metal. So nature one ups the organic chemists once again

223
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,360
having devised ligands far more complex than those of Wilkinson's catalysts or even dotarem

224
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,840
and they're capable of conducting much more powerful directed chemistry.

225
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,240
But why stop at one metal? Yet another of nature's chemists who continues to embarrass us all is the

226
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,760
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria which live in the root nodules of legumes like soy.

227
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,440
The molecule that they produce which allows them to fix nitrogen is a protein called nitrogenase

228
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,400
and it contains not just one metal ion but multiple clusters of them in complex with sulfur atoms.

229
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,080
Scientists have discovered and characterized two different forms of nitrogenase both of which

230
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,880
rely on iron to function, one of them exclusively and another one in concert with molybdenum.

231
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,080
Now even though these metalloprotein structures have been well known for decades their ability

232
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,280
to accomplish the same reaction at room temperature and pressures that Haber could only

233
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,040
accomplish at extremely high pressures and temperatures remains unexplained even today.

234
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,080
And when someone finally unlocks the secret to the chemistry of these large

235
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,080
powerful organometallic molecules the impact it will have on the world food supply

236
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,680
is likely to be as great as cold fusion would be for the power industry.

237
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,360
So today we started with one of Butler-Rov's projects in the 1800s.

238
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,360
We took a look at how he and Zetzev conducted some of the very first organometallic experiments.

239
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,160
Then we spent some time covering the reaction developed by Victor Grineard in 1900 which bears

240
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,360
his name and won him the Nobel Prize and also breathed new life into the floundering science

241
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:31,040
of organometallic chemistry. We talked about how his alkyl magnesium halides had the properties

242
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,920
of carbanions including strong nucleophilic character and extreme basicity. We covered how

243
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,040
this nucleophilic character makes no carbonyl safe in the presence of a Grineard leading to a

244
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,040
large library of potential substrates which can be used in conjunction with them.

245
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,120
We saw how Jeffrey Wilkinson is usually regarded as the father of modern organometallic chemistry

246
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,400
having devised a method to get rhodium and platinum of Sabatier's heterogeneous catalysts

247
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,560
into solution making them more effective homogeneous catalysts.

248
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,720
We then advanced on Wilkinson's ideas and took them into the biological realm seeing how

249
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,280
compounds like dota rem could get highly magnetic but extremely toxic gadolinium ions

250
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,120
safely into the bloodstream of cancer patients where they can help to detect tumors.

251
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,800
Finally, we indulged in Mother Nature a bit more and took a look at some pretty representations of

252
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,040
metal-containing proteins like hemoglobin and hemocyanins, mitrogenases and some vitamins

253
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,000
all of which carry out spectacularly focused chemistry in one way or another helping to

254
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,360
sustain the lives of those creatures that use them. We've come a long way from the simplest of

255
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:54,400
organic compounds, methane, to organometallics the size of nitrogenase. We've nearly run the gamut

256
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,000
of molecular size but there is one more class of organic compound to consider, the undisputed king

257
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,680
of molecular size, polymers, and they're the last class of organic compounds on our list.

258
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,760
Next time we're going to take a look at some world-changing polymers, how they were discovered,

259
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,200
how they're made, and how their size and modular composition make them an extremely

260
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,640
versatile class of compounds. I'll see you then.
