1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,340
In 1666, a young Isaac Newton first documented the separation of white light into its constituent

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,400
visible colors using a prism.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,320
And in his notes on this now famous experiment, he described the rainbow of colors he saw

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,920
as a spectrum from the Latin word meaning apparition.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,040
But what we didn't know at that time was that what he saw was only part of the story.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,000
It was another hundred years, more than that, in 1801 when a young self-taught scientist

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,840
by the name of Wilhelm Ritter acted on a hunch that maybe there was more to the spectrum

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,040
than what Newton had seen with his own eyes more than a hundred years earlier.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,560
The problem is that Wilhelm is a human and his eyes couldn't see any further along the

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,400
spectrum than Newton's could.

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,360
So Ritter needed a different kind of eye and he had just the tool for the job, silver chloride.

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,200
Now silver chloride is an inorganic compound which is most famous for its use in photographic

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
films.

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,480
Solutions of silver chloride undergo a chemical reaction in the presence of visible light

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,000
which causes them to dissociate into a suspension of silver metal and chlorine gas.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,640
In other words, the solution turns dark when exposed to light.

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,160
It was known even before Ritter that this reaction did not proceed at the same speed

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,440
in different colors of light.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,440
He could disperse light with a prism, then place vials of silver chloride solution in

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,800
different parts of the resulting spectrum, and clearly see that the reaction was fastest

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:02,040
in blue, slower in green, and slower still in the red portions of the spectrum.

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,440
Ritter's real contribution was that he decided to place a vial of silver chloride solution

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,360
outside of the blue colored light from the prism.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,020
His hunch paid off.

25
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,820
The solution outside of the blue end of the spectrum reacted even faster than any of the

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,720
samples in the visible area.

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,880
This experiment is remarkable because it clearly demonstrated the existence of light

28
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,040
with a frequency even higher than the violet light at the edge of the visible spectrum,

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,440
one which was not detectable to the human eye but had even more energy than visible light.

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,080
Ritter had discovered ultraviolet light.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,360
If you're watching these lectures in order, I'd like to congratulate you on completing

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,000
the structures and reactions segment of the course.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,400
You now have the basic knowledge and skills needed to understand and predict the reactivity

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,160
of organic compounds on paper.

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,800
But you must have asked yourself more than once during these lectures.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,160
How do we know how these molecules are reacting and behaving?

37
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,640
How can these structures and the changes we make to them be confirmed experimentally?

38
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,600
After all, organic chemistry is about science, and science is about what we can prove.

39
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
So where's the proof?

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,760
Well, today we begin answering these very fair and very crucial questions by discussing

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,640
the techniques which organic chemists and many others use to identify the products of

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,800
their work.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,760
Today we begin to explore the science of spectroscopy.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,280
Now most simply put, spectroscopy is the observation of the interaction of light with matter.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,840
Now before we can dive into spectroscopic techniques, we need to take a step back and

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,520
characterize what we generally refer to as light.

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,560
Light is in fact electromagnetic radiation, a form of self-propagating energy composed

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,680
of perpendicularly oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,920
It exhibits both wave and particle-like properties, and it carries energy and momentum.

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,560
Now it's the wave properties of light and the energy it carries, which are most interesting

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,360
to spectroscopists, and we're going to tend to classify light based on those properties.

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Now one of these properties associated with waves is the wavelength, or the distance from

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,440
one point on the wave to the next analogous point.

54
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,240
For example, the distance from the top of the peak on this end to the top of the next

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,600
peak here on my wave, this is defined as the wavelength.

56
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Now another property of light which interests us is its velocity.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,760
See light has a fixed speed at which it travels in a given medium, regardless of its wavelength.

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,920
Light in a vacuum always travels at 3 times 10 to the 8th meters per second.

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,600
Now I'm going to start my wave in motion, but I'm not going to start it at the speed

60
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
of light.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,360
So let's just move our wave now and pretend that this is the speed of light.

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Now the frequency of light is the number of equivalent points along that wave, which pass

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,520
by a given location in a specified time.

64
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,240
For example, my wave here has a frequency of about one oscillation per second.

65
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Now since the maxima pass designated points in one second intervals, that's my frequency.

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,680
Now it sounds a little bit awkward to say this wave has a frequency of one per second,

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,280
so we instead use a unit called Hertz.

68
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,480
This is a unit named in honor of German physicist Heinrich Hertz, who first characterized electromagnetic

69
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,480
radiation in 1887.

70
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:51,480
So the constant speed of light becomes a proportionality constant for the relationship between wavelength

71
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,640
and the reciprocal of frequency.

72
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,720
For example, if I were to decrease my wavelength by a factor of two, I'd just increase the

73
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,120
frequency by a factor of two.

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Now one last property of light, which is going to be of crucial importance to understanding

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,720
spectroscopy, is this.

76
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,920
Light does still have some particle character.

77
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,680
We call these particles of light photons.

78
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,400
A single photon of light contains an amount of energy, which is directly related to its

79
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,640
frequency by a factor called Planck's constant, sometimes shown in mathematical equations

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,200
as the letter H.

81
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,080
So a single photon of light has an associated wavelength, frequency, and energy, all of

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,400
which are related to one another mathematically.

83
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,120
So we classify light according to its frequency or wavelength, which are related to the amount

84
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,400
of energy carried by a single photon of that light.

85
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,200
We call this range of wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum.

86
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,920
The spectrum includes, in order of increasing frequency and therefore energy, radio waves,

87
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:18,240
microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma rays.

88
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,320
Radio waves can have wavelengths kilometers wide, and as we reduce the wavelength to about

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,280
the diameter of a baseball, we cross into the microwave region.

90
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,320
Continuing to reduce the wavelength to about the size of a human cell gets us to the infrared.

91
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,600
The visible has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers or about the size of a typical

92
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,880
virus, and the ultraviolet begins to approach the size of some of the larger molecules that

93
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,000
we've studied in the course, like proteins.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,480
Finally, from about ten nanometers on down, x-rays constitute the smaller extremes of

95
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,440
wavelengths, including the very high energy gamma rays that have wavelengths smaller than

96
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,920
the diameter of a single atom.

97
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,020
So the electromagnetic spectrum spans a dramatic scale of wavelengths, and therefore a dramatic

98
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,800
range of energies per photon.

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Because of this, each class of radiation tends to interact with molecules in its own unique

100
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,080
way, and scientists have devised a way to exploit all of them.

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,520
So let's try a spectroscopy experiment.

102
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,720
You ready?

103
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,480
Here I have two glasses of water and a flashlight.

104
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm going to shine my flashlight through the water.

105
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,680
Now you can see that both glasses of water basically allow all of the visible light to

106
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,200
transmit through them.

107
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Simple enough, right?

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now I'm going to add just a small bit of red food coloring to one of the two glasses of

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
water.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,360
And I'll use my highly specialized scientific tool to stir that.

111
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,120
Be sure it's well mixed.

112
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,320
Now I'll pass my white light back through the same two glasses, the original and the

113
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,720
one with the added food coloring.

114
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
You notice a difference?

115
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
You see something different, don't you?

116
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,880
Of course, the light reaching your eyes appeared white when it went through the first glass

117
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,200
because it contained only water, which didn't absorb anything, and you were able to see

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,320
all the wavelengths of light which were generated by the flashlight.

119
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,240
But in the second glass, you saw the light that was passing through appeared to be red.

120
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
And that's because the contents of the solution were absorbing the complementary color of

121
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,280
red or green.

122
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,560
So you know that something in that dye has to have the ability to absorb light of about

123
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
520 nanometer wavelengths.

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
Congratulations, you are now a spectrophotometer.

125
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
You just observed the interaction of light with matter.

126
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,520
And measurement of the interaction of light with matter is the function of all optical

127
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,240
spectroscopy instruments.

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,480
Now what distinguishes optical spectrophotometers in a lab from your eyes and mine is their increased

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,840
sensitivity and the ability to see the electromagnetic spectrum with far greater precision over a

130
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,080
far wider range of wavelengths than the human eye ever could.

131
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,040
Instead of seeing a combination of all visible wavelengths simultaneously, spectrophotometers

132
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,840
can give us information about each wavelength individually, telling us exactly which photons

133
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:35,240
are absorbed by our sample and which photons are not absorbed.

134
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,920
For the next few lectures, we will take a look at some of the ways scientists coax structural

135
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,040
information from molecules using spectrophotometers to sense how they interact with different

136
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,840
forms of light.

137
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,440
And we'll begin in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum today.

138
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,680
Of course, since Ritter's Day, the science of spectroscopy has come a long way.

139
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,000
We no longer have to move a sample from one band of light to the next to observe how a

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
sample is interacting with light.

141
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,560
Instead, we rely on sophisticated instruments called spectrophotometers to get this job done.

142
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,040
Now all spectrophotometers have the same basic functional parts.

143
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,120
How each part functions can be very different depending on the design and the technique

144
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,960
needed to solve a particular problem.

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,240
But all spectrometers or spectrophotometers consist of several crucial parts.

146
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,880
First, there's a light source, which generates a broad spectrum of light.

147
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,160
Now this can be as simple as an ordinary incandescent light bulb or a much more advanced lamp

148
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,200
capable of producing ultraviolet.

149
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,160
The light from this source is sent to a device called a monochromator.

150
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,840
The simplest example of this would be one of Newton's prisms in between two slits.

151
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,840
The purpose of the first slit is to ensure that all the light from the source reaches

152
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,280
the monochromator in a parallel pathway.

153
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,120
Once it gets into the center of the monochromator, we will see this beam being fanned out into

154
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,360
its spectrum just as Newton did in the 1600s.

155
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,600
The final slit is there to allow only one very small region of that spectrum to pass

156
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
on through.

157
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,000
The next element of our spectrophotometer is a beam splitter, which is really just a fancy

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,080
array of mirrors which accomplishes the task of dividing our monochromatic light beam into

159
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,800
two different beams which pass through two different regions of space.

160
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,400
These different regions of space are our sample and reference compartments.

161
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,320
So the beam which passes through my reference compartment will encounter really nothing,

162
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
just the reference.

163
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,360
So this would be like our glass of water in the original experiment today.

164
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,720
But the other beam passes through a sample cell and that sample cell contains not just

165
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,440
say water but water with dye in it, as in our example before.

166
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,120
So the difference between these two cells is the presence of the sample that we want

167
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
to study.

168
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,360
Finally, the exiting light beams encounter detectors.

169
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,360
And detectors have many different designs as well.

170
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,400
But essentially what a detector does is it turns the impact of photons into some kind

171
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,040
of an electrical signal which can be sent off to a computer which monitors the experiment.

172
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,480
And it's the differences in those signals between the light exiting the reference cell

173
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:37,040
and the light exiting the sample cell which are interpreted as the result of our experiment.

174
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,600
So the advent of the modern spectrophotometer allows me to not only say that my sample appears

175
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,360
red and therefore is absorbing green light, I can go much farther and determine exactly

176
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,920
how much of every wavelength in the visible spectrum is being absorbed to create the color

177
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,280
that I see.

178
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,400
But there's even more information available from this kind of experiment.

179
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,900
See, one of the very first of these devices was built by a German physicist by the name

180
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,400
of August Bier.

181
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,680
Now Bier is most well known for his law of absorbance which he proposed in 1852.

182
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,840
His law is concerned not with the maximum wavelength of absorption but with just how

183
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,540
strongly a given compound or sample absorbs.

184
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,980
What Bier observed is that incrementally increasing the concentration of a chromophore

185
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:32,740
or light absorbing molecule cut the transmittance of a sample by one half each time he increased

186
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
it.

187
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,660
Now similarly, for a given concentration of a sample the transmittance was cut in half

188
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,780
when the length of the cell was increased incrementally.

189
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,180
This relationship produces an exponential relationship like the one I'm showing you

190
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,060
here.

191
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,800
But scientists prefer to work with linear relationships whenever possible because they're much easier

192
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,620
to predict.

193
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:04,220
So Bier converted transmittance into a new unit called absorbance.

194
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,980
The absorbance is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of a sample's transmittance.

195
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,460
And when this is done the resulting plot is a very simple and useful relationship in which

196
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,020
incremental concentration or path length increase leads to incremental absorbance values

197
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,620
as well.

198
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,300
So Bier's equation relates absorption to three important factors.

199
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,100
A property of a given molecule called its molar absorptivity, which is essentially a

200
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,900
measure of how well it absorbs at a given wavelength, the concentration of the sample,

201
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,740
and the path length of the cell used in the experiment.

202
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,380
So if you know two of these three parameters for a given sample, measuring the absorbance

203
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,740
would allow you to calculate the third variable using Bier's law.

204
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,940
So this gives us a simple way to determine the concentration of solutions of known compounds

205
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:06,660
or to help identify compounds in solutions of known concentrations.

206
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,100
Now we saw in our discussion of conjugated alkenes how the frontier molecular orbital

207
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:18,300
energy of conjugated compounds decreases as additional p-atomic orbitals join the system.

208
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
So let's begin by restating a crucial proviso here.

209
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,980
That a single photon of light carries a specific packet of energy with it and that this energy

210
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,620
can be calculated from its wavelength and from Planck's constant using a relationship

211
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:40,580
of energy is equal to Planck's constant times the speed of light divided by the wavelength

212
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,540
of that particular photon.

213
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,300
So for example, using this equation I can determine that a photon with a 520 nanometer

214
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:56,860
wavelength carries with it exactly 3.82 times 10 to the minus 19th joules of energy.

215
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,940
No more, no less.

216
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,940
We sometimes convert these energies from joules per photon into kilojoules per molar photons

217
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,860
to make the numbers a little more manageable.

218
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:15,300
So in our example, 3.82 times 10 to the negative 19th joules per photon becomes 230 kilojoules

219
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,620
per mole of photons.

220
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,140
Second, let's set the rule that this photon will only be absorbed by a molecule when it

221
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,820
can promote an electron to a higher energy state.

222
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:33,620
In other words, when the orbital energy gap between occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals

223
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,780
are exactly equal to the energy packet of the photon.

224
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,380
Now let's take a look at a few molecules with distinctive UV spectra, compounds with

225
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,660
which we're pretty familiar by now, the conjugated alkenes.

226
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,860
Simple conjugated alkenes have pi systems which overlap very well with one another,

227
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,460
creating a virtual superhighway for electrons to move from one orbital to the next.

228
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,660
And when electrons move from the highest occupied pi molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied

229
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:12,140
pi molecular orbital, we call the transition a pi to pi star transition.

230
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,900
Now because of the fantastic geometric overlap of the associated orbitals, this absorption

231
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,740
occurs nearly every time an electron of sufficient energy strikes that molecule.

232
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:30,100
In other words, the extinction coefficient for the absorption can be very, very large.

233
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,820
Now recall from our lecture on conjugated alkenes that I can construct an energy diagram

234
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,100
for the molecular orbitals of a conjugated system.

235
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,620
And that when we did this for 1,3-butadiene and 1,35-hexatriene, we discovered that the

236
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:51,060
frontier molecular orbitals are closer in energy in the more conjugated compound.

237
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,620
Now if we were to carefully calculate the energies of the frontier molecular orbital

238
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,380
gaps, we would see the following trend for the first three alkenes in the series.

239
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:09,020
686 kilojoules for ethene, 540 kilojoules for 1,3-butadiene, and 452 kilojoules for

240
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,420
1,35-hexatriene.

241
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,220
Assuming that our earlier rules hold, this means that promoting one electron from the

242
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,820
homo of each compound to the lumo should require a photon with the exact same energy.

243
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:34,140
So ethene should require a photon of 686 kilojoules per mole or one with a wavelength of 171 nanometers.

244
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,820
1,3-butadiene requires a photon of 217 nanometers and 1,35-hexatriene requires a photon of 258

245
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,580
nanometers.

246
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,940
So there is a distinct correlation between the wavelength of maximum absorption and the

247
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,380
extent of conjugation in organic compounds.

248
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,980
And this trend continues into the visible spectrum as well, where compounds like beta-carotene

249
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:06,300
with its 11 conjugated double bonds has a maximum absorption at 454 nanometers.

250
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,780
So let's take a look at another example in the form of a compound so well understood

251
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,820
that it's frequently used as a reference standard for experiments like these.

252
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm talking about our old friend benzene.

253
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,580
Now benzene has a maximum absorption at 255 nanometers, lower than 1,35-hexatriene because

254
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,460
promoting electrons causes benzene to lose some of its aromaticity.

255
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,620
But let's take a look at the maximum absorption of benzene's cousins, naphthalene and anthracene.

256
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:41,860
Now see when we do, we notice that the overall trend of increasing lambda max or maximum wavelength

257
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:50,260
of absorption with increasing pi system size holds for our aromatics as well.

258
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,220
Of course, no discussion of the ultraviolet region of the spectrum is ever complete without

259
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:00,660
the mention of the single most well-known source of electromagnetic radiation, the sun.

260
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,540
In addition to the intense visible light emitted by the sun, it also constantly bathes the

261
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:12,980
planet in strong ultraviolet radiation which is capable of causing damage to cellular DNA.

262
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,580
The overall ultraviolet region of the spectrum is defined as the region between 100 and 400

263
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,140
nanometers in wavelength.

264
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,620
But spectroscopists and other scientists break the UV spectrum down into three general regions

265
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,820
which are commonly called UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.

266
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,340
So let's look at those one by one.

267
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,540
UV-C radiation spans 100 nanometers to 280 nanometers in wavelength.

268
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,780
UV-C is that portion of the UV spectrum which isn't normally found at the surface of the

269
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,380
Earth because it's naturally absorbed by the gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

270
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,860
This high energy, potentially damaging radiation, is absorbed by two naturally occurring atmospheric

271
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,980
gases in particular, oxygen which absorbs between 100 and 200 nanometers and ozone which

272
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,860
absorbs between about 200 and 280 nanometers.

273
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,900
So these two gases work in concert to protect us from all of the most dangerous UV light

274
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,180
reaching the planet.

275
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:22,420
UV-B radiation spans 280 to 315 nanometer wavelengths.

276
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,700
Now, it's that portion of the UV spectrum which reaches the surface and causes reddening

277
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,180
of the skin which we commonly refer to as sunburn.

278
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,900
Because of this, it was long thought that UV-B rays were the only dangerous form of

279
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,500
UV radiation reaching the planet's surface, leading companies to produce sunblock formulations

280
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,900
containing compounds like para-amino-benzoic acid or PHABA, which absorbs very well right

281
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,820
up to the edge of the UV-B.

282
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,820
UV-A radiation spans the 315 to 400 nanometer region of the spectrum.

283
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,580
And for a long time, it was thought that this lower energy UV light wasn't harmful to humans

284
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,140
because it didn't cause sunburn the way that UV-B does.

285
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,540
In the later decades of the 1900s, though, medical researchers began to recognize that

286
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,540
UV-A light can in fact cause cellular damage even though it doesn't cause a reddening

287
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,660
of the skin.

288
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,780
So modern sunblock formulations have abandoned PHABA in favor of compounds like octocrylene

289
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,780
and avalbenzone, shown here as its enol-tautomer.

290
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,220
So when we take a look at the UV spectrum as a whole and all those materials which we

291
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,380
use to protect ourselves from it, both man-made and naturally occurring, we should start to

292
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,060
notice a distinct trend.

293
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,420
Increasing the size of the conjugated pi system in the compound correlates directly with their

294
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,860
wavelength of maximum absorption.

295
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:02,780
From oxygen to ozone to PHABA, octocrylene and avalbenzone, each larger and more conjugated

296
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,020
than the next.

297
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,660
So using this predictive tool of extended conjugation, these products have been carefully

298
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:15,780
engineered to have very large extinction coefficients at very specific wavelengths to fill in the

299
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,780
gaps that Mother Nature left behind.

300
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,580
Some aromatic and conjugated compounds are also titratable, meaning that they can accept

301
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,660
and release protons, which can change their absorptive properties.

302
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,000
So let's belly up to the bar here.

303
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,500
Take for example, the anthocyanins in this red wine, well, blush wine.

304
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,100
Now anthocyanins are polyphenols, and that means that not only are they highly conjugated,

305
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,860
which gives them beautiful colors, but they also have hydroxyl groups on them which can

306
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,860
be protonated and deprotonated.

307
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,700
Now if you're an enophile, you might want to look away for this demonstration, because

308
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I'm going to take this wine, which is currently at a pH of about five, and I'm going to bring

309
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,580
it up, and we're going to watch the effect it has on the color.

310
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,500
Now to do this, I'm going to use a solution of sodium hydroxide, which is caustic, so

311
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:15,820
I'm going to find a glove that isn't destroyed, and I'm going to cover up my hands just for

312
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,060
safety's sake.

313
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,420
Of course what I'm about to do is also going to render the wine undrinkable.

314
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,620
So I'm probably going to make a few enemies, or at least not make any new friends by doing

315
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,780
this today.

316
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,980
So here we have the original wine.

317
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,100
You can see it's clearly red in color.

318
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:39,380
This is because of a compound called malvadenglucoside, and I have here a small Erlenmeyer flask

319
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:45,300
with an aqueous solution, that's water-based, of sodium hydroxide.

320
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,220
Now as a control, just to prove to you that there's nothing magical about what I'll be

321
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,260
adding to these wines, I'm going to put a few drops of my solution into a glass full

322
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:59,260
of water, and of course we see no color change or reaction of any kind taking place.

323
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:06,020
So clearly if we see any changes in these wines as a result of adding my hydroxide to

324
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,700
it, it has to be coming from something already in the wine.

325
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,940
I'll leave my second glass unaltered as our control, so we have a reference.

326
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,020
Now I'm going to add a little bit of my aqueous sodium hydroxide to my first victim today.

327
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,620
Did you see a change?

328
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,940
I know I certainly do.

329
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,100
Now the change that's taking place here is a result of deprotonating some of those phenolic

330
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,560
compounds, most notably the malvadenglucoside in the red wine.

331
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,220
But I can go even farther than that, and add a very large amount of my sodium hydroxide

332
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,220
to my third glass.

333
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Let's give it a little bit more just for good measure.

334
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,500
I'll cap my sodium hydroxide solution and give my wines one last swirl to be sure that

335
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,420
they're thoroughly mixed.

336
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Now what should be very apparent here is that something has changed.

337
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Clearly changing the pH conditions of the wine has altered the structure of these compounds.

338
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,500
Quite an impressive color change, isn't it?

339
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,340
So let's recap what just happened here.

340
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,900
The compounds which impart the color to the wine like malvadenglucoside have become deprotonated,

341
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,780
and removal of one or more hydroxyl protons allows the newly deprotonated oxygen atoms

342
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,060
to partake in resonance with the rest of the aromatic system, thereby extending the conjugation

343
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,980
and changing the frontier molecular orbital energies of the color-giving organic species

344
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,860
in the wine.

345
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,820
I've actually prepared some more samples here of the same wine that had been altered

346
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,140
with sodium hydroxide as well in varying proportions, and you can see that there's

347
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,540
actually a broad range of colors that can be achieved in this way.

348
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,900
Now as the conjugated pi systems here grew in energy, the pigments absorbed first in

349
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,900
the green, then in the orange, which resulted in a blue color, and finally in the red portion

350
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,700
of the spectrum, which your eyes detect as green.

351
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,260
And that is the chemistry of destroying a perfectly good rosé.

352
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,580
So today we started on our journey through the task of probing molecular structures.

353
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,420
We talked a little bit about light and the electromagnetic spectrum which comprises it.

354
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:28,100
We explored the relationships among wavelength, frequency, and energy in any given photon.

355
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,200
And we noted that a single photon carries a packet of energy which can only be absorbed

356
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,660
in a transition of equal energy.

357
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,940
We talked about UV light in particular, how Wilhelm Ritter discovered this type of electromagnetic

358
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:50,180
radiation using decomposition of silver chloride solutions with light separated by a prism.

359
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:55,100
We examined the general structure of a UV visible spectrophotometer from light source

360
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:01,260
to monochromator to beam splitter, sample and reference compartments, and finally detectors,

361
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:07,220
and how these units all work in concert to produce a UV visible spectrum.

362
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:13,180
Next, we discussed how extending conjugation in a compound leads to lower energy homo-lumo

363
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:18,300
transitions within the pi system of molecules lengthening the wavelengths of the associated

364
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,900
molecules' maximum absorption.

365
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,780
We saw how this concept can be used to explain how the Earth's atmosphere protects us from

366
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,700
UVC radiation, but we need to devise our own methods to protect ourselves from UVB and

367
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,980
UVA radiation.

368
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:41,340
And finally, you witnessed me doing the unthinkable and rendering a perfectly good wine undrinkable

369
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,820
by altering its pH.

370
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,620
In doing so, however, I demonstrated that the protonation state of many organic compounds

371
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,780
can profoundly affect their absorption characteristics as well.

372
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,260
Next time, we're going to turn our attention to the other side of the visible spectrum

373
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,460
and explore its other neighbor, infrared light, and how it interacts with molecules by a completely

374
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,660
different mechanism, yielding completely different information about structures.

375
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,700
And I promise, I won't destroy one single beverage during the entire lecture.

376
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,780
I'll see you then.
