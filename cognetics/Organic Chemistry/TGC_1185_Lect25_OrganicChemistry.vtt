00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
Today, I'm going to show you how to do the impossible.

00:15.760 --> 00:20.840
Okay, it's a little bit dramatic, but not entirely inaccurate.

00:20.840 --> 00:26.240
Now what would you say if I told you that I know how to deprotonate an alkane?

00:27.200 --> 00:34.160
Now remember, the hydrogens of an aliphatic alkane, like the hydrogens in a molecule of ethane, for example,

00:34.160 --> 00:41.840
are the single weakest acids of any compound that we've studied to date, with a pKa of somewhere around 60.

00:41.840 --> 00:46.240
Now that's literally trillions of times less acidic than alkenes,

00:46.240 --> 00:50.960
which are themselves trillions of times less acidic than alkynes,

00:50.960 --> 00:55.680
which are an extraordinarily weak acid in their own right.

00:55.760 --> 01:04.720
But if we could deprotonate an alkane, just imagine what a powerful nucleophile the resulting carbanion would be.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.440
It's a tempting target, isn't it? But how do we do it?

01:09.440 --> 01:14.240
So if we were to have a go at creating such a motif using proton transfer,

01:14.240 --> 01:19.440
we would need a base whose conjugate acid has a pKa of at least 60.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.560
But what would such a base be? Right, the only option would be deprotonated alkane,

01:24.560 --> 01:28.560
so we're right back at our original problem.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.320
Okay, you've got me here. This is a little bit of a trick question.

01:32.320 --> 01:39.680
It really is just about impossible to deprotonate an alkane under any kind of sensible laboratory conditions.

01:39.680 --> 01:45.120
But there is a class of compounds which can be made to act like carbanions.

01:45.120 --> 01:51.120
In order to do this, we have to abandon the safety and simplicity of the first few rows of the periodic table.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.680
We have to use a remarkable marriage between the usual suspects of organic chemistry,

01:55.680 --> 02:02.400
like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and a newcomer to our discussion, metals.

02:02.400 --> 02:10.480
Today we're going to investigate a small slice of a field known as organometallic chemistry.

02:10.480 --> 02:18.080
Now, before I continue, I need to advise you that we're only going to look at a very small set of organometallic compounds and reactions.

02:18.080 --> 02:23.040
Organometallic chemistry is used in a wide variety of applications, as we'll soon see,

02:23.040 --> 02:27.200
and it's a science worthy of its own graduate level course when considered in its entirety.

02:30.160 --> 02:35.120
Organometallic chemistry as a proper science got its start in a familiar place,

02:35.120 --> 02:39.920
the lab of Alexander Butlarov at the University of Kazan in 1800s Russia.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.080
Butlarov had noticed that dialkyl zinc reagents, or chemicals containing

02:46.080 --> 02:51.040
two organic alkyl groups bonded directly to a zinc atom through their carbons,

02:51.920 --> 02:56.880
could be used to produce alcohols from ketones by transferring their alkyl group

02:56.880 --> 02:58.960
to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.

03:00.560 --> 03:05.760
No doubt excited about the prospect of developing a new method for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds,

03:06.480 --> 03:10.480
Butlarov passed this project on to his protege, Alexander Zetsiv.

03:10.880 --> 03:17.760
Zetsiv was able to apply his chemistry to several new substrates, but always with limited success.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.680
These zinc-based reagents proved to be unpredictable and difficult to work with,

03:23.680 --> 03:27.680
and as the sun set on Zetsiv's career, he seemed no closer to developing

03:27.680 --> 03:30.800
reliable methods or rules for their use in synthesis.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.000
It would appear that this particular line of research was destined for obscurity.

03:36.800 --> 03:45.280
Then, in 1900, a young French graduate student by the name of Victor Grignard

03:45.280 --> 03:49.440
blew the lid off of organometallic chemistry when he devised a powerful,

03:50.240 --> 03:55.840
versatile, and adaptable organometallic reagent for use in the reliable production

03:55.840 --> 03:59.200
of carbon-carbon bonds, which had eluded Butlarov and Zetsiv.

03:59.920 --> 04:06.320
Grignard's story is truly inspirational for anyone struggling with their schooling.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.800
He took a long and winding road through his college education,

04:10.800 --> 04:13.680
and after starting as a secondary education student,

04:13.680 --> 04:18.880
he failed to pass a standardized math examination, which landed him in the military for a short time.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.240
When he returned from his service, he managed to move ahead with his education,

04:24.240 --> 04:28.080
ultimately finding himself working in the lab of Philippe Barbier

04:28.080 --> 04:31.760
at the University of Lyon in France in the late 1890s.

04:34.800 --> 04:40.640
It was there, in Barbier's lab at Lyon, conducting experiments for his doctoral dissertation

04:40.640 --> 04:45.760
that Grignard acted on a hunch, replacing the zinc from the only widely known class

04:45.760 --> 04:51.520
of organometallics of the day with what he believed would be more reactive magnesium.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.880
One of his first reactions was the combination of isoamyl bromide

04:57.440 --> 05:00.240
with magnesium followed by carbon dioxide.

05:01.520 --> 05:06.080
And the reaction produced what Grignard himself described as, quoting here,

05:06.080 --> 05:11.840
a colorless liquid, distinctly of acidic character, with an odor of perspiration,

05:11.840 --> 05:13.440
and at the same time of butter.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.360
So it sounds like Grignard was really suffering for his science,

05:19.440 --> 05:23.840
having chosen the reaction which produces the fragrance reminiscent of sweaty butter.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.320
Nonetheless, I'm sure he was glad that he did, since his work not only earned him his doctorate,

05:30.320 --> 05:33.200
but one half of the Nobel Prize 12 years later.

05:33.920 --> 05:39.520
His co-recipient was his countryman Sabatier for his metal-catalyzed hydrogen addition reactions.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.320
So let's take a look at a Grignard reaction. In fact, one of the original Grignard reactions

05:48.320 --> 05:50.160
conducted by Victor Grignard himself.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.800
Now this is a bit of an oversimplification, but it all holds true what's going on.

05:57.840 --> 06:03.040
Victor Grignard started with the reagent isoamyl bromide, which is an alkyl halide.

06:03.600 --> 06:08.720
To this he added magnesium. So when mixed with magnesium, isoamyl bromide

06:09.680 --> 06:15.360
creates this new compound where the magnesium has been inserted between the carbon and bromine atoms.

06:16.320 --> 06:22.640
So the consequence of this is, we placed our metal next to a carbon.

06:23.600 --> 06:28.080
Now here's where organometallic chemistry really starts to differ from what we're used to seeing.

06:29.280 --> 06:35.840
Magnesium has a very low electronegativity. And because of that, it creates a very strong

06:35.840 --> 06:42.080
dipole with the negative end pointed towards the carbon. So this very high electron density

06:42.080 --> 06:47.520
near the carbon to which the magnesium is bonded makes it act more like a carbon ion.

06:48.320 --> 06:53.520
So we can think of it as being this even though we know that this species is very difficult to generate.

06:54.880 --> 07:02.080
So Grignard mixed this Grignard reagent which acts like a carbon ion with carbon dioxide,

07:02.720 --> 07:07.520
which has a very electrophilic carbon, the only carbon in the molecule of course.

07:08.480 --> 07:14.240
So when we combine a very powerful nucleophile which acts like a carbon ion with a very good

07:14.240 --> 07:19.280
electrophile such as carbon dioxide, we should all be well aware of what's going to happen next.

07:20.400 --> 07:27.760
Nucleophilic attack creates a new carbon-carbon bond. And acidifying gives us our final product,

07:28.400 --> 07:34.960
isocoprolic acid or isoamyl acid. Of course when Grignard made it, his reagent was not a

07:35.040 --> 07:39.840
carbon ion but an alkyl magnesium bromide reagent, which means that we also have to

07:39.840 --> 07:45.760
account for the magnesium in the bromine. Now what happens to them during the nucleophilic attack

07:45.760 --> 07:52.080
is a bit complicated and case specific. But at the end of the reaction, the byproduct is magnesium

07:52.080 --> 07:59.840
hydroxy bromide. So here we can see one of the driving forces behind the Grignard reaction.

08:00.800 --> 08:08.160
Notice that what started as a neutral magnesium atom is now a magnesium 2 plus ion with a full octet.

08:09.680 --> 08:15.680
So powerful is the desire for magnesium to have that octet that it can be used to drive carbon-carbon

08:15.680 --> 08:23.200
bond formation. Grignard continued his research and discovered that his new nucleophile could be

08:23.200 --> 08:30.240
used reliably to produce acids from carbon dioxide, secondary alcohols from aldehydes,

08:31.840 --> 08:39.760
and also tertiary alcohols from ketones. In fact, Grignards are extremely versatile offering not

08:39.760 --> 08:49.040
only ways to make alcohols and acids but also aldehydes from amides, tertiary alcohols from esters,

08:49.040 --> 08:54.960
and many, many other reactions. It seems that when Grignard reagents are involved,

08:54.960 --> 08:58.160
it's pretty much open season on anything with a carbonyl group.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.480
But there is much more to the Grignard reaction. Easy though it is to run, there are certain

09:06.480 --> 09:11.280
special considerations which must be taken to ensure its success, two in particular.

09:11.280 --> 09:21.280
First, the Grignard reagent itself is only stable in ether solvents like diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.

09:23.040 --> 09:28.960
Second, the reaction mixture has to be kept extraordinarily free of protic solvents including

09:28.960 --> 09:34.880
water. So let's consider each of these two restraints individually then collectively.

09:35.040 --> 09:43.840
One of the great limitations of Grignard reactions is that alkyl magnesium halide reagents

09:43.840 --> 09:51.120
can only form in ether solvents. But why is this? The answer lies in the ability of solvents to

09:51.120 --> 09:57.200
coordinate metals. Now what I mean by this is that the solvent must have oxygen atoms with

09:57.200 --> 10:02.880
lone pairs which can stabilize the Grignard by donating electrons to form a stabilizing

10:02.880 --> 10:12.000
metal oxygen interaction in solution. That alkyl magnesium halide motif is so polar that it needs

10:12.000 --> 10:17.120
a solvent which will be able to arrange its dipole beneficially to interact with the positive

10:17.120 --> 10:23.600
charge density at the magnesium. For this purpose ether solvents are just the ticket.

10:25.120 --> 10:29.840
Nonpolar solvents like hexanes or benzene are not capable of forming these kinds of

10:29.840 --> 10:33.440
stabilizing interactions so they are clearly out as a solvent.

10:36.560 --> 10:42.640
So Grignard reagents are polar. They're really polar. We get that. So why can't we use more

10:42.640 --> 10:47.840
polar solvents like ethanol to dissolve them for reactions? Certainly ethanol has enough

10:47.840 --> 10:55.040
polar oomph to get this reagent to form in solution, right? Well it does but with one devastating caveat.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.920
Unlike ether, ethanol is protic and has a pKa of about 17. Remember, Grignards react like

11:03.920 --> 11:13.360
carbon ions whose conjugate acid has a pKa of about 60. So a Grignard reagent might form an ethanol

11:13.360 --> 11:18.960
for just a split second before reacting with that ethanol to form ethoxide and a hydrocarbon.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.480
Clearly this is not a good way to make a Grignard. Now ethers like diethyl ether

11:24.480 --> 11:29.520
and tetrahydrofuran are special because they strike a balance between their ability to

11:29.520 --> 11:36.080
solvate a Grignard with their inability to react with it. And this is why they have been the preferred

11:36.080 --> 11:43.760
solvent for this sort of reaction from 1900 right up until today. But using ether and THF

11:43.760 --> 11:51.840
tetrahydrofuran isn't enough because these solvents are slightly polar. So ether can dissolve a small

11:51.840 --> 11:59.040
bit of water itself. In fact, when left opened a bottle of ether will absorb about 1.5% of its

11:59.040 --> 12:06.000
own mass in water from the atmosphere. So a bottle of ether left open by a careless colleague or

12:06.000 --> 12:10.720
even simply one which has been opened and closed enough times to allow a small amount of air into

12:10.720 --> 12:20.080
it can contain enough water to effectively ruin a Grignard synthesis. Our solution to this is to use

12:20.160 --> 12:26.560
ether which has been chemically dried before use. And we accomplish this through the use of inorganic

12:26.560 --> 12:32.960
drying agents like magnesium sulfate or a special kind of material called molecular sieves which

12:32.960 --> 12:37.760
act like little mineral sponges absorbing the water from the ether and trapping it as a solid

12:37.760 --> 12:46.560
complex which we can simply filter or decant to separate. Grignard reagents are an incredibly

12:47.040 --> 12:51.920
versatile tool for attaching new carbons to electrophiles. So let's take a moment and summarize

12:51.920 --> 12:58.320
just a few of the tools in the Grignard toolbox and their limitations. First, Grignards are made

12:58.320 --> 13:04.560
using alkyl halide and magnesium metal mixed in an ethereal solvent. But they're not limited to

13:04.560 --> 13:11.280
aliphatic R groups. Commonly used Grignards include unsaturated groups also like allyl

13:11.280 --> 13:17.600
magnesium bromide and phenyl magnesium bromide. Grignard reagents provide a way to

13:17.600 --> 13:22.640
access the kind of reactivity we would expect to get from an aliphatic carbanion without the

13:22.640 --> 13:28.320
fuss of having to deprotonate one of the least acidic hydrogens known to man, the alkane CH bond.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.080
Grignards can be reacted with carbon dioxide to form organic acids,

13:34.640 --> 13:39.520
with aldehydes to form secondary alcohols and with ketones to form tertiary alcohols.

13:40.480 --> 13:46.000
They can attack secondary imines to form secondary amides with varying degrees of branching.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.960
Carbonyl compounds with leaving groups like acid chlorides attached to the carbon can undergo

13:52.960 --> 13:58.240
multiple attacks by Grignard reagents, resulting in the addition of two alkyl groups giving us

13:58.240 --> 14:05.840
an alternate route to make secondary or tertiary alcohols. So far today we've discussed the use

14:05.840 --> 14:11.440
of metals to activate hydrocarbons and turn them into nucleophiles. Of course, organometallic

14:11.440 --> 14:16.560
chemistry is far more varied and complex as a subject than just this small window on the science

14:16.560 --> 14:22.240
would appear to imply. Organometallics have found their first few applications in the world of

14:22.240 --> 14:27.920
organic synthesis, but their real potential cannot be appreciated until we take a look at another one

14:27.920 --> 14:36.720
of their uses, catalysis. The use of organometallics harkens back to our old friend Sabatier, who

14:36.720 --> 14:41.680
developed the technique for hydrogenating fats using platinum metal and who incidentally shared

14:41.680 --> 14:48.160
the Nobel Prize with Victor Grignard. In modern laboratories, the reduction of alkenes to

14:48.160 --> 14:54.880
alkanes is still a widely used technique, but the heterogeneous nature of Sabatier's method

14:54.880 --> 15:01.520
leaves a lot to be desired. Hydrogenating double bonds at the surface of a solid catalyst may work

15:01.520 --> 15:08.720
well on industrial scales, but in the laboratory a reaction which takes place in solution is far

15:08.720 --> 15:17.520
more desirable. If we had access to a homogeneous catalyst, one which could be dissolved in

15:17.520 --> 15:23.040
organic solvents along with substrates, we could run reactions much more efficiently and cleanly

15:23.040 --> 15:29.840
in the lab, wasting less reagents and amplifying our yields. But the problem with this is that

15:29.840 --> 15:34.880
metals themselves are not generally soluble in the kinds of solvents that one would use to dissolve

15:34.880 --> 15:43.440
an alkene. But in 1966, a British chemist by the name of Jeffrey Wilkinson published a paper

15:43.440 --> 15:50.320
outlining a way to solubilize a large transition metal like rhodium by bonding it to organic

15:50.320 --> 15:59.600
molecules which we call ligands. These ligands are specially designed to be strong Lewis bases

15:59.600 --> 16:05.360
which donate stabilizing electron pairs to the metal ion, forming a complex which gives it the

16:05.360 --> 16:10.400
solubility characteristics of the ligands while retaining the catalytic activities of the metal.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.400
Wilkinson's work is generally regarded as the seminal work in the field of organometallic

16:16.400 --> 16:21.360
chemistry. His discoveries in this field launched an age of investigation into metal

16:21.360 --> 16:28.400
ligand interactions that continues to this day in labs around the world. Wilkinson's work

16:28.400 --> 16:32.640
has inspired the creation of some really exciting and exotic looking complexes.

16:33.520 --> 16:37.120
You'll see extensions of his work in such life-changing compounds as

16:37.120 --> 16:43.040
contrast reagents used for MRI imaging. The magnetic properties of many large metals make

16:43.040 --> 16:49.600
them useful as tools to enhance the sensitivity of MRI imaging machines. But the problem is

16:49.600 --> 16:55.200
that most heavy metals are highly toxic by themselves or don't accumulate in the necessary

16:55.200 --> 17:00.800
tissues for them to be useful. The gadolinium ion is one perfect example of this.

17:03.280 --> 17:09.680
Now when gadolinium is in its plus three state, it's a powerful atomic-sized magnet

17:10.640 --> 17:15.520
and its presence is easily detected by such complex magnetic instruments as the MRI you

17:15.520 --> 17:22.400
may see in a hospital. Unfortunately the gadolinium itself is very toxic and doesn't accumulate well

17:22.400 --> 17:30.640
where we need it. So one solution to this problem is to complex metal ions with organic ligands

17:30.640 --> 17:36.160
which render them far less toxic and also can cause them to selectively accumulate in areas

17:36.160 --> 17:42.720
of interest in the body assisting in the imaging process. A classic example of this is the complex

17:42.720 --> 17:50.480
of gadolinium-3 which is marketed under the trade name Dota-REM. Now gadolinium itself is an f-block

17:50.480 --> 17:57.840
metal and its three plus ion contains seven electrons filling its f-sub shell or its outermost

17:57.920 --> 18:05.120
sub-shell. Now electrons like their space so those seven outermost electrons in the f-block

18:05.120 --> 18:11.600
of or in the f orbitals of gadolinium are unpaired and this gives it a tremendously powerful

18:11.600 --> 18:18.240
magnetization. So this tiny little ion of gadolinium is producing an extremely powerful

18:18.240 --> 18:26.000
magnetic field but only at atomic distances. Now Dota-REM is an ingenious way to exploit the

18:26.000 --> 18:31.600
magnetic properties of gadolinium ions like this without dealing with toxicity issues and

18:31.600 --> 18:38.080
solubility problems. Now this is accomplished using a complex organic ligand which looks like this.

18:39.840 --> 18:47.120
Now we call molecules with large rings of many atoms like this one macro cycles and the key to

18:47.120 --> 18:53.040
Dota-REM's safety and efficacy is not only this macrocyclic ligand which sits on top of the metal

18:53.680 --> 19:00.640
but it allows it to attach its carboxylates around the edges. So these nitrogens and carboxylates

19:00.640 --> 19:07.920
contain lone perelectrons and regions of dense negative charge which coordinate to the gadolinium

19:07.920 --> 19:15.920
three ion. So this forms a cage around the ion preventing it from reacting with anything as it

19:15.920 --> 19:21.760
circulates in your bloodstream and the ligands also have the effect of changing the solubility

19:21.760 --> 19:27.120
characteristics of the complex presenting an organic phase instead of an ionic phase

19:28.000 --> 19:36.000
and this helps the Dota-REM accumulate in tumor cells. Now the final piece of the puzzle is this

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
last little bit of space on the bottom which is complexed to the oxygen of a water molecule.

19:43.520 --> 19:48.080
So we place our water molecule under there you can see how close it is to the protected gadolinium

19:48.080 --> 19:56.480
ion. The proximity of the water molecule to that gadolinium three makes it very easy to detect

19:56.480 --> 20:03.200
using an MRI machine and physicians can then use MRI techniques to look for the magnetic effects

20:03.200 --> 20:10.160
of the gadolinium three on the water molecule inside the patient thereby helping them locate

20:10.240 --> 20:18.720
an image problem areas. Now not to be outdone by modern chemists nature herself has also devised

20:18.720 --> 20:24.400
ways to use organic molecules which help not just humans but all other known species to get the

20:24.400 --> 20:28.480
benefits of the chemistry of metals while coping with their inherent toxicities.

20:31.120 --> 20:37.040
So let's take a look at a subunit of the structure of human hemoglobin it's a pretty big molecule

20:37.040 --> 20:44.880
isn't it but if I remove all the protein atoms we see that leftover is a large cyclic ligand

20:44.880 --> 20:51.360
known as a porphyrin and this porphyrin coordinates an iron atom in the center from four planar

20:51.360 --> 20:57.920
positions. This metal ligand complex is commonly called heme and is the namesake of the oxygen

20:57.920 --> 21:04.560
carrying protein hemoglobin. Now free iron is toxic in the blood but it's the coordination

21:04.560 --> 21:10.000
of these four nitrogen atoms and also two histidines which come in from the protein itself

21:10.640 --> 21:17.440
which give this molecule its life-sustaining ability to bind transport and release oxygen in the body

21:17.440 --> 21:24.400
without being toxic to us. Now the heme ligand not only plays a role in oxygen carrying ability

21:24.400 --> 21:31.600
of hemoglobin but its highly conjugated structure also makes it highly colored. Now when the iron

21:31.600 --> 21:36.960
with the iron in place rather the heme takes on a familiar deep red color that we associate with

21:36.960 --> 21:45.040
oxygenated blood but when physical trauma causes cells in the body to rupture and die the exposed

21:45.040 --> 21:52.000
heme from their hemoglobin has to be cleaned up and this is done by enzymes which first break open

21:52.000 --> 21:59.200
the ligand and this breaking of the ring forms a new compound known as biliverdin. It's a dark

21:59.200 --> 22:07.280
green colored compound. The biliverdin is then further reduced into a compound known as bilirubin

22:07.280 --> 22:13.200
which is yellow in color and this is the process of cleaning up a porphyrin ligand and it's also

22:13.200 --> 22:18.480
what we commonly associate with the process of bruising. So the colors that you see underneath

22:18.480 --> 22:24.320
the skin are actually the free heme from the traumatized cells being cleaned up by your own body

22:24.320 --> 22:31.280
but nature's gone far beyond just using iron ions and porphyrin ligands to get jobs done.

22:32.160 --> 22:40.400
Another great example is hemosyanin. Now rather than hemoglobin hemosyanin still transports oxygen

22:40.400 --> 22:46.000
does this in crustaceans crabs and lobsters those sorts of animals but it does so using two copper

22:46.000 --> 22:51.920
ions coordinated directly to a protein matrix which gives these lobsters crabs and other marine

22:51.920 --> 22:58.080
animals a very different blood chemistry than mammals. So in this case the protein itself

22:58.080 --> 23:04.400
is acting as the ligand for the copper ions which carry oxygen. Let's look at one more example

23:05.360 --> 23:14.400
vitamin B12. Now vitamin B12 includes a compound called cobalamin and as the name implies cobalamin

23:14.400 --> 23:21.120
has a cobalt ion complex in its center. Now this vitamin is used in the body to conduct

23:21.120 --> 23:26.160
essential functions including synthesis of folic acid and again it's all dependent on having the

23:26.160 --> 23:35.600
ligand in place to coordinate that metal. So nature one ups the organic chemists once again

23:36.320 --> 23:41.360
having devised ligands far more complex than those of Wilkinson's catalysts or even dotarem

23:42.000 --> 23:45.840
and they're capable of conducting much more powerful directed chemistry.

23:46.400 --> 23:52.240
But why stop at one metal? Yet another of nature's chemists who continues to embarrass us all is the

23:52.240 --> 23:57.760
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria which live in the root nodules of legumes like soy.

23:59.440 --> 24:05.440
The molecule that they produce which allows them to fix nitrogen is a protein called nitrogenase

24:06.080 --> 24:12.400
and it contains not just one metal ion but multiple clusters of them in complex with sulfur atoms.

24:13.200 --> 24:18.080
Scientists have discovered and characterized two different forms of nitrogenase both of which

24:18.080 --> 24:24.880
rely on iron to function, one of them exclusively and another one in concert with molybdenum.

24:26.880 --> 24:32.080
Now even though these metalloprotein structures have been well known for decades their ability

24:32.080 --> 24:37.280
to accomplish the same reaction at room temperature and pressures that Haber could only

24:38.240 --> 24:43.040
accomplish at extremely high pressures and temperatures remains unexplained even today.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.080
And when someone finally unlocks the secret to the chemistry of these large

24:48.640 --> 24:54.080
powerful organometallic molecules the impact it will have on the world food supply

24:54.080 --> 24:57.680
is likely to be as great as cold fusion would be for the power industry.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.360
So today we started with one of Butler-Rov's projects in the 1800s.

25:05.680 --> 25:11.360
We took a look at how he and Zetzev conducted some of the very first organometallic experiments.

25:13.040 --> 25:18.160
Then we spent some time covering the reaction developed by Victor Grineard in 1900 which bears

25:18.160 --> 25:23.360
his name and won him the Nobel Prize and also breathed new life into the floundering science

25:23.360 --> 25:31.040
of organometallic chemistry. We talked about how his alkyl magnesium halides had the properties

25:31.120 --> 25:37.920
of carbanions including strong nucleophilic character and extreme basicity. We covered how

25:37.920 --> 25:43.040
this nucleophilic character makes no carbonyl safe in the presence of a Grineard leading to a

25:43.040 --> 25:47.040
large library of potential substrates which can be used in conjunction with them.

25:49.600 --> 25:55.120
We saw how Jeffrey Wilkinson is usually regarded as the father of modern organometallic chemistry

25:55.120 --> 26:00.400
having devised a method to get rhodium and platinum of Sabatier's heterogeneous catalysts

26:00.400 --> 26:04.560
into solution making them more effective homogeneous catalysts.

26:06.400 --> 26:10.720
We then advanced on Wilkinson's ideas and took them into the biological realm seeing how

26:10.720 --> 26:17.280
compounds like dota rem could get highly magnetic but extremely toxic gadolinium ions

26:17.280 --> 26:21.120
safely into the bloodstream of cancer patients where they can help to detect tumors.

26:21.680 --> 26:26.800
Finally, we indulged in Mother Nature a bit more and took a look at some pretty representations of

26:26.800 --> 26:33.040
metal-containing proteins like hemoglobin and hemocyanins, mitrogenases and some vitamins

26:33.040 --> 26:38.000
all of which carry out spectacularly focused chemistry in one way or another helping to

26:38.000 --> 26:45.360
sustain the lives of those creatures that use them. We've come a long way from the simplest of

26:45.680 --> 26:54.400
organic compounds, methane, to organometallics the size of nitrogenase. We've nearly run the gamut

26:54.400 --> 27:02.000
of molecular size but there is one more class of organic compound to consider, the undisputed king

27:02.000 --> 27:07.680
of molecular size, polymers, and they're the last class of organic compounds on our list.

27:09.040 --> 27:13.760
Next time we're going to take a look at some world-changing polymers, how they were discovered,

27:14.320 --> 27:19.200
how they're made, and how their size and modular composition make them an extremely

27:19.200 --> 27:24.640
versatile class of compounds. I'll see you then.
