0	16880	Welcome to our closing lecture on organic chemistry.
16880	21320	The final lecture of this course is bittersweet for me, but it's also exciting for me to
21320	25300	think about how much you've learned and that you are now ready to take that knowledge
25300	29160	with you out into the world.
29160	34600	We spent 35 lectures exploring the definition of organic chemistry, the theories upon which
34600	40120	it is built, and many examples of how organic chemistry as a science has touched our lives
40120	43440	and steered our history as a species.
43440	48240	It's unlikely that Lavassier and Buller ever dreamed that simply by challenging historical
48240	53320	ideas that they would help to start 300 years of experimentation, which would ultimately
53320	59120	lead us to where we are today, at the precipice of understanding the origins of our own existence.
60120	64800	The scientists who follow them carry that understanding forward in ways which have improved
64800	69380	the lives of billions of people on the planet today, and countless more who will come after
69380	71880	them.
71880	77120	So now that we understand and appreciate the contribution of these past researchers,
77120	80200	I think we've earned the right to have a little bit of fun.
80200	84240	Let's turn our attention forward and dream about the future that will be created by
84240	88900	the scientists who stand on the shoulders of these giants, who helped us understand the
88900	93940	chemistry carbon-based compounds.
93940	98660	One of the most exciting frontiers in modern organic chemistry is its interface with other
98660	103900	scientific disciplines like biology, engineering, and earth sciences.
103900	109020	So why not start there and ask the question, how might this interface help us create a
109020	114660	better world for ourselves in the coming decades?
114660	121500	If you'll pardon a pun, our understanding of the origins of life continue to evolve.
121500	126060	Even as the scientific community begins to get a handle on just how complex biological
126060	132940	systems can be, like those driving DNA translation or protein structure and function, we still
132940	138380	struggle with the simplest question of all, how did it all get started?
138380	143060	Even now, evidence of exactly how the first carbon-containing compounds blinked into existence
143060	147740	on earth is scarce.
147740	151820	Stanley Miller gave us some insight into how certain biological materials might form
151820	156980	under the conditions of the primitive earth's atmosphere some three billion years ago.
156980	161620	But there are those who believe that these molecules didn't form on earth at all.
161620	168700	There are those who think that life may have literally fallen to earth from outer space.
168700	174860	In 1969, a huge fireball rocketed across the Australian sky before separating into several
174860	181300	pieces and finally crashing to earth near the town of Merchison, Victoria.
181300	184900	This meteorite strike is unusual in three important ways.
184900	189940	First, it was witnessed so there's no debating its extraterrestrial origins.
189940	195360	Second, it was rather large, delivering more than 100 kilograms of material to the surface
195360	196900	of the earth.
197900	202980	And finally, the most fascinating characteristic of this meteorite is that it appears to have
202980	209100	carried with it a buffet of organic compounds which is hard to believe.
209100	213840	As spectroscopic techniques continue to advance, the Merchison meteorite has been analyzed from
213840	219860	time to time, always with new and interesting results.
219860	225020	In 2010, for example, a group of researchers attempted to extract organic compounds from
225020	228420	freshly broken samples of the Merchison.
228420	233940	Now careful chromatographic separation of the extracts, analyzed by mass spectrometry
233940	239900	and NMR spectroscopy techniques, revealed that the meteorite contained not just a few,
239900	246580	but thousands or even tens of thousands of different small organic molecules all encased
246580	247420	within it.
249940	253840	Of course, the implication here is that just like the meteorite, which is unquestionably
253840	259800	an authentic space rock, those molecules which were trapped within its matrix must have fallen
259800	262360	from space.
262360	264280	So this brings up new questions.
264280	271920	If the Merchison results are accurate, just how did these compounds get there?
271920	277000	Even more tantalizing evidence of extraterrestrial organics has been collected in recent decades
277000	282840	as organizations like NASA launch sophisticated probes in telescopes like the Spitzer Space
282840	284840	Telescope.
284840	290000	The Spitzer operated in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, and it looked
290000	296520	at interstellar space through infrared eyes, sensing absorptions caused by organic molecular
296520	304400	vibrations occurring tens or even hundreds of thousands of light years away or more.
304400	308560	Perhaps not surprisingly, in light of the Merchison meteorite results, Spitzer indeed
308560	315960	found not only evidence of carbon, but specifically of sp3 hybridized carbon.
315960	321160	A clear absorbance at 2900 wave numbers was reported when the telescope was pointed at
321160	323640	interstellar space.
323640	328920	That's an absorption corresponding to the CH bond vibrations one would find in a typical
328920	333080	organic compound.
333080	334800	The implication?
334800	342160	That organic carbon does indeed exist in abundance in regions of space which harbor little else.
342160	347480	It would seem that even the void of deep space may harbor the seeds of life.
347480	352440	So the more we search, the more we seem to find evidence that organics can spontaneously
352440	357480	form, not only on Earth, but elsewhere in the universe, potentially seeding the cosmos
357480	361920	with life.
361920	366600	Yet another curiosity which scientists are still trying to address is this.
366600	372000	All life on Earth that we know of uses L, or left-handed, amino acids as the principal
372000	375620	constituent of the proteins of life.
375620	380360	That means that even though we may think of ourselves as being achiral at the macroscopic
380360	388280	level, we are in fact not symmetrical when we look at ourselves through molecular eyes.
388280	393600	For example, the amino acids and proteins making up the skin and muscle in your arms
393600	396000	are all of one-handedness.
396000	401720	So if you could look at your right index finger and your left index finger with atomic resolution,
401720	405400	they would in fact not be reflections of one another.
405400	411280	So at the molecular level, you are chiral.
411280	417040	Yet every reliable source of data on abiologically synthesized organics, from those formed in
417040	421200	Miller's primitive Earth experiment, to the interstellar stowaways on the Merchison
421200	429880	meteorite, suggests that racemic mixtures of these compounds are created in natural processes.
429880	432960	This leads us to two important questions.
432960	436360	First, why L amino acids?
436360	440280	The molecular machinery which our bodies use to create proteins and enzymes we need to
440280	445680	live are chiral themselves, so it makes sense that we should use all of one-handed amino
445680	447240	acid or the other.
447240	450840	So clearly, nature had to make a choice early on.
450840	457360	Left-handed biochemistry or right-handed biochemistry?
457360	462200	But is there any real difference between our biochemical world and its mirror image?
462200	467120	Is there some quantum mechanical effect that we don't understand perfectly which dictated
467120	468600	that choice?
468600	476560	Or was it a cosmic coin toss that led us to be composed of L amino acids instead of D?
476560	481520	This question was effectively answered in the early 1990s, when the labs of Stephen Kent
481520	487320	at Scripps Research Institute created a right-handed version of a naturally occurring left-handed
487320	491240	protein, HIV protease.
491240	495560	Kent used modified techniques pioneered by Bruce Merrifield to create a perfect mirror
495560	498620	image of that protein.
498620	504440	He then tested it for activity against mirror images of its normal substrates, finding that
504440	509720	the chemical activity of his right-handed protein was identical in every way to the left-handed
509720	513080	version.
513080	517040	This closed the book on the question of handedness in the chemistry of life.
517040	521600	Racemic sources of material which led to our left-handed biochemistry should be equally
521600	525200	capable of seeding right-handed biochemistry.
525200	530600	So if we ever do make contact with extraterrestrial carbon-based life forms, it would appear
530600	536400	that there's a 50% chance that their biochemistry will be not exactly the same as our own, but
536400	540520	rather a perfect reflection of our own.
540520	544340	But Kent's research opened up a whole new vein of inquiry.
544340	548600	Now that we know that D amino acids can be used to create enzymes with every bit as much
548600	554920	power to promote highly specialized chemistry, researchers are trying to develop new therapeutics
555280	560760	made from those D amino acids.
560760	565160	It may be that someday these mirror images, which previously had no use in biology, or
565160	570920	little use in biology, will find use in the hands of humans who can not only rationally
570920	576440	design them, but produce them in laboratories for use as medicines, chiral catalysts and
576440	576800	more.
585520	589960	When humans sought to take to the air and fly, birds and their wings were an obvious
589960	593080	inspiration for the design of early aircraft.
593080	598160	In fact, evidence of working bird-shaped gliders may date as far back as ancient Egypt.
598160	604040	Now, scientists call this kind of design strategy one of observing the properties of natural
604040	608640	systems and applying them to engineering, bio-mimicry.
608640	613600	And we've been doing this for a very, very long time.
613600	619040	And just as the designs of some planes, trains and boats have been inspired by nature, as
619040	624040	we learn more and more about the biomolecular world, scientists, more and more, turn to
624040	629320	the biological for inspiration in their designs of useful compounds.
629320	633880	This may one day help us to accomplish similar chemistry to the molecules of life, but with
633880	638800	smaller compounds which are more easily obtained and whose properties are more easily adjusted
638800	644240	and tuned than their larger biological counterparts.
644240	650040	We call this practice of imitating the function of biological molecules, biomimetic chemistry.
650040	654720	And it may provide the springboard that we need to create small molecules with the exact
654720	659600	chemical properties that we need to accomplish a number of tasks.
659600	663360	Take the example of oxygen transport and storage.
663360	668560	Our bodies and those of many other animals rely on hemoglobin to bind, transport and
668560	674040	release oxygen within our bodies so that our cells have the oxidizer that they need to
674040	681040	carry out cellular respiration and give us life-sustaining chemical energy.
681040	686320	Hemoglobin consists of four proteins bound together in a quaternary structure which supports
686320	689400	four organometallic heme molecules.
690400	695840	It's here at the iron atom within the heme that oxygen binds when it is present in great
695840	699920	abundance, like in the air that enters our lungs.
699920	704800	Now that oxygen is then released in environments which are lower in oxygen concentration like
704800	709400	the tissues of our body where it's most needed.
709400	715040	The elegant balance of binding and releasing oxygen is mediated by the protein itself which
715040	720120	affects solubility and tunes the chemistry of the heme so that it grabs oxygen with striking
720120	724880	efficiency in the lungs, then transports it through the blood and releases it at just
724880	727280	the right time as well.
727280	731960	So proteins in a way are nature's organic chemists, tinkering with the properties of
731960	736240	small molecules and asserting an influence over how they behave.
736240	740080	Well, that sounds a lot like something that humans are learning to do for themselves,
740080	743400	doesn't it?
743400	747440	So can we abandon the large protein and substitute the knowledge that we've gained over the
747440	753800	past two centuries to create other molecules which can imitate the properties of hemoglobin?
753800	756360	Researchers at the University of Leeds think so.
756360	761720	They successfully synthesized what they called porphyrin-chord hyperbranched polymers which
761720	766880	have oxygen binding properties, very similar to hemoglobin, but can be easily created in
766880	770600	a laboratory.
770600	775240	Looking at the structure of a porphyrin-chord hyperbranched polymer, it's easy to see where
775240	778560	the inspiration came from for this compound.
778560	783280	It's also easy to see how someday compounds like this one might offer a non-biological
783280	788080	oxygen carrier for use in medical applications like surgery.
788080	792320	An artificial blood like this would all but eliminate concerns over disease transmission
792320	798120	or incompatible antibodies associated with human blood transfusions.
798120	803680	With available polymer arms which could be modified to achieve almost any solubility,
803680	808080	oxygen binding affinity, or other property that we need, we might even see compounds
808080	811920	like this in use one day, colonizing new planets.
811920	817240	The tenuous Martian atmosphere, for example, has a very small amount of oxygen in it naturally.
817240	822760	Now, solutions of biomimetic oxygen carriers might someday be used to extract that small
822760	827600	amount of oxygen from outside of a structure, pumping it back inside the building where
827600	837120	it's released, essentially creating a building which breathes so that its occupants can too.
837120	842280	But our ability to imitate life goes far beyond creating small mimetic molecules.
842280	848240	Remember that Ken was able to construct not only working copies of HIV protease from L-amino
848240	851680	acids but from D-amino acids as well.
851680	857280	This shows that even large biomolecules can be created abiologically and then used to
857280	862160	enhance or even create biological systems.
862160	866960	Yet another exciting advancement was made by scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute
866960	869240	in 2010.
869240	874440	This is when they reported that they had chemically synthesized a genome of over one million base
874440	883280	pairs, then substituted that DNA for the native DNA in a bacteria.
883280	888800	In this proof-of-concept experiment, the researchers made just a few small changes between the natural
888800	894120	DNA of the bacteria and their synthetic form, targeting regions of the genome which were
894120	899440	known to act as structural supports rather than those coding for specific proteins.
899440	904280	Now, such a simple change was enough that it could be detected in the cells which had
904280	909400	accepted the transplant without compromising the viability of those cells.
910400	914680	So the genetic deck was stacked in favor of success in this experiment.
914680	920640	Still, this achievement will no doubt take us to the next level of biomolecular engineering,
920640	926640	as it demonstrates clearly and effectively that the molecular machinery of life is modular
926640	931200	and can be transplanted from one cell to another.
931200	937040	This experiment shows it with enough understanding and cautious, dedicated effort, genetic material
937040	942960	and the cellular machinery which uses it can be mixed, matched and altered to produce
942960	946000	any biochemistry that we desire.
946000	951040	Someday we may even create entire cells from nothing more than chemicals on a lab bench
951040	957280	using organic reactions which are available to us today.
957280	960520	Just imagine what these cells might be designed to accomplish.
960520	965840	We could literally synthesize self-replicating microscopic production plants for fixed nitrogen
965840	970800	with nitrogenase activity many-fold more powerful than rhizobia.
970800	975440	We could create super red blood cells to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood used
975440	978320	in transfusions.
978320	983400	Imagine vast pools of photosynthetic bacteria of our own design, harvesting light and converting
983400	989680	it into biomass or even energy faster and better than any living thing ever has.
989680	993560	All to the benefit of mankind.
993560	998600	The possibilities are truly limitless and the inspiration for it all harkens back to
998600	1005720	that day in 1828 when Voler accidentally created urea on his lab bench and realized that mastering
1005720	1011760	the chemistry of carbon didn't require any mystical vital force but careful study and
1011760	1016640	application of the scientific method.
1016640	1021920	I'd also like to challenge you with one of humanity's major environmental concerns.
1021920	1026260	We spend a lot of time looking at how chemists build upon carbon scaffolds to make organic
1026260	1029480	compounds with new structures and properties.
1029480	1034440	And we saw how some of the major entry points for carbon into organic chemistry include
1034440	1039280	the hydrocarbons isolated from fossil fuels which can be halogenated to make reactive
1039280	1044760	substrates for substitution and elimination reactions.
1044760	1049640	We discussed how biological systems can also bring carbon into the organic world.
1049640	1053640	Science convert carbon dioxide into biomass which makes its way through the food chain
1053640	1058120	where it's used by organisms to produce all of the necessary chemicals to exist, some
1058120	1062880	of which are extracted from those living systems by opportunistic chemists like Justice von
1062880	1065040	Liebig.
1065040	1068560	But what about the exit point for carbon from organic chemistry?
1068560	1074080	It's a fair question, it's actually a very good question.
1074080	1079560	As our activities as humans concentrates carbon in our fuels and biomass, we have to ask
1079560	1084240	the question, where does that carbon go when we're done with it?
1084240	1088000	Carbon containing compounds contain a great deal of chemical energy.
1088000	1092680	And whether we are burning fuels or using foods for respiration, a large amount of the
1092680	1097820	organic material in the world is destined to become carbon dioxide.
1097820	1101880	And although it isn't particularly pleasant to think about when humans and other creatures
1101880	1106920	are done with their biomass for good, decomposition naturally releases much of their carbon as
1106920	1110680	CO2 as well.
1110680	1114880	Now that might not sound like a big problem, after all carbon dioxide's a gas so it's
1114880	1117640	just carried away by the atmosphere, right?
1117640	1119400	Well not quite.
1119400	1124120	We know from our discussions on spectroscopy just how powerful an IR absorber the carbon
1124120	1129600	oxygen double bond can be because the vibrations of those very polar bonds in the molecule
1129600	1132280	give it a strong absorption.
1132280	1136800	Recall also from Sir William Herschel's experiments that when objects absorb infrared
1136800	1141680	light, they tend to heat up.
1141680	1147120	So carbon dioxide acts as what we call a greenhouse gas, absorbing radiated heat from
1147120	1152880	the Earth's surface leading to climate change when it's not properly balanced.
1152880	1157480	This has led to a global movement to devise ways to store and use carbon dioxide in ways
1157480	1161280	which prevent its release into the atmosphere.
1161280	1167040	For example, the U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that 2.4 billion metric tons
1167040	1173000	of industrially produced CO2 could be stored by injecting it into subsurface structures
1173000	1178360	like unminable coal seams where it can become adsorbed to the surface of the underground
1178360	1181400	deposit.
1181400	1185880	The concern here is that there are other gases already bound to coal in seams like these,
1185880	1187800	most notably methane.
1187800	1192200	Obviously, those who advocate this method are betting on irreversible strong binding
1192200	1197640	of carbon dioxide to subsurface structures like the carbon-rich coal deposits of coal
1197640	1202120	seams, binding so strong that hopefully it can displace methane.
1202120	1204720	Now, could such an idea work?
1204720	1210040	Well, there's a good chance that it would, but it depends on how well each environmental
1210040	1215760	gas absorbs to the stationary coal phase relative to its tendency to vaporize.
1215760	1220720	In complex geological systems like these, the overall composition and chemical behavior
1220720	1226000	of formations can be tricky to predict, so we don't know the best method for sequestering
1226000	1229680	CO2 until we try and see the results.
1229680	1235200	Just remember, it's all about those partitioning coefficients.
1235200	1243960	So, organic chemistry may change the world we live in, but it may also play a pivotal
1243960	1248560	role in getting us off of that world someday very soon.
1248560	1252720	There are those who estimate that the Earth's current population of seven billion people
1252720	1255680	would not be naturally sustainable.
1255680	1260680	That without chemical advancements like the Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation,
1260680	1263440	global famine would already have ensued.
1263440	1269600	Yet, the global population continues to expand, pressing ever closer to the nine billion or
1269600	1273520	so that could be fed using modern technologies.
1273520	1274960	But what then?
1274960	1279160	When we've completely exhausted the ability of our planet to provide for us, even with
1279160	1282680	some assistance from science, what's next?
1282680	1288160	Well, even if we one day master the chemistry of nitrogen fixation, there will still come
1288160	1293480	a day when there simply isn't enough land to feed every mouth on the planet.
1293480	1297760	The natural next step is that we look beyond the Earth for places to live.
1297760	1301280	We continue to expand our knowledge and carry our species into the reaches of the solar
1301280	1305120	system and eventually the cosmos.
1305120	1310240	To do so, at least to get started, will require that we take with us everything and every
1310240	1316760	one that a colony might need to survive transport to and establishing that colony on a new celestial
1316760	1319680	body.
1319680	1324680	But that leads to a number of logistical questions, not the least of which is, how do we get that
1324680	1328520	much material off of the Earth and into space?
1328520	1330400	That's a valid question.
1330400	1335240	See with current rocket technology, it costs thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars
1335240	1340400	just to get one pound of material into orbit around the Earth.
1340400	1345320	So step one of colonizing space is to find a cost-effective way to escape the gravity
1345320	1347280	of Mother Earth.
1347280	1350240	Now there are many possible approaches to this challenge.
1350240	1356160	And one very interesting proposal is the construction of a so-called space elevator, which would
1356160	1362360	consist of a line which reaches from the equator of the Earth to an altitude of about 36,000
1362360	1367880	kilometers, the altitude at which a geostationary orbit is obtained.
1367880	1373160	Of course, building a tower more than 40,000 times the height of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai
1373160	1376480	presents some obvious structural challenges.
1376480	1381360	It's unlikely that any such structure could support its own weight.
1381360	1385400	One proposed solution to this problem is to use a structure which is supported not
1385400	1391840	by compression but by tension, constructing a cable with a counterweight reaching so far
1391840	1397560	into space that its center of mass is above 36,000 kilometers and its overall length is
1397560	1404040	about 100,000 kilometers so that it's held taut under its own momentum as it turns with
1404040	1405040	the Earth.
1405040	1411340	Now, using a cable like this, a mechanical climber could simply move up the cable, taking
1411340	1416260	its payload of people and supplies to the necessary altitude to escape Earth's gravity
1416260	1418220	and reach outer space.
1418220	1424020	Now, estimates are that a device like this, though profoundly expensive to build, once
1424020	1429460	operating could lower the cost of delivering material into space by more than tenfold.
1429460	1434540	So it would cost just a few hundred dollars per pound to reach orbit, instead of the thousands
1434540	1439860	or even tens of thousands of dollars that are currently required.
1439860	1444980	So in order to construct this modern marvel, a cable about 100,000 kilometers in length
1444980	1446340	would have to be produced.
1446340	1448820	Now, let's think about that for a moment.
1448820	1453140	That's more than twice the circumference of the Earth, nearly a quarter of the way to
1453140	1455060	the moon.
1455060	1460300	But to build a cable that long which can withstand the tension produced by its orbiting counterweight,
1460300	1465040	we're going to have to find the lightest, most durable material with the greatest tensile
1465040	1469180	strength to weight ratio ever developed.
1469180	1473860	And the front runner for that material is carbon nanotubes.
1473860	1479180	Under one proposal, nanotubes several meters in length could be woven together into a rope,
1479180	1484300	creating the longest man-made object in human history and providing us with that cable that
1484300	1487180	we need to make the space elevator a reality.
1487180	1492420	Now, this may seem like an insurmountable target, a three meter long nanotube, especially
1492420	1498380	when you consider that that rivals the length of a completely extended strand of human DNA.
1498380	1502660	But researchers have reported recently that they've managed to create single nanotubes
1502660	1508060	with lengths approaching that necessary mark needed to form the proposed cable.
1508060	1511740	So it would seem that soon the only thing standing in the way of a space elevator will
1511740	1516180	be our own imagination, and about 20 billion dollars.
1516180	1521180	Now, if this project ever takes place, it would be a fitting application for these allotropes
1521180	1522580	of carbon.
1522580	1527220	The same element which makes up the scaffold of the molecules of life on Earth will also
1527220	1534740	make up the scaffold of the vehicle which we use to propel that life forward into outer space.
1534740	1539100	So our day dreaming about the role of organic chemistry in surmounting the challenges faced
1539100	1543440	by humanity in coming generations is coming to an end.
1543440	1547540	But just because our time together is up doesn't mean that your time with organic chemistry
1547540	1549540	has to be over.
1549540	1556020	If you found the last 36 lectures gratifying, I encourage you to carry your knowledge forward
1556020	1560500	and use it as a basis on which to learn from other chemists.
1560500	1565380	You now have all the tools necessary to read and digest current chemical literature created
1565380	1569940	by researchers in the field, intended for those with an interest in the science of organic
1569940	1572780	chemistry.
1572780	1577100	Countless university and public libraries subscribe to such prestigious professional journals
1577100	1582180	as Science, Nature, and the Journal of the American Chemical Society, as well as more
1582180	1587020	focused organic chemistry journals like the Journal of Organic Chemistry and Tetrahedron.
1587020	1593100	I strongly advise you to search out these publications and others like them.
1593100	1598140	There are a window into the incredible accomplishments being achieved every day by those toiling
1598140	1603260	in the lab hoping to develop the next great catalyst like Sabatier or find a new way to
1603260	1606580	isolate vital compounds like Tzvet.
1606580	1611580	Perhaps they want to mathematically decrypt the kinetics of reactions like Ingold or decipher
1611580	1615900	the function of a critical biomolecule the way McKinnon did.
1615900	1620380	And you now have the tools you need to join in on the conversation.
1620380	1626020	It has been my distinct privilege to help you get started on what I hope will be a lifelong
1626020	1630780	journey exploring and appreciating the rich and beautiful chemistry which breathes life
1630780	1636020	into our planet, the chemistry of molecules based on carbon.
1636020	1636900	Thank you for joining me.
