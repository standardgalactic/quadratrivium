00:00.000 --> 00:18.280
In 1928, a Scottish chemist by the name of Alexander Fleming noticed something strange

00:18.280 --> 00:20.240
in his laboratory.

00:20.240 --> 00:25.480
He saw that a culture plate containing Staphylococcus bacteria had been left open overnight

00:25.480 --> 00:27.800
and had been contaminated by mold.

00:27.800 --> 00:32.720
Now, we can all thank Fleming for his keen powers of observation, as rather than simply

00:32.720 --> 00:37.600
throw the plate away, he decided to examine it.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.720
What Fleming saw was that the mold had produced a zone of inhibition around itself.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.080
Clearly, the mold was producing and excreting something which was protecting its biospace

00:48.080 --> 00:50.920
from the Staphylococcus.

00:50.920 --> 00:55.720
So Fleming cultured the mold and determined that it was the presence of a bacterium called

00:55.720 --> 01:00.120
Penicillium Rubens, which inhibited the growth of that Staphylococcus.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.840
Now, he grew up a culture of that Penicillium Rubens, filtered the broth of that culture

01:05.840 --> 01:09.000
and dubbed that filtrate Penicillin.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.440
The age of modern antibiotic discovery had begun.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.520
Now, it wasn't long before it was discovered that Penicillin was safe for human injection

01:18.520 --> 01:25.120
or ingestion, and that its antibacterial properties remained intact in the bloodstream of humans.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.840
And by World War II, this drug was being mass produced for use in protecting injured

01:28.840 --> 01:31.360
soldiers from infection.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.960
In 1945, its structure was determined by noted British x-ray crystallographer and Nobel

01:36.960 --> 01:39.680
laureate Dorothy Hodgkin.

01:39.680 --> 01:45.880
The floodgates of mass production were opened in 1957, when John C. Sheehan completed the

01:45.880 --> 01:50.280
first total synthesis of Penicillin at MIT.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.600
Now, since the discovery of Penicillin, its characterization in mass production, thousands

01:56.600 --> 02:00.560
of antibiotic compounds have been discovered and put into use for medical purposes all

02:00.560 --> 02:02.000
around the world.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.480
But it all started with a botched experiment in the basement of St. Mary's Hospital in

02:06.480 --> 02:07.480
1928.

02:07.480 --> 02:12.360
Now, there's no doubt in my mind that all of our lives have been touched by an antibiotic

02:12.360 --> 02:14.120
in some way or another.

02:14.120 --> 02:17.840
And by the end of today's lecture, I hope you'll have a new perspective on exactly

02:17.840 --> 02:23.600
how Penicillin, the seminal antibiotic compound, functions at the molecular level.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
Let's get started.

02:27.280 --> 02:32.240
Previously, we discussed linear and branched alkanes, in which the connectivity of carbon

02:32.240 --> 02:37.960
atoms in these hydrocarbons leads to millions of possible geometric isomers.

02:37.960 --> 02:43.680
But we left out one obvious type of connectivity, cyclization.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.040
In light of the fact that the carbon can bond so well to itself, you might have already

02:47.040 --> 02:52.320
asked yourself the question, can a chain of atoms turn back on itself and create a cyclic

02:52.320 --> 02:53.840
chain?

02:53.840 --> 02:57.640
The answer is not only yes, but frequently.

02:57.640 --> 03:04.800
We see these cyclic chains in a variety of organic compounds, from medicines to explosives.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.400
Today we're going to focus on the structure of cyclic hydrocarbons.

03:08.400 --> 03:13.600
So let's get started by examining the simplest possible cyclic hydrocarbon, one with three

03:13.600 --> 03:15.560
carbon atoms.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.760
And don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity of this structure.

03:18.760 --> 03:23.280
This compound has found uses as a starting material in many organic syntheses, as well

03:23.280 --> 03:25.920
as medical applications as an anesthetic.

03:25.920 --> 03:31.680
So this deceptively simple molecular structure belongs to a very powerful and versatile organic

03:31.680 --> 03:32.680
compound.

03:32.680 --> 03:41.000
If we start by taking a look at the linear cousin of our cyclic three-membered compound,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.960
propane, what we want to do is cyclize this compound.

03:44.960 --> 03:49.280
So I'm going to turn the carbon-carbon bonds in such a way that I can bring it together

03:49.280 --> 03:54.440
and form my new cyclic compound with three carbon atoms.

03:54.440 --> 03:59.120
Now cyclizing this compound, we can see that we have to bond the two terminal atoms together,

03:59.120 --> 04:00.880
which has several consequences.

04:00.880 --> 04:06.640
First, the terminal carbon atoms must each give up a hydrogen to make space available

04:06.640 --> 04:08.800
for the cyclizing bond.

04:08.800 --> 04:16.960
Now this means that the generic formula for my cyclic alkane is CnH2n compared to CnH2n

04:16.960 --> 04:22.680
plus 2 as in its analogous linear hydrocarbon.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.720
Next I want you to notice that even though all the carbons are sp3 hybridized, and so

04:26.720 --> 04:30.360
they should have free rotation, that they in fact do not.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.980
This ring structure prohibits the carbon-carbon bond axis from rotating.

04:34.980 --> 04:40.500
So this lends a new type of isomerism, one in which the side of the ring to which a substituent

04:40.500 --> 04:43.620
is attached makes a difference.

04:43.620 --> 04:48.020
See when they're placed on the same side of the ring, we have to use the term cis to

04:48.020 --> 04:51.940
describe their relationship, whereas when they're placed on opposite sides of the ring

04:51.940 --> 04:57.900
like this, we have to use the term trans.

04:57.900 --> 05:03.260
Now the IUPAC system of nomenclature for cycloalkanes is very similar to that for linear alkanes

05:03.260 --> 05:06.260
with just a few basic modifications.

05:06.260 --> 05:10.620
First the root name is given the prefix cyclo, as an indication that the parent chain is

05:10.620 --> 05:12.380
in fact cyclic.

05:12.380 --> 05:16.780
So our three-membered ring depicted here would be named cyclo-propane.

05:16.780 --> 05:26.500
Similarly, rings of increasing size would be named cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane.

05:26.500 --> 05:31.660
Our next consideration is that those cyclic alkanes with a single substituent don't require

05:31.660 --> 05:37.020
a number to give that substituent its location on the ring, and this of course stems from

05:37.020 --> 05:41.320
the fact that all carbons on any unsubstituted ring are equivalent.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.580
So we would name this molecule methylcyclobutane.

05:46.580 --> 05:51.440
Now when two identical substituents are bonded to the ring, we designate their locations

05:51.440 --> 05:55.820
using one as the first and then proceeding around the ring in a manner which gives the

05:55.820 --> 06:00.220
lowest second number to the other substituent.

06:00.220 --> 06:07.540
For example, we begin by naming this compound 1-3-dimethylcyclobutane.

06:07.540 --> 06:12.340
Now when two or more different substituents are present, we number the ring atoms, starting

06:12.340 --> 06:17.580
with a substituent which comes first alphabetically, and then proceed around the ring in a direction

06:17.580 --> 06:21.420
leading to the lowest possible substituent numbers.

06:21.420 --> 06:30.020
For example, we would name this compound 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclobutane.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.340
But there's more to this structure.

06:32.340 --> 06:36.900
Because the carbon-carbon bonds can no longer freely rotate, placing my two substituents

06:36.900 --> 06:41.500
on the same side of the ring produces an isomer which is distinct from that when I place

06:41.500 --> 06:44.660
substituents on opposite sides of the ring.

06:44.660 --> 06:49.060
And again, to distinguish the isomers, we have to name them cis for the same side and

06:49.060 --> 06:52.020
trans for the opposite sides.

06:52.020 --> 06:56.100
And I'm sure that you've also wondered about our discussion on chirality.

06:56.100 --> 07:01.180
Can such molecules have a chiral center which must be ranked by the Conningold pre-log convention

07:01.180 --> 07:03.620
and given R and S designations?

07:03.620 --> 07:05.500
Well, absolutely.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.300
So let's try working with cyclic compounds which don't contain a mirror plane like the

07:09.300 --> 07:12.340
1-3-dimethylcyclobutane example.

07:12.340 --> 07:17.420
How about 1-2-dimethylcyclobutane?

07:17.420 --> 07:22.860
Now in this case, the cis isomer has equal and opposite chiral centers, which makes it

07:22.860 --> 07:25.980
superimposable with its own mirror image.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.340
This means it's a mesocompound.

07:28.340 --> 07:32.060
In other words, the chiral centers are equal and opposite.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.940
But the trans isomer doesn't meet this requirement.

07:34.940 --> 07:42.020
The non-canceling chiral centers on trans 1-2-dimethylcyclobutane means that this compound is expected

07:42.020 --> 07:53.180
to exist as a set of enantiomers, RR and SS, each of which is distinct from the other.

07:53.180 --> 07:57.900
In addition to new nomenclature and isomerism, small cyclic alkanes, like those containing

07:57.900 --> 08:04.300
three to ten atoms, come with another consideration, and this affects their reactivity.

08:04.300 --> 08:09.660
You'll notice that in cyclopropane, the carbon-carbon bonds must be 60 degrees since the three atoms

08:09.660 --> 08:16.380
are necessarily coplanar, yet we already know that sp3 carbons ideally form bond angles

08:16.380 --> 08:19.620
of 109.5 degrees.

08:19.620 --> 08:24.380
Now the fact that the ring structure forces bond angles into suboptimal geometries is

08:24.380 --> 08:26.940
known as angle strain.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.940
We sometimes also call this bier strain.

08:29.940 --> 08:34.900
It's named for a notable chemist and a Nobel Prize winner, Adolf von Beyer, who first proposed

08:34.900 --> 08:36.500
the concept.

08:36.500 --> 08:41.820
Now also, if I turn cyclopropane on its side and produce a Newman projection along one

08:41.820 --> 08:47.620
of the carbon-carbon bonds, it also becomes clear that all the substituents of this cyclic

08:47.620 --> 08:54.740
compound are locked in an eclipsed conformation, and the inability to achieve a staggered conformation

08:54.740 --> 08:58.700
is referred to as torsional strain.

08:58.700 --> 09:03.620
When we combine these two forms of strain, the angle and the torsional, we get an overall

09:03.620 --> 09:07.420
measure of instability known as ring strain.

09:07.420 --> 09:12.740
It's the total energetic cost of having CH2 groups forced into the geometry dictated

09:12.740 --> 09:18.580
by the ring, as opposed to freely rotating CH2 groups as you would have in a hypothetical

09:18.580 --> 09:23.020
linear alkane.

09:23.020 --> 09:28.940
So let's consider the conformation in ring strains associated with a few small cycloalkanes.

09:28.940 --> 09:35.380
Cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane.

09:35.380 --> 09:41.260
First, imagine that I could somehow create a linear alkane with no end.

09:41.260 --> 09:46.980
It could, in theory, achieve perfect 109.5 degree bond angles throughout, and a perfectly

09:46.980 --> 09:52.820
staggered conformation for all substituents, which in this case are hydrogens.

09:52.820 --> 09:58.060
If such a molecule existed, I could determine its free energy and use that as my reference

09:58.060 --> 10:01.940
point for a perfect ring strain free hydrocarbon.

10:01.940 --> 10:09.940
Now let's pit each of our cycloalkanes against this ideal alkane and see how they do.

10:09.940 --> 10:14.420
Cyclopropane has only three ring atoms, and since three points define a plane, these atoms

10:14.420 --> 10:16.940
are locked in a planar arrangement.

10:16.940 --> 10:23.500
That results in 60 degree bond angles and 0 degree substituent dihedral.

10:23.500 --> 10:29.900
These two factors combined lead to a ring strain value of 115 kilojoules per mole.

10:29.900 --> 10:35.460
Now normalizing this to the number of CH2 groups in the molecule gives me 38.3 kilojoules

10:35.460 --> 10:40.740
per CH2.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.300
Cycloputane, on the other hand, has four ring atoms.

10:43.300 --> 10:47.580
So looking down on the ring from above, we might estimate that its bond angles are exactly

10:47.580 --> 10:49.100
90 degrees.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.900
But we'd be wrong.

10:50.900 --> 10:56.700
A 90 degree bond angle would require 0 degree substituent dihedral angles.

10:56.700 --> 11:02.820
And unlike cyclopropane, cycloputane can twist or pucker just slightly in an attempt to remove

11:02.820 --> 11:08.300
that torsional strain, even though that increases angle strain in the process.

11:08.300 --> 11:13.500
So this results in a slightly puckered conformation in which all ring atom bond angles are about

11:13.500 --> 11:18.460
88 degrees and all substituent dihedral are about 20 degrees.

11:18.460 --> 11:24.700
This is slightly better than cyclopropane, but it's still a far cry from our ideal geometry.

11:24.700 --> 11:30.980
So the total ring strain in cycloputane is about 110 kilojoules per mole, which corresponds

11:30.980 --> 11:37.620
to 27.6 kilojoules per CH2.

11:37.620 --> 11:42.260
Now when we get to cyclopentane, we're starting to get close to ideal bond angles, but we're

11:42.260 --> 11:43.940
not quite there.

11:43.940 --> 11:49.660
A flat 5-membered ring would have angles of about 108 degrees, but remember those eclipsing

11:49.660 --> 11:56.180
interactions cause cyclopentane to pucker in very much the same way cycloputane does.

11:56.180 --> 12:00.980
Now in its most stable conformation, four atoms are nearly coplanar and a fifth atom

12:00.980 --> 12:05.860
is raised out of the approximate plane defined by the other four.

12:05.860 --> 12:10.980
This leads to an arrangement commonly called the envelope conformation for cyclopentane.

12:10.980 --> 12:15.340
This is because tracing out the surface created by the atoms leads to a shape that reminds

12:15.340 --> 12:19.340
us of an open envelope.

12:19.340 --> 12:24.340
So average carbon-carbon bond angles and dihedral angles in cyclopentane are beginning to approach

12:24.340 --> 12:27.580
ideal values, but they're not quite there yet.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.300
So there's still going to be some ring strain associated with this motif, but it's going

12:31.300 --> 12:35.220
to be significantly reduced compared to cycloputane.

12:35.220 --> 12:41.180
In fact, cyclopentane has a total ring strain of 27.2 kilojoules per mole, or only about

12:41.180 --> 12:47.220
5.4 kilojoules per CH2.

12:47.220 --> 12:50.100
Now our next example is cyclohexane.

12:50.100 --> 12:55.340
And when we reach a cyclic hydrocarbon of six atoms, something special happens.

12:55.340 --> 13:01.380
I can produce a conformation in which I have four coplanar atoms, one atom rising up above

13:01.380 --> 13:05.940
the plane and one atom falling down below the plane.

13:05.940 --> 13:09.940
We call this the chair conformation because we can imagine it as a lounge chair with a

13:09.940 --> 13:13.300
headrest and footrest.

13:13.300 --> 13:20.540
The chair conformation of cyclohexane produces a ring with 109.5 degree bond angles throughout

13:20.540 --> 13:26.420
and ideal 60 degree bond dihedral angles among all of its substituents.

13:26.420 --> 13:31.620
So with cyclohexane, we've come full circle as it were, to a situation in which there's

13:31.620 --> 13:35.300
essentially no energetic penalty for ring formation.

13:35.300 --> 13:41.660
So chair cyclohexane's ring strain is effectively 0 kilojoules per mole, which naturally leads

13:41.660 --> 13:46.860
to 0 kilojoules per CH2.

13:46.860 --> 13:51.460
So it might seem on casual observation that once we've passed the six carbon mark, we've

13:51.460 --> 13:56.180
achieved the necessary flexibility to overcome any energetic penalties incurred by the act

13:56.180 --> 13:58.900
of ring closure.

13:58.900 --> 14:03.380
Organic chemists however rarely observe things casually and detailed consideration shows

14:03.380 --> 14:05.980
that this is not the case.

14:05.980 --> 14:10.420
Now construction of a model of cyclohexane shows pretty clearly that the addition of

14:10.420 --> 14:15.940
a seventh atom to the ring creates a geometric problem, one in which bond angles of the ring

14:15.940 --> 14:20.740
carbon atoms can no longer be optimized while also avoiding eclipsing interactions among

14:20.740 --> 14:23.100
its substituents.

14:23.100 --> 14:27.620
And this of course leads to a less stable cyclic alkane.

14:27.620 --> 14:31.820
So just as three, four, and five membered rings have systematically decreasing ring

14:31.820 --> 14:36.780
strain, seven, eight, and nine membered rings also have increasing ring strain associated

14:36.780 --> 14:39.620
with them.

14:39.620 --> 14:44.700
Even with the addition of more atoms and therefore more conformational flexibility, it's impossible

14:44.700 --> 14:50.700
to produce the unique harmony of 109.5 degree bond angles and completely staggered substituent

14:50.700 --> 14:53.620
relationships in cyclohexane.

14:53.620 --> 14:57.940
In other words, the virtually non-existent ring strain of cyclohexane, and therefore

14:57.940 --> 15:02.820
its unusual stability, cannot be recreated with any other number of ring atoms, up to

15:02.820 --> 15:08.020
and including 16 carbons.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.100
So what does all this have to do with the action of penicillin?

15:11.100 --> 15:17.260
Well, penicillin works by inhibiting an essential enzyme called transpepsidase.

15:17.300 --> 15:22.500
Now transpepsidase is used by certain types of pathogenic bacteria to build their cell

15:22.500 --> 15:24.060
walls.

15:24.060 --> 15:28.340
But when a molecule of penicillin interacts with the enzyme, a four-membered ring called

15:28.340 --> 15:33.900
a lactam ring, which contains a nitrogen, so it's not just four carbons, but that nitrogen

15:33.900 --> 15:39.060
is also sp3 hybridized, so it's subject to much of the same ring strain as a cyclobutane

15:39.060 --> 15:40.060
would be.

15:40.060 --> 15:45.900
Now that ring opens as it reacts with the enzyme's active site, and that active site

15:45.900 --> 15:50.620
is the region where the cell wall reinforcing bonds are normally made.

15:50.620 --> 15:56.180
So by bonding to the enzyme, penicillin chemically modifies the active site, causing the enzyme

15:56.180 --> 15:58.180
to malfunction.

15:58.180 --> 16:02.220
And it can do this with remarkable efficiency, because the formation of the new bond to the

16:02.220 --> 16:08.040
enzyme is energetically driven by the opening of the four-membered lactam ring.

16:08.040 --> 16:13.300
And this guarantees that the process proceeds with a reduction in overall free energy,

16:13.300 --> 16:17.820
and therefore it's spontaneous.

16:17.820 --> 16:24.420
So we just saw how a strained ring of sp3 atoms can give a molecule powerful chemistry.

16:24.420 --> 16:30.820
But lack of strain can be every bit as important of a feature in a biologically relevant molecule.

16:30.820 --> 16:35.420
For example, it's lack of strain which makes a cyclohexane such a pervasive motif in the

16:35.420 --> 16:37.540
chemistry of life.

16:37.540 --> 16:41.920
We see this structure in powerful hormones, like human sex hormones, testosterone and

16:41.920 --> 16:43.620
estrogen.

16:43.620 --> 16:48.620
We see it in the antibiotic drug Tobromycin, and in the metabolite, anacetol, which can

16:48.620 --> 16:54.180
be modified to make chemicals with varied uses ranging from explosives to investigational

16:54.180 --> 16:57.440
anti-cancer drugs.

16:57.440 --> 17:03.620
So this ubiquity and versatility that makes cyclohexane the gold standard of cyclic alkanes

17:03.620 --> 17:05.740
in any organic chemistry course.

17:05.740 --> 17:08.380
And ours is not going to be an exception.

17:08.380 --> 17:12.580
So let's take a little bit of time now and explore cyclohexane's conformational behavior

17:12.580 --> 17:13.580
just a bit.

17:13.580 --> 17:18.700
Okay, so here's a cyclohexane molecule in the chair conformation.

17:18.700 --> 17:25.700
Now you can see that I've got my forcoplanar atoms, I have my headrest, and I have my footrest.

17:25.700 --> 17:31.940
Now I can approximate this ring of carbon atoms with a circle if I tilt the molecule slightly.

17:32.140 --> 17:36.460
When I do this, you can see that there are two distinct substituent positions, one above

17:36.460 --> 17:41.620
and below the ring, and another which runs around the perimeter of the ring.

17:41.620 --> 17:46.220
And since these positions are distinct from one another, we can give them special names.

17:46.220 --> 17:48.060
We call them axial.

17:48.060 --> 17:53.540
If they're up and down, we call them equatorial if they're along the perimeter.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.140
But molecules aren't static entities.

17:56.140 --> 18:00.060
They're bonds vibrate and twist under the influence of thermal energy.

18:00.100 --> 18:04.540
And because of this, cyclohexane's capable of a remarkable transformation known as a

18:04.540 --> 18:06.540
ring flip.

18:06.540 --> 18:11.860
Now when a ring flip takes place, the headrest and footrest of my imaginary chair are going

18:11.860 --> 18:13.460
to interchange.

18:13.460 --> 18:18.260
And in doing so, they'll create a second chair conformer in which all of the axial substituents

18:18.260 --> 18:23.700
are now equatorial, and all of the equatorial substituents are now axial.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.220
So let's take a look at this.

18:25.220 --> 18:29.620
Right now I have axial, white, and equatorial, red.

18:29.620 --> 18:33.580
And now I'm going to do my ring flip.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.380
Remarkable transformation, isn't it?

18:35.380 --> 18:40.220
All my red atoms have now become axial, all my white atoms equatorial.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.900
And I can ring flip right back the way I was.

18:42.900 --> 18:43.900
Very simply.

18:43.900 --> 18:48.580
No bonds are broken or formed, so this is simply a conformational change as a result

18:48.580 --> 18:50.900
of bond rotation.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.940
Now I did that ring flip pretty quickly.

18:53.940 --> 18:58.340
So let's slow it down a little bit and explore this really important conformational change

18:58.340 --> 19:01.980
a bit slower.

19:01.980 --> 19:06.740
As a ring flip begins, one of the carbon atoms moves into a coplanar arrangement with the

19:06.740 --> 19:08.620
four others.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.820
We call this a half chair conformation.

19:11.820 --> 19:16.700
And you'll notice that adopting that conformation increases the ring carbon bond angles and

19:16.700 --> 19:19.820
also creates new eclipsing interactions.

19:19.820 --> 19:24.660
So this is a very high energy state, and in fact it represents a transition state between

19:24.660 --> 19:28.900
the chair conformation and the intermediate for our ring flip process called the twist

19:28.900 --> 19:31.900
boat.

19:31.900 --> 19:36.180
In a twist boat conformation, the foot rest of my original chair is now level with my

19:36.180 --> 19:37.660
head rest.

19:37.660 --> 19:42.500
But there's a slight twist to the structure which gives it its name.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.940
Now recovering the ideal bond angles within the ring to form a boat conformation means

19:46.940 --> 19:51.860
that I have to create some eclipsing interactions between certain substituents, and the ring

19:51.860 --> 19:55.180
flip tries to attenuate these by twisting ever so slightly.

19:55.180 --> 19:57.980
So this is the boat conformation.

19:57.980 --> 20:04.460
It represents a transition state between the two different twist boat intermediates.

20:04.460 --> 20:08.340
Now the ring flip completes with the twist boat passing again through the half chair

20:08.340 --> 20:13.660
transition state on its way to the alternate chair conformation.

20:13.660 --> 20:18.540
And generally speaking, although conformers like the twist boat do exist, they have a

20:18.540 --> 20:21.220
much higher energy than the chair conformation.

20:21.220 --> 20:27.300
So chemists tend to model cyclohexane conformational equilibria as two state systems with only

20:27.300 --> 20:30.460
one chair or the other being possible.

20:30.460 --> 20:36.220
So we're going to make this assumption ourselves in many cases.

20:36.220 --> 20:39.660
Now you may find that somewhat uninteresting at the moment because all of the substituents

20:39.660 --> 20:40.740
are the same.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.740
They're all hydrogens.

20:42.740 --> 20:46.820
But what happens if we're dealing with a substituted cyclohexane molecule with various

20:46.820 --> 20:49.380
groups attached to the ring?

20:49.380 --> 20:53.720
At this point, the ring flip becomes very, very important conformational change because

20:53.720 --> 21:01.060
it will alter the location of that substituent from an axial to an equatorial or back again.

21:01.060 --> 21:05.700
So let's keep our discussion as simple as possible and focus on the conformational behavior

21:05.700 --> 21:09.180
of a very simple substituted cyclohexane.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.660
This is methylcyclohexane.

21:11.660 --> 21:15.660
Now as you can imagine, a methyl group is much larger than a hydrogen.

21:15.660 --> 21:19.660
So we expect that this methyl substituent, which I've marked in red, will want to take

21:19.660 --> 21:25.380
up a position which gives it the largest volume of free space.

21:25.380 --> 21:30.620
So if I draw a cyclohexane in the chair conformation that looks like this with its methyl group

21:30.620 --> 21:36.140
in an axial position, is this really the best representation of the molecule?

21:36.140 --> 21:41.860
The way that I've constructed this, the methyl group is close in space to two other hydrogens.

21:41.860 --> 21:45.940
With the physical collisions of these larger groups with one another, we call one-three

21:45.940 --> 21:51.220
diaxial interactions because the influencing substituents are on positions of the ring,

21:51.220 --> 21:55.100
which would be one and three if we were labeling it as disubstituted.

21:55.100 --> 22:01.380
In the case of methylcyclohexane, the diaxial interactions among these groups can be relieved

22:01.380 --> 22:03.460
by a ring flip.

22:03.460 --> 22:08.140
Notice that the ring flip places my larger methyl group in the equatorial position and

22:08.140 --> 22:12.620
in the case of methylcyclohexane, having it out here where there's more space, lowers

22:12.620 --> 22:19.260
its energy by about seven and a half kilojoules per mole, which corresponds to a 20 to 1 excess

22:19.260 --> 22:26.220
of the equatorial conformer over the axial conformer.

22:26.220 --> 22:31.260
So if it's my goal to approximate the chemical and physical properties of methylcyclohexane,

22:31.260 --> 22:39.300
the best single representation that I can offer is that of the equatorial conformer.

22:39.300 --> 22:44.020
Now you might have noticed in my previous example that the cyclohexane ring on testosterone

22:44.020 --> 22:49.460
is not an isolated ring structure, but rather it's part of a larger network of rings, all

22:49.460 --> 22:54.180
of which are bonded together in a very specific geometry.

22:54.180 --> 22:59.300
So when two carbon or two hydrocarbon rings share one or more atoms, we call them bicyclic

22:59.300 --> 23:05.820
systems and by extension we might call a molecule like the testosterone tetracyclic molecule

23:05.820 --> 23:10.660
because it actually has four rings, each of which shares atoms with others.

23:10.660 --> 23:14.940
Now today I'd like to show you just the most basic bicyclic systems in detail and show

23:14.940 --> 23:20.300
you how we name them and how their connectivity can have a profound influence on their geometry

23:20.300 --> 23:26.580
and therefore their behavior.

23:26.580 --> 23:31.180
So let's begin by considering the different types of bicyclic structures.

23:31.180 --> 23:33.380
There are actually three that we'll talk about today.

23:33.380 --> 23:35.860
The first is sphero.

23:35.860 --> 23:41.300
We define a sphero bicyclic structure as one which contains a single common carbon.

23:41.300 --> 23:46.700
So here I have what we can view as two six-membered rings which are being conjoined by a single

23:46.700 --> 23:48.860
atom that they share in common.

23:48.860 --> 23:54.660
An example of this is a molecule cannabis spiran, also called cannabis spirone, which

23:54.660 --> 23:58.660
is found in marijuana plants.

23:58.660 --> 24:05.340
We can see very clearly that there is a sphero carbon here which creates this bicyclic motif.

24:05.340 --> 24:12.180
Now the second type is a fused bicyclic and my example here is a molecule called decolin.

24:12.180 --> 24:17.660
These fused bicyclics contain two adjacent carbons which fuse the rings together and

24:17.660 --> 24:20.980
when this happens we call them bridgehead carbons.

24:20.980 --> 24:26.020
So here I have two common carbons directly bonded to one another.

24:26.020 --> 24:30.740
When this happens we call it a fused ring and a classic example of a fused system is

24:30.740 --> 24:32.660
again our testosterone molecule.

24:32.660 --> 24:35.300
We can see the fused motif right here.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.900
Finally there's a third way to combine two rings and that is in a bridged motif.

24:38.900 --> 24:43.940
And in the bridged motif we have two non-adjacent bridgehead carbons.

24:43.940 --> 24:48.020
So in this case my two bridgehead carbons are not bonded to one another but are connected

24:48.020 --> 24:51.580
through other atoms on all sides.

24:51.580 --> 24:53.940
Example of this is the familiar molecule camphor.

24:53.940 --> 24:57.100
You can see the motif right there.

24:57.100 --> 25:01.940
So let's take a moment and think about how chemists actually think about bicyclics.

25:01.940 --> 25:06.460
We call these structures bicyclic because we can create them mentally by combining two

25:06.460 --> 25:08.020
rings together.

25:08.020 --> 25:11.800
Now this is not how they're actually synthesized but rather this is how we think about them

25:11.800 --> 25:13.860
from a structural perspective.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.940
So we're not going to do a reaction here but I am going to show you what happens when we

25:16.940 --> 25:20.700
put two rings together in our minds.

25:20.700 --> 25:24.420
For this example I'm going to use five-membered rings.

25:24.420 --> 25:28.940
The first example I bring my five-membered rings together and combine them at a single

25:28.940 --> 25:30.620
common atom.

25:30.620 --> 25:35.220
So that single bridgehead carbon is a spiro compound.

25:35.220 --> 25:40.540
If I take my two five-membered rings and combine them at adjacent carbon atoms I now

25:40.540 --> 25:42.980
have a fused system.

25:42.980 --> 25:48.260
And again if I take my two rings and conjoin them at non-adjacent atoms I have what we

25:48.260 --> 25:50.060
would call bridged.

25:50.060 --> 25:54.180
So this is the way that we think about these kinds of systems.

25:54.180 --> 25:56.240
Finally of course we need to know how to name them.

25:56.240 --> 26:01.380
So if we know how we think about them naturally the next task at hand is to figure out how

26:01.380 --> 26:03.900
to tell other people about them.

26:03.900 --> 26:08.380
So we name these compounds using a system that is very akin to other IUPAC names but

26:08.380 --> 26:11.140
we have a few extra considerations here.

26:11.140 --> 26:15.860
For example in the spiro compound that I've just created I need to communicate how many

26:15.860 --> 26:20.540
carbons are present in all of the bridges within the molecule.

26:20.540 --> 26:24.940
So I have a bridge here which consists of four carbon atoms.

26:24.940 --> 26:29.060
And I have a second bridge which also consists of four carbon atoms.

26:29.060 --> 26:33.700
So my goal is to tell my reader that I have two bridges of four connected through a spiro

26:33.700 --> 26:35.180
carbon.

26:35.180 --> 26:39.100
So I start by naming my compound a spiro compound.

26:39.100 --> 26:46.340
And then in brackets I indicate the size of each bridge separated by a period.

26:46.340 --> 26:51.580
Finally I count all of the atoms within the molecule and use that to generate the final

26:51.580 --> 26:52.580
name.

26:52.580 --> 26:58.460
So in this case I have nine atoms in the total molecule meaning this is a spiro, four, four,

26:58.460 --> 26:59.460
no name.

26:59.460 --> 27:05.420
In the case of a fused bicyclic I have a bridge of three in my example here.

27:05.420 --> 27:10.500
I have a second bridge of three and I have two directly connected bridgehead carbons

27:10.500 --> 27:13.980
which can be thought of as a bridge of zero.

27:13.980 --> 27:19.620
So to distinguish this system from the spiro I call it a bicyclo and I give the length

27:19.620 --> 27:24.060
of all three bridges even though one of them is zero.

27:24.060 --> 27:28.460
So this compound is a bicyclo 330.

27:28.460 --> 27:32.540
And finally counting all of the atoms within the molecule I can get the root of the name

27:32.540 --> 27:39.020
this is a bicyclo 330 octane molecule.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.340
Alright now let's name our bridge compound.

27:41.340 --> 27:43.660
We'll do exactly what we did with the fused.

27:43.660 --> 27:52.100
We have a bridge of two, another bridge of two, and now a bridge of one.

27:52.100 --> 27:56.940
So I'm going to call this also a bicyclo system because it, just like the fused, has two bridgehead

27:56.940 --> 27:58.780
carbons.

27:58.780 --> 28:03.420
What the distinction here is that I don't have any zeros in my brackets.

28:03.420 --> 28:10.020
So this bicyclo 2, 2, 1 compound clearly has to be bridged, it's not fused.

28:10.020 --> 28:13.700
And finally I do exactly what I've done for my other two which is I take an inventory

28:13.700 --> 28:16.860
of the total number of atoms within that scaffold.

28:16.860 --> 28:26.860
This is a bicyclo 2, 2, 1 heptane molecule.

28:26.860 --> 28:31.180
So in this lecture we discussed the general formula of cyclic alkanes and how closing

28:31.180 --> 28:38.780
a loop of carbons removes two hydrogens and gives us the general formula CnH2n.

28:38.780 --> 28:43.420
We discussed nomenclature of this new class of hydrocarbons and we also touched on how

28:43.420 --> 28:48.420
cyclization creates new geometric relationships among hydrogens and substituents known as

28:48.420 --> 28:51.780
cis and trans.

28:51.780 --> 28:55.940
We covered the phenomenon of ring strain, a combination of the two factors of angle

28:55.940 --> 28:58.860
strain and torsional strain.

28:58.860 --> 29:04.500
We saw how three, four and five-membered rings are unable to fully relieve this strain, making

29:04.500 --> 29:09.180
them more unstable than their normal chain counterparts.

29:09.180 --> 29:14.160
And we also noted that although more stable than very small cycloalkanes, rings of seven

29:14.160 --> 29:19.380
atoms and more are also unable to achieve zero ring strain.

29:19.380 --> 29:24.300
We then met cyclohexane, a very special cyclic hydrocarbon with virtually no ring strain

29:24.300 --> 29:25.780
at all.

29:25.780 --> 29:29.860
And we saw how its chair conformation can interconvert between two different conformers

29:29.860 --> 29:34.780
which interchange axial and equatorial substituents.

29:34.780 --> 29:39.460
We also considered how the size of substituents on substituted cyclohexanes can affect the

29:39.460 --> 29:44.500
equilibrium between the two chair conformers, with larger groups pushing the equilibrium

29:44.500 --> 29:48.180
in favor of their equatorial conformers.

29:48.180 --> 29:53.780
Finally, we looked and named a few bicyclic hydrocarbons.

29:53.780 --> 30:00.180
We saw how spirobicyclics contain two rings conjoined at a single carbon atom, fused bicyclics

30:00.180 --> 30:07.660
share adjacent bridgeheads, and how bridged bicyclics share non-adjacent bridgeheads.

30:07.660 --> 30:13.860
Along the way, we also saw how a laboratory error in an English basement in 1928 ultimately

30:13.860 --> 30:20.260
led decades later to the discovery of the reaction between penicillin and transpepsinase.

30:20.260 --> 30:24.980
And it's this reaction which gives this history-altering drug its antibiotic properties.

30:24.980 --> 30:29.140
And it's our understanding of this reaction, which gave birth to a whole class of antibiotics.

30:29.140 --> 30:34.620
And it's all driven by the energy released when a strain ring opens.

30:34.620 --> 30:38.500
Next time, we're going to turn our attention back to linear and branched hydrocarbons,

30:38.500 --> 30:43.020
but we're going to explore the effects of the presence pi bonds.

30:43.020 --> 30:43.620
I'll see you then.
