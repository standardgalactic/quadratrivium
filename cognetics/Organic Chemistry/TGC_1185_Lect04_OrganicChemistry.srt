00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,520
Welcome back. I hope that our first few lectures on bonding and molecular structure have piqued

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,880
your interest in the relationship between those structures and the physical and chemical

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,840
properties that they lead to in organic compounds. Of course, observation of these properties

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,800
takes time, so we can't just rely on a static snapshot of a structure to tell the whole

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:43,480
story. Let me show you an example. Here I have a molecule called acrolein. Acrolein is a

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,040
potent toxin found in cigarette smoke. It's also used in commercial biocides, and its

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,400
reactivity is similar to that of formaldehyde, so it finds use as a fixative agent, preserving

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,360
biological samples. Now, in textbooks and in papers, acrolein is commonly drawn in this

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,600
configuration. And yet, something about this configuration doesn't make sense to us. There's

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,800
a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbon-carbon single bond, and a carbon-oxygen double bond

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,400
in this molecule, which means the central bond should rotate freely. Yet, when we use

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,480
the static structure like this one and try to model its behavior, we see that this kind

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,520
of rotation doesn't happen. And so the chemical properties of acrolein, like its boiling point,

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,920
its acid-base properties, are all different than the prediction based upon this model.

15
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,400
So we find the carbon-oxygen bond dipole here is actually larger than the structure predicts,

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,040
and that electron density around these carbons is not the same. So clearly there's something

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,380
going on here that this static model just can't explain. Now, so far we've concerned

18
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,340
ourselves primarily with the drawing of molecular structures, these stationary, unchanging representations

19
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,820
of molecules in their most ideal states. They'll have median bond lengths and angles and dihedrals

20
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,300
just the way that we want them. Now, as useful as it is to have these representations, showing

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,220
compounds in their most stable, ideal states, as chemists we're ultimately concerned with

22
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,020
materials physical and chemical properties in the real world, where bonds vibrate, electrons

23
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:27,340
move through clouds, and those bonds change. So the physical and chemical changes would

24
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,740
be best communicated not by a single ideal representation, but by how the molecule truly

25
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:41,740
behaves as time passes. So we need to develop a method for communicating how substances behave

26
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:49,460
and change through time, instead of just a single instantaneous ideal snapshot. We naturally

27
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,540
benefit from a method which is generally accepted by all chemists so that we can give one another

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,380
all the information we need to reach a common understanding of chemical processes as well

29
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,180
as physical processes. In this lecture I'll show you how to create drawings which depict

30
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,660
the transfer of electrons from one location to another in order to form and break chemical

31
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,020
bonds. Some of these motions will be intramolecular, meaning they take place within a single molecule,

32
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,580
and others will be intermolecular, meaning that they take place between two or more molecules.

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:31,100
In all cases, the relocation of electrons will result in the formation, alteration, or breaking

34
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:40,020
of connections between atoms. Get ready, chemistry is about to come alive.

35
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,940
So let's begin with an intramolecular process called resonance. Electrons within an electron

36
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,980
cloud are always in motion, and we've already seen in one of our previous lectures that

37
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,060
pi bonds have a unique ability to form and break without altering the connectivity of

38
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,420
atoms, and since the stronger sigma bonds can remain intact while the weaker pi bonds are

39
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,660
broken. So electron pairs which are not involved in bonding at all, sometimes called lone

40
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,580
pair electrons and pi bonding electrons, can be made more mobile within a molecule's

41
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,180
overall electron cloud. Now these electrons can sometimes occupy a region much larger

42
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,540
than just that defined by a hybrid orbital or an isolated pi bond. They can traverse

43
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,140
great distances across molecules using p orbitals without disrupting the connectivity of the

44
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:34,140
atoms. These long interconnected systems of p orbitals, sometimes called pi systems.

45
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,180
So as electrons move through the pi systems, no reaction is really taking place, but our

46
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,940
method of drawing an individual structure begins to fail. We're already familiar with

47
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,540
today's acrolein molecule, and I drew it like this just the way that I had represented it

48
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,700
in the model that I showed you previously. But the problem is that the pi electrons in

49
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,940
acrolein want more space. They want to run throughout the molecule, and if given a chance

50
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,260
to do so, that's exactly what they'll do. Now if you look at the acrolein structure,

51
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:16,020
you'll see many, many sp2 carbons and even an sp2 oxygen all arranged in a row. Now if

52
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,180
I show you the molecule on its side, it'll probably make a little bit more sense what's

53
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,620
happening here. I'm going to take the hydrogens away so it's easier to see, and I'm going

54
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:30,220
to turn my acrolein molecule. Now these are the p orbitals participating in pi bonding.

55
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,780
So even though I've drawn it here with an isolated pi bond on alternating carbons, the

56
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,820
truth of the matter is that pi system is completely interconnected. So when the bonds are arranged

57
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,900
appropriately so that all p orbitals are aligned, the electrons can run throughout the molecule.

58
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,980
So I need a way to represent acrolein, which is a little bit more realistic. And we do

59
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:00,100
this by breaking the structure down and drawing every conceivable extreme. For example, here

60
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,700
I have three duplicates of my acrolein structure, but I'm going to alter them, remembering my

61
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,420
rule. Sigma bonds can't break, only pi bonds can move. So let's take a look at what happens

62
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,260
when I do this to my first structure on the left. I'm going to move one pi bond up to

63
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,860
the oxygen, creating a charge separation. In my other one here, I'm going to relocate

64
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,500
both of those pi bonds, one to the oxygen and one to the central carbon-carbon bond,

65
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,340
creating a different kind of charge separation. And my third I'm going to leave exactly as

66
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:37,260
it was. So these extremes of electron motion that we draw in this type of way are called

67
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,020
resonance contributors. And you'll see this drawn in the chemical literature and in your

68
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,820
textbooks. But what happens when you see that, or at least when a trained chemist does, is

69
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,460
this. They mentally combine all of those resonance contributors into a single resonance hybrid,

70
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,020
which is essentially the weighted average of these three structures. In my resonance

71
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,660
hybrid, I can understand why there is no rotation or limited rotation about that central bond,

72
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,220
because it has a little bit of pi character, which my static structure that I drew originally

73
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,540
would not predict. So this is the utility of thinking more about the motion of electrons

74
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:22,940
through time than about a single instantaneous snapshot of my molecule. So in that drawing,

75
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,260
I had brackets and straight double-headed arrows, giving me my cue to create the best

76
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,980
possible approximation of acrylene structure. And I did this by mentally combining them

77
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,940
all into that new weighted average called the resonance hybrid. And it will help me

78
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,100
to predict the reactivity and properties of acrylene much better. But it's important to

79
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,580
remember that hybrid is a weighted average, meaning that the contributors with less charge

80
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,180
separation and more ideal electron positions tend to be a closer representation of the hybrid

81
00:07:52,180 --> 00:08:00,500
than their charge-containing counterparts. Now, creating a static depiction of a system

82
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,460
changing through time can be a challenging undertaking, but one which humanity has deemed

83
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,900
worthy since prehistory. Just ask cave painters of Paleolithic Europe and Africa. They tried to

84
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,900
document their hunts with just a few simple markings on a cave wall. Or if you don't have a

85
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:23,140
time machine, ask any modern-day comic strip author. The comic strip artists try to tell

86
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,860
a story using a storyboard of static images, depicting different moments within the narrative.

87
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,740
And it's up to us as readers to combine these images in our minds to create a seamless running

88
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:41,780
story. For example, here's Garfield holding a piece of pie, and then suddenly in the next

89
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,660
frame, pie's gone. But where did it go? Well, as the readers, we have to rely on our experience

90
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,180
and our intuition to tell us how that transition occurred. I'm pretty sure I know where the

91
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,340
pie went. Now, organic chemistry is no different than that comic strip. I might show you the

92
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,340
chemical structures, for example, of ammonium cyanate and urea. But unless I give it greater

93
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,900
detail, it's up to you to decide how you think the transition took place, using your understanding

94
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,340
of how organic chemistry works. Of course, technologies progress to the point at which

95
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,740
we don't often have to perform this exercise anymore. Computer animation fills in all the

96
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,500
gaps and gives us maximum detail about how a process takes place. But even with the advantages

97
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,540
of modern technology, fully animating a story is not always the best choice. It certainly

98
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,460
leaves out most ambiguities, but it requires a great deal of effort to create, and also

99
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,660
special devices to view. So for the purposes of day-to-day communication, chemists prefer

100
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,660
to use a faster, shorthand style of depicting reactions that's developed over the centuries.

101
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,780
Now, last time, we took a detailed look at methods chemists use to unambiguously convey

102
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,420
molecular structures to one another. And in this lecture, we'll be taking a detailed

103
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,020
look at how organic chemists convey changes in those structures through time. Specifically,

104
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,160
how the chemical energy of a system changes, and how the bonding between and among atoms

105
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,160
changes when that chemistry takes place. So let's begin with the simplest possible illustration

106
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,140
of a chemical change, a reaction scheme. Now chemists often don't know or feel the need

107
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,440
to convey minute mechanistic details of a chemical reaction as it takes place. And sometimes

108
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,580
their arguments simply depends on what was present at the beginning of the reaction and

109
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,700
what was present at the end. For example, if we just want to give the basic details

110
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,580
of a reaction, we rely on something called a reaction scheme. The reaction scheme consists

111
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:50,060
of reagents on the left side, products on the right side, an arrow which indicates whether

112
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,340
the reaction is reversible or not, we'll get to that in a moment, and also any special

113
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,400
conditions which are required for the reaction to take place. A great example of this is

114
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,480
the reaction scheme used by Friedrich Wohler to synthesize urea. Remember, his reagent

115
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,480
was ammonium cyanane. His products ultimately were urea. The reaction runs irreversibly,

116
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,640
meaning that it completely and quantitatively converts all of the reagents into products.

117
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,160
And the conditions that he used were simply heating. We represent heat sometimes with

118
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,180
the capital Greek letter delta. So this is how Wohler's synthesis would appear if I

119
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:36,180
were to write it as a reaction scheme. I have the synthesis of urea formed from ammonium

120
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,740
cyanate in an irreversible process driven by heat. Now it's that last element of the

121
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,780
scheme that requires a little bit more explanation. See, chemists distinguish between reactions

122
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,420
which can be reversed from those and those which cannot. So in a reaction like Wohler's

123
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,400
synthesis, the product formed is so stable that once it forms, it can never go back to

124
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,600
the original starting materials through the reverse pathway. Of course, this means that

125
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,520
if we wait long enough, the reaction will eventually result in the complete conversion

126
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,200
of reactants to products. And as the course progresses, we'll eventually see why this

127
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,240
is so important to make a distinction like this when plotting out a synthesis. So now

128
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,360
that we have our completed scheme for Wohler's irreversible synthesis of urea, let's take

129
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:28,380
a look at a scheme for another famous reaction, which this time is reversible. Another classic

130
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,060
example of a reaction scheme is a Haber-Bosch process, which one might argue is not truly

131
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,860
organic since carbon is not involved, but it's probably the single most influential

132
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,820
chemical reaction of all time. And it's a critical entry point for nitrogen into the

133
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,900
biosphere. So I'm going to exercise the professor's privilege here and step outside the bounds

134
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,960
of my own discipline for just a moment. During World War I, with Germany facing dwindling

135
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,760
natural resources to fuel their war efforts, famous German chemists Fritz Haber and Karl

136
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,120
Bosch were engaged in a project to provide Germany with all the fixed nitrogen it could

137
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,120
ever need for explosives and crop fertilization. The scheme that Haber used looks like this.

138
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,980
As reagents, he used nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. For products, he was hoping to get ammonia.

139
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,400
And what Haber realized was that in order to accomplish this, he was going to have some

140
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,660
trouble because he had a reversible process. But he could get it to go if he ran it at

141
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,660
400 degrees centigrade and 200 atmospheres of pressure in the presence of an iron catalyst,

142
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,520
which speeds the reaction but doesn't really participate in it overall. That's why we place

143
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,600
the iron here in the conditions rather than as a reagent. So Haber's scheme was, again,

144
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,520
to try to get nitrogen and hydrogen to combine in a reversible process at 400 degrees and

145
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,200
200 atmospheres of pressure with an iron catalyst, all to make ammonia. So you'll notice in

146
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,000
this case that I've placed some numbers in front of my reagents here. And those numbers

147
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,220
indicate a quantity. So you'll hear me from time to time refer to three moles of hydrogen

148
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,820
or two moles of ammonia. This is because chemists usually count molecules using a very large

149
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:24,780
quantity. It's no different than a dozen or a gross. So if I need a dozen eggs to make

150
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,820
two dozen cookies, you now know the ratio needed. So if I need three moles of hydrogen

151
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,100
to make two moles of ammonia, again, you know the ratio that's needed. So the only difference

152
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,000
here is that in chemistry, we're counting atoms and molecules. So a mole is tremendous

153
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,520
in quantity by comparison. 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd to be exact. So my reaction here

154
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,480
involves one mole of nitrogen gas reacting with three molar equivalents of hydrogen

155
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,440
to produce two moles of ammonia. And it would be a great way to make ammonia from the air

156
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,680
if we could convert it into this much needed ammonia. The only problem here is the reaction

157
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,100
is reversible. So once it's formed, the ammonia can convert back to hydrogen and nitrogen

158
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,820
gases, thereby completely undoing the reaction. So as the concentration of ammonia builds,

159
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,140
the reverse reaction accelerates until it matches out of the forward reaction, establishing

160
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,700
what chemists call an equilibrium. The problem that Haber and Bosch faced is that ammonia

161
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,060
decomposes to nitrogen and hydrogen very rapidly under common laboratory conditions, so only

162
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:38,080
a small fraction of material in the reactor will be ammonia at any given time. So equilibrium

163
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,400
is defined as a dynamic process in which the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.

164
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,520
And it's a common misconception actually that equilibrium means equal amounts of both

165
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,200
products and reactants, but this is really not the case at all, much to the chagrin

166
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,200
of Haber and Bosch. So let me show you what I mean by that. We model equilibria as chemists

167
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,860
using something called an equilibrium constant, which is written as the capital letter K. Now

168
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,020
in the equilibrium constant we place a function of the products in the numerator, a function

169
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,620
of the reagents in the denominator, and we raise those functions to a power equal to

170
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,720
their coefficients in the reaction. So here I've created a sort of generic reaction,

171
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,720
one mole of reagent A plus three moles of reagent B forms two moles of product C. So to construct

172
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:35,200
the equilibrium constant K, I simply place my product's concentration, which we indicate

173
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,560
by brackets, raised to the power of two for its coefficient. I place my first reagent

174
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:48,240
in the denominator, raised to a power of one, and my second reagent also in the denominator,

175
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,740
raised to a power of three. So this is my general equilibrium constant for this type

176
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,440
of reaction. So Haber and Bosch were attempting to use nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia in

177
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,040
an equilibrium process, meaning that its equilibrium constant expression will look like this, concentration

178
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:15,040
of ammonia squared over concentration of nitrogen over concentration of hydrogen cubed equals

179
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,540
ten to the minus sixth. This is a highly disfavored equilibrium. So this reaction is capable of

180
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,880
producing only a small amount of ammonia once equilibrium is reached. So the scheme

181
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,840
that Haber and Bosch were hoping to use to create ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen,

182
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,560
unfortunately at equilibrium didn't look much like this, instead it looked a little

183
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:43,560
bit like this. So the genius of what Haber and Bosch did was not in this reaction that

184
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,920
they used. In fact, it's a pretty simple reaction. The genius of what Haber and Bosch accomplished

185
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,100
was in their reactor design, which altered the conditions of pressure and temperature,

186
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,700
increasing both of these factors to speed the rate of ammonia formation relative to

187
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,460
the rate of its decomposition. So they influenced the equilibrium in a manner which suited their

188
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,460
needs. But even that strategy didn't produce large quantities of ammonia at equilibrium.

189
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,100
So in a final manipulation, they devised a way to remove ammonia from the reactor as

190
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,120
it formed, thereby causing the equilibrium to shift continuously in favor of their desired

191
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,720
products. This tendency of reversible systems to shift in ways which relieve stresses like

192
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,720
removal of product is known as Le Chatelier's principle. Now at this early stage, reversible

193
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,200
reactions may seem like a nuisance. After all, wouldn't it be great if we could just

194
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,960
mix some ingredients, wait for a little while, and ultimately have the maximum possible amount

195
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,220
of product? Sure, many times it would. But later in the course, we're going to see some

196
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:58,220
examples of reactions whose reversibility makes them even more useful in synthetic design.

197
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,540
So far our drawing examples have been limited in the sense that they convey a great deal

198
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,860
about what we start and end with, but relatively little about what goes on in the interim.

199
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,700
And since reaction schemes only show a list of starting materials and products, we're

200
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,960
often left to wonder exactly how those materials go about changing. One might make the analogy

201
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,960
that it's like having a pile of boards, screws, and other pieces, and then a picture of a

202
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,960
finished table when assembled, but our step-by-step manual is missing. So when organic chemists

203
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,640
want to convey a process in a little more detail, they turn to a style of drawing known

204
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,240
as a mechanism. And a mechanism, just like that manual for assembling their table, it's

205
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,660
a series of elementary steps showing not only the starting material, reversibility, conditions

206
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,420
and products, but also explicitly showing how electrons from each species are exchanged

207
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,260
to make and break bonds. So let's take a look at Wohler's Synthesis one more time

208
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,940
as an example, knowing that chemists now understand what happened during that happy accident.

209
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,900
So our scheme only showed the starting material and products, but let's see if we can fill

210
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,920
in some of the gaps now. So once again, here is Wohler's Synthesis. Ammonium cyanate

211
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,040
and forming urea. But if I break this reaction down to elementary steps, I see that there

212
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,800
are different compounds which form as intermediates, specifically ammonia and cyanic acid, and ultimately

213
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:34,240
a charge-separated intermediate, before it finally becomes urea. So Wohler's Synthesis,

214
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,900
as I showed you before, left out a lot of information. There's actually quite a few

215
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,900
additional species involved in the transition. But that's still not enough information.

216
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,260
If you look at this now, it's sort of like reading that comic strip. We might have multiple

217
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,780
pains in the comic, but we still haven't really clearly defined how one transition

218
00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,380
occurs and forms the next. Now to do this, we use a mechanism. And a mechanism consists

219
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,360
of not only the structures of all of these species, but arrows indicating how and when

220
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:12,360
electrons move. For example, here's a representation of ammonium and of cyanate. And I've colored

221
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,080
the nitrogens just a little bit different shades of blue so they're easier to follow

222
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,780
through the process. So I could skip ahead and draw the new structures for ammonia and

223
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:26,200
cyanic acid, but that would leave you wondering how the transition happened. So to fill in

224
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,820
that gap, I'm going to use some arrows. When I use an arrow like this, I'm trying to show

225
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,500
you that a pair of electrons is moving from this nitrogen to this hydrogen, abstracting

226
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,380
it, forming a new chemical bond to it. As that happens, the original chemical bond breaks,

227
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:51,380
and that pair of electrons moves back to the nitrogen of the ammonium ion. Now I can draw

228
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:58,380
this intermediate in my process, and it's absolutely clear how it got that way. In a

229
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,980
second fundamental step, I have my ammonia reacting with the cyanic acid, which was produced,

230
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,980
forming a new bond between the nitrogen and carbon, and breaking a pi bond between the

231
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,980
carbon and the original nitrogen of the cyanic acid. This produces a charged intermediate

232
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,200
in which there's a rearrangement where one of the hydrogens moves from my nitrogen here

233
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,440
to my nitrogen down below, breaking that bond. Now I can complete my mechanism, and it becomes

234
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,640
clear exactly how we got from this point to this point, including each individual bond

235
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,520
forming and breaking. And this is the value of a mechanism. It gives us the maximum level

236
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:47,520
of detail. So we're now acquainted with the techniques used not only to draw molecular

237
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,500
structures, but the elements of drawings used to convey elementary steps, and the electron

238
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,780
transitions which take place in each one. But there's one more piece of information

239
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,060
which is crucial to understanding how these transitions occur, and that is the chemical

240
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:11,060
energetics of the process. You see, just like in classical physics, chemists think in terms

241
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,320
of potential energy. And just like a physical object, like a ball, is expected to roll down

242
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,920
a hill, thereby decreasing its potential physical energy and reaching a more stable state, so

243
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,880
will a molecular system react in a way which decreases its overall potential chemical energy,

244
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,540
also making it more stable. The difference is that chemical energy is a bit less intuitive

245
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:42,940
to determine. Still, to fully understand the process of a chemical reaction, we need a

246
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,980
quick and convenient method for demonstrating whether a particular transition increases

247
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:54,340
or decreases the overall chemical free energy of the system, and by how much. And to better

248
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,480
understand this concept, we should consider a simple example like that ball perched on

249
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,260
a hilltop. Classical physics tells us that the potential energy of that ball in its current

250
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:11,260
position is higher than that of the same ball at the bottom of the hill. So we can see from

251
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,300
the diagram that when we give it a small push to overcome the barrier, which would be friction

252
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,900
or a small hill preventing it from rolling in the first place, the ball will spontaneously

253
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,420
roll downward, presumably coming to rest at the bottom of the hill in the lowest energy

254
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,600
state available. Chemical systems are a perfect analogy for this physical system that I just

255
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,080
described. Just as that ball has an associated physical potential energy, which it would

256
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,080
like to release, so does a collection of molecules have an associated chemical free energy that

257
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,080
it would like to release. When a small energetic barrier is overcome by the addition of heat,

258
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,400
catalyst or some other perturbation, the system can then convert spontaneously to its lower

259
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:02,420
energy state. Now chemists often convey this energetic landscape for a chemical reaction

260
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,900
using this hill analogy, and we call it a reaction coordinate diagram. The only difference

261
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,420
here is that the hill is one of chemical potential energy rather than one of physical potential

262
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,740
energy. So the diagrams are essentially a plot of system free energy as a function of

263
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:25,020
reaction progress. So let's finish our discussion today by applying this diagram to Wohler's

264
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Urea Synthesis, and recall that the mechanism for this process involves starting materials,

265
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,200
products, and two different intermediate states, which are meta-stable, and they can exist

266
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,700
for a little while. So we begin by defining the original energy of the system as the y

267
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,760
intercept of our plot, and the first step of our reaction begins with a new bond forming

268
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,520
to hydrogen while its original bond breaks. So this process actually increases the energy

269
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,140
of the system until we reach a maximum energy for the step. The structure at that local

270
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:07,140
energy maximum is called the transition state. Now at first it might seem strange to suggest

271
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,540
that the system is going to move energetically uphill. After all, balls aren't known to roll

272
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,020
suddenly uphill without a little outside help. And the same is actually true of chemical

273
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,660
systems, but often the help is already there. It's all around us permeating every object

274
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,680
in this room. Of course I'm talking about heat. At all temperatures but absolute zero,

275
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,520
there will be some molecular motion, bond vibration, molecular collisions, and other

276
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,800
kinds of motions. And so long as there's sufficient thermal energy in a system to get it over

277
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,560
that initial barrier from starting materials to the transition state, the reaction will

278
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:53,580
take place. Now we call that activation, that barrier activation energy as you already know.

279
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,460
And just as you might expect, often the addition of heat to a reaction mixture is all it needs

280
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:04,660
to traverse that barrier, thereby speeding the reaction up. Now as that first step winds

281
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,700
down, we see that the energy of the system begins to decrease to a local minimum. But

282
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,260
in this case it has a second energetic hill to climb on its way to the final product.

283
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,680
So we call this local minimum an intermediate. And it's distinct from transition states because

284
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,240
it has a small energy well there which makes it metastable so it can exist in measurable

285
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:34,240
amounts while the reaction is running. In the next step ammonia forms its bond to the

286
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,960
newly formed cyanic acid. Again this increases the energy of the system initially to a point

287
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,640
representing the transition state for that process. After that new bond formation completes

288
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:52,180
and the system reaches another metastable state. We finally conclude the reaction with

289
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:59,180
the reorganization of the product by an intramolecular exchange of a hydrogen. So we've created an

290
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,380
energy diagram here for the entire process of converting ammonium cyanate into urea

291
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,380
in three steps. Now let's review the relevance of all the features of this diagram.

292
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Our starting materials must pass through a transition state to become the first intermediates

293
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:22,400
ammonia and cyanic acid. The diagram tells me two important things. First that the reaction

294
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,640
will happen quickly because the energetic barrier is relatively low. And second that

295
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,520
a large amount of this intermediate will exist in equilibrium with the starting material

296
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,200
because the intermediate is lower in energy. The second step of the mechanism reaches a

297
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,740
considerably higher transition state energy which tells me that this is a rate limiting

298
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,460
step of the reaction. Since this step is expected to proceed much more slowly than the others

299
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:53,960
by virtue of the energy change taking place. Finally the intramolecular proton relocation

300
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,580
or hydrogen relocation takes place quickly and irreversibly once that last intermediate

301
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,980
has formed. This creates a product of greater stability than the original starting materials

302
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:11,120
and my reaction is complete. So today we've taken a look at how chemists communicate chemical

303
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,520
transitions to one another. We do this in much the same way that a cartoonist tells

304
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:23,520
a story with pains showing punctuated depictions of a system as it undergoes changes. We started

305
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,540
with the phenomenon of resonance or delocalization of electrons. And we talked about how multiple

306
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,640
resonance contributors contained in brackets and separated by straight two headed arrows

307
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,640
can be mentally combined in a mathematical average to produce the resonance hybrid.

308
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,520
We looked at how to write a reaction scheme which communicates the four crucial details

309
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:53,520
of a reaction, the starting materials, the products, the conditions and the reversibility.

310
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,480
And we discussed how the choice of arrows separating the starting materials and products

311
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,700
give us a little bit of information about that reversibility. Then we explored the art

312
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,540
of depicting mechanisms in which schemes are expanded into their elementary steps and the

313
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,660
motion of electrons is indicated by curved arrows pointing from the original location

314
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:20,220
to their final destination in a given step. And finally we took a look at a reaction coordinate

315
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,260
diagram and how it shows us the energetic landscape of a chemical change making such

316
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,600
details as the transition state and intermediate energies and rate limiting steps all evident

317
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,040
to us. As we progress through the remainder of this course, we're going to rely heavily

318
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,800
on what we've learned regarding chemical drawing. And next time we'll put some of these drawing

319
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,840
skills into practice as we investigate the acid based properties of organic compounds.

320
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,360
I'll see you then.
