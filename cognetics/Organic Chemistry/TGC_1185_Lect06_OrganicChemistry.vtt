00:00.000 --> 00:18.920
In 1957, the German pharmaceutical firm GrÃ¼nenthal was enjoying sizable profits from its post-war

00:18.920 --> 00:22.080
sales of the antibiotic penicillin.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.360
And as the company sought to reinvest those profits and continue growing its product line,

00:26.360 --> 00:34.960
it developed a compound called 2-2-6-dioxo-piperidine-3-ill-1-H-isoindole-1-3-2-H-dione.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.520
That's a mouthful, isn't it?

00:37.520 --> 00:41.880
This compound was touted as a miracle cure for a variety of ailments, all the way from

00:41.880 --> 00:46.600
insomnia to colds to headaches.

00:46.600 --> 00:51.840
A global public made trusting by the miraculous benefits of drugs like penicillin welcomed

00:51.840 --> 00:55.800
this new product into their medicine cabinets with open arms.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.480
In the early 1960s, the indications for this new wonder drug were expanded to include morning

01:01.480 --> 01:05.560
sickness in pregnant women.

01:05.560 --> 01:10.160
Within months of its introduction to world markets for this particular use, thousands

01:10.160 --> 01:14.480
of reports of birth defects began rolling into government offices and countries which had

01:14.480 --> 01:16.840
approved its use.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.960
Within a year or two, it became clear that this new indication for the drug was linked

01:20.960 --> 01:23.720
somehow to this growing catastrophe.

01:23.720 --> 01:29.080
Its use for this purpose was quickly stopped, though not before tens of thousands of lives

01:29.080 --> 01:33.280
were tragically and directly affected.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.400
The drug that I'm talking about is, of course, the now infamous thalidomide.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.600
Most of us are at least familiar with the story of this drug's remarkable efficacy,

01:42.600 --> 01:46.680
but also its remarkable ability to cause birth defects in growing fetuses.

01:46.680 --> 01:52.120
Now, what you might not realize, however, is that these two biological effects are actually

01:52.120 --> 01:57.640
the result of two different forms of the molecule sold under that trade name.

01:57.640 --> 02:02.400
Today we're going to investigate the phenomenon of stereoisomerism, the key to understanding

02:02.400 --> 02:09.480
what a tragedy the thalidomide accident truly was.

02:09.480 --> 02:14.360
Hi.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.000
Start today with an easy question, shall we?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.480
Did I just wave to you with my left hand or my right hand?

02:20.280 --> 02:25.120
Now I'm guessing anyone watching this lecture can easily conclude that was my right hand.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.800
But how did you know that it was my right hand?

02:27.800 --> 02:32.800
Well, you know that it was my right hand because, even though I have a thumb, four fingers and

02:32.800 --> 02:40.800
a palm on both hands, what makes them different is the position and orientation of those substituents

02:40.800 --> 02:42.240
on the hands.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.680
The direction of the palm, the fingers and the thumb are unique on the right hand as

02:46.680 --> 02:48.880
compared to the left.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.440
If I try to superimpose them, I can't make it work.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.200
If I line the palms, my thumbs are on the wrong sides.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.800
Yet if I line my thumbs, now the palms don't match.

02:58.800 --> 03:05.240
So in spite of the identical connectivity, I can't superimpose my hands with one another.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.960
Clearly they are distinct objects which can interact with the world differently.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.200
You don't believe me, just try to put a right-handed glove on your left hand.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.560
It's a completely different experience than trying to put it on the right hand.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.600
Now, so far we've concerned ourselves with macro-scale objects and we're not done with

03:23.600 --> 03:28.680
that yet, but let's take a few minutes and turn our attention to a geometry more relevant

03:28.680 --> 03:31.560
to organic chemistry, the tetrahedron.

03:31.560 --> 03:37.800
See, carbon atoms can have up to four sigma bonds, meaning four different bonded substituents

03:37.800 --> 03:40.920
arranged tetrahedrally about a central atom.

03:40.920 --> 03:46.320
Now, when these four substituents are all distinct from one another, they actually create

03:46.320 --> 03:50.840
two different possible arrangements which hold the same connectivity.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.000
Okay, so let's take a look at this tetrahedral center here.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.880
It's got four distinct substituents and for now we're just going to use these colors,

03:57.880 --> 04:03.760
red, blue, yellow, and green to indicate that they're all different from one another.

04:03.760 --> 04:11.560
Now if I were to make an exact copy of this, but interchange two of the four substituents,

04:11.560 --> 04:12.840
look at what happens here.

04:12.880 --> 04:18.000
I've created two structures with exactly the same connectivity, but no matter how I translate

04:18.000 --> 04:23.080
and rotate them, there's no way to make them superimposed with one another.

04:23.080 --> 04:30.160
Now these two hypothetical molecules have handedness, just like my hands did in our previous example.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.160
And when we interchange two substituents on a central atom, just like we did here, we

04:34.160 --> 04:36.880
produce a new molecule.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.520
And when this happens, we call the central atom a chiral center.

04:41.520 --> 04:46.280
In our current example, this is a tetrahedral center with four distinct substituents.

04:46.280 --> 04:51.640
Now the result of course was that we had non-superimposable objects with identical connectivity.

04:51.640 --> 04:57.080
And when this happens, we call these two entities stereoisomers of one another.

05:00.680 --> 05:05.440
Now pairs of stereoisomers fall into several distinct categories and understanding each

05:05.440 --> 05:09.640
of them is critical to understanding the physical and chemical properties of some of the organic

05:09.640 --> 05:12.160
compounds that contain them.

05:12.160 --> 05:17.560
So before we begin investigating these relationships, let me stress to you that they are just that,

05:17.560 --> 05:18.720
relationships.

05:18.720 --> 05:23.080
Just as you can be a brother to one person and an uncle to another, so can a given molecule

05:23.080 --> 05:29.800
have various stereoisomer relationships to other similar molecules.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.920
Now the first class of stereoisomers that I'd like to look at are called enantiomers.

05:34.920 --> 05:40.200
In most chemistry books, you'll find them defined as non-superimposable mirror images.

05:40.200 --> 05:44.480
I prefer to think of them as a pair of compounds in which all of the atom connectivity is the

05:44.480 --> 05:49.160
same, but all of the stereocenters are inverted.

05:49.160 --> 05:53.800
So the simplest example of our tetrahedral center with just one stereocenter, this is

05:53.800 --> 05:56.600
really the only possible relationship we could develop.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.640
You can't invert a fraction of a stereocenter.

05:59.640 --> 06:03.320
Now this is in fact a part of the thalidomide story.

06:03.320 --> 06:09.840
The thalidomide, like many drugs, contains a chiral center.

06:09.840 --> 06:15.320
One of these stereoisomers of thalidomide has the desirable pharmacological properties.

06:15.320 --> 06:20.280
But the other stereoisomer, which was thought to be completely innocuous at the time, was

06:20.280 --> 06:25.720
in fact a powerful angiogenesis inhibitor, which is a fancy way of saying that it inhibits

06:25.720 --> 06:30.680
the development of blood vessels critical to proper fetal growth.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.880
And what's worse is that this angiogenesis inhibitor crosses the placental barrier with

06:34.880 --> 06:41.920
startling efficiency and doomed many fetuses to abnormal development.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.960
Now you'll notice that interchanging two of the four substituents produced a mirror image

06:45.960 --> 06:49.480
of the original, and of course that I couldn't superimpose them.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.800
So we call them enantiomers of one another.

06:52.800 --> 06:58.400
But when more than one chiral center, or center of handedness, is present in a molecule, the

06:58.400 --> 07:01.360
picture becomes a little bit more complicated.

07:01.360 --> 07:09.320
So let's take the example of a hypothetical compound with two non-identical stereocenters.

07:09.320 --> 07:14.600
In my example I have one stereocenter with red, yellow, and green substituents, and another

07:14.600 --> 07:19.200
with purple, orange, and gray substituents.

07:19.200 --> 07:25.560
Now inversion of both stereocenters produces that mirror image which can't be superimposed.

07:25.560 --> 07:31.040
So here I've made a set of enantiomers, which you'll recall I defined as compounds in which

07:31.040 --> 07:34.000
all centers are inverted.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.440
But now that I have multiple stereocenters, it's possible to invert only one while leaving

07:39.440 --> 07:42.600
the other one in its original state.

07:42.600 --> 07:49.280
When I do this, the result is a compound with identical connectivity which is neither superimposable

07:49.280 --> 07:51.400
nor a mirror image.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.000
And these pairs of compounds have a different name.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.560
Their relationship is called diastereomers.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.480
Sets of diastereomers are distinct from sets of enantiomers in that they can, and very

08:02.480 --> 08:08.400
often do, have different physical properties like boiling points, melting points.

08:08.400 --> 08:13.960
A third and somewhat unusual situation arises when a compound contains two stereocenters

08:13.960 --> 08:17.240
which each have the same force of substituents attached.

08:17.240 --> 08:22.520
Now in this instance, it's possible to have a situation in which a complete inversion

08:22.520 --> 08:27.880
of stereochemistry leads to a mirror image, but that mirror image is exactly the same

08:27.880 --> 08:29.680
molecule.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.320
When this happens, we don't actually have two different stereoisomers, but we have a compound

08:34.320 --> 08:37.520
that still has stereocenters or chiral centers.

08:37.520 --> 08:44.960
So we give them a special name, mesocompounds.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.240
Now not all stereoisomers contain chiral centers.

08:48.680 --> 08:54.040
Now recall our definition of stereocenter is that interchanging two groups on that center

08:54.040 --> 08:57.400
changes the identity of a molecule.

08:57.400 --> 09:02.000
You also may recall that in lecture two, we learned that pi bonds have restricted rotation

09:02.000 --> 09:07.160
owing to the side-to-side overlap of p-atomic orbitals, which can't be interrupted unless

09:07.160 --> 09:10.040
we break the pi bond.

09:10.040 --> 09:14.720
So this can lead to another kind of stereoisomerism.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.120
Here's a molecule of what we would call beta-butylene.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.480
Now since we can't rotate pi bonds, it's possible to have a compound like this with

09:23.480 --> 09:30.040
two substituents, a methyl and a hydrogen on this, a methyl and a hydrogen on this carbon.

09:30.040 --> 09:36.960
And I can create a second form of this beta-butylene molecule in which my two CH3 groups are on

09:36.960 --> 09:41.640
the same side of the molecule instead of the opposing sides of the molecule.

09:41.640 --> 09:46.920
And any effort I make to convert this molecule to this is thwarted by the presence of the

09:46.920 --> 09:48.760
pi bond.

09:48.760 --> 09:55.800
So two different isomers exist, even though these are not tetrahedral centers.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.600
Now the presence of the pi bond makes these two isomers distinct from one another, since

09:59.600 --> 10:04.080
breaking the pi bond between the two carbons is necessary to achieve the kind of rotation

10:04.080 --> 10:07.360
it would take to make them superimposable.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.360
And since this sort of thing doesn't tend to happen on its own, we'll see later that

10:10.360 --> 10:17.280
it takes a special set of circumstances to encourage that change.

10:17.280 --> 10:22.800
Now since multiple isomers of compounds with stereocenters are possible, naturally we need

10:22.800 --> 10:26.720
to come up with a labeling system to distinguish them from one another.

10:26.720 --> 10:34.480
And several systems exist, but the most commonly employed is the con-angled pre-log convention.

10:34.480 --> 10:40.440
In 1950, as the phenomenon and significance of chirality was just becoming understood,

10:40.440 --> 10:46.240
two English chemists, Robert Kong and Christopher Engeld, began cooking up a methodology for

10:46.240 --> 10:51.800
quickly and unambiguously distinguishing one stereoisomer from another by name.

10:51.800 --> 10:56.880
A third chemist, named Vladimir Prelog, entered the discussion during a social event thrown

10:56.880 --> 11:00.880
by the British chemical company Imperial Chemical Industries.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.240
And this is one of those great moments in history in which the wallflowers among us

11:04.240 --> 11:06.200
can really be proud.

11:06.200 --> 11:12.120
Because as Prelog himself put it, everybody danced except for Engeld, Kahn and myself.

11:12.120 --> 11:18.000
Not being proficient dancers, we drank beer in discussed chemistry.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.200
Now I love this story, not only because it combines two of my favorite things, chemistry

11:22.200 --> 11:27.720
and beer, but because the product of the discussion was a two-year collaboration leading to what

11:27.720 --> 11:33.560
is today the most used method of communicating stereochemistry in naming organic compounds,

11:33.560 --> 11:38.880
the Kahn Engeld prelog convention.

11:38.880 --> 11:43.640
Kahn Engeld prelog convention gives us a way to assign a rank to all the substituents around

11:43.640 --> 11:46.120
a particular stereocenter.

11:46.120 --> 11:50.760
And we can then use these ranks to describe the geometric arrangement of a compound quickly

11:50.760 --> 11:52.840
and easily.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.920
So since the first step is ranking the substituents, let's concern ourselves with that for the

11:56.920 --> 11:59.680
moment.

11:59.680 --> 12:04.760
The system that Kahn Engeld and Prelog suggested was one of a sequential comparison of atoms

12:04.760 --> 12:09.400
within the competing substituents around that central atom.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.120
And the rules take a bit of getting used to, but in fact once you do get used to it they're

12:13.120 --> 12:14.960
quite simple.

12:14.960 --> 12:20.360
In short, we start from the chiral center and move out one bond at a time, comparing all

12:20.360 --> 12:26.000
atoms encountered and the substituent with the first instance of the heavier atom wins

12:26.000 --> 12:28.320
priority.

12:28.320 --> 12:33.240
Any time a double or triple bond is encountered, the doubly or triply bonded atom is counted

12:33.240 --> 12:37.440
twice or three times, respectively.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.520
Now let's take a look at this rule in action.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.640
And we're going to consider just the ranking of substituents for the moment and we'll add

12:42.640 --> 12:46.320
those spatial arrangements later.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.760
Let's begin with a molecule we've all heard of, this is Freon 151.

12:50.760 --> 12:56.240
It's also called chlorofluoroethane and it contains a chiral center right there.

12:56.240 --> 13:05.520
This carbon has four distinct substituents, chlorine, fluorine, CH3, and a hydrogen.

13:05.520 --> 13:10.520
So to rank each of these substituents using the Kahn Engeld pre-log convention, I simply

13:10.520 --> 13:15.000
move one bond out from the carbon and make a note of the atom I encounter.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.840
In this case, a chlorine, a fluorine, a carbon, and a hydrogen.

13:19.840 --> 13:25.400
Now the atomic numbers of these are 17, 9, 6, and 1 respectively.

13:25.400 --> 13:31.440
So I can distinguish each of my substituents here based upon the first atom that I've encountered.

13:31.440 --> 13:39.400
So I'll rank chlorine as 1, fluorine as 2, my CH3 group as 3, and my hydrogen as 4.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.080
I've completed my ranking using Kahn Engeld pre-log.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.800
But not all molecules are as simple as Freon.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.160
Let's take the example of a naturally occurring compound called limonene.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.280
You'll find limonene in the peels of citrus fruits.

13:53.280 --> 13:57.240
And I've drawn for you here the line angle formula, but to do our Kahn Engeld pre-log

13:57.240 --> 14:01.440
analysis I'm going to convert this into a more expanded formula.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.040
Now take a look at this structure.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.600
Can you find the chiral carbon?

14:04.600 --> 14:09.920
Remember, it's a tetrahedral center with four unique substituents.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.480
It's right there.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
Hydrogen.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.920
Here's our second substituent.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.920
And then the other two substituents actually are parts of this loop, one and the other.

14:18.920 --> 14:23.760
And they're distinct from one another, which means this is genuinely a chiral center.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.480
So let's start our analysis.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.200
One bond out gives me three carbons and a hydrogen.

14:28.200 --> 14:35.440
So I can assign my lowest priority substituent, but I still have three other competing substituents.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.600
So let's go another bond out.

14:37.600 --> 14:42.840
When I do that, I have a situation where I have a double bonded carbon, which means I

14:42.840 --> 14:47.720
count it twice, whereas here I have carbons and hydrogens.

14:47.720 --> 14:53.840
So when I take my inventory of all the bonded atoms that I've encountered, I have CCC for

14:53.840 --> 15:01.560
this one, CHH for my substituent on the left side, and CHH for my substituent on the right

15:01.560 --> 15:02.840
side.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.740
So as I take a quick scan here, I see a tie and then I see a win.

15:06.740 --> 15:11.480
So this substituent is going to be my top ranked substituent.

15:11.480 --> 15:17.120
But I'm not done yet because I still have a tie for the second and third position, which

15:17.120 --> 15:21.240
means I've got to go another bond length away.

15:21.240 --> 15:27.600
When I do this, on the left hand side of the molecule, I get CHH, and on the right side,

15:27.600 --> 15:34.800
I encounter another double bond to a carbon, meaning it's counted twice, or CCH.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.880
So the substituent on the right side would be ranked number two and a substituent on

15:38.880 --> 15:40.080
the left number three.

15:40.080 --> 15:44.040
Now there's another gotcha to this system that I'd like to point out.

15:44.040 --> 15:48.400
This is a favorite when I write an exam question, actually, and that is that the tendency becomes

15:48.400 --> 15:52.400
to look for that heavy atom and say, that must be the top ranked substituent.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.720
And a great example of this is a fluoxetine molecule, also marketed under the trade name

15:56.720 --> 15:58.960
Prozac.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.040
Fluoxetine contains a chiral center right here.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.880
And if we looked at this and gave it a quick glance, we might notice there's a nitrogen

16:05.880 --> 16:06.880
up here.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.560
I've had a low carbon in hydrogen since the heavy atom is on the upward pointing substituent.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.400
That must be a higher rank.

16:13.400 --> 16:18.720
But the truth is, it's not, because con-ingled pre-log requires that I move sequentially,

16:18.720 --> 16:21.920
one bond at a time, and make my comparison.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.480
Once I have a win, I stop counting.

16:24.480 --> 16:32.480
So my first bond out lets me assign the one and four to the oxygen and the hydrogen, respectively.

16:32.480 --> 16:38.920
And to break the tie between my carbons, I go one more bond to get CHH on my top and

16:38.920 --> 16:42.160
CCC off to the left here.

16:42.160 --> 16:46.520
So this substituent has won, and I never even encounter the heavy atom.

16:46.520 --> 16:51.280
So it's crucial when doing this ranking that you go bond by bond and stop as soon as you

16:51.280 --> 16:52.480
found a difference.

16:52.480 --> 16:58.960
This is how the con-ingled pre-log works.

16:58.960 --> 17:03.520
So the ranking system proposed by con-ingled and pre-log gives us the basis for assigning

17:03.520 --> 17:08.440
a universal stereochemistry designation to particular chiral centers.

17:08.440 --> 17:13.040
But we have yet to define exactly how we use these rankings to define the geometry around

17:13.040 --> 17:15.320
those stereocenters.

17:15.320 --> 17:21.680
The most common use of these rankings is what's called the RS system of nomenclature.

17:21.680 --> 17:28.160
In this system, each chiral center is given a designation of R or S, depending upon the

17:28.160 --> 17:34.240
arrangement of rank substituents around the center, and it's done in the following way.

17:34.240 --> 17:38.760
After we've ranked all four substituents, we place the fourth ranked substituent at

17:38.760 --> 17:41.000
the back of the molecule.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.680
And next we draw a curved arrow passing through the first, second, and third rank substituents.

17:47.680 --> 17:53.640
If that arrow traces out a clockwise rotation, we call this the R enantiomer, from the Latin

17:53.640 --> 17:56.680
for rectus or right.

17:56.680 --> 18:01.760
If instead it traces out a counterclockwise path, we call it the S enantiomer from the

18:01.760 --> 18:06.160
Latin for sinister or left.

18:06.160 --> 18:10.960
So let's try this system out on the two enantiomers of 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane, remember freon

18:10.960 --> 18:11.960
151.

18:11.960 --> 18:16.720
Now again, we'll identify the chiral center and rank the four substituents with chlorine

18:16.720 --> 18:23.680
as 1, fluorine as 2, carbon as 3, and hydrogen as 4.

18:23.680 --> 18:28.280
In this case, the lowest ranked substituent is already pointed to the back, I can simply

18:28.280 --> 18:31.680
draw my arrows and assign my stereochemistry.

18:31.680 --> 18:37.320
So the molecule on the left is S, 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane, and the molecule on the right

18:37.320 --> 18:42.080
is R, 1-chloro, 1-fluoroethane.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.000
Let's try that same exercise with limonene, the compound responsible for that strong aroma

18:46.000 --> 18:47.920
of citrus fruits.

18:47.920 --> 18:52.600
And you'll recall limonene has a single chiral center, and it's located here.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.880
Now I've drawn the limonene structure with the hydrogen in the back of the molecule as

18:55.880 --> 19:02.840
well, so I'm ready to determine its RS designation without having to rotate the molecule any further.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.720
Counting for my substituents 1 through 3, I draw a circle which is clockwise.

19:07.720 --> 19:12.920
So this enantiomer of limonene has an R stereocenter.

19:12.920 --> 19:18.360
Of course we can draw a limonene with the S stereocenter simply by reflecting this molecule.

19:18.360 --> 19:22.480
And the enantiomer of limonene actually doesn't smell like citrus at all, but more like

19:22.480 --> 19:25.640
pine tar or turpentine.

19:25.640 --> 19:30.200
So one very useful aspect of the RS system is actually how simple it is to tell when

19:30.200 --> 19:36.920
you're dealing with enantiomers or mesocompounds in cases with two similar chiral centers.

19:36.920 --> 19:42.320
So let's have another look at 2,4-dichloropentane as an example.

19:42.320 --> 19:49.120
Here I have two chiral centers in the molecule, but is this molecule chiral overall?

19:49.120 --> 19:50.720
The answer is no.

19:50.720 --> 20:00.920
If I assign chirality to each stereocenter in this example, I find that I have 2R4S2,4-dichloropentane.

20:00.920 --> 20:11.040
Now the mirror image of this molecule is 2S4R2,4-dichloropentane, which is exactly the same molecule.

20:11.040 --> 20:16.280
A simple translation and rotation allows me to overlay the two molecules.

20:16.280 --> 20:21.800
But the other two possibilities here are the RR and SS enantiomers, and these are in

20:21.800 --> 20:26.480
fact chiral because they are not superimposable with their mirror images.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.840
So these two are a set of enantiomers.

20:30.840 --> 20:37.600
Now, con-angle pre-law convention is not only used in tetrahedral chiral centers, but also

20:37.600 --> 20:42.960
in designating the stereoisomers which contain double bonds, which are not chiral, like our

20:42.960 --> 20:43.960
beta-butylene.

20:44.120 --> 20:48.280
So here are my two different stereoisomers of beta-butylene.

20:48.280 --> 20:53.400
And we've already heard cis and trans mentioned a few times as a means of conveying the relationships

20:53.400 --> 20:58.920
between the substituents along this double bond which has restricted rotation.

20:58.920 --> 21:02.360
So there are two different isomers here which cannot interconvert easily because of the

21:02.360 --> 21:05.160
pi bond.

21:05.160 --> 21:10.640
In one of them, the larger groups are at opposition, and in the other one, the larger groups are

21:10.640 --> 21:12.520
next to one another.

21:12.520 --> 21:17.200
And because the second substituent in this case is hydrogen, it's very easy to tell when

21:17.200 --> 21:20.760
I say trans or cis exactly what I'm talking about.

21:20.760 --> 21:25.440
Clearly I'm talking about the non-hydrogen-based substituents.

21:25.440 --> 21:29.000
So we would call this a cis-trans nomenclature system.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.360
But what happens when we get to a more complex molecule that doesn't necessarily have hydrogens

21:33.360 --> 21:36.360
bonded to all of its stereocenter carbons?

21:36.360 --> 21:39.520
Let's take this example here.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.720
At this point, I've got a molecule which actually has one of its sp2 carbons bearing

21:43.720 --> 21:50.280
two different substituents, in this case a ch3-ch2 group and a chlorine group.

21:50.280 --> 21:56.720
So looking at each of the two carbons in the sp2 system, the first one is very easy to determine.

21:56.720 --> 22:02.040
My higher priority substituent, which I'll use in my naming, is clearly the ch3.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.720
But how do I determine the other two?

22:03.720 --> 22:07.800
Well, this is the problem that con angle pre-log solves.

22:07.800 --> 22:14.640
If I turn my attention to that carbon and its substituents, I reach a carbon and a chlorine.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.280
So clearly the chlorine has higher priority.

22:18.280 --> 22:23.440
So these two higher priority substituents are as far apart as possible.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.760
They're on opposite sides of the molecule.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.840
And so we use the letter E to designate this isomer.

22:29.840 --> 22:34.400
Had they been on the same side, we would have designated it as a Z isomer.

22:34.800 --> 22:39.280
And these names come from the German meaning same and opposite.

22:39.280 --> 22:44.480
So let's apply this to a different type of molecule, one that you might find in nature.

22:44.480 --> 22:50.440
Geranial is a compound produced by flowers, as is the compound neral.

22:50.440 --> 22:54.640
But they produce different floral smells, distinctly different.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.880
And yet when we take a look at these two molecules, we see that the bond connectivity is identical.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.280
So what's the source of the difference here?

23:02.280 --> 23:06.840
Well, the source of the difference is that they are stereoisomers of one another.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.960
If I take a look at the line angle formula for geranial,

23:09.960 --> 23:16.120
and I choose my two highest con angle pre-log substituents compared to that of neral,

23:16.120 --> 23:21.920
in geranial they're at opposition to one another, meaning this would be an E stereoisomer.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.520
Whereas in neral, they're on the same side of the molecule,

23:25.520 --> 23:28.880
meaning that they would be Z stereoisomer.

23:28.920 --> 23:32.160
So in this case, just as in the case of limonene,

23:32.160 --> 23:36.920
inverting a stereocenter causes a completely different smell to form in the molecule.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.960
They clearly react differently with U.

23:43.160 --> 23:48.080
So the difference between smelling like a lemon or a pine tree, or different kinds of flowers,

23:48.080 --> 23:52.400
all comes down to something as simple as the inversion of a stereocenter.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.800
That's remarkable.

23:54.800 --> 24:02.880
So let's wrap up our discussion today by taking one last look at thalidomide from a stereochemistry perspective.

24:02.880 --> 24:08.200
We know now that it's the R-antimer of thalidomide, which has the desirable sedative properties,

24:08.200 --> 24:13.720
but the S-antimer causes the defects in developing fetuses.

24:13.720 --> 24:19.240
So if I wanted to draw the stereoisomer of this molecule with the desirable pharmacological properties,

24:19.320 --> 24:24.680
I'd have to first rank all four substituents using conical pre-law.

24:24.680 --> 24:33.000
I have one group attached by a nitrogen, one by a hydrogen, and two groups attached by carbons.

24:33.000 --> 24:42.040
Of those two groups attached by carbon, one has a C-H-H set of bonds, and the other O-O-N.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.640
So I now have all the information I need to rank my substituents.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.840
And now I just need to place the lowest in the back

24:48.840 --> 24:53.480
and draw the remaining three in a clockwise fashion to complete the structure.

24:53.480 --> 24:57.800
I've drawn the sedative version of thalidomide.

24:57.800 --> 25:04.120
So the logical question one might ask here is, if we know that the R-antimer of thalidomide has favorable properties

25:04.120 --> 25:12.600
and the S-antimer is terribly, terribly toxic, can we simply remove the S-antimer from the product?

25:12.600 --> 25:15.960
Well, in the case of thalidomide, this is unfortunately not possible.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.320
And the reason why goes back to our last lecture on acid-base chemistry.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.400
See, because the hydrogen on the chiral center is weakly acidic,

25:23.400 --> 25:26.200
it can be removed by the weak bases in your bloodstream.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.520
And it's then replaced to the molecule from both sides,

25:30.520 --> 25:35.000
meaning that it can actually reform the S-antimer in your bloodstream.

25:35.640 --> 25:40.360
So any attempt to get pure arthalidomide into the bloodstream would only result in its conversion

25:40.360 --> 25:44.760
back to what we call a racemic mixture or an equal mixture of the two enantiomers

25:44.760 --> 25:45.880
within a matter of minutes.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.080
But everything we learn today is not in vain.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.480
There are many pharmaceutical products in use today,

25:54.200 --> 25:58.920
things as simple as anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, opiates like methadone,

25:58.920 --> 26:04.120
and even our antidepressant, fluoxetine, all of which contain sets of stereoisomers.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.800
In some cases, only one of which has the desired pharmacological property.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.720
But because we are aware of the phenomenon of chirality,

26:11.720 --> 26:16.600
we know that we need to test both of those for toxicity before we put our drugs on the market.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.960
A lesson learned from Thalidomide.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.160
So let's review what we've learned today.

26:24.120 --> 26:28.440
We've explored the idea of handedness and how chemists have given this phenomenon

26:28.440 --> 26:30.120
a different name, chirality.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.920
We saw how tetrahedral centers and molecules can be chiral

26:34.920 --> 26:37.880
if they contain four distinct bonded substituents.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.680
And we saw how handedness can be inverted by interchanging two of those substituents

26:42.680 --> 26:46.040
on such a chiral center, creating sets of stereoisomers.

26:48.600 --> 26:52.280
We took a look at some examples of stereoisomers, including enantiomers,

26:52.280 --> 26:54.440
in which all the chiral centers have been inverted.

26:55.320 --> 27:00.200
We looked at diastereomers, in which some but not all of the chiral centers have been inverted.

27:01.080 --> 27:05.400
And we also saw a special case in which equal and opposite chiral centers

27:05.480 --> 27:10.120
invert rendering a molecule A chiral, even though it has those chiral centers in it.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.080
We've explored how it is possible for compounds to have stereoisomers,

27:15.080 --> 27:16.760
even when they don't have chiral centers.

27:17.400 --> 27:21.720
Most notably, this happens when compounds have double bonds with distinct substituents

27:21.720 --> 27:23.720
on those sp2 hybridized carbons.

27:25.400 --> 27:29.640
Now, next we met Robert Kahn, Chris Engeld, and Vladimir Prelog,

27:29.640 --> 27:33.640
who devised a system for ranking substituents around stereocenters

27:33.640 --> 27:37.240
so that we could have a simple convention for describing them to one another.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.000
And we saw how chiral centers are categorized by the direction in which

27:43.000 --> 27:46.200
the three highest priority substituents are seen

27:46.200 --> 27:49.480
when the lowest priority substituent is in the back of the molecule,

27:50.520 --> 27:53.240
R for clockwise, S for counterclockwise.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.440
Then we took a look at stereoisomers containing double bonds,

27:58.440 --> 28:01.400
and how they can be described using E and Z designations,

28:01.960 --> 28:05.800
and how substituents ranked using the Kahn Engeld Prelog convention

28:05.800 --> 28:08.920
allow us to determine our priorities for that naming system as well.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.520
And finally, we used the example of thalidomide to demonstrate

28:14.520 --> 28:18.360
the power of stereochemistry and the profound differences in properties,

28:18.360 --> 28:23.320
which can result from a change as simple as reflecting just one chiral center.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.920
Next time we're going to begin a series of lectures,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.040
in which we categorize, name, and explore the structures

28:32.040 --> 28:34.520
of various classes of organic compounds.

28:34.520 --> 28:44.840
I'm looking forward to that, and I'll see you then.
