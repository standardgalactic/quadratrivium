 The ancient Olympic games featured various events, one of which was the equestrian race, which involved chariots pulled by horses. The race began with a dramatic starting mechanism that involved an altar, a bronze eagle, and a bronze dolphin. When the eagle was made to jump and become visible to the spectators, a signal for the start of the race was given, leading to the sequential dropping of barriers as the chariots raced towards the finish line, aiming to have all competitors abreast at the end of the initial sprint.

Despite the dangers and the skill required by both the horses and their drivers, it was the owners rather than the athletes who received the glory and the victor's wreath. The owner who stood out in this context was Alcibiades, who famously entered seven chariot teams into the Olympic games and won first, second, and third places in a single event. This achievement earned him a hymn by Euripides celebrating his accomplishment.

However, not everyone shared the same enthusiasm for the athletic heroes of ancient Greece. Xenophon, for instance, believed that the veneration of these athletes was excessive and questioned whether such victories truly benefited the city. The Olympic games, nonetheless, maintained a strong grip on the Greek imagination, as we will explore further in the next lecture.

 The ancient Olympics were not just about athletic competition; they were a cultural event that celebrated Greek identity and unity, attracting participants and spectators from across the Greek world. These games, held at Olympia every four years, were considered Pan-Hellenic, meaning they were for all Greeks. Alongside athletic events, the Olympics featured cultural activities such as poetry, music, and performances, with poets like Pindar composing works to celebrate Olympic victors. The games were so significant that even after Greece became a province of the Roman Empire, they continued to thrive and were viewed as the greatest games in the world. The Olympic victors were held in high esteem, and their glory was immortalized through poetry and other cultural expressions. The Olympics remained a central institution in Greek life for over a millennium, lasting until the 4th century AD, and the tradition of celebrating athletic champions in cultural terms has continued into modern times, including the contemporary Olympic Games, which now also include non-athletic cultural events. The Teaching Company offers courses on various subjects, including the history of the ancient Olympics, taught by professors like Professor McInerney, and provides access to a wide range of educational materials.
