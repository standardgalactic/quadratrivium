In the last lecture, we were looking and with some specificity about supersymmetry. Now
remember this is of course really a course on string theory and so we have to think for
a moment why were we doing that? The answer is that supersymmetry is one of the signatures
that string theory almost predicts about our world. If supersymmetry is discovered in the
laboratory it will be an enormous boost for the idea that string theory is an accurate
description of nature. Supersymmetry however would be good for other reasons and let me
admit that supersymmetry could be present without string theory. Remember I commented that most
string theories produce notes and pairs and that's what we would think of a supersymmetry.
But supersymmetry can fix other mysterious problems in our universe. In one of my very
beginning lectures I talked about something called dark matter. Dark matter explains some
things but it's a puzzle. For example the formation of galaxies over the time scales
that we need in order to describe our universe doesn't work if we just include the matter
that is contained in stars that are visible. We have to in order to get the mathematical
description to describe our universe assume that there's more matter than we can detect with our
telescopes about nine times more. We've seen that to live in a universe where ordinary
matter is only one tenth of the matter that's present. One of the things that super partners
provide is a candidate for dark matter. You see in this other mirror part of the universe
that's proposed by supersymmetry there's an object called the LSP that stands for the
lightest supersymmetric particle. Now it's some combination of the things that we see on the
right hand side of our table not particularly clear which one but one of them will be the LSP.
Now why is the LSP so important? Well most of the super particles as we will discover in this
lecture will be enormously massive but one of them if they exist has got to be the lightest one.
The lightest one turns out cannot disappear cannot turn into anything else it has to be
absolutely stable. That means that if we live in a supersymmetric universe perhaps all of the
higher mass super partners have gone away but if they have gone away they have they must have
transmuted themselves into this lightest supersymmetrical particle which means that it would still
be here. Well since it's supersymmetrical it might not have the same sort of force laws that
ordinary matter have. In that case it would effectively be dark. So the LSP is an almost
ideal candidate to explain the dark matter problem in the structure of galaxy formation.
So it would fix the problem if our world were supersymmetric.
Now the description of superpartners I've given you so far is the predominant one but it's not
the only possibility. A few years ago working with a colleague by the name of Oleg Lebedev I studied
the mathematical models where the LSP in fact was one of the squarks. Now why is that important?
Well squarks are of course related to quarks but all quarks are bound in the interior of nuclear
matter. So if the LSP was actually a squark it means that you would find the lightest
supersymmetric particle bound inside of a hadron. Well if that's the case finding supersymmetry
turns out to be much more difficult than the view that I've described previously where the LSP
is not a squark. Now this is very unlikely but mathematically it's good for us to know of the
mischief that nature can make should she choose. Now the bulk of this lecture is going to be talking
about this mass issue. Remember I kept saying the superpartners have to be massive. So the question
becomes can we find a consistent way in which to introduce mass for the superpartner so that
they become very heavy whereas ordinary matter stays light. It turns out that the answer to this
question requires us to do something that we have ignored. We've talked about the fact that
supersymmetry says that things come in pair that ordinary matter is paired with super matter
what about gravity? Well if the principle of supersymmetry is correct then gravity the gravaton
has to have a superpartner. So let's go back and review some things on gravity. Again in a previous
lecture we've learned to think about gravity as somehow associated with curvature. Now there's
an interesting thing about gravity and the force carrier for gravity. I describe the fact that
light has two polarizations it can be left circularly polarized or right circularly polarized.
This statement is approximately true for gravity also so there are actually two
degrees of freedom for gravity but one of the most interesting things about this observation is that
if you're a mathematician and you know how to describe gravity then you can describe gravity
in all dimensions and in particular one of the peculiar things about gravity is that the number
of degrees of freedoms that it contains depends on the dimension and in fact if you look at this
expression I've written I say that the gravaton in d dimensions has the number of degrees of freedom
that are equal to one half d times d minus three. Now for us the number d is four so you plug that
into this formula it becomes one half of four and then four minus three is one and one half of four
is two but yes that's exactly the two polarization states of the gravaton. A curious thing about
this formula it says that if d is equal to three there are no degrees of freedom of gravity
but that's actually very interesting because if the world were three dimensional there would be no
gravity. If there's no gravity there are no galaxies there are no galaxies there are no planets
no stars no life so there's actually a mathematical reason why the smallest conceivable mathematical
construct in which you get a force of gravity turns to look remarkably like our world it happens
at d equal four. Now you can have gravity for higher dimensions but turns out that four is the lowest
dimension in which you could have gravity. Now supersymmetry well supersymmetry I remind you
means that we're allowed to exchange going back and using our latter analogy just one more time
we can think of the blue square as being the gravaton that's the one that appears below in our
diagram but if supersymmetry is correct then we are allowed to change things and look for something
that has similar properties but here corresponds to the brown square. We must find something like
this object for the force of gravity. Now Einstein gave us a picture of gravity associated with
curvature or acceleration which is a a neater way to think about it so how does that actually work?
Well, Einstein essentially says that if you were in an elevator that was accelerating upward then
all objects would appear to fall so a ball would fall but interestingly enough this same set of
equations says that a light beam would fall gravity curves light that's something we know to be true
so there is some kind of message carrier responsible for all of these actions
it's called the gravaton it's the waves that we saw coming off of our neutron star system
many many lectures ago. Well by this exchange rule the gravaton the message for the gravitational
force must be exchanged with another object. This other object has to differ by one half
a unit of spin the gravaton spins at a rate of four times the rate of the electron or spin two
this other object spins at a rate of three-half. Now it turns out that mathematically physicists
have been wondering about these sorts of things for a very long time in fact in 1939 one can find
the first paper where two physicists by the names of Fierce and Paulie Paulie once again
did a lot of good physics wrote equations which describe objects which are spin three-halves
so the mathematical tools have been around for a long time. Now this spin three-halves object
is has a name also it's called the gravatino and in the late to middle 70s the equations which
describe this object interacting consistently with gravity were first written down. It was done by
two groups of physicists Ferrara and Van Nuuyzen and Friedman and then separately it was worked by
Desert and Zamino. So this theory of gravity with this super partner is called supergravity
and in fact your lecturer has spent a large time of his research career studying such theories.
Now these theories also have the kinds of angles that we associated with the photon remember in
the lecture about the forces we had this one demonstration that had two bowls that were different
but the changes that is the number of balls coming out was the same and what the comment was that
even if you have two different photons if the change in the photon is the same then you get
the same electromagnetic field. This statement turns out to be true about the graviton too
if you have two different graviton gravitons but the change in them is the same you produce the
same gravitational effect in nature this also applies to the super partner so the theory of
supergravity was created to respect this property and its actual creation date was 1975.
So we have this picture of supergravity where the super partner to the graviton is around
but our world is not super symmetric that is we don't see a doubling of the particles we see
electrons but we don't see electrons why not I have argued previously that if super matter is
very much more massive you can't see it because we don't have the technology yet but can it is
it possible to find a mathematical equation that allows super matter to be very much more massive
in fact the problem of mass in these theories is much more complicated than you might imagine
remember without gravity we have the strong weak electromagnetic forces
of the force carriers only the force carriers for the weak force have mass the others are all
massless so if we consider the force carriers some have mass some don't the ability to give mass to
force carriers is a complicated problem in fact so complicated that for many years if you look to
the physics literature there was no consistent solution to this until particle physicists
borrowed an idea from people studying magnets in the mathematical descriptions of magnets you can
write an equation which mimics something happens in nature is something is called spontaneous
magnetization there are materials that at normal temperatures are not magnets but if you cool them
sufficiently they turn into magnets now this is a phenomena that's been known for a very long time
to physicists and by studying these kinds of materials sets of equations were developed
these same equations were borrowed by people studying particle physics who were worried
about including mass for the force carriers and in particular
if you want to introduce mass for force carriers if you try the most obvious thing you introduce
time like ghost well my goodness we've talked about time like particles before
as often we also refer to them as time like ghosts and even worse sorts of ghosts appear
if you just try to give mass to a force carrier of the type similar to the photon or the gluon
so there was a point at which things were stuck
this is where magnets came to the rescue by taking the equations for magnets
that form when you get spontaneous magnetization a group of physicists deduced that these same
equations could introduce mass for the force carriers and it's a fairly large group of
physicists who make contributions these include Brout, Englert, Guralnik, Hagen, Higgs and Kibble
who all worked on this problem in the 60s we now refer to the result of their work as the Higgs
mechanism so the Higgs mechanism turns out to be a way to give mass to ordinary force carriers
so now let me try to explain the Higgs mechanism and again rather than to bore you with equations
we're going to do this with pictures the Higgs mechanism works as follows it says that in nature
you have to have a particle the so-called goldstone particle whose energy takes the form of what we
call the Mexican hats so here we have a picture of that if you look at the image you'll notice
there's a ball on the top of this hill and this ball represents the Higgs and more importantly
goldstone bosons so it's a spin zero particle in nature whose energy has the shape of this
object we call the Mexican hat below this object you will notice that there are three other dots
these other dots represent ordinary force carriers like the intermediate vector bosons
now the Higgs mechanism says the following that when the equations describe this situation
that we see at the beginning where the Higgs boson and the goldstone field are at the top of
this energy potential the ordinary force carriers are massless so the intermediate vector boson
has no mass the charged one the neutral one nor the negatively charged one however as the Higgs
and goldstone bosons together roll down this potential you'll notice at the bottom of my diagram
that the objects are growing more massive and in fact this is the great discovery that now bears
the name of the glacial Weinberg salon mechanism they wrote the equations which prove that this
picture that we have applies to the force carriers in our world you'll notice in our picture one of
our balls didn't grow any mass the reason is actually quite important the one that doesn't get
mass is the photon so we can write equations where the intermediate vector bosons and the photon
initially were all massless but as the Higgs field rolls down the bottom of its potential
and the goldstone field in particular rolls down to the bottom of its potential we get mass
and you might wonder how does this work well again I can't show you the mathematics but I can give
you a sense of what goes on you see when the goldstone field gets to the bottom of that potential
it kind of leaves an energy field all throughout space and time which kind of acts like syrup
and therefore we get the following picture so these disc that you see here represent the remaining
energy from the Higgs field pervading all of space and now as an ordinary particle that would be
massless moves through these planes this energy field of Higgs field you'll notice it is growing mass
we think that this is the mechanism by which all mass occurs in our universe in fact
Nobel laureate Leon Letterman has written a book called The God Particle and it's about the Higgs
boson and its role in providing mass in the universe so that's how we give mass to force
carriers but remember the problem that we're actually after is not just giving mass to the
force carriers we want to give mass to the super partners so we have to worry about how to do that
well we have to go back a bit now because just remember I said that if supersymmetry is true
then the force carrier for gravity must have a super partner we've actually identified this
super partner as an object that spins at a rate of three halves so we can we know how to write
these equations and when you write such equations what you find is that this spin three has object
also is a massless object well since it is a message carrier for gravity gravity couples to
everything so gravity couples to ordinary matter gravity must couple to super matter that means in
particular that the super partner of gravity must couple to ordinary matter as well the super
partner to gravity must couple to super matter so both of them that's what supersymmetry means
right it means balance they both have to appear in a balanced manner so these equations are pretty
simple to write out at some level and one can do so and now what we want to do is to use a trick
a moment ago I described the process by which the weak intermediate boson that's neutral
the charged intermediate boson with a positive charge and the negatively charged intermediate
boson all grow mass through the Higgs mechanism when you grow mass through the Higgs mechanism
some interesting things go on and one of these things that goes on is that the kinds of angles
that are associated with change of a force carrying particle also more or less disappear
so symmetries disappear so when these angles go away it means certain balances are lost or at
least apparently lost we call this entire process spontaneous symmetry breaking what
we now want to do as a strategy and this is what was done excuse me in these early papers in the
1980s was to write a model where initially everything is massless but you want to include
the effects of gravity as well as its super partner the next step is you want to repeat for the
supersymmetry exactly the process that was carried out to give mass to the ordinary force carriers
in other words you want to find a supersymmetric version of the spontaneous symmetry breaking
mechanism in the early 1980s two groups of physicists independently figured out how to
write such equations so you write these equations and then you ask a very simple question what is
their implication and it goes as follows remember in the ordinary Higgs mechanism there was a particle
that we refer to as a goldstone boson that sits at the top of an energy hill and then as it goes
down the hill other particles gain mass because it leaves behind a field that pervades all of space
that was those disk we saw we want to repeat that now but in the context of supersymmetry
well how does that work well supersymmetry always means balance so if there's a goldstone
particle that sits at the top of an energy potential by symmetry you expect to find a super
partner that sits at the top of a super potential if the ordinary particle that sat at the top of
the potential was spin zero its super partner that would sit at the top of a potential would have
spin one half because we always differ in super partners by one half a unit of spin now this
supersymmetric partner sitting at the top of the potential is named the gold steen oh so it's
related to the goldstone field which was the boson that introduced mass and now remember
we're all talking about mathematics here so you write the equations that describe the words that I
have given and then you look at the equations and solve for their implications let's look at a picture
to see what happens so here's a picture we see at the bottom of the picture we have both ordinary
matter as well as super matter at the top of this picture we have the gold steen oh not the
goldstone boson and now as the gold steen oh rolls down this so-called mexican hat potential
you will notice
that our ordinary particles which we had illustrated as small balls along the bottom
of the diagram have grown mass now the thing that's really interesting about the pattern
of the growth of mass is the large balls that you see in those pictures are all super partners
so they are squarks they are electrons they're hyxenos there's votinos and they're the gluinos
in other words they are the super partners to our ordinary matter the smaller balls that you see
in this diagram representing the results of an equation the smaller balls are in fact
ordinary matter they're electrons they're muons they're tau particles and they're affiliated
neutrinos and they're the quarks as well as the ordinary force carriers so it turns out
that almost by magic by simply writing the equations where gravity has a super partner
called the gravatino and then uh repeating exactly the process that gives mass to the
force carriers of our world by introducing a gold steen oh all of the super partners in a
very natural manner without sort of excessive manipulation of the equations can be shown
to grow masses this was the great discovery that excited the particle physics community
in the early 80s that there was a mechanism that we now call the spontaneous
breaking of supersymmetry which we've seen illustrated in this diagram whereby the implementation
of this mechanism has the implication that super matter is always much much heavier than ordinary
matter now this actually solves another problem because as super matter gets heavier the super
partner to the graviton grows mass and of course that's exactly what we need in our universe because
you see in our universe as far as we can tell from our experiments there is one massless particle
that's associated with communicating gravitational forces so if the supersymmetric
Higgs mechanism had not worked then in addition to the graviton transmitting gravitational forces
back and forth there would have been a second object the gravatino would have been responsible
also for communicating gravitational forces but this since gravitational forces are long range
those tend to be forces that one can very easily detect not by necessarily writing down equations
for the quantum world but instead by looking up at the galaxies looking at the solar system
looking at the structure of the universe on the large because remember although gravity is the
weakest force it controls the large-scale structure of the universe so if the super partner to the
graviton had not grown mass we would have very easily been able to detect that by the structure
of the universe itself we wouldn't need particle accelerators and so we have a coherent picture
here a picture that most of the physics community finds compelling but it is of course still one
which needs experimental verification but as you can see things that look like they might be
problems have almost virtually disappeared from this model we understand why we've never seen
super partners because they're so massive why they're so massive because the ghostino which
is the super part into the graviton is a naturally very massive object and when it disappears from
the theory it leaves behind an energy field that gives mass to everything that we don't see in the
laboratory how much mass now that's the real question and to that we don't know the answer
in my previous lecture I talked about the fact that in order for this balanced supersymmetric
view of the universe to be consistent with experiment all the super partners have to be
more massive I even put some limits on how much more massive we think that there's somewhere
between 300 and 1000 times as heavy as ordinary matter if there any heavier than that
other theoretical difficulties appear so we think that certainly within 300 years or so
assuming continued human progress we would actually expect to produce a super partner
again in a previous lecture however I've talked about the fact that our first detection will likely
occur by looking at running coupling constants but the thing which is perhaps most surprising
about what I've just described at least by those of us who study the mathematics is as I said earlier
with almost no manipulation of the equations we arrive at a picture of the universe that is
consistent with supersymmetry it's got the super partners but they're so massive that they have
avoided our present-day technology for many physicists this is extremely satisfying
is it physics I don't know if we detect super partners we haven't detected strings
but it's an enormous boost for string theory
