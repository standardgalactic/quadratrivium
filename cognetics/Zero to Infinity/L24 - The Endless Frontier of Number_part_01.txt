Even though the abstract notion of number came from our imagination, once born numbers conform to the laws of nature and mathematics.
What's surprising and intriguing plot twists lie ahead in the story of number?
That enticing, unending journey will fuel the creativity and imagination of our descendants for the next thousand years.
Well, before moving on, I wanted to say a word about the structure of our journey.
Perhaps there's still a question about this course.
Was it a history course or was it a math course?
Well, of course, this was the story of number and so plainly we frolicked among the delights of mathematics.
So then why the history?
Well, the history is the only means by which we can intuit the critical human element that gave rise to the ever-evolving notion of number.
If we were just handed a laundry list of numbers, here's the rational numbers, here are the natural numbers, here are the irrationals, the reals, the complexes, the algebraics, the transcendentals, the pediatrics, and so forth.
Well, then our view of numbers would be as a jumbled collection of abstract definitions that would have no real meaning and would not tell any story.
The story of number is really the story of humankind's ever-evolving imagination, creativity, understanding, and curiosity.
It's the history that breathes life into our story of number.
So was this a history or a math course?
Honestly, I don't know.
And I'm not really sure that we need to have our efforts here dropped into any particular pigeonhole.
My hope is that we feel the synergy between the two.
The history inspired the mathematics and the mathematics amplified the history.
It really was an incredible story.
Over 30,000 years ago, long before there was a notion of number, Sumerian shepherds didn't want to lose track of their flocks.
So they used pebbles to create a one-to-one pairing between the stones and the sheep.
