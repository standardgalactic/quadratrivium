end up with the quantity 1 plus 1 over n all raised to the n power.
That's how much dollars we would have, that's how many dollars we would have at the end
of the year.
So once we know how many times we compound, we could actually plug into this formula and
it would tell us how much money we'd have at the end of the year.
For example, let's take a look at some examples to illustrate the point.
If n equals 1, so there's compounding just once, which is at the end of the year, then
this formula gives 1 plus 1 over 1 to the first power.
Now raising a number to the first power is just the same thing as having the number itself,
so we don't have to do anything with that exponent of 1.
And we just see 1 plus 1 over 1, 1 over 1 is 1, so 1 plus 1, 2.
And of course, that was the answer we arrived at earlier.
If n were 2, which means that we actually have compounding twice, one at six months
and then one at the end of the year, then we'd actually see we'd have the formula gives
1 over 1 plus 1 half all squared, which equals 3 halves squared, which equals 9 fourths.
And 9 fourths is 2.25, which again we saw for ourselves earlier.
If n equals 4, so we have compounding quarterly, then we look at 1 plus 1 quarter raised to
the fourth power, which works out to be 2.4414 and so forth.
And if we have compounding daily, then n would equal 365, and we'd see the formula giving
1 plus 1 over 365 all raised to the 365th power, which works out to 2.71456 and so forth,
and that's how we actually computed those values.
Now if we compound every second of the year, every second, then n would equal 31,536,000.
And we'd have, for the amount of money that we'd have at the end of the year, 1 plus 1
over 31,536,000 all raised to the 31,536,000 power, which equals 2.7182817 and so forth.
You could see that we're actually heading toward our number.
So we now see that Bernoulli's, as Bernoulli saw, namely that as n gets larger and larger
and actually approaching infinity, the corresponding value of 1 plus 1 over n, all raised to the
n power, is approaching this number E. Well, another important definition of E arises out
of the ideas of calculus.
The number E can be expressed as an infinitely long sum of ever shrinking fractions.
So we can actually write E as 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 2 times 1 plus 1 over 3 times
2 times 1 plus 1 over 4 times 3 times 2 times 1, and this pattern continues.
Now the product of all the natural numbers from 1 up to any natural number n is called
n factorial, and it's denoted by the letter n followed by an exclamation mark.
So for example, 5 factorial would be the number 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1, which in
that case would equal 120.
So given this shorthand, we could actually write the previous sum or speak the previous
