mountain and earth and so the seven elements were represented here in binary which is a wonderful
illustration of the power of just the zero and one one of the most famous icons consisting of two
elements is the yin yang symbol and in fact the yin yang symbol corresponds to the solid and broken
lines of the each thing the solid line represents yang which stands for creativity and the broken
line represents yin which stands for openness as in open-mindedness of course the in the previous
lecture we also saw reflections of the binary system in the Egyptian multiplication technique
that we saw known as doubling we have doubling each time that was a binary type of operation
in India in the 4th century BCE poet and musician Pingala used a binary system to
notate musical meters now the modern binary system using zeros and ones was established by the great
German mathematician a Gottfried Leibniz in 1660s in the 1660s a hundred years later the French
mathematician and astronomer Pierre Simone Laplace who revolutionized mathematical physics wrote
about Leibniz and Leibniz's interpretation for giving great grandeur to the binary system in
fact Leibniz really gave a religious significance to the zeros and ones which Laplace didn't
appreciate as we'll hear in this quote he writes Leibniz saw in his binary arithmetic the
image of creation he imagined that unity represented God and zero the void that the
supreme being drew all beings from the void just as unity and zero express all numbers in
his system of numeration I mentioned this merely to show how the prejudices of childhood make
cloud the vision even of the greatest men so you can see he wasn't really accepting of this
religious overlay but definitely acknowledged that this was a great man who made great
contributions now neither Leibniz nor Laplace could have ever anticipated the dominant role
that binary numbers would play in the computer age which is built on bits and bits actually the
word bits come from binary digits we slam those two together we get bits so the binary digits of
zero and one gave rights to the bits that we see in our computer in fact that is why when we see
computers and we see bits we know that that's the zero and one at work well in fact the first
computer using binary addition was built by mathematician George Stipnitz who was a scientist
at Bell Labs and he did this in 1937 and he built this in his kitchen and unless he he named it
the model K which is sort of a cute way of remembering that he built this binary machine in
his kitchen in this country the base three ternary system becomes extremely popular during the
days of summer for the ternary system is used in baseball for giving innings pitched for example
in this context if we see a 4.1 that means four and one-third innings pitched notice the one-third
that's in fact ternary we note that not all number systems today actually use a positional
system that we're describing ironically in describing our physical position we don't actually
