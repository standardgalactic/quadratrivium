And the snake you can see in a finite number of steps will eventually pass through that and it will be associated with some natural number.
So we have this one-to-one correspondence.
Now, what about the negatives?
Well, we now take our positive fractions and we just shift them over so that they're paired up with the even numbers.
In other words, let's slide the rational numbers down so that they're just paired up with every other natural number.
And so now the odd numbers, the odd natural numbers, have no partners.
And in this pairing, what we could do is just plug in the negative of every fraction next to its neighbor.
So we just sort of fill in the other half with the negatives.
And so we actually see a one-to-one correspondence in this way.
So again, if you try to find a formula for this, it's very, very tricky.
But we could visualize it very easily by snaking through and determining that, in fact, we have a one-to-one pairing.
Every natural number is paired with a particular rational number.
And conversely, every ratio is paired with a natural number.
So the size is the same.
These two collections have the same size.
In some informal sense, infinity multiplied by infinity still yields the same size of infinity.
We haven't upped anything.
Well, as we'll see in the next few lectures, infinity holds many more profound surprises.
As the great early 20th century mathematician David Hilbert once wrote,
No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man.
No other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect.
Yet no other concept stands in greater need of clarification than that of the infinite.
That clarification and that wonderful journey to infinity will be the provocative conclusion to this challenging topic.
