four times one hundredth in some countries the separator is actually a comma so for example
seven comma zero five would actually mean seven in the unit spot plus zero in the ten
spot spot plus five in the hundreds spot and so I see seven times ten to the zero plus
zero times one over ten plus five times one over ten squared now of course there's nothing
special about the power ten the important feature in a base ten is that we require ten
digits however by analogy we could consider writing in other bases besides ten in some sense the
simplest system is is base two and the base two or or what it's referred to as the binary the
binary system requires only two digits it's base two so we only need two digits and those
digits will be zero and one now in this system the positions represent powers of two rather than
powers of ten so if we just argue by analogy and think formally then we'll we'll see exactly what
this means so we have to forego the the base ten that we grew up with and now we're gonna think of
something new so every spot well we'll start with the unit spot but then one over from that will
not be the tens it will now be the two spot and next to that we'll have the the four spot which is
two squared and next to that we'll have the eight spot and so forth so for example the number one
zero one one in base two now notice by the way the the little subscript two that we see there
actually tells us that this is a number that's denoted in base two so we don't read it as
one thousand eleven as if it were read in base ten but this is a special number that little teeny
two tells us no no no there's only two digits in the world zero and one and we're writing this in
base two so positions are powers of two if we look to the far right we see there's a one there
that's the unit spot and so we see two times one times two to the zero power and then right next
to that we see another one to the left and that's sitting in the two spots so we have one two then
we add to that zero in the four spot that's two times two so we have no fours and then that that
final one way off on the left what spot is that in well it's in the eight spot which is the two
cubed and so we see this is actually one times a two cubed plus zero times two squared plus one
times two to the first plus one which equals eight plus two plus one which is the number eleven in
base ten so notice how how in this system eleven which is easy to write in base ten requires a long
string in base two and that and that actually happens that the the smaller the base the more we
have to write in order to capture a number now fractional positions are analogous to those in
base ten except now instead of having a tenth and a hundredth and a thousandth we have a half a
fourth and an eighth again powers of two in the denominator so for example if we take a look at
the the the decimal the a binary number one zero one point one one and this again is expressed in
base two well what do we see well let's do the whole number part first I see a one immediately to
