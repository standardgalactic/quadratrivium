Well, it turns out that we could actually produce a random number, a random real number,
by generating its digits by pure chance.
And what we could do, actually, is imagine rolling a 10-sided die, because if we were
to roll a 10-sided die, which would have all the digits from 0 all the way out to 9, then
in fact, if the die was just as equally likely to come up one side than the other, then in
fact, we would see we'd be generating random digits and putting it together, stringing
it together, we would have a random number.
Well, in fact, we can try this.
Now, in terms of rationality and irrationality, all that matters are the digits to the right
of the decimal point.
So for our example, let's just suppose we start with 0 point, and then we'll roll and
see what the random is.
Now, in fact, you can actually get these dice.
Here's a die, and you can actually see the digits.
Here we see 0, 8, 2, 6, 4, and if you turn it around, you actually see 1, 7, 3, 5, 6,
5, 9.
So all 10 digits are represented here, and we could now generate a genuine random real
number by rolling the die to determine the digits.
And I'll do this right now, and I'll record the results.
So let's see what number we get.
This is going to be an actual random number.
We start with an 8.
Roll again.
A 7.
Roll again.
A 0.
Roll again.
Oops.
Luckily, I have a spare.
Roll again.
A 3.
Roll again.
A 4.
Roll again.
A 9.
Roll again.
A 0.
And we can keep doing this, but let's stop, because let me ask a question now.
So we have, so far, in our random number, 0.8703490.
Now the question is, is it possible that this now will repeat?
For example, let's just take the last three digits, the 490, and ask, is it possible that
when I roll this again and again and again, this fair 10-sided die, that I'll see a 4,
