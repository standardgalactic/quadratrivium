Natural numbers raised to fractional powers are numbers.
Well, all was well with number until Orzmi declared and dared to wonder something totally bizarre.
What does it mean to raise a number to an irrational exponent?
For example, what does 2 raised to the square root of 2 mean? And is that thing a number?
The answer is, as we're about to see, yes, that thing does have meaning and it is a number.
But how can we see what it means?
Since it's way too complicated of an object, we immediately retreat and we try to inch up to it by constructing objects that we already understand.
So, this is an exciting moment since we're about to discover a new type of number.
Now, how can we inch up to 2 raised to the power square root of 2 power?
Well, in lecture 10 we showed that rational numbers, the fractions, are dense in the number line.
In other words, we can find fractions as close as we wish to any real number at all.
For example, we can approach the square root of 2, who has a decimal expansion of 1.414213 and so forth, using fractions.
1.4, which is 14 over 10, or 1.41, which is 141 over 100, or 1.414, which is 1,414 over 1,000, and so forth.
In fact, we foreshadowed this idea in lecture 6 when we saw that the ratios of Fibonacci numbers approach the golden ratio.
Well, we'll now use these fractions that approach the square root of 2 to approach the value 2 raised to the square root of 2 power
by computing 2 to the a over b, in which a over b is a fraction near the square root of 2.
In this case, we first consider 2 raised to the power 1.4, that equals 2 raised to the 14 over 10, which equals 2 raised to the power 7 fifths,
which we just found to be 2.63901 and so forth.
If we were to calculate 2 to the power a over b for each a over b approximating the square root of 2,
then we could produce a list of numbers by just taking the bth root of 2 and then multiplying and then raising it to the eighth power.
So for example, we'd see 2 raised to the 1.4 power is 2.639 and so forth.
If we look at 2 raised to the 1.41 power, we'd see 2.6573 and so forth.
And then we can go down the list and go 2 to the 1.41421356, which turns out to be 2.6651441, and look what's happening.
