We can discard the kid gloves of reality's restrictions and let our minds play where they will.
The theory of numbers is about what can be thought, what can be imagined, and what can be dreamed.
And it all leads to new truths.
Exploring the deep consequences of simple ideas takes us on a journey of startling sights and unexpected insights.
We compare flocks of sheep and numbers are born.
We keep track of inventories by pressing pebbles into clay and a symbolic language of numbers graces the page.
We look upon the spirals of nature and we see Fibonacci numbers.
We search for the atoms of the numbers and we uncover an infinitude of primes.
We measure a diagonal and we discover irrational numbers.
We look beyond the square root of two and we find the transcendental values pi and e.
We transcend the real line in the complex plane and we find ourselves suspended in a vexing world of the peatic numbers.
We look beyond all numbers and we travel to the universe of infinitely many infinities.
The history of numbers paints a story about casting off the constricting coil of bound thought.
The ever-evolving world of numbers is full of wonder, but our guide is the clear principle of following creative ideas to their logical conclusions.
We can all embrace this strategy of mathematical thinking to guide us in our everyday lives as well.
We've seen here just a glimpse of the vast richness that our minds can create.
Numbers in our imaginations have no bounds, no ends, no finish line.
Every horizon reached opens new horizons more glorious still.
Thank you very much.
