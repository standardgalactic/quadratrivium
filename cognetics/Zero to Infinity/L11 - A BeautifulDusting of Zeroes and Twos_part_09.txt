We've paired up every number from zero to one.
Why?
Suppose we consider a number between zero and one.
We first just write it in its base two expansion.
For example, let's say zero point zero one zero one one zero one zero zero zero one
zero and so forth, base two.
To find its partner in this pairing scheme, all we just do is take every appearance of
a one and just replace it by a two and take this new list of digits and view it as a base
three number.
In this case, we'd see the number zero point zero two zero two two zero two zero zero
zero and so forth, two zero and so on.
Base three.
Well since this new number consists of only zeros and two in its base three expansion,
it's in the Cantor set.
So every number has one and only one partner.
Amazing.
Well, this matchmaking method is the one to one correspondence between the Cantor set
and the entire collection of numbers between zero and one that Cantor claimed existed.
Absolutely tremendous.
Well the Cantor set is a very counterintuitive collection of numbers.
In fact, it's quite often used as a counter example to very seemingly reasonable conjectures.
This collection of numbers isn't once sparse and thin and yet full and as we'll see at
the end of the course, fat.
Cantor was an extraordinarily original and creative thinker who allowed his mind to wander
and through that journey made discoveries that at first appeared unbelievable.
Unfortunately, as we'll see in the last part of this course, Cantor also had to contend
with personal demons that haunted him most of his life.
Today, he would most likely have been diagnosed as bipolar, manic depressive and sadly he
spent a good portion of the later years in in asylums.
In the last part of our course, we'll explore this tragic drama, his struggle with relationships
including some ugly mathematical feuds and of course his imaginative and profound insights
into infinity which continue to be the foundations for how we view the infinite.
