In this lecture, we'll celebrate the dramatic impact the digits had on our understanding
of number.
Have you ever tried to multiply using Roman numerals?
How would you write the number 10,030 without using zero?
A compact place-based or positional number system with a symbol for zero opens the floodgates
for arithmetic calculations and the discovery of new numbers.
With only 10 symbols, we have the machinery to describe new numbers that grow beyond our
imagination.
Here we'll explore the origins of zero and the development of our modern decimal system.
With a powerful positional number system in place, humankind was finally equipped with
the tools necessary to begin the development of modern mathematics.
Along with the commonly used decimal system, we'll consider the binary number system,
a system that has roots in ancient China and India.
Binary numbers are the basis for modern computers.
Who would have imagined that the basic structure utilized by today's computers is the basis
for the same structure used in the ancient Yi Cheng?
We close our discussion by contemplating other base systems, including the base 60 system
employed by the Babylonians and the base 3 system known as the ternary number system.
Well, I want to begin with the downside of the ancient additive systems.
Well, most of the systems that we've studied in the previous lecture required the repetition
of symbols.
For example, the Roman numerals XXIII equals 23, and we'd add up the two X's, 10 each,
and then the three I's, and get 23.
In fact, also recall the dovetails and nails that the Babylonians used, we'd add them
up.
Now, although computation with the additive systems was fast using tools such as the abacus,
those systems required a very long list of symbols to denote larger and larger numbers,
and this was a problem in practice.
Additive systems made it difficult to look at more arithmetically complicated questions,
and thus slowed the progress of the study of numbers.
In order to move to what we call a positional system, we need a new number, and this inspires
a philosophical question.
So the question is, how many items do you see are in this box?
Well, is your answer a number?
This is the question, right?
This is the question about zero.
Now in the Rhined Papyrus from 1650 BCE, the scribe Ames referred to numbers as heaps.
This tradition actually continued through the Pythagoreans, who in the 6th century BCE
viewed numbers as a combination or heaping of units.
Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans will be highlighted in the next lecture, and their view of number
will be explored further in lecture 8.
Here even Aristotle defined number as an accumulation or heap.
Again we see the word heap.
Also recall from the last lecture, the word three, derived from the Anglo-Saxon word a
throp, again meaning pile or heap.
Well, okay, so because we can't have a heap of zero objects, right?
Zero objects, there would be no heaping at all, zero was not viewed as a number.
So this notion of having zero be a quantity didn't make any sense at all because we were
thinking in terms of heaps.
Okay, well the lack of zero caused many challenges.
Now as we saw in the previous lecture, a careless Sumerian scribe could cause ambiguities since
in cuneiform different spacing between symbols can actually represent different numbers.
The Egyptian system, on the other hand, did not require a place holder like zero, but
their additive notation was cumbersome.
Again, they had all the symbols together and we had to add them all up.
As a result, in the 2,000 years of the Egyptian numeral system, they made very little progress
in arithmetic or more generally in mathematics.
Meaning to see how the notation really drives our understanding and our intuition and our
further quest to consider number.
Well, zero first appeared as an empty place holder rather than a number.
As we noted in the previous lecture, the Babylonians had a symbol for zero by 300 BCE.
And it was a place holder rather than a number because, again, they were thinking heapings
but they needed to distinguish between numbers.
For example, if we just see these two nails spaced apart like this, then we would understand
that that leftmost nail, now remember the Babylonians used this peculiar base 60 system.
So instead of being in the 10 spot like we would think today, that's actually located
in the 60s spot.
So that one nail is 60 and then the other nail produces the one and so we see 61.
That is now different from this number where we actually see the symbol and icon for zero
in between which means that we have no 60s but we have that nail located in the 3,600
spot.
So we see 3,601 nail or 3,601 and so you can see the power of this symbol to represent
a place holder.
Now the Mayans also had a symbol for zero that they also used only as a place holder
and here you see this eye shaped symbol.
Now the evolution of the symbol for zero is actually very difficult to chart.
As we remarked in the previous lecture, the modern symbol zero may have arisen from the
use of those sand tables for calculations.
Remember that we had this sand table that were used to calculate things where pebbles
would be placed in and moved back and forth for addition or subtraction and what we'd
see is when a pebble would be removed, we would have an indentation or a dimple in
the sand which reflects a zero that we used to see, that we see today.
In fact calculations performed on the sand tables may have actually led to the development
of the placed based number systems that we're about to describe and consider.
Remember in the second century CE, Ptolemy used the Greek letter omicron which looks
like an O in fact to denote nothing.
Now so this is the symbol for zero, the O that we see the circle but I want to make
it very clear that Ptolemy did not view this as a number but merely as the idea of nothing
but you can see again these things are coming together, they're slowly moving together.
Well zero as a number really occurred in India most likely and by the 7th century the
Indian astronomer Brahmagupta who as we saw in the previous lecture offered a treatment
of negative numbers actually understood zero as a number not just as a placeholder.
In fact he actually studied zero divided by zero and one divided by zero and actually
decided erroneously that zero divided by zero equals zero but he actually just didn't
know what to conclude about one divided by zero.
Well here again we see a couple things, first of all we know today that we can't divide
by zero, if we divide by zero in fact it does not yield a number so we leave the realm of
numbers so we can't do that, no dividing by zero, we've learned that in school but we
also see a wonderful thing, here Brahmagupta this very important great mind always making
a mistake again something that is to be celebrated rather than to feel embarrassed about he didn't
get it quite right that's okay his contributions were enormous.
So finally we see that humankind expanded its view of number to actually include and
embrace zero.
Well given the relatively late inclusion of zero in our world of numbers a more chronologically
accurate name for this course would actually be one, two, many, zero to infinity.
I mean that is really how the notions developed together.
Now let me say a few words about this nothing number in terms of language.
In the from the sixth to the eighth century Sanskrit we actually see sunya which meant
empty to represent zero as we think of it by the ninth century in Arabic we have cipher
by the 13th century Latin we have Zephyrium 14th century Italian we have Zephyro and
by 15th century English we have zero and so we can see the evolution of just that word.
Now because of zero's power in computation some viewed it as mysterious and nearly magical
and as a result the word zero has the same origins as another word that means a hidden
or mysterious code and that word of course is cipher and so we can see that cipher actually
came from the mysterious qualities that that zero possessed to our ancestors.
Now so with zero firmly planted in our hearts and minds as an actual number we're ready
for at long last the positional number systems and let's start with the familiar base ten
a numeral systems that we use in our everyday lives.
Now as we previously mentioned in the other lecture the base ten or decimal system uses
the ten Hindu Arabic numerals zero one two three four five six seven eight and nine and
these are called digits.
Now the word digit actually comes from the Latin digitus which means finger again quite
a nice image because remember this is early counting with our fingers coincidentally Baskara
the first the great seventh century Indian mathematician is credited as the first person
to write these numerals including a circle for zero so wonderful contribution there.
Now the position of a digit in our system indicates by which power of ten that digit
is to be multiplied by so either one the unit spot or the ten spot or the hundred spot or
the thousand spot and as we move further and further to the left that we multiply by bigger
and bigger a powers of ten.
Now we'll actually employ exponential notation to denote powers of ten so instead of writing
ten times ten we'll write just ten squared instead of writing ten times ten times ten
we'll write ten cubed and so forth.
Now we'll declare as a convention that ten to the zero power will represent the unit's
place or one so ten to the zero will be a very fancy way of saying one.
Now as an aside I want to remark that this notation was actually invented by Rene Descartes
in the 17th century and we'll explore the evolution of other arithmetical symbols in
lecture 12.
Well okay so let's take a look at an actual example.
If we take a look at what we'd write as 293 I'm not going to actually say 293 and give
it away let's just analyze what that means.
I first start off in the far right and notice the three that three is in the unit spot so
that's three times one or three times ten to the zero and then I add to it I move over
to the next position which is the ten spot.
It tells me what digit I'm to multiply by ten in this case I see nine so I see nine
times ten to the first or nine times ten and then finally I add the two which is in the
one hundredth spot so I add two times a hundred or two times ten squared and so 293 actually
means two times ten squared plus nine times ten to the first power plus three times ten
to the zero and if we take a look at another example let's take a look at this number here
eight one zero five I don't want to say it out loud because I'll give it away again I
start in the unit spot I see I have five ones so five times ten to the zero I have zero
tens so we skip over the tens that zero times ten to the one I see I have one in the hundredth
spot so I see one times ten squared and now I see an eight in the thousand spot which is
eight times ten cubed and so I see the number is actually eight thousand one hundred and
five is actually eight times ten cubed plus one times ten squared plus zero times ten
plus five times ten to the zero well a specific mark called a radix or decimal point is used
to separate the whole number of positions from the fractional positions in some countries
including the U.S. the mark is a period so for example three point one four would mean
that I have three in the unit spot so that's three times ten to the zero now the one since
it's the right of that radix that's now tenths so one over ten so I see one times one over
ten a fractional part and then that four is located in the one hundredths and so I see
four times one hundredth in some countries the separator is actually a comma so for example
seven comma zero five would actually mean seven in the unit spot plus zero in the ten
spot spot plus five in the hundreds spot and so I see seven times ten to the zero plus
zero times one over ten plus five times one over ten squared now of course there's nothing
special about the power ten the important feature in a base ten is that we require ten
digits however by analogy we could consider writing in other bases besides ten in some sense the
simplest system is is base two and the base two or or what it's referred to as the binary the
binary system requires only two digits it's base two so we only need two digits and those
digits will be zero and one now in this system the positions represent powers of two rather than
powers of ten so if we just argue by analogy and think formally then we'll we'll see exactly what
this means so we have to forego the the base ten that we grew up with and now we're gonna think of
something new so every spot well we'll start with the unit spot but then one over from that will
not be the tens it will now be the two spot and next to that we'll have the the four spot which is
two squared and next to that we'll have the eight spot and so forth so for example the number one
zero one one in base two now notice by the way the the little subscript two that we see there
actually tells us that this is a number that's denoted in base two so we don't read it as
one thousand eleven as if it were read in base ten but this is a special number that little teeny
two tells us no no no there's only two digits in the world zero and one and we're writing this in
base two so positions are powers of two if we look to the far right we see there's a one there
that's the unit spot and so we see two times one times two to the zero power and then right next
to that we see another one to the left and that's sitting in the two spots so we have one two then
we add to that zero in the four spot that's two times two so we have no fours and then that that
final one way off on the left what spot is that in well it's in the eight spot which is the two
cubed and so we see this is actually one times a two cubed plus zero times two squared plus one
times two to the first plus one which equals eight plus two plus one which is the number eleven in
base ten so notice how how in this system eleven which is easy to write in base ten requires a long
string in base two and that and that actually happens that the the smaller the base the more we
have to write in order to capture a number now fractional positions are analogous to those in
base ten except now instead of having a tenth and a hundredth and a thousandth we have a half a
fourth and an eighth again powers of two in the denominator so for example if we take a look at
the the the decimal the a binary number one zero one point one one and this again is expressed in
base two well what do we see well let's do the whole number part first I see a one immediately to
the left of the point the rate x so that's a one in the unit spot I see zero in the two spot and I
see a one in the four spot so I see four plus one so I see five so the whole number part is five
that's the one zero one now what about to the right of the rate x well I see a one in the first
spot which is the one halves right used to be the one tenths but now in base two it's one half spot
and I also see a one in the one fourth spot and so what I see here is one half plus a fourth which
is three fourths and so putting this all together this number is equivalent to five and three fourths
written in base two well we could of course consider another base what would a base three system even
look like well we would again argue by analogy we're finding a pattern we would have exactly three
digits and those digits will call zero one and two and the positional values would be dictated by
powers of three so so this base three system is actually called ternary it's the ternary number
system so for example in base three the number two one zero two in base three and notice that we
have a little a subscript three which indicates that this is base three well we start again at the far
right in the unit spot I see two units that means I have two ones I see zero threes that one is
actually located in the three squared or the nines spot and that two is located in the three
cubes spot or the twenty seventh spot so this number is actually two times twenty seven plus one
times nine plus zero times three plus two times one which equals fifty four plus nine plus two or
sixty five written in a base ten now again fractional positions are once again analogous to those for
base ten so the base three number one two point two zero two let's see if we can figure this out by
looking at the whole number part right to the left of the the dot the the rate x we see a two so
that means we have two units and then that one to the left of that tells me I have a one three so I
have three plus two which gives me five so the whole number part is five now what about the point two
zero two well the two is in the one third spot so I see two thirds I have zero ninths so I have
plus zero ninth and then two twenty sevenths when I add them together I see five and twenty twenty
sevenths so again just arguing formally by analogy we actually see these numbers and translate them
into more familiar numbers that were used to in base ten now are there any other bases left well of
course the answer is yes in fact any counting number any natural number one two three four five well
greater than one so we can't include one so two three four five six seven and so forth can actually
be used as a base and given any such base every number can be expressed in terms of that base so
we can express any number in terms of any base that we wish now we recall that the Babylonians
used base sixty for their number system which means that they have a unit spot than a sixties
than a sixty squared and so forth now some computer languages today use base sixteen which is
sometimes referred to as hexadecimal but of course even even this notion of writing numbers in
positional form is never without a controversy from the 13th century to the 16th centuries
Europeans actually disagreed about the advantages of a positional system versus an additive system
like the Roman numerals for example now an additive system allowed very speedy calculations
using an abacus because you can add really fast and didn't require memorizing multiplication tables
which we now subject children to because we have a positional system even back then the prospects
facing large multiplication tables seem daunting a little bit more seriously some worried about
that the positional system was more vulnerable to fraud as someone could radically change the
value of a number by simply inserting a single zero to the right of the number it would make
it much bigger in fact this possible fraud remains very real and a very real concern today
that's why on the checks we write we express the amount both in numerals and in words that's why
because the positional system really is subject to a potential fraud by just adding a zero at the
end well after much debate and brouhaha the virtues of the positional system were finally
realized and since it's widespread adoption it is proven to be enormously valuable not just in
its efficiency in writing numbers but but as we've seen in as we'll see actually in in lecture
nine in the advancement of the theory of numbers and mathematics in general you know given the
the great value of the positional system it's perhaps not surprising that we find harbingers
in ancient times of modern positional systems as well as holdovers of some very old practices today
in our everyday lives and I want to share a few of those with you right now now in terms of the
binary expansions where we just had zeros and ones the Chinese each thing from 2800 BCE contained
patterns of of solid and broken lines called trigrams and hexagrams that corresponded to binary
numbers but but they were not commonly used for for computation so so for example what we'd see
here is for example here we see a list of of eight numbers and you see eight numbers but eight
these eight symbols these trigrams of these broken and solid lines and in fact if we associate
with each broken line the number zero and each solid line the the digit one then in fact we can
represent these eight symbols as numbers for example those three broken lines if we view them as in
binary would actually be 000 and this is the number of course zero but the next number over
we see a broken line broken line solid line well that's solid line would be in the unit
spot and then those two broken lines represent zero so we'd have the number one and if we move to
the very last number there on the list we see one one one and if we think of that as being a binary
number then I have one in the unit spot I have one two and I have one four and if I add them
together notice I get seven so that last number is seven well each one of these trigrams actually
represented an aspect of nature and so the first one was ether forest fire thunder wind water
mountain and earth and so the seven elements were represented here in binary which is a wonderful
illustration of the power of just the zero and one one of the most famous icons consisting of two
elements is the yin yang symbol and in fact the yin yang symbol corresponds to the solid and broken
lines of the each thing the solid line represents yang which stands for creativity and the broken
line represents yin which stands for openness as in open-mindedness of course the in the previous
lecture we also saw reflections of the binary system in the Egyptian multiplication technique
that we saw known as doubling we have doubling each time that was a binary type of operation
in India in the 4th century BCE poet and musician Pingala used a binary system to
notate musical meters now the modern binary system using zeros and ones was established by the great
German mathematician a Gottfried Leibniz in 1660s in the 1660s a hundred years later the French
mathematician and astronomer Pierre Simone Laplace who revolutionized mathematical physics wrote
about Leibniz and Leibniz's interpretation for giving great grandeur to the binary system in
fact Leibniz really gave a religious significance to the zeros and ones which Laplace didn't
appreciate as we'll hear in this quote he writes Leibniz saw in his binary arithmetic the
image of creation he imagined that unity represented God and zero the void that the
supreme being drew all beings from the void just as unity and zero express all numbers in
his system of numeration I mentioned this merely to show how the prejudices of childhood make
cloud the vision even of the greatest men so you can see he wasn't really accepting of this
religious overlay but definitely acknowledged that this was a great man who made great
contributions now neither Leibniz nor Laplace could have ever anticipated the dominant role
that binary numbers would play in the computer age which is built on bits and bits actually the
word bits come from binary digits we slam those two together we get bits so the binary digits of
zero and one gave rights to the bits that we see in our computer in fact that is why when we see
computers and we see bits we know that that's the zero and one at work well in fact the first
computer using binary addition was built by mathematician George Stipnitz who was a scientist
at Bell Labs and he did this in 1937 and he built this in his kitchen and unless he he named it
the model K which is sort of a cute way of remembering that he built this binary machine in
his kitchen in this country the base three ternary system becomes extremely popular during the
days of summer for the ternary system is used in baseball for giving innings pitched for example
in this context if we see a 4.1 that means four and one-third innings pitched notice the one-third
that's in fact ternary we note that not all number systems today actually use a positional
system that we're describing ironically in describing our physical position we don't actually
use a positional number system we designate location on the earth surface using latitude and
longitude in degrees minutes and seconds complete with separate units and markings and so forth
so for example if you want to locate Williamstown Massachusetts you say 42 degrees 71 minutes 22
seconds north and 73 degrees 20 minutes and 13 seconds west however our division of time shows
the influence of the of the Babylonian base 60 system notice that we we have 60 minutes in an
hour and 60 seconds in a minute again potential reflections from the Babylonians base 60 here's
a fun fact the stock prices traditionally are measured in eighths maybe you've noticed that and
this base may be due to the use of hand signals used in the trading pit it turned out that in
the trading pit you would use your thumbs to indicate whether the price is up or down which
only leaves eight digits left to give the price and so that's why we have things in eighths rather
than in tenths on the on the stock market which is interesting now I just wanted to close with
some final thoughts on the power of this new positional system in fact I want to have reflections
by two great mathematicians the first one being again Pierre Simone Laplace who we just heard
from a moment ago but but here is his take on this positional system it is India that gave us
the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of ten symbols each symbol receiving a
value of position as well as an absolute value a profound and important idea which appears so
simple to us now that we ignore its true merit but it's very simplicity and the great ease with
which it has lent to all our computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions
and we shall appreciate the gland grandeur of this achievement the more when we remember that it
escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius two of the greatest men produced by antiquity and
and Carl Friedrich Gauss the 19th century German mathematician who was in fact so great that
that people today refer to him as the prince of mathematics he wrote in fact he actually was a
great admirer of Archimedes but wrote this about the positional system with respect to Archimedes
how could he have missed the discovery of our present positional system of writing numerals to
what height science would have risen by now if only he had made that discovery and so what we see
here is that both Laplace and Gauss show their great respect for the positional system and also
for Archimedes by the way who was considered to be in fact one of the greatest scientists from
antiquity and yet his contributions really did not move the notion of number forward but the
concept of a positional system allowed us to break the barrier and enter the modern world of numbers
