positional form is never without a controversy from the 13th century to the 16th centuries
Europeans actually disagreed about the advantages of a positional system versus an additive system
like the Roman numerals for example now an additive system allowed very speedy calculations
using an abacus because you can add really fast and didn't require memorizing multiplication tables
which we now subject children to because we have a positional system even back then the prospects
facing large multiplication tables seem daunting a little bit more seriously some worried about
that the positional system was more vulnerable to fraud as someone could radically change the
value of a number by simply inserting a single zero to the right of the number it would make
it much bigger in fact this possible fraud remains very real and a very real concern today
that's why on the checks we write we express the amount both in numerals and in words that's why
because the positional system really is subject to a potential fraud by just adding a zero at the
end well after much debate and brouhaha the virtues of the positional system were finally
realized and since it's widespread adoption it is proven to be enormously valuable not just in
its efficiency in writing numbers but but as we've seen in as we'll see actually in in lecture
nine in the advancement of the theory of numbers and mathematics in general you know given the
the great value of the positional system it's perhaps not surprising that we find harbingers
in ancient times of modern positional systems as well as holdovers of some very old practices today
in our everyday lives and I want to share a few of those with you right now now in terms of the
binary expansions where we just had zeros and ones the Chinese each thing from 2800 BCE contained
patterns of of solid and broken lines called trigrams and hexagrams that corresponded to binary
numbers but but they were not commonly used for for computation so so for example what we'd see
here is for example here we see a list of of eight numbers and you see eight numbers but eight
these eight symbols these trigrams of these broken and solid lines and in fact if we associate
with each broken line the number zero and each solid line the the digit one then in fact we can
represent these eight symbols as numbers for example those three broken lines if we view them as in
binary would actually be 000 and this is the number of course zero but the next number over
we see a broken line broken line solid line well that's solid line would be in the unit
spot and then those two broken lines represent zero so we'd have the number one and if we move to
the very last number there on the list we see one one one and if we think of that as being a binary
number then I have one in the unit spot I have one two and I have one four and if I add them
together notice I get seven so that last number is seven well each one of these trigrams actually
represented an aspect of nature and so the first one was ether forest fire thunder wind water
