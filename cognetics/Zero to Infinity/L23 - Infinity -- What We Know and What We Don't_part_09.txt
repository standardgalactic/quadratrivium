So it took Gerl himself to read through the work, to actually be able to articulate and
say, yes, this is right.
This young guy got it.
Well, of course, once he got Gerl's seal of approval, then everything fell into place,
and people then read it and studied it and did agree that it was indeed correct.
And just a little time later, Paul Cohn was awarded the Fields Medal, which is the equivalent,
the math equivalent of the Nobel Prize in mathematics, and he won this very, very, the
highest honor in mathematics given to a young mathematician, and he won it for his work
on that.
And so then he actually then went and spent a good portion of his remaining years thinking
about trying to conquer the Riemann hypothesis, which we mentioned about primes in a previous
lecture, and that wasn't nearly as successful.
Now I don't know how much of the story is true, but it's a wonderful story, and it does
show us that, in fact, it's important to tackle hard questions and be brave enough to take
things on that seem like greater minds weren't able to solve.
Well, the study of number and the notion of comparing sizes of collection has brought
us to one of the cliffs of mathematics itself.
This is one of the edges of math, for we see a statement that is neither provable or disprovable
within the realm of mathematics.
Now I can't resist closing this chapter on infinity with the very moving words of the
great 18th century English poet, William Blake.
And I wanted to share with you one of his poems that I believe captures the image of
grasping at the incredible ideas that surround the study of the infinite.
And so while we sit back and try to make sense of all this totally counterintuitive ideas
and try to make it intuitively reasonable, while we struggle with that, I want us to
think about the words of William Blake.
To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower, hold infinity in the palm
of your hand and eternity in an hour.
