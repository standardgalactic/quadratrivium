and bigger a powers of ten.
Now we'll actually employ exponential notation to denote powers of ten so instead of writing
ten times ten we'll write just ten squared instead of writing ten times ten times ten
we'll write ten cubed and so forth.
Now we'll declare as a convention that ten to the zero power will represent the unit's
place or one so ten to the zero will be a very fancy way of saying one.
Now as an aside I want to remark that this notation was actually invented by Rene Descartes
in the 17th century and we'll explore the evolution of other arithmetical symbols in
lecture 12.
Well okay so let's take a look at an actual example.
If we take a look at what we'd write as 293 I'm not going to actually say 293 and give
it away let's just analyze what that means.
I first start off in the far right and notice the three that three is in the unit spot so
that's three times one or three times ten to the zero and then I add to it I move over
to the next position which is the ten spot.
It tells me what digit I'm to multiply by ten in this case I see nine so I see nine
times ten to the first or nine times ten and then finally I add the two which is in the
one hundredth spot so I add two times a hundred or two times ten squared and so 293 actually
means two times ten squared plus nine times ten to the first power plus three times ten
to the zero and if we take a look at another example let's take a look at this number here
eight one zero five I don't want to say it out loud because I'll give it away again I
start in the unit spot I see I have five ones so five times ten to the zero I have zero
tens so we skip over the tens that zero times ten to the one I see I have one in the hundredth
spot so I see one times ten squared and now I see an eight in the thousand spot which is
eight times ten cubed and so I see the number is actually eight thousand one hundred and
five is actually eight times ten cubed plus one times ten squared plus zero times ten
plus five times ten to the zero well a specific mark called a radix or decimal point is used
to separate the whole number of positions from the fractional positions in some countries
including the U.S. the mark is a period so for example three point one four would mean
that I have three in the unit spot so that's three times ten to the zero now the one since
it's the right of that radix that's now tenths so one over ten so I see one times one over
ten a fractional part and then that four is located in the one hundredths and so I see
