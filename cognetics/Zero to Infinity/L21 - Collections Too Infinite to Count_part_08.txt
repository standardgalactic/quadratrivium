to see that we can list them all.
So in fact, then their totality would also be countable.
But we've already said the totality, in fact, are the real numbers and they're uncountable.
So that's a contradiction.
Therefore, since the infinity of the rationals is so small and the infinity of the reals is so large,
the infinity of what's left over, which are the irrational numbers, must be large as well.
In particular, they must be uncountable.
Now this discovery amplifies our previous discussions of irrational numbers being the norm.
Remember, again, we see that this recurring theme,
that the at first exotic irrational numbers are actually abundant,
while the more familiar rational numbers are in fact really rare.
In fact, the irrationals totally dominate because they're uncountable.
Well, going a step further, by the modified diagonalization argument,
it's possible to actually establish the fact that the collection of all algebraic numbers,
that means like square root of 2 and the number i, square root of negative 1 and so forth,
they're countable as well.
Thus, since the real numbers are either algebraic or transcendental,
the opposite of being algebraic,
we discover that the collection of transcendental numbers is uncountable.
And it's by the same principle.
We have that the real numbers and uncountable collection are broken up into two pieces,
the algebraics and the transcendentals.
The algebraics are countable.
If the transcendentals were to be countable,
then these two collections together would be countable as well,
but the reals are in fact uncountable.
Therefore, the transcendentals must also be uncountable.
So again, we see the transcendentals are very robust,
whereas the algebraics, square root of 2, which we know very well,
are actually the exotic ones.
Well, let's conclude by returning to Cantor's original collection of numbers
that we've explored in lecture 11,
