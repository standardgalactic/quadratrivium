We see that these values are converging upon a particular decimal number.
The values are looking more and more the same.
Thus, we now define what we mean by 2 raised to the square root of 2 power.
We declare it to be the number we're approaching in this manner.
Specifically, 2 to the square root of 2 power is the real number whose decimal expansion begins 2.66514414 and so forth.
So in this lecture, we not only saw the origins of arithmetic and those cryptic symbols that we've been taught to use,
but we've developed a deeper understanding of what that arithmetic represents and what it actually means.
And we've actually proved some theorems involving the arithmetic.
For example, a negative times a negative being a positive or any number times 0 equals 0.
We see that not only can we make sense of fractions as powers in exponents,
but that by inching up to them, we can actually make sense of irrational powers.
And those strange new objects are indeed themselves numbers in the truest sense.
Thus, we see that arithmetic can be used to enhance our understanding of number
and help us widen our ever-growing notion of what number means.
