The symbol was later made popular by the great 18th century Swiss mathematician, Leonhard
Euler, around 1737.
From its name to its value, we have evidence that the Babylonians approximated pi in base
60 around 1800 BCE.
In fact, they believe that pi equaled 25 over 8, or 3.125, an amazing approximation for
so early in human history.
The ancient Egyptian scribe Ames, who is associated with the famous Ryan Papyrus, offered the
approximation 256 divided by 81, which works out to be 3.16049 and so forth.
Again we see a very impressive approximation to this constant.
There's even an implicit value of pi given in the Bible.
In 1 Kings 723, a round basin is said to have 30 cubic circumference and 10 cubic diameter,
and thus in the Bible implicitly it states that pi equals 3, 30 divided by 10.
Not surprisingly, as humankind's understanding of number evolved, so did its ability to better
understand and thus estimate pi itself.
In the year 263, the Chinese mathematician Laihu believed that pi equaled 3.141014.
Approximately 200 years later, the Indian mathematician and astronomer Arabata approximated pi with
the fraction 62,832 divided by 20,000, which is 3.1416, amazing.
And in 1400, the Persian astronomer, Kasheni, computed pi correctly to 16 digits.
Amazing.
Well, let's break away from this historical hunt for the digits of pi for a moment and
consider pi as an important number in our universe.
Given pi's connection with measuring circumferences of circles, scholars were inspired to use
it as a measure of angle distance.
Now, let's consider a circle having radius 1, remember radius is just the measure from
the center out to the side, it's half the diameter.
The traditional units for measures of angles are of course degrees, and with degrees, one
complete rotation around the circle has a measure of 360 degrees, which by the way happens
to approximately equal the number of days in one complete year, which might explain
why we think of once around as 360.
Well, instead of the arbitrary measure 360 to mean once around the circle, let's figure
out the actual length of traveling around this particular circle, a circle of radius
1, once around.
So what's the length, what's the circumference of that?
Well, let's see, if we have a radius of 1, then our diameter is twice that, 2.
And so we know that the once around will be 2 times pi, because the circumference is
a pi times the diameter.
And so what I see here is once around will be 2 pi.
So one full rotation around, which is an angle of 360 degrees, would be swept out with a
circumference length of 2 pi in this particular circle.
