proof, and complete proofs of these facts allude us, if they're facts, allude us to
this day.
So many, many open questions.
The importance and beauty of e has made it a favorite number in many mathematical circles
and amongst mathematical fans and groupies all over the world.
As a result, we see the digits of e actually appearing in the strangest places.
And so I thought I'd share one with you.
For example, in 2004, Google honored this extremely important constant in an unusual
way in its initial public offering, which was 2,718,281,828, precisely the first 10 digits
of e.
So even Google is gaga over e.
Well, oh, by the way, suppose that you actually want to rattle off the first 11 digits of
e.
It's always fun to be able to have a little trivia fact like that to rattle off at parties
and in meetings.
If you want to actually remember the first 11 digits of e, you just have to remember
the sentence that I'm about to give you.
And again, their famous sentence is like this, and I modified this just for us.
So this is the first time this sentence has ever been uttered.
But if you remember it, you'll always remember the digits of e, at least the first 11.
So here's the sentence to remember.
To express e, remember to memorize a sentence in embedded code.
And notice that if you take the letter count of each word in the sentence to express e,
remember to memorize a sentence in embedded code.
Notice that in the first three words, if you were to count the letters, we'd see two,
a seven, and then a one.
And if you continue, you would see two, seven, one, eight, two, eight, one, eight, two, eight,
four, the first 11 digits of e.
Well, e is indeed a natural constant that's extremely important in our universe.
It's intrinsic in nature and in growth.
Now it's a new number to humanity in terms of our discovery of this amazing constant,
but it's been with us since the very, very beginning of time.
