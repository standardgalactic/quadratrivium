Later, the pebbles were pressed into clay and the abstract writing of numbers began.
After thousands of years of trying to express numbers, humankind finally came upon the now-familiar 10 symbols for our digits
and a place-based system that allowed science and mathematics to race forward at breathtaking speeds.
With the Jains, Pythagoreans, and many others, numbers move from an attribute to an object.
Once those objects are named, they exist in our minds and take on a life of their own.
Numbers have captured the imagination of all people from all cultures throughout human history.
It's one of the few intellectual curiosities that truly unites humankind.
Of course, we've explored various perspectives on numbers.
If we just count, thinking of numbers as Ames did in the Rhine Papyrus as heaps, then we have the natural numbers, one, two, three, four, and so on.
When we consider ratios of these numbers, we see the rational numbers.
When we extend our imagination and our view of number, we can actually embrace negative numbers and even zero.
When we measure lengths, we discover irrational numbers such as the square root of two and pi.
When we measure growth, we find the number E.
When we consider numbers as solutions to certain polynomial equations, we naturally uncover the number I, the square root of negative one,
the complex numbers, and the distinction between algebraic and transcendental numbers.
When we use number to measure distance, our analysis allows us to produce a precise definition of real numbers
and explore parallel universes of numbers known as piatic numbers.
When we invoke the Sumerian Shepherd's idea of a one-to-one correspondence, we unlock the secrets of infinity and build an infinite tower of different infinities.
Well, now we arrive back at the very first challenge I offered all of us in the very first lecture.
What is number?
As we see now, there's no one all-encompassing definition that has any precise meaning.
