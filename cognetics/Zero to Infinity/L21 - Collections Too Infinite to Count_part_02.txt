So we look at the number paired up with the natural number 1, and we see it's 0.8472651 and so forth.
Cantor only cares about the very first digit, which is an 8, and he'll now, in the number that he's constructing,
will just switch it to make sure that the digit that he writes down is different from 8.
So in particular, let's say he writes down a 5.
So he starts his number 0.5.
Okay, now we need the second digit of our allegedly missing number.
Where do we go?
We look at the number paired up with the natural number 2.
It's 0.5000 and so forth.
I look at its second digit, and I see that it's a 0, and I want to write a digit that's not a 0.
So I'll just put down a 5 again.
So now I see my second digit of my number is 5.
And I continue this process to find the third digit of the number we're constructing.
We look at the number associated or paired up with the number 3.
It happens to be 0.3333 and so forth.
I look at its third digit, I see that it's a 3, and so now I'll want to switch it to make sure that our digit doesn't equal 3,
and so I'll make it a 5 again.
So far our number is 0.5555.
What should our next digit be?
Well, I look at the fourth number on our list, which is 4, which is paired up with 0.1075963 and so forth.
I look at the fourth digit of that real number, which notice is a 5.
So I'll write down a digit that differs from 5, and I'll just pick 8.
So now my fourth digit is 8.
For the fifth digit, how do I select that?
I look at the number paired up with the number 5, which happens to be, in this example, 0.0100.
The fifth digit is a 0, and so what do I do?
I'll make sure that our digit is not a 0.
I'll select 5 again, and then I repeat this.
For the sixth digit, I look at the number paired up with 6.
I see 0.2160058.
I see that the sixth digit there is a 5.
I'll switch that and I'll make it an 8, and I do this and continue forever.
