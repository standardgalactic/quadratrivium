plus pi to the fourth over times i to the fourth over four factorial and so forth all
I did there was take the pi i to a power and just split it up into pi to the power i to
the power which is completely legal in the in the world of arithmetic.
Now let's remember something fantastic that powers of i repeat so we have i and then i
squared is negative one i cubed is negative i and i to the fourth gets us to one and then
we repeat i to the fifth gets its i and so forth so we see i as we raise to higher and
higher powers in i we see i negative one negative i one i negative one negative i one and so
forth it repeats its cycles and if we use that fact and then replace all the i's to
powers by what they're equal to we see the following we see that our long expression
becomes e to the pi i equals one plus pi to the first times i all over one factorial minus
pi squared over two factorial because i squared is negative one minus pi cubed i over three
factorial plus pi to the fourth over four factorial and so on again looks pretty complicated
and threatening but watch what happens now notice that every other term in this sum has
an i in it so let's reorganize the sum and write the first terms with no i's at the beginning
so first write the terms with no i's and then write all the terms with one i at the end
and so now if we factor out the common factor of i from all the terms in the second sum
then we see something interesting by the way we could factor out that i just using the
good old distributive law in reverse so it can be done it's not a problem but now look
what we have in the top sum we see only even numbers and the signs alternate plus minus
in the bottom sum we see only odd numbers and again the signs alternate plus minus in
other words forget about all the derivation just look at these things visually and you'll
see that these are precisely the previous formulas that we saw for sine and cosine so the first
sum is the sine and the second sum being multiplied by the i is the cosine well in this case the
a in our formula is pi since we have pi's running around well pulling all these ideas
together we see that e raised to the pi times i power is equal to cosine pi plus i times
sine pi again just using the formula that we derived before well ok the algebra is over
you survived and now it's back to the fun let's now remember what we've learned from
those right triangles and trigonometry we saw for ourselves by swinging that point way
around that cosine pi plus i times sine pi equals negative one we saw that in the complex
plane well this is wonderful because if we pull all these discoveries together we realize
that e raised to the power pi times i equals negative one and maybe you can see it coming
all we have to do is add one to both sides and we come upon beauty e to the power pi
times i plus one equals zero we just arrived for ourselves the most beautiful formula in
all of mathematics and all of nature this is a moment to celebrate so feel free to celebrate
