the left of the point the rate x so that's a one in the unit spot I see zero in the two spot and I
see a one in the four spot so I see four plus one so I see five so the whole number part is five
that's the one zero one now what about to the right of the rate x well I see a one in the first
spot which is the one halves right used to be the one tenths but now in base two it's one half spot
and I also see a one in the one fourth spot and so what I see here is one half plus a fourth which
is three fourths and so putting this all together this number is equivalent to five and three fourths
written in base two well we could of course consider another base what would a base three system even
look like well we would again argue by analogy we're finding a pattern we would have exactly three
digits and those digits will call zero one and two and the positional values would be dictated by
powers of three so so this base three system is actually called ternary it's the ternary number
system so for example in base three the number two one zero two in base three and notice that we
have a little a subscript three which indicates that this is base three well we start again at the far
right in the unit spot I see two units that means I have two ones I see zero threes that one is
actually located in the three squared or the nines spot and that two is located in the three
cubes spot or the twenty seventh spot so this number is actually two times twenty seven plus one
times nine plus zero times three plus two times one which equals fifty four plus nine plus two or
sixty five written in a base ten now again fractional positions are once again analogous to those for
base ten so the base three number one two point two zero two let's see if we can figure this out by
looking at the whole number part right to the left of the the dot the the rate x we see a two so
that means we have two units and then that one to the left of that tells me I have a one three so I
have three plus two which gives me five so the whole number part is five now what about the point two
zero two well the two is in the one third spot so I see two thirds I have zero ninths so I have
plus zero ninth and then two twenty sevenths when I add them together I see five and twenty twenty
sevenths so again just arguing formally by analogy we actually see these numbers and translate them
into more familiar numbers that were used to in base ten now are there any other bases left well of
course the answer is yes in fact any counting number any natural number one two three four five well
greater than one so we can't include one so two three four five six seven and so forth can actually
be used as a base and given any such base every number can be expressed in terms of that base so
we can express any number in terms of any base that we wish now we recall that the Babylonians
used base sixty for their number system which means that they have a unit spot than a sixties
than a sixty squared and so forth now some computer languages today use base sixteen which is
sometimes referred to as hexadecimal but of course even even this notion of writing numbers in
