use a positional number system we designate location on the earth surface using latitude and
longitude in degrees minutes and seconds complete with separate units and markings and so forth
so for example if you want to locate Williamstown Massachusetts you say 42 degrees 71 minutes 22
seconds north and 73 degrees 20 minutes and 13 seconds west however our division of time shows
the influence of the of the Babylonian base 60 system notice that we we have 60 minutes in an
hour and 60 seconds in a minute again potential reflections from the Babylonians base 60 here's
a fun fact the stock prices traditionally are measured in eighths maybe you've noticed that and
this base may be due to the use of hand signals used in the trading pit it turned out that in
the trading pit you would use your thumbs to indicate whether the price is up or down which
only leaves eight digits left to give the price and so that's why we have things in eighths rather
than in tenths on the on the stock market which is interesting now I just wanted to close with
some final thoughts on the power of this new positional system in fact I want to have reflections
by two great mathematicians the first one being again Pierre Simone Laplace who we just heard
from a moment ago but but here is his take on this positional system it is India that gave us
the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of ten symbols each symbol receiving a
value of position as well as an absolute value a profound and important idea which appears so
simple to us now that we ignore its true merit but it's very simplicity and the great ease with
which it has lent to all our computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions
and we shall appreciate the gland grandeur of this achievement the more when we remember that it
escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius two of the greatest men produced by antiquity and
and Carl Friedrich Gauss the 19th century German mathematician who was in fact so great that
that people today refer to him as the prince of mathematics he wrote in fact he actually was a
great admirer of Archimedes but wrote this about the positional system with respect to Archimedes
how could he have missed the discovery of our present positional system of writing numerals to
what height science would have risen by now if only he had made that discovery and so what we see
here is that both Laplace and Gauss show their great respect for the positional system and also
for Archimedes by the way who was considered to be in fact one of the greatest scientists from
antiquity and yet his contributions really did not move the notion of number forward but the
concept of a positional system allowed us to break the barrier and enter the modern world of numbers
