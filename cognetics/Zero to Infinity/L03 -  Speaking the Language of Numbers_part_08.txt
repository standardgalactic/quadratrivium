this technique was called doubling and I want to give you an example. Let's actually multiply
13 by 21 and their method was to continually double the 21. So we start with 1 times 21
which is 21. Then we double. 2 times 21 is 42. Then we double again. 4 times 21 is 84
and then we double yet again and we see 8 times 21 is 168. Now if we were to double
again we'd have 16 times 21 but remember we're trying to multiply 13 by 21 so that would
exceed the value we're looking for. So we stop right here at 8 times 21 and then we
take the number 13 which is the real thing we want to multiply by 21 and we write 13
as the sum of these doubled numbers. So in fact how could we write 13? There's only one
way of writing 13 in terms of 1, 2, 4 and 8 and it turns out it's 8 plus 4 plus 1 that
equals 13. So what's 13 times 21? It's 8 plus 4 plus 1 all times 21 which we see is 168
from our chart plus 84 plus 21 and we see that the product is 273. And their method
really foreshadows the important modern notion of binary expansions that drives our technological
age and actually runs our computers and we'll describe this idea in the next lecture. They
also perform calculations involving fractions but only those with numerators wants, only
1 in the top of the fraction. These are called unit fractions and this convention actually
limited their understanding of more complicated numbers. If we now hop to the Babylonians
we can actually see the occurrence of an early square root. So the Babylonians were computing
square roots as early as 1800 BCE and they were able to actually calculate a very good
approximation to the number, the square root of 2. And in fact if you look at this image
you see a square and notice that we see three dovetails. Those three dovetails if you remember
means we have 30 and so this actually meant the square had size 30 and they need to actually
calculate the square root of 2 and if you notice in the image here we see the numbers
1, 24, 51 and 10 which actually gives the expansion for the square root of 2 but remember
the Babylonians use this funny base 60 expansion and so this would really be read today as
1 plus 24 divided by 60 plus 51 divided by 60 squared plus 10 divided by 60 cubed. And
if you would actually add that up on a calculator you would see a number 1.414213 which notice
actually agrees to the precise value of the number square root of 2 as you can see to
six decimal places which is really an amazing approximation without a calculator. In fact
what is a calculator? The question really is who is a calculator? Because before the
onset of modern calculation devices the word calculator referred to an individual who
would perform calculations. In terms of computing devices many ancient cultures performed calculations
