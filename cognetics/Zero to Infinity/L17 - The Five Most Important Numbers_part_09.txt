take a moment to recall the Gelfand Schneider theorem from lecture 15 it states that if
we have an algebraic number that's not zero or one and we raise it to an irrational algebraic
number then the result of this number raised to that number will be a transcendental number
well let's now show that e to the pi is transcendental indirectly in other words we'll assume that
e to the pi is not transcendental which implies that it's an algebraic number well let's recall
that from lecture 16 we saw that I is in fact an algebraic irrational number remember I is
the solution to the polynomial is one of the solutions to the polynomial x squared plus
one equals zero so it's algebraic and since I is not real it must be irrational well given
our assumption that e to the pi power is algebraic I can take e to the pi power algebraic number
and raise it to the I which is an algebraic irrational number and then by the Gelfand
Schneider theorem I know that this quantity in fact must be a transcendental number well
but e to the pi all raised to the I is actually the same thing as e to the pi times I which
we just saw was negative one and negative one is an algebraic number it's the solution in
fact to x plus one equals zero so it's certainly not transcendental so we just contradicted
the Gelfand Schneider theorem and so what's the problem well our assumption that e to
the pi was an algebraic number must be false that was the only thing we assumed in other
words we just prove that e to the pi is not algebraic therefore it's transcendental now
remember that we've already seen that both pi and e are transcendental numbers however
there's so many simple combinations of involving involving pi and e as we noted in lecture 15
and for most of these combinations we don't know if any of these numbers are irrational
let alone transcendental but here we see a natural combination of pi and e e to the pi
power for which we know the whole story all because of our amazing identity so we see
that this amazingly beautiful formula e raised to the pi I plus pi I plus one equals zero
does have important applications after all in particular it allows us to discover that
the number e to the pi is a transcendental number well thus this this helps us see more
detail into the jungle of numbers but more importantly we can look upon this formula
with great delight and appreciate the beauty and the majesty that is the five most important
numbers the three most important operations all together singing in unison
