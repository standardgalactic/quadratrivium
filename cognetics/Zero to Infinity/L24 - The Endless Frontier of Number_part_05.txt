We noted in an earlier lecture that calculus is the study of motion and change.
Here we use the mechanics of this study to deduce facts about numbers.
For example, one of the jewels of analytic number theory is the prime number theorem.
This result, as we discussed in lecture 7, gives an estimate for how many prime numbers there are up to any given point.
Remember that the primes are the fundamental building blocks or atoms of the natural numbers,
because every natural number greater than one is either a prime or is a product of primes.
The study of how well the estimate in the prime number theorem approximates the number of primes up to any given point
leads to one of the most important unanswered questions in all of mathematics today.
This question has been around since 1859 and is known as the Riemann hypothesis.
The Riemann hypothesis is named after Bernhardt Riemann, an extremely influential German mathematician who first stated the conjecture.
Basically, the heart of the issue is to describe all the solutions to a certain equation.
What makes this question so difficult is that the equation itself has an endless sum of terms,
each term of which has the unknown x appearing.
Well, moreover, there are infinitely many numbers that actually satisfy this equation.
In other words, there are infinitely many solutions to this equation,
so we just can't list them all and be done with it.
The Riemann hypothesis asserts that every one of the numbers that satisfies this special equation exhibits a certain property.
Now, if we could show that the Riemann hypothesis holds,
then we would actually be able to say more about the placement of the primes within the natural numbers.
The surprising fact is that the numbers that are solutions to Riemann's endless equation are in fact complex numbers,
numbers that contain the imaginary number i, which equals the square root of negative 1.
