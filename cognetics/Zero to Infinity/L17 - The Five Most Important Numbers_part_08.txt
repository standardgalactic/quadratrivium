if you want you've earned it well thus we proved that the five most important numbers
come together in one identity involving the three most important arithmetic operations
this identity was first recorded in its modern form by leonard euler in the eighteenth century
although the english mathematician roger coats had proved the result about thirty years earlier
it was also the first to consider exponents with imaginary numbers as we did in this lecture
and this was in seventeen forty but as we remarked in an earlier lecture as late as eighteen
twenty five the great mathematician gauss wrote that the true metaphysics of the square root
of negative one remains elusive so we could see that again trying to wrap our minds around
the imaginary number i takes an awful lot of time today this formula is considered to
be the most beautiful equation in all of mathematics the great twentieth century nobel prize winning
physicist richard feinman once called it the most remarkable formula in mathematics nearly
a hundred years before that the harvard mathematician benjamin pierce after proving this formula
in a lecture just the way we did in fact he said the following after after he gave the
proof to the to the group gentleman that is surely true it is absolute absolutely paradoxical
we cannot understand it and we have not the slightest idea what the equation means but
we have proved it and therefore we know it must be the truth and we may be sure that
it means something very important it is beautiful beautiful quote here where it's certain it's
mathematically correctly proved it but we have no idea what it means who knows however given
that all these wonderful numbers are coming together it's got to mean something important
even though we don't know what it means yet well the truth is that not every formula must
have a profound application in order for us to appreciate it we can appreciate its beauty
just as we depreciate a piece of music or a work of art however in mathematics quite
often what first appears as abstract and devoid of any practical value is later discovered
to be central into or central piece I should say of some important mathematical puzzle so
I thought we would actually close this lecture to see that pierce's intuition was in fact
correct I'm gonna now describe a tremendous number theoretic theoretic consequence of this
beautiful formula that was discovered nearly a hundred years after pierce made his famous remarks
about I'm sure it's important but I don't know how we'll actually use Euler's formula to prove
that e to the pi is a transcendental number which means that not only is e to the pi an irrational
number but we'll actually be able to know that it's not the solution to any polynomial
equation involving integers now the two basic pieces to our argument first is the famous
identity we just proved e to the pi I plus one equals zero although the version we'll
look at is the one we did right before we we actually solved we had e to the pi I equals
negative one and the second important fact will be the Gelfand Schneider theorem so let's
