Maya Angelou, renowned author and past poet laureate of the United States, was raped by
her mother's boyfriend when she was only seven years old.
She told her brother and shortly thereafter, when her attacker got off scot-free, her uncles
most likely killed the man. Seven-year-old traumatized Maya was horrified. She thought her
words, her telling, had killed the man so she decided to never speak again and she didn't speak
for almost five years. She was sent to live with her maternal grandmother and she met a teacher
named Bertha Flowers. Bertha was very patient and as you'll see, a bit of a cognitive behavioral
therapist. She introduced Maya to great literature, Whitman, Poe, Dickens, Langston Hughes and she
found that Maya loved a tale of two cities. She started Maya on what we would call a course of
systematic desensitization to get her to talk again. She asked Maya to take out her book and just
to read the first chapter to herself quietly. Step two was to move her lips while she was reading.
Step three was to quietly whisper the very first word, then the first sentence, then the next sentence,
then the first chapter. You can see step by step by step what was happening is that Maya was
beginning to find her voice. Through the help of her maternal grandmother and through the help of
her teacher, Maya learned that not only can words hurt but words can heal and she used that knowledge
to go on to heal many others by becoming a poet. In today's lecture, we're going to look at the
construct of resilience and the frequent companion of resilience, flexibility. We'll look at what
the literature shows us then see how we might use our CBT tools to promote both flexibility
and resilience. Now, first thing I wanted to share a couple of different definitions of resilience
where the first is resilience defined as when a powerful biologic and or environmental
diathesis or risk factors do not produce the expected negative outcome, high subjective well
being, even in the presence of adversity or another definition resilience defined as the
ability to negotiate significant challenges to development yet consistently snap back in order
to complete the most important developmental tasks that confront people as they grow. So succeeding
may be even thriving in the face of adversity. Now, in a qualitative study done by Gina Higgins
and published in her book, Resilient Adults, she interviewed 40 adults who had been abused as children
but gone on to be successful and to have a self reported high quality of life as adults.
She wanted to deduce from those interviews what were some of the common features that helped those
individuals to be so resilient. She found that these individuals used resilience as a developing
phenomenon over time, a phenomenon propelled by vision and stamina, a belief in control, freedom
and change. There was a focus on strength, ability and proaction. They were able to establish what
she called a place of refuge. She saw that their resilience would wax and wane over time
and she encourages us to don't overlook the phoenix for the ashes. Other quantitative studies of
resilience have found similar features from the environment they found that enriched environments
or finding a supportive adult or a parental surrogate was important or finding some place of
refuge. I have a patient of mine who was able to survive a very abusive childhood because he spent
most of his hours when not in school at the public library. That was his place of refuge
and his surrogates were the librarians. The other category falls in the cognitive or
personality factor category and we know some of those predictors of resilience include having
an optimistic style, having a flexible cognitive style which we'll define in just a moment and
having high affect or emotion regulation skills and having an affectionate or outgoing temperament
which we know is more effective in eliciting social support from other individuals.
Now a primary factor in resilience is having positive relationships either inside or outside
one's family. In fact it's probably probably the single most critical means of handling both
ordinary and extraordinary levels of stress. These positive relationships include traits such as
mutual trust, reciprocal support and caring. There are also a number of CBT skills which
might help an individual develop and sustain a person's resilience. The ability to make
realistic plans and being able to take steps necessary to follow through with them is an
important skill and here you should think of our smart goals and you should think of our
suggestions on how to create an effective action plan. Having a positive self-concept and confidence
in one's strengths and abilities and here we're going to need to dig below those automatic thoughts
and get to those conditional assumptions and even more so we're going to need to get to those core
beliefs about your individual self-worth. We want to work on communication and problem solving skills
as we've talked about in the social support and the couple's conflict lectures and of course the
ability to manage strong impulses. Many individuals with a history of trauma or history of abuse
talk about the intense feelings that they have. We might not be able to change the intensity of
those feelings but we can teach people more effective skills and how to control those feelings
and not act on impulses. Now with Maria we saw a transformation over time, a sort of softening.
She flexed and she was willing to join a support group for caregivers.
She flexed and she was willing to hire more in-home help for her husband to give herself some respite.
Let's look at this example of Maria adapting on the fly when one of her homework exercises in a
social interaction didn't go quite so well. Well I had an opportunity this week to add a little to
my social life. Oh good, good. How did that go? Not very well actually. This lady from our church
called up and said she'd heard my husband had been ill and she had made a pie and wanted to bring
it over. I guess a few weeks ago I just would have told her not to come but I said I was thinking
about our you know our agreement about having more social life so I invited her to come over
and she came and brought her pie and we were having a nice little chat and then
Jack wandered in and he wasn't wearing a lot of clothes sort of in his underwear and no shirt and
and she was she was obviously feeling awkward and didn't know what to say and he called her
Betty which was his sister's name and not her name although we know her fairly well from church
and all and so it was and she left almost right after that so I felt really bad about it and it
didn't quite go the way I was hoping or imagining it might. Sure, sure. Well first let me say
Bravo for reaching out and trying. I know that that wasn't easy to do but I also know that
friendships and relationships are important to you and you're trying to be true to those values
so you invited her over we had an outcome that wasn't what you had wanted and I think that's
oftentimes a signal that it's time to take out the toolbox and to try something cognitive or
behavioral to help you better understand the situation in what maybe to do differently next
time so we have our cognitive toolbox and we have our behavioral toolbox which would you like to
start with let's start with the behavioral one okay so behavioral one so what's in our behavior
toolbox so one is scheduling things like social context you did you did that yeah but maybe I
should have gotten Jack dressed ahead of time okay that would be one thing I could do differently
all right so so a little bit of preparation yeah a little bit of preparation and I think
most people are just feeling awkward about when somebody is really sick I mean like they want you
they want to say the right thing but there's no right thing you could say really I mean how can
you say I hope your husband gets better you know he can't and so you know they just don't know what
to say and I think she felt awkward about that so maybe maybe I just could have said something to her
you know just made her more at ease I guess I was so anxious myself about it it's sort of embarrassed
about Jack you know how that feels when I don't like him to be exposed like that you know to someone's
contempt or pity or whatever so I don't know I guess maybe I could have prepared her a little
more and explained that he had Alzheimer's and so you could prepare Jack and you could prepare her
that's right a little bit I could have done a little more than I did yeah it's just I guess I was
thinking too much about myself and how I was feeling and I could have been thinking more about
what she was feeling and what he was up against and I think you know you you raise an important point
when we think about social supports we think about our relationship supporting us through a stressful
time but sometimes our social supports need direction they need some instructions and it happens
often around illness where people don't know what to say and they don't know what to do and
unfortunately many of them avoid that awkwardness by avoidance so they don't come over they don't
call they could say almost anything just the just the support and comfort would be nice just showing
up yeah just being just showing up that she she thought enough to bring the pie that was nice
come over yeah yeah so what could you say to her to make it less awkward or more comfortable for
both of you what what ideas do you have just explain what the situation is I guess you know ask her
if she would be understanding about it I think that would put her in a better position to to
feel magnanimous about it then yeah yeah absolutely something like that I do have any thoughts about
well you know it it probably depends on the relationship and depends on the person it's
maybe having coffee with her first and saying hey thank you so much for reaching out that means a
lot to me just wanted to let you know how jack's doing a little bit what to expect and she may have
had experiences on her own caring for a father or her spouse or a son or someone so sometimes it's
good to find that common ground and for both of you to realize hey this is tough but we're both
expressing a desire to be connected she offered and you accepted her invitation so the two of you
are where where it matters the most to your agreement with each other and maybe I could
write her a little note and thank her for coming by and say some of those things that I couldn't
think up to say at the time it's not too late so that's that's our behavioral box how about the
cognitive box so what tools do we have in there well disputing what you're thinking I guess I was
embarrassed okay so we have a thought record why don't we do one of those really quick and I'll
just sketch one out so we have the activating situation and you did a great job jack in his
underwear okay jack in his underwear okay and we have the emotion is embarrassment yeah embarrassment
and feeling protective towards him feeling sort of ashamed and ashamed okay and of course feeling
bad for the woman who didn't know what to do with it okay okay and if we were to rate the intensity
zero to one hundred of embarrassed about a hundred for all of them okay those are all pretty strong
and what were some of those automatic thoughts you were having um
how do I get rid of him how do I get him out of here um this is you know I should have done
something before I should have planned I should have realized this was going to happen or something
bad would happen and I shouldn't have had her over or what am I going to say you know how am I
going to make it right sounds like a lot of shoulds right okay all right a lot of that 2020 hindsight
issue right that's right um any other automatic thoughts um let's see I can't I can't think of
anything what any um guesses about what she might have been thinking yeah really worry about what she
might have been thinking I was of course worried about what she was thinking I imagine she'd be
she looked pretty horrified so that might be part of it um she was embarrassed too of course
and she didn't know what was happening she didn't know
um she didn't know that he was sick in that way she just knew that he was ill right right we weren't
close friends with her so it wasn't something very if it was my friend I would just be able to
you know explain or say something sure sure yeah sure well let's look at these thoughts and
remember thoughts aren't true or false uh their opinions their interpretations of a situation
they often pop to mind uninvited but we can take a step back and see if there's a different way that
we could see the same situation that might help you feel less embarrassed or ashamed or these other
emotions so rather than looking at evidence for against let's use some of those techniques we
used in the ABCD of if this happened to someone else what what might you say or the guess about
technique or the whole list of strategies that we had so if we were looking at some of these
shoulds I should have done something I shouldn't have had her over I should have prepared Jack all
these should should should should shoulds shoulds what would you say to a friend that's beating
herself up stop beating yourself up right right um you know he's sick this is a reality this is
the fact this is what it's like it's nothing to be ashamed of it's human that's just the way it is
to trust in the integrity of your friend yes and their compassion that she might feel embarrassed
that would understand and not judge as a consequence so in the moment what what thought
could you have would those thoughts be helpful or yes that would be helpful okay okay so can you
imagine having someone else over uh he comes out in his underwear oh please
he'll be dressed this time okay he'll be dressed because you will have done the behavioral strategies
and prepared him right and I'll have prepared my guests in fact when she calls on the phone I'll
explain what the situation is and if she's on and ask her if she's uncomfortable with it
and then that will give her a chance to know ahead of time I'll do it before she gets there because
you never know when Jack's gonna come out okay all right so if he is loud or disruptive or calls
her the wrong name or starts asking the same question over and over and over again which I know
he does what can you think in that moment
what I'm thinking is that maybe we should do this in a different place and not have
people necessarily to the house but if he did it maybe I could just say you know this happens
he asks me these questions all the time and um maybe this maybe I could just gently get him out
of there sure sure something like that sure so an acknowledgement of what's going on maybe an
explanation if it's needed but saying to yourself also it's okay you know you've done the pre-session
right you you've explained what it is that going on your friend understands they know the situation
they're in and the reason they're there is to support you because they know what you're going through
yeah so are you willing maybe at some point down the road to have another person over or
yeah I think I might start with somebody that I know better and then maybe for other people maybe
I could find time to go out and just you know have a chat a girl chat good that sounds like a great
idea yeah so in this clip with Maria she gives us a fairly straightforward example of something we
would call planful problem solving even the best laid plans sometimes go awry she just wanted to
have more increased positive social contacts things didn't go quite so well but instead of
becoming discouraged or defeated she was able to step back do a behavioral analysis of what was
happening and to think constructively of what she might do might do differently next time
other elements of resilience that we might want to think about and we might want to teach
fall into the cognitive and emotional styles category we'll talk about something called
attributional or explanatory style we'll go back to the notion of positive emotions and how they
can serve as a reservoir or a recharge when we're in the face of stress and we'll also talk about
flexibility or adaptability now the cognitive style that I wanted to share something called
attributional or explanatory style it was from the seminal work of Marty Seliman at the University
of Pennsylvania first starting with animal studies in the 60s and 70s and then moving on to human
studies now explanatory style essentially tells us that we have habits and how we explain why
events occur so here we're very much in the realm of subjective cognitions as human beings we almost
have a compulsion to try to explain why things happen big things small things positive things
and especially negative things now Marty Seliman believed that explanatory style has three key
dimensions which he called internal stable and global let's say a negative event happens to you
you have this compulsion to search for an explanation and you probably have to make your
best guess are you going to blame yourself or is it the fault of something outside of you
that's the internal dimension is this cause is it going to be there all the time now even in the
future or was it a one time only that's the stable dimension and is this cause maybe it's your
intelligence maybe it's your environment whatever it might be is it going to affect all areas of
your life and that's the global dimension internal stable and global now we know that the explanatory
style is particularly important in explaining achievement and also with its relationship to
depression individuals who explain negative events with an internal stable and global style
it's my fault it's never going to change and it's going to affect me everywhere
those are the individuals who are less likely to pick themselves up and to continue pushing forward
those are the individuals who are going to become more depressed
an important outgrowth of the work of explanatory style is the pen resiliency project this was a
CBT program to teach kids from inner city philadelphia schools how to have a more optimistic
explanatory style and the goal was to make them more resilient to stressors in their home life
as well as to prevent possible depression in the future much of this work was done by my
fellow graduate students at the time karen rivich jane gillam and andrew shatay since then there
have been quite a few studies looking at the pen resiliency program i'll just mention a meta analysis
of 17 different studies looking at this program that showed that the interventions significantly
reduced and prevented depressive symptoms over time in these children however it's not clear
if the pen resiliency program had an enhanced effect among children who were experiencing
adversity now that's important because if we define resilience as someone who is able to
withstand adversity we want to see that it's more effective in individuals who's in that
circumstance well it worked for pretty much all of the kids whether or not they were having stressors
or not i say if it works we should use it now the other cognitive style a really emotional
style i wanted to mention is to go back to positive emotion and we've had a couple of
lectures talking about how to induce positive emotions how to find meaning or how really to
construct meaning and while some research indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively
stable personality trait new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to treat
resilience now that's not to say that positive emotions are merely a byproduct of resilience
but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits
in the coping process of the individual empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research
on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit
positive emotions such as benefit finding cognitive reappraisals humor optimism and goal
directed or problem focused coping individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods
of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive
emotional resources and here i'd hope you could recall the work of judy moskowitz where she looked
at individuals newly diagnosed with hiv she looked at parents who were caring for sick children
and found that if she was able to induce positive emotions it essentially gave them
more of a reservoir to cope with the stressful and negative times ahead i would ask you i'll also
ask you to remember the work or the theory of barbara frederickson who taught us that positive
emotions are there to broaden and build they help to broaden our cognitive repertoire and they help
to build important social relationships that will help us to be more resilient in the future
i'd like to share a few new studies in the first by aung and colleagues in 2006 which was looking
at widows and positive emotion their group found that widows with high levels of resilience
experienced more positive and negative emotions than those with lower levels of resilience the
former group shows high emotional complexity which is the capacity to maintain the differentiation
of positive and negative emotional states while undergoing stress their group further suggested
that the adapted consequence of resilience is a function of an increase in emotional complexity
while stress is present so it's not just they have the rose colored glasses on they're feeling
things fairly intensely both positive and negative but they're able to differentiate and to use
both of those states constructively barbara frederickson did a study looking at the way that
individuals cope following the events of september the 11th and published her work in 2003 her work
suggests that positive emotions were critical elements in resilience and they served as a
mediator that buffered people from depression after the crisis occurred moreover she showed that
high resilient people were more likely to notice positive meanings within the problems that they
faced for example feeling grateful to be alive they endured fewer depressive symptoms and they
experienced more positive emotions than low resilient people after the terrorism attacks
so we've talked about general factors predicting resilience and we've expanded the work on
cognitive styles in positive emotion now let's look at flexibility and how it might relate to
resilience now cognitive flexibility has been described as the mental ability to switch between
thinking about two different concepts and to think about multiple concepts simultaneously
despite a good bit of disagreement in the literature about how to operationally define the term
one commonality is that cognitive flexibility is a component of executive functioning now a lot of
research on flexibility has been conducted with children at the school age however however individual
differences in cognitive flexibility are apparent throughout the lifespan in fact there are a number
of different clinician administered neuropsychological tests to measure flexibility such as the a not
be tasked dimensional change card sorting or the wisconsin court card sort or the stoop test
which we demonstrated in our last course mind body medicine cognitive flexibility also has
implications both inside and outside the classroom a person's ability to switch between modes of
thought and to simultaneously think about multiple multiple concepts has been shown to be a vital
component of learning and of problem solving and that includes social conflict i wanted to describe
a different kind of cognitive flexibility and it's also called cognitive complexity and this was
developed by phil tetlock he's a psychologist but i really think of him almost as a political scientist
he developed a concept called integrative complexity which is defined as the degree to which
thinking and reasoning involved the recognition and integration of multiple perspectives and
possibilities and their interrelated contingencies now that's a big mouthful of jargon but essentially
what he's talking about is when an individual talks about a challenging topic are they able
to see both sides of the coin are they able to verbalize to discuss the nuances of a particular
charged topic not only are they able to see the different sides and the nuances of that topic
are they then able to balance them or play them off of one another and come up with some sort of
integrated perspective that takes all of that possibly disparate data into account now as i
mentioned he's partly a political scientist because he uses this concept of integrated complexity
to help us understand politicians and the political process he's found that the electorate the voters
they tend to prefer politicians who are low in integrative complexity meaning someone that
doesn't talk about both sides of the coin someone who's more dogmatic who only sees one side but
they sound very confident and very determined otherwise they're wishy washy he would call that
integrative complexity and of course their pros and cons of both styles now this the idea of different
cognitive styles can be applied in many different situations an example would be the dissertation
that i did for my doctorate where we used integrative complexity we use something called pessimistic
rumination and we also used explanatory style in order to better understand the decisions made
by the major players in world war two and here we're talking about hitler stalin tertiel and
roosevelt why were they aggressive at times why were they more or less tolerant of risk at particular
times we were able to do a content analysis of their diaries of their letters and of interview
transcripts in order to better understand those decisions and their behaviors much to our surprise
and our delight it works the last type of flexibility i'll talk about is is called attributional or
explanatory flexibility and this of course is related to explanatory style now remember the
definition of explanatory style is that you have a habit of explaining things in a certain way
this looks at essentially how strong is that habit if you explain 10 different events are they all
essentially the same sorts of explanations or do you tend to move or flex depending on the situation
here oftentimes you'll look at the standard deviation of an individual's explanatory style
scores the greater the standard deviation the greater their attributional flexibility i'll
mention just one set of studies that was done by dav fresco he looked at attributional flexibility
in college students and found those students who were more flexible could be more resilient to
stressful events that occurred and they were less likely to get depressed so where does cbt fit in
well we know that cbt can be helpful in terms of generating positive emotions we know that cbt teaches
us to reappraise attributions and potentially explanations it gives us general cognitive
restructuring skills and hopefully teaches us through that process of looking at evidence for
and evidence against it teaches us to be more cognitively flexible or maybe more integratively
complex i'll mention a recent report put out by the american psychological association that gives
us 10 ways to build resilience and again i would encourage you to look at these through the lens
of cbt so first telling us to maintain good relationships with close family members friends
and others we've talked about that skill set to avoid seeing crises or stressful events is unbearable
problems and here we're talking about appraisals three except circumstances that cannot be changed
and we've talked about acceptance and constructing meaning and even forgiveness
four to develop realistic goals and to move towards them we've talked about smart goals and
action plans which brings us to number five to take decisive actions in adverse situations
six to look for opportunities of self-discovery after a struggle with loss
to develop self-confidence to keep a long-term perspective to maintain a hopeful outlook
and ten to take care of one's mind and body exercising regularly and paying attention
to one's own needs and feelings as well as social relationships if you're interested in other fully
fleshed out cbt programs to build resilience i would encourage you to look at a book by robertson
written in 2012 called build your resilience so let's tie all of this back to our cases now carol
who has anxiety we really want to help her have more courage in the face of her anxiety and resilience
to go out and build those social connections michael we want to increase the need for flexibility
he has a very specific way of seeing the world and becomes very angry when that view is violated
maria we want to help her be more flexible in order to meet the chronic stress of caregiving
and the upcoming death of her husband i hope you'll join us in our next lecture where we'll talk
about case endings finding treatment and how to evaluate your progress thank you
