You could say, what, the difference between 2 and 3 is that you're going to add up to
5, which is true, but negative 1 isn't allowed.
What, 3 and a half and 1 and a half, which add up to 5, and they're different, but they're
not whole numbers either, so that's no good.
So if you think about it, these are the only ones, 5, 4 and 1, 3 and 2.
That's the only way to break 5 up into different sized pieces.
So d of 5, remember, is how many ways to do this?
3.
There they are.
Those are 3.
Now, let me let o of n, new symbol, be the number of ways of writing n as the sum of
not necessarily distinct odd numbers.
So now we want to take n and break it up into odd sum-ands, but this time I'm going to allow
them to be repeated, but you see what I'm restricting is they've got to be odd.
Well, let's look at an example.
Let's do 5 again.
So I want to break 5 up into odd pieces.
One of them could be 5 standing alone.
How about 3 and 1 and 1, 3, 4, 5, and they're all odd?
Now, notice I've repeated the 1 here, but for this game, for the o of n, I'm allowed to
repeat as long as they're odd.
So that's a second way to do it.
And how about 1 and 1 and 1 and 1 and 1, 5-1s are all odd.
That's 5.
And then if you think about it, you're not going to find any more.
So that's it.
So we would say o of 5 is how many ways to split 5 up into odd pieces, o of 5 is 3, and
there they are, those 3 decompositions.
Well, before we move on, let me do another example.
Let's try 8.
Let's look at the number n equals 8 and do this again for 8.
So if I'm looking for distinct sum-ands, now you've got to break 8 up into different sized
pieces.
Here we go.
8, stand-alone, great.
How about 7 and 1?
That makes 8, and they're different, sure.
6 and 2, yep, that makes 8, 5 and 3, good, that makes 8, 4 and 4, well, that makes 8,
but they're not different.
So that's out.
So we can't count that one.
But there's a few more out there.
How about 5 and 2 and 1?
That makes 8, and there's 3 sum-ands now, but they're all different, so that's good.
And how about 4 and 3 and 1?
That makes 8, and they're all different.
If you try to find any more, you won't.
That's the whole collection, and how many ways to do that, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6 ways to
break 8 up into the sum of distinct sum-ands, so d of 8 is 6.
Remember, d of 8 counts how many ways to do the process, 6.
Let's do O of 8.
Let's break 8 into odd sum-ands.
Let's see what happens.
