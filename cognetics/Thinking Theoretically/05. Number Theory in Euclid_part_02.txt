And I want to show you his proof.
This is a classic result from number theory.
The proof goes like this.
It's Proposition 31 of Book 7.
Any composite has a prime divisor.
He said, all right, let's let n be a composite number.
Now what does that mean?
Well, we have a definition for composite.
It means you can write n as a times b, product of two pieces, where the a is intermediate
in size between 1 and n.
So a is bigger than 1, less than n.
So that much I know.
So n is so expressed, a times b.
Now Euclid says, if a is a prime, then we're done.
What am I trying to show?
Any number n has a prime divisor.
If a is a prime, it's certainly a divisor, you got it.
So then we're finished.
But maybe it isn't a prime.
There's no guarantee.
If it isn't a prime, then a is a composite.
So now Euclid has to go see what that means.
Well, back to the definition.
If a is composite, a can be written as a product of c times d, two pieces, where the c is a
is less than a and bigger than 1.
But remember, the a itself was less than n.
So now I got this chain.
One is less than c, is less than a, is less than n.
Now if c is prime, we're done.
Now why is that?
Well, c would be prime.
c would divide evenly into a, because a is c times d, a divides evenly into n, because
n is a times b, and hence c divides evenly into n.
It's just like in my numerical example, the two divided evenly into the 10, the 10 divided
evenly into the 120, so the two does.
So if c were prime, c would be a prime divisor of the composite number n.
Great, but it doesn't have to be.
So maybe c is composite.
Now what?
Well, back to the definition.
If c is composite, c is equal to e times f, where e is intermediate between 1 and c.
So 1 is less than e, is less than c.
But we said previously that the c is less than a, and we said before that that the a
