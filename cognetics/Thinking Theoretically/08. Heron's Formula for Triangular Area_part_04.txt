Now you can come out of the room with your papyrus.
You've got a way to figure out the square roots by hand.
Well, that's the one result that is in the matrica
that I wanted to mention.
But the even greater one is Heron's formula
for triangular area.
Now, you might say,
why do I need a formula for triangular area?
We've already seen this.
If you have a triangle with base b and height h,
we saw Euclid gave us the formula
that the area of the triangle is 1 half bh.
Why do I need another formula?
It seems like I got this one nailed down.
Ah, no, no, says Heron.
What if you don't have h?
What if you don't know the altitude of your triangle?
For instance, suppose I had this triangle,
five meters on one side,
eight meters on the other,
11 meters across the bottom.
And I want to know its area.
Maybe for tax purposes.
The tax collector's coming.
I've got to know how much area this is.
The formula that the area of a triangle
is 1 half base times height
will do me no good at all here
because I don't have the altitude.
I need some other approach.
And yet, I observe this.
There is an answer.
There is a unique answer.
There is only one area this triangle could have.
And that's because of congruence.
If you had another triangle
that had a side five, a side eight,
and a side 11,
those two triangles would be congruent
by side, side, side from Euclid,
book one, proposition eight.
And what congruence means is
the triangles are identical,
absolutely the same.
They have the same angles,
the same sides,
and the same areas.
And so any other triangle with these dimensions
has the very same area.
The trouble is, I don't know what it is.
I've got to find it.
And that's what Heron's formula will give me.
So, what does Heron do?
How does he give this area?
He says, let's suppose a triangle
has sides A, B, and C,
just arbitrary sides.
I want to figure out the area
