So let's figure this out.
That triangle on the left has area A1.
I'm going to figure it out via Heron's formula.
I first have to do the semi-parameter.
So there's 10 plus 24 plus 26 over 2.
That comes out to be 60 over 2 is 30.
So the semi-parameter is 30,
and hence A1, the area of the triangle on the left,
is the square root of S times S minus A times S minus B times S minus C.
That'll be the square root of 30.
That was S.
30 minus 10 is 20.
30 minus 24 is 6.
And 30 minus 26 is 4.
So I'm going to have to multiply 30 times 20 times 6 times 4.
Multiply all those together, and you get 14,400.
Take the square root of that,
and I don't need Heron's approximation scheme
because this one comes out perfectly, 120.
Exactly.
So the area of the left-hand triangle is 120.
How about the area of the right-hand triangle?
Well, same thing.
We know three sides.
We first have to figure out the semi-parameter.
17 plus 25 plus 26 over 2 turns out to be 34.
And now you apply Heron's formula for the area,
the square root of S, which is 34, times 34 minus 17,
which is 17, times 34 minus 25, which is 9,
times 34 minus 26, which is 8.
So I got to take the square root of that product.
You multiply it all out.
You get 41,616.
And I don't need an approximation for that either
because the square root of 41,616 is 204.
How amazing.
They came out evenly.
Well, I actually made it out that way.
Well, now I'm done because the area of the quadrilateral
is A1 plus A2.
A1 was 120.
A2 was 204.
Bingo.
324 is the area of that four-sided figure.
And you can imagine if you had a five-sided figure
or a six-sided figure or any polygon,
you just put in enough diagonals
to break it up into some triangles
and apply Heron's formula repeatedly.
Add them up and you got it.
So this is a very useful piece of mathematics.
Now, I'm not going to prove this right now.
We don't have much time.
And actually, Heron's proof is rather complicated.
It's a sophisticated geometry.
I've shown you here the diagram that accompanies it.
You can see the triangle there, ABC.
