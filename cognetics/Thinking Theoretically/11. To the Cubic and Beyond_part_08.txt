27 in both spots, I'm just going to stick in 36.
And now I can quickly run to the end, I'm trying to solve x cubed plus 24x is 56, I've
got my cubic formula, I put in the numbers, I get the cube root of n over 2, which is
56 over 2, plus that square root I just did, which we said turned out to be 36, minus the
cube root of minus n over 2, minus 56 halves, plus that same square root 36.
Well 56 over 2 is 28, so I'm now down to the cube root of 28 plus 36, minus the cube root
of minus 28 plus 36, 28 and 36 is 64, so I've got the cube root of 64, minus 28 plus 36
is 8, minus the cube root of 8, the cube root of 64 is 4, the cube root of 8 is 2, finally
I get x is equal to 4 minus 2, which is 2, which is correct.
So the formula works in a case where I sort of knew what the answer was ahead of time.
But the formula works for others that aren't quite as nifty, that one all worked out, everything
was a perfect square. Let me show you one where it's not quite as pleasant, x cubed
plus 6x equals 10, m is 6, n is 10, you go to the cubic formula, I'll read it once more,
but this will be the last time, the cube root of n over 2 plus the square root of n
squared over 4 plus m cubed over 27, minus the cube root of negative n over 2 plus the
square root of n squared over 4 plus m cubed over 27.
You can sort of see at this point why they don't teach this in schools, it's hard enough
to remember the quadratic formula, let alone this one.
But anyway, if you stick in the m's and n's, you get a big blizzard of square roots and
cube roots, and when you simplify it, it comes down to be the cube root of 5 plus the square
root of 33 minus the cube root of negative 5 plus the square root of 33, and this can't
be simplified further, that's it. Square root of 33 is not something that reduces, so there's
your solution by radicals. Now you could punch this in and get an approximate solution as
a decimal, 1.30271, it comes out to be, but that's just an approximation, that's not
what they were looking for in the 16th century, they were looking for the line above, they
were looking for the solution by radicals.
Okay, now, a couple of questions remain, what if the cubic isn't depressed? What if you
had a cubic that has the square term in it, like generally ax cubed plus bx squared plus
cx plus d is zero? Cardano discovered how to approach this, and what he did was he depressed
it. If it wasn't depressed, make it so, and his great discovery was how to do this, how
to turn any cubic into a depressed cubic, he says you just make a substitution. You replace
x by y minus b over 3a, where the a's and b's are the coefficients of your general cubic.
So let me do an example of this, let me show you how this works. Let's suppose I have this
cubic, x cubed minus 15x squared plus 81x is 165, that is not depressed. The a is one,
the coefficient of x cubed, the b is negative 15, and so Cardano says let x equal y minus
b over 3a, that is y minus negative 15 over 3 times 1, well minus minus 15 is 15, 15 over
3 is 5, so he says let x be y plus 5. When I go back to the cubic, I let x be y plus
5, stick it into x cubed minus 15x squared plus 81x equals 165, and you'll get of course
y plus 5 cubed minus 15 times y plus 5 squared plus 81 times y plus 5 equals 165. You multiply
all this out, collect the terms, and this turns into a depressed cubic. It always does,
that's what Cardano showed, this always will have to happen. In fact, the depressed cubic
it turns into is y cubed plus 6y is 10, that's the one we just did. I had x's in it, but
now I got y's in it, I know what the solution is by the formula y is equal to the cube root
of 5 plus the square root of 33 minus the cube root of negative 5 plus the square root
