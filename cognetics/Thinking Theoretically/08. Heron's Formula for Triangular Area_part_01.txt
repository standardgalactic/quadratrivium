So let me show you how to do the square root of 336 a la Heron.
He says, first of all, you need an estimate. You need a first guess.
And so let me take 18 as my first guess for the square root of 336.
I'm not right, but it's not a bad first guess because if you square 18, 18 times 18 is 324.
Well, that's not 336, but you're in the ballpark.
So that seems like a first guess, a good place to start.
Then Heron's technique shows you how to get a better guess from your first guess.
And he says, as your second estimate, use x2, I will call it, my second estimate,
as x1, my first estimate, divided by 2 plus 336, the number whose square root we seek,
divided by 2 times x1.
So I'm taking my previous estimate over 2 plus 336 divided by the double of my previous estimate.
All right, let's try that. That would be 18 over 2.
Remember, my first guess was 18. So 18 over 2 plus 336 over 2 times 18.
So that's 9, 18 over 2.
And 336 over 2 times 18 is 336 over 36.
And you can divide top and bottom by 12, and you get 28 thirds.
So what I would then decide is my next estimate is 9 plus 28 thirds.
So if you get a common denominator there, you get 55 thirds as my second estimate, as a fraction,
which of course is all the Greeks had to go on.
If you wanted to break it off as to a whole number plus a piece, it turns out to be 18 and 1 third.
So there's your second estimate, 55 thirds, or 18 and 1 third.
So you've sort of refined the first estimate of 18 upward a little bit to 18 and 1 third.
Well, then Heron says, let's get another estimate, a next estimate.
What do you do? We'll call it x3.
And what I will do is take x2, my previous estimate, over 2 plus 336 over twice x2.
Exactly the same process I just did to go from first estimate to second.
I repeat that to go from second estimate to third.
Now, what's going to happen here?
Well, remember, if x3 is x2 over 2 plus 336 over 2x2, we said x2 was 55 thirds from the previous one.
So it's 55 thirds over 2 plus 336 over twice 55 thirds.
Now, the fractions here are a little bit nasty.
You'd have to simplify these and get a common denominator.
But, you know, you're sitting there in the room with your big stack of papyrus.
You can do this by hand.
And when you do, it turns out to be 6049 over 330.
And at that point, I'm going to stop.
I'm saying, good enough, that's my estimate.
If you break it off, you get 18 plus 109 over 330.
That's going to be my estimate of the square root of 336.
So, there it is, estimate the square root of 336 is roughly, I think, 6049 over 330.
And then the question is, well, there's two questions.
Is this any good?
And if it is, why does this work?
What's going on here?
Let me address both of these.
Is this approximation any good?
Is the square root of 336 somewhere near 6049 over 330?
Well, one way to see it would be to square 6049 over 330.
After all, if that's the square root of 336, and I square it, I should get 336, or pretty close.
Well, if you square this, you get 36,590,401 over 108,900.
If I divide this out, this turns out to be 336 plus a little more.
How much?
One over 108,900.
That's awfully close to coming out right where I wanted it, 336.
That's a heck of an approximation.
But if you don't like that, let's convert these to decimals.
Not something the Greeks could have done, but we can.
Heron's estimate of 6049 over 330 converts out as a decimal 18.33030303 forever.
