is the root you take and the numerator, the p, is the power you raise it to.
So if I had something like 8 to the 1 3rd, this means the q-root of 8 to the first power.
And you don't need to write the first power, it just means the q-root of 8, which is 2.
So 8 to the 1 3rd is 2.
And something like 6 to the 5 halves means the 2nd root of 6 to the 5th power.
Well the 2nd root of 6 is the square root of 6.
So it means the square root of 6 to the 5th power, i.e. the square root of 6 times the
square root of 6 times the square root of 6 times the square root of 6, 5 of them.
And any 2 of them, square root of 6 times square root of 6, multiply to give you a 6.
So you can see what will happen if you get 6 times 6 is 36 square root of 6.
So with that little background then, we will look at the binomial expansion and allow fractional
or negative exponents.
This is what's called Newton's generalized binomial expansion.
He's allowing more general exponents up there than anybody had before.
So let me do an example, this is one he looked at.
Let's expand the q-root of 1 plus x.
Suppose you want to expand this out as a series.
We wouldn't actually do it with the q-root, you'd turn that into a fractional exponent.
So you'd write this as 1 plus x to the exponent 1 3rd, that would be your fraction.
And so when I use my generalized binomial series, r, the role of r will be played by
1 3rd.
So let's do it.
1 plus x to the 1 3rd will start off with 1 plus rx will become 1 3rd times x.
Next up is plus r times r minus 1 over 2 factorial x squared, but instead of r we're putting
in a 3rd.
So we have a 3rd times a 3rd minus 1 over 2 factorial x squared, then comes a 3rd times
a 3rd minus 1 times a 3rd minus 2 over 3 factorial x cubed, and on we go.
Now if you start simplifying that you'll see that you'll end up with 1 plus a 3rd of x
plus in the next expression 1 3rd times negative 2 3rds over 2 times 1 x squared because 1
3rd minus 1 is negative 2 3rds.
The next term will be 1 3rd times negative 2 3rds times negative 5 3rds over 3 times
2 times 1 x cubed because 1 3rd minus 2 is negative 5 3rds, and on it goes.
And if you then clean up the fractions, watch out for the signs, you'll get 1 plus 1 3rd
x minus 1 9th x squared plus 5 81st x cubed minus 10 over 243 x to the 4th and so on.
Now what's critical here is that this series doesn't stop.
It never quits, it keeps going, it's an infinite series.
And compare this to the one I did earlier where we had 1 plus x squared, remember as
those exponents were coming down we had 2 times 1 times 0 and that wiped out all the
rest of the terms.
Here we never get a 0 in the numerator, we skip over it.
I started off with 1 3rd and when I subtracted 1 I'm at negative 2 3rds and when I subtract
