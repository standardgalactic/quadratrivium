In our previous lecture, we saw Euler solve the Basel problem, a great theorem if ever
there was one.
Now there he was working on infinite series, which is a subject that had been around for
a long time.
He was pushing the frontiers.
In this lecture, I want to show you another of his great theorems on a subject that was
brand new.
He was essentially making up a field of mathematics as he went along.
It's a theorem about the partitioning of numbers.
However, I have a little extra time in this lecture, so I thought I'd start by just surveying
one branch of mathematics we haven't mentioned yet, and that is number theory.
Number was one of the great number theorists of all time, certainly in that same chain
that brought us Euclid, Fermat, you got to include Euler.
He wrote volumes of wonderful mathematics on number theory.
Let me just tell you about one of the contributions he made.
A definition had been kicking around for centuries as follows.
It says whole numbers m and n are amicable, which means friendly, if each is the sum of
the proper whole number divisors of the other.
This needs an example.
Look at the number m equals 220 and n equals 284.
What I'm looking for are the proper divisors of 220.
By that I mean whole numbers that divide evenly into 220, but are not 220.
That's what the proper means, smaller than.
If you look at the divisors of 220, you'll get 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and
110.
You also get 220, which divides into 220, but that's not proper.
If you add those up, you get 284.
Look at the proper divisors of 284, 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, those are the whole numbers that
go into 284 and are less than 284.
Add those up, you get 220.
Each of these numbers is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.
It's a strange reciprocity.
It has no particular use, but it's intriguing.
Mathematicians, number theorists love this.
I have a friend who, when he married the love of his life, gave her a key chain with 284
on it, and he has a key chain with 220 on it to indicate their undying friendship.
It's very sweet.
Now, let me give you the history of amicable numbers.
It's very short.
The Greeks knew that pair I just showed you.
220 and 284, the Greeks had somehow discovered, and they wanted to find more.
They couldn't.
These are hard to come by.
So that was it.
They just knew that one pair.
In the ninth century, the Islamic mathematician, Tabet Ibn Kura, whom I mentioned in an earlier
lecture, found a rule that generated two more pairs.
So now there were three known pairs.
However, apparently, Tabet's rule didn't make it back to Europe after the Renaissance,
where the European mathematicians only knew of that Greek pair, only that first pair.
And so in the year 1636, Pierre de Fermat, our friend, the number theorist, found another
pair, 17,286 and 18,416.
Believe it or not, if you add up all the proper divisors of 17,286, you get 18,416 and vice
