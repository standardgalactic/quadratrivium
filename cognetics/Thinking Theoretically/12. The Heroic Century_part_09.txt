1,940,249. Let's see this get factored. According to Fermat's scheme, what you do first is take
the square root of 1,940,249, and that's 1392 and change. And what you do is you go up to the next
bigger number, so 1393. Then you take 1393 squared minus your number, 1,940,249. You go up to the
next one, you get 1394 squared minus your number, 1395 squared minus your number, and keep going
until you get a perfect square as the result. Now in my case, that first difference turned
out to be 200. 1393 squared minus my number is 200. That's not a perfect square. The next one
turned out to be 2987. Not a perfect square. But the next one, 1395 squared minus my number,
turned out to be 5776, which lo and behold is 76 squared. That's all the further I gotta go,
because now I see that 1395 squared minus 1,940,249 is 76 squared. Move this around,
and you'll get that 1,940,249 is there for 1395 squared minus 76 squared. That's a difference
of squares. That factors into 1395 minus 76 times 1395 plus 76. You add and subtract here,
and you see that it's 1319 times 1471. That's how to factor 1,940,249 with Fermat's little trick,
and notice it only took three tries to do it. So wow, you can factor that on your third try.
That's nice. Well, the other result of Fermat is motivated by the fact that sometimes two
squares add up to be a square, as we know. Three squared plus four squared is five squared.
Five squared is 25. You can sort of break it down into two squares. Fermat said it is impossible to
do this with higher powers. He said it's impossible to divide a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power
into two fourth powers, or generally any power beyond the square into two like powers. I have found a
remarkable demonstration, but this margin is too narrow to contain it. He was writing this in the
margin. He said you can't split a cube up into two cubes, nor a fourth power into two fourths, nor any
higher power, and he had approved, but he couldn't quite fit it in. What he's saying in our notation
is if n is bigger than 2, there are no whole numbers a, b, and c, so that a to the n plus b to the n
is c to the n. For squares you can do it, but not for any higher n. This result has come to be known
as Fermat's last theorem. It was a tantalizing problem for mathematicians, in part because he
claimed he had a solution, you know, rats. He just couldn't quite get it in the margin. Maybe somebody
could find it. Nobody could in the 17th century, nor the 18th, nor the 19th, and indeed this wasn't
solved until the year 1995 by Andrew Wiles with an assist from Richard Taylor. Fermat was right,
but the proof that they found was hundreds of pages long. It would not have fit in the margin.
Well, I'll end this lecture with a quotation from Fermat, where he was looking back over his work,
and I think quite proud of what he had done. He wrote this, perhaps posterity will be grateful to me
for having shown that the ancients did not know everything. That kind of captures the excitement
of the era, the excitement of the heroic century.
