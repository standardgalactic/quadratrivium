Logarithms were discovered and developed by two people.
One was John Napier, a nobleman from Scotland, nurse's picture.
And one was Henry Briggs from England, who was not a nobleman.
In fact, I couldn't find a picture of Henry Briggs, though I might.
So I asked for a picture of some English Henry from about this time, and they gave me that
one.
Henry VIII.
Well, wait a minute.
That's not Henry Briggs.
That Henry wasn't particularly good at mathematics, and he was a very unkind man.
Henry Briggs was very good at mathematics and was very nice.
He went and visited Napier, and the two of them refined the idea of logarithms in a very
impressive fashion.
They created what are called the common or Briggsian logarithms.
These are the ones you remember from school.
The log base 10, the common log, the Briggsian log, the base 10 log of 10 is 1.
The log base 10 of 100 is 2 because 100 is 10 squared.
The log base 10 of 1,000 is 3 because 1,000 is 10 cubed.
The logarithm is the exponent.
You must raise 10 to to get the number.
This is the idea of a common log or a Briggsian logarithm.
Now those are easy, but what about the log base 10 of 5?
What number do you raise 10 to to get 5?
It's going to be some fractional number.
It's not going to be very obvious what that is.
It has to be calculated, and it has to be calculated with an enormous amount of tedium,
enormous amount of effort.
Briggs took it upon himself to do this.
He published in 1624 something called the arithmetica logarithmica, which is a table
of logarithms which he had calculated painstakingly over the years.
It must have been one of the most grueling computations ever done because his table of
logarithms were done to 14-place accuracy, which seems like overkill to me.
But finally, he did this.
He presents the world with these log tables, and then people can use logarithms to expedite
