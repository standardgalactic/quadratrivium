plus 1, which is 3. 2 and 1 is 3. That's a prime. And so Gauss's theory says you can construct a regular
3 gone, an equilateral triangle. Well, people had known that before Gauss's theory, but it's nice to
see that falling out of his ideas. If n is 1, 2 to the 2 to the 1 plus 1, now it looks like 2
squared plus 1, 2 to the first up there is a 2, 2 squared plus 1 is 5, that's a prime,
so his theory says you can do a regular pentagon. Again, we knew this from Euclid,
but there it comes from his theory. But now he moves into new territory. If n is 2, I'm looking at 2
to the 2 to the 2 plus 1, well, that 2 squared up there is a 4, 2 to the 4th plus 1 is 17,
and there's the regular 17 gone that he discovered. If n is 3, I now have 2 to the 2 to the 3rd plus
1, 2 to the 8th plus 1 is 257, that's a prime, and so you can construct a regular 257 gone by his
theory. And if n is 4, you have 2 to the 2 to the 4th plus 1, which is, these numbers are getting
huge, 2 to the 16th plus 1 is a 65,537 gone, which is a prime, and that can be constructed.
Now, there's not much point to it, because if you actually constructed a regular 65,537
gone, it would look like that. Can you imagine how big the radius would have to be before you
could see the little sides there? It would look like a circle, but it can be done. That's the
amazing thing. It can be done. It falls out of his theory. Now, the next candidate would be 2 to the
2 to the 5th plus 1, which is 2 to the 32nd plus 1, and if you multiply that out, you get
4,294,967,297. Can you do one of those? Well, that doesn't come out of his theory, because guess
what? That's not a prime. That number isn't a prime. It factors into 641 times 6,700,417,
and the person that first saw that was Euler, who was looking at this number for a completely
different reason and managed to factor it. So, since that's not a prime, it doesn't fit Gauss's
pattern, nor have any of the other numbers yet explored 2 to the 2 to the n plus 1 turned out
to be prime. So, it was just those first few, at least as far as we know at the moment, where his
theory works. Now, I should stress that the importance of all this is not because we really
care about constructing regular polygons with compasses and straight edges. We don't have to
do this for any particular reason. It's not that this has any practical use, but rather it's
theoretically so fascinating that it can be done, and Gauss's insights opened doors to explorations
into abstract algebra that became so fundamental as we move into the 19th century. You can trace a
lot of the theory of abstract algebra back to things like this from Gauss. Well, here's a picture
of Gauss laid in life, and his epithet by then had become the prinkeps mathematicorum, the prince
of mathematicians, and that was certainly accurate.
