and that's what it means to circumscribe a cylinder about a sphere, well now what Archimedes
is saying is that the cylinder is half again the sphere in volume and in surface, what
an amazing fact, let's check these out individually, the volume of the cylinder, let's do the
volumes first, the cylindrical volume, now you remember how to find the volume of a cylinder,
you take the area of the base which is a circle times the height, so we usually write that
v sub c the volume of a cylinder is pi r squared the area of the base times h the height, so
that's the cylindrical volume, but this isn't any old cylinder, this is a cylinder whose
height is the diameter of the sphere as it goes from top to bottom, in other words it's
twice the radius, so if I want to modify this formula I'm going to say that the volume
of the cylinder in this case is pi r squared times not h but 2r, if you multiply that out
you get 2 pi r cubed, so the cylinder in question here has volume 2 pi r cubed, now what does
Archimedes say about this, he says this is half again the volume of the sphere in his
sort of verbal description of his result, now what's that mean, here's what he's saying,
the volume of the cylinder is the volume of the sphere plus half the volume of the sphere
again, it's one and a half spheres, you can see it's bigger, he says it's exactly one
and a half of these, now if I know this add together v of s plus half of v of s I get
three halves of v of s, and then if you cross multiply this I'm trying to figure out what
is the volume of the sphere according to Archimedes, you cross multiply and v sub s will be two
thirds of v sub c, is that three halves flips over, so what he's saying is the volume of
the sphere is two thirds the volume of the cylinder but up above we saw the volume of
the cylinder was 2 pi r cubed, and so what he's telling us in our notation is that the
volume of the sphere is two thirds of 2 pi r cubed which is four thirds pi r cubed, is
that right, you bet, do we do it as Archimedes did, no, we do it with calculus, it's a nice
calculus problem but he's spot on, how about the surface, this seems to me even harder,
how in the world do you figure out the surface area of the sphere, well he says it's half
again the surface, he said the surface of the cylinder is half again the surface of
the sphere, so let's see what that's going to tell me, what's the surface area of the
cylinder, if you're going to paint the cylinder what are you going to do, you've got to paint
the circle on top, the circle on the bottom and then the lateral surface of the cylinder
the distance round, so the surface area of the cylinder is the lateral surface plus the
top and bottom circle, now you might remember the formula for the lateral surface of the
cylinder, what you do is you imagine sort of snipping the cylinder up the side and opening
it out, it has height h, it has width, the circumference of the original circle 2 pi
