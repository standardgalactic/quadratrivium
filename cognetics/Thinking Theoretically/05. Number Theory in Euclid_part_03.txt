is less than n.
So we're getting this chain being created here.
So as you continue this, you're going to have, here's my chain, 1 is less than whatever's
coming next, eventually you get less than e, less than c, less than a, less than n.
And notice that each new divisor I create in this fashion is greater than 1, but smaller
than its predecessor.
Now Euclid at this point says, we cannot fit infinitely many such whole numbers in the
range between 1 and n.
We cannot fit in infinitely many numbers, of course not, between 1 and 120.
If you've got to put whole numbers, but they've got to be less than 120 and more than 1, there's
only 118 slots.
So after 118 steps at the most, you'd have to stop, because you cannot fit infinitely
many numbers in here.
When I come to this split in the road at each case, it's either prime or composite, it's
either prime or composite, I can't go on forever.
The process of finding these new divisors must stop, and Euclid asks, what stops it?
When does the process stop?
It stops when we get a prime.
And so as I move down the chain, I go from n to a to c to e, and I might go for a long
time, but eventually I've got to stop.
And what will stop this process, so I do not go beyond, is I will have a prime divisor
of each of the numbers up the chain, including n.
Any number, any composite number n must have a prime divisor.
That's why.
That's the proof in Euclid, if you look at a modern number theory book, I promise you
that's the proof that's still there.
So let me look at an example here, just to see this working.
Suppose I looked at the hideous number 7,844,067, believe it or not that's composite, I'm looking
for a prime divisor.
So what would I do?
I'd break it up into two pieces.
So it turns out it breaks into 16, 17, and 48, 51.
And the 16, 17 is intermediate between 1 and the 7,844,067.
But the 16, 17 isn't prime.
It breaks up into 21 times 77.
And the 21 is bigger than 1, but less than the 16, 17, which in turn was less than the
number we started with.
The 21 can further be broken up into 3 times 7.
And now I get the chain, 1 is less than 3, is less than 21, is less than 16, 17, is less
than 7,844,067.
But I've reached a point where the process stops.
Three can't be further broken down.
Why not?
