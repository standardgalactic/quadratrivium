means, began to think they were fighting with the gods.
And so Archimedes was at least initially successful in keeping the Romans out.
And who knows how long this would have gone, but as the story goes, there was a festival
day at one point when the people in Syracuse, the guards, started drinking a little too much,
let down their vigilance, and the Romans broke in.
They got into the walled city.
So now they're running around through Syracuse.
Archimedes is in there, but he's not paying attention.
He's working on a math problem.
And Plutarch says that Archimedes having fixed his mind upon working out some problem never
noticed the incursions of the Romans, nor that the city was taken.
And so he's busily working on his math problem.
Here come the Romans to attack.
And a soldier unexpectedly coming up to him commanded Archimedes to follow to Marcellus.
So the soldier finds Archimedes and says, you're coming with me back to the general.
Marcellus would have loved to have had Archimedes on his side to invent all these weapons of
war for the Romans.
Here's a mosaic from classical times that shows the scene.
You see the centurion there.
You see Archimedes.
He's actually working on his sand tray, as he did.
And the centurion is saying, come with me back to Marcellus.
Well, according to the story, Archimedes declined to do this before he had worked out his
problem to a demonstration.
No, no, he says, I'm not going with you.
I've got to finish my proof.
Wrong answer, because then the soldier enraged, drew his sword, and ran him through.
And so Archimedes was slain because he wouldn't stop doing his math.
Here's an artist's rendition of this.
Now ever since, mathematicians have talked about this as the great mathematical death.
I mean, what a way to go.
Here you are working on your problem.
You won't give it up until you get your proof, and OK, that costs you your life.
