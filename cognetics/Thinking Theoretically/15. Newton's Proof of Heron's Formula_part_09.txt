B minus C, but I'm going to replace that with 2S minus C. That's what that is. Next up in
the numerator was an A minus B plus C, but that's twice S minus B. Next up was a B plus
C plus A. That's twice S. Lastly, B plus C minus A is twice S minus A. There's what
H squared is in terms of these semi-parameters. Now we're almost home. Because there's my
triangle ABC, let me look at the area of the triangle squared. I'll drop the H, drop
the altitude. The area of the triangle squared is one-half base times height squared. Sure,
I used the old formula for triangular area, one-half base times height. If you square
that, you'll get B squared over 4 when you square the one-half B times H squared. But
after all this work, I finally know what H squared is. H squared is twice S minus C
times twice S minus B times twice S times twice S minus A over 4B squared. The triangle's
area squared is that expression. Now the exciting drum roll. The B squared on the top cancels
the B squared on the bottom. In the numerator, I see 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, 16. In the
bottom, 4 times 4, 16. All that cancels and you get just S times S minus A times S minus
B times S minus C. But that's the area of the triangle squared. Well, if the area of
the triangle squared is S times S minus A times S minus B times S minus C, it follows
that the area of the triangle is the square root of S times S minus A times S minus B
times S minus C. That is Newton's algebraic proof of Heron's formula. I think that's a
wonderful argument. It's a lot of work. It's very clever. It's kind of a conversation between
the great Newton and Heron from so long before. And it reminds us why Isaac Newton belongs
on the mathematical Mount Rushmore.
