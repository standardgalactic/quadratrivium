It doesn't have to be this one, but I just need something on the screen.
So let's say this is the correspondence.
There could be anyone.
The contradiction will be the same, but let's use this as my concrete example.
So what am I going to do?
On the one hand, I got in the left-hand column the natural numbers, n.
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, on they go.
Now these are matched in a 1 to 1 fashion with real numbers between 0 and 1, which are
these infinite decimals.
So 1 has to match with something.
Suppose it matches with the number 0.123, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
Suppose 2 matches with the number 0.995, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
3 matches with 0.6023, 1, 9, 8, 8, 8.
It could be anything.
It matches with something.
4, let's say, matches with 0.7777 and so on.
So hypothetically, here it is, the 1 to 1 correspondence, where in the left-hand column
we have all the natural numbers.
In the right-hand column, we have all the real numbers between 0 and 1, and these are
matched like the fingers on my hands.
There's actually a logical contradiction lurking in front of us if we can just ferret
it out.
Well, Cantor says, let's introduce a real number, which I'm going to call c, and it's
going to be a real number of the form 0.c1, c2, c3.
Where are the digits?
And my job is to figure out what these digits should be to get me into a contradiction.
Let's suppose the first decimal digit of c, that is the thing that I'm calling c1, is
chosen to be different from the first decimal digit of the number matched with 1.
Now that sounds a little confusing here, so let's go back to the correspondence.
What I do is I look at the number matched with 1, so it's that 0.123123, I look at its
first decimal digit, there it is, put a circle around it, it's a 1.
So I want my c1, my first digit of c, not to be that.
I want to insist that c1 be something other than 1.
So let's just crank it up 1 and make it 2.
So c1 is 2.
Now remember my number I'm trying to build here, c, looks like 0.c1, c2, c3.
What I've just said is let c1 be 2, so my number now looks like 0.2, and then here comes
c2, c3, and the rest.
Well, now, Cantor says, choose c2 to differ from the second decimal digit of the number
matched with 2.
Again, back to the chart, the number matched with 2 is 0.99500.
I go to the second decimal digit there, which is at 9, and I want to choose c2 to be something
