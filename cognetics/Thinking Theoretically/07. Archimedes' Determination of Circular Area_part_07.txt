That can't be.
They can't both hold.
Something's wrong.
We've got a contradiction.
We, therefore, can eliminate case 2 as impossible.
Well, we're almost there.
Now, here's what Archimedes said.
Case 1, he showed it was impossible
that the area of the circle is more than the area of the triangle.
That disappeared in case 1.
Gone.
Can't be.
Then he said, he showed it was impossible
that the area of the circle is less than the area of the triangle.
That went down the tubes.
In case 2, what's left?
Well, Archimedes puts it this way.
Since then, the area of the circle
is neither greater nor less than the triangle.
It is equal to it.
That's his result.
That's his proof by double contradiction, which
seems to me to be really quite amazing.
A eureka moment.
There we go.
That's it.
That's what he wanted to prove.
Now, a modern reader looks at this and says,
this is strangely indirect.
What a strange way to prove that two things are
equal to show that one can't be bigger than the other
or smaller than the other.
Hence, they must be equal.
We sort of eliminate all the other possibilities.
Seems peculiar.
Here would be an example.
Suppose somebody said, let's prove 2 plus 3 equals 5.
Which it does, right?
Well, the Archimedean approach, the double reductio
out of certain approach, would say,
let's first assume 2 plus 3 is more than 5.
And you do some reasoning, and you get a contradiction.
So that can't be.
And then you assume, in case 2, 2 plus 3 is smaller than 5.
And you do some reasoning and get a contradiction.
So that's out.
And if it can't be bigger than 5 or it can't be smaller than 5,
you would be justified in concluding the 2 plus 3 is 5.
But what a strange route to that end.
So it's surprising.
But as I've said before, the history of mathematics
holds interesting surprises.
Hey, two other things.
First of all, is he right?
We're back to this question.
All right, the area of the circle
equals the area of that triangle.
We proved it.
