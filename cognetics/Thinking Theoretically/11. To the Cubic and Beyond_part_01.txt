So x is negative b negative negative 56 plus or minus the square root of negative 56 squared
minus 4 times a, which is 1, times c, which is minus 512.
All of this over 2a, which is 2 times 1.
So you'd start doing the simplifications.
The minus minus 56 is 56 plus or minus the square root.
Now minus 56 squared is 3,136.
And the minus 4 times the 1 times the minus 512 is 2048.
So that's under the radical.
All of this is over 2.
You add up the terms under the radical and you get 5,184.
And then when you take the square root of that,
you'll find that x is 56 plus or minus the square root of 5184 over 2.
But the square root of 5184 is 72, exactly.
So you get 56 plus or minus 72 over 2.
When you add them, you get 128 over 2.
When you subtract them, you get negative 16 over 2.
And so after all of this, you get that x is either 64, 128 over 2, or negative 8.
There's actually two solutions to this quadratic.
As I say, keep these in mind.
We'll see them again.
Well, that's the quadratic.
How about the cubic?
How about the third degree equation?
And we're about to plunge in.
Let me just say that, as you might expect, this is going to be harder.
It's more sophisticated.
But it's kind of incredible to see how this is done.
Now, remember what we're doing.
We're going to follow Cardano in chapter 11 of ours, Magna, in which he first
addresses just the depressed cubic, the sort of restricted sort, x cubed plus mx
is n.
Now, rather than do that general cubic with an m and an n in it, how about just
to make things a little easier, I will put specific numbers in those slots.
So instead of x cubed plus mx equals n, how about we'll pick this one, x cubed
plus 24x equals 56.
It's not going to be quite the generic general solution.
But all the steps I do here can be replicated with m's and n's.
It just makes it even more complicated looking.
So I think this one with the numbers n will make it a much more accessible kind
of derivation.
So we're going to go after just that one, x cubed plus 24x equals 56.
Now this is a cubic equation.
And so Cardano, interestingly, begins with a cube, an actual three-dimensional cube.
Remember when we saw Al Quarizmi solving a second degree equation, he completed the
