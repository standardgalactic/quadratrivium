This is very difficult, imagine trying to do your mathematics on a sand tray, there's
all kinds of things that can happen, the wind could blow away your proof or something, it's
amazing he did all that he did with his sand tray, but here's a picture of Archimedes working
in the sand.
He contributed a whole lot to mechanics, to our understanding of mechanics, he studied
the basic machines like pulleys and levers and screws, just as an example is his famous
statement, give me a place to stand and I will move the earth, and what he's getting
at there is he understood the principle of the lever, the fulcrum, if you had a long enough
arm and you push down you could lift a very great weight, even the earth should you have
a long enough arm to do that.
And his studies of the screw, the machine screw led to the Archimedean water screw for
pumping fluids, now this is a cylinder, a closed cylinder with a spiral inside, and as you
turn the crank the spiral turns and the water rises from a lower to a higher point, this
is still used, this is called the Archimedean water screw, a very nice application.
We have an awful lot of surviving works from Archimedes, we're actually quite fortunate
in that regard that so many early mathematicians their works are lost or contaminated, we have
quite a number of Archimedes works that are still around, let me mention a few of these,
one is a work called On Floating Bodies, this seems to be his work on hydrostatics probably
inspired by the story of the crown, he did a work called On Spirals, he was very much
intrigued with spirals and there's a spiral spinning line that's still around called the
spiral of Archimedes, and he wrote a book called Quadrature of the Parabola, now this
requires a little explanation, a parabola is a curve, we think of it as being the graph
of a quadratic equation, y equals x squared will graph to a parabola, the Greeks didn't
have equations, they thought of the parabola as a conic section, that is if you took a
cone and sliced through it with a plane exactly parallel to one of the sides, it would slice
out one of these parabolas, so that's what a parabola was to the conic section, quadrature
means finding area, so what he was doing here in this book was finding the area under a
parabola, the area under such a curve, now that's not a trivial question at all, nowadays
we do areas by integral calculus, and if you look in this book, quadrature of a parabola
you can see Archimedes anticipating integral calculus, it's not quite there yet, he doesn't
have the notation, he doesn't have the symbolism, but boy is he close, here's somebody who was
ahead of his time, not just by decades or centuries, but by millennia, so that is a
great work indeed, but then I want to mention two in particular, two of his works that are
