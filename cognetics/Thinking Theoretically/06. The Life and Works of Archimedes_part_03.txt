at the top of the heap, one of them is called measurement of a circle, it's a very short
work, only has three propositions in it, but two of them are real classics, the first is
this, proposition one in measurement of a circle, he asserts that the area of any circle is
equal to a right angle triangle in which one of the sides about the right angle is equal
to the radius, and the other to the circumference of the circle, now this might sound rather
confusing and complicated, this is actually his determination of the area of a circle,
this will be the proposition we prove in the next lecture, so I'll say no more about it
for now, but we'll be back, proposition three, the last proposition in measurement of a circle
says that the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter is less than three
and one seventh, but greater than three and ten seventy firsts, now you recall that the
ratio of the circumference of a circle, the distance around to the diameter, the distance
across is a constant, any two circles have that same ratio, whether it's a big circle
with a big diameter, or a small circle with a small one, the ratio is the same, and that
ratio of circumference to diameter we now denote by pi, that's what pi is, the Greeks
didn't use that, even though that's a Greek letter, they didn't use that symbol, but
they would always talk about the ratio of circumference to diameter, so what this is
saying is c over d, circumference to diameter is pi, and if you just cross multiply that
c is equal to pi d, there's that famous formula from high school, so whenever Archimedes is
talking here about the ratio of circumference to the diameter falling between three and
one seventh and three and ten seventy firsts, what we can see that he's doing is saying
that pi, this constant, lands between three and ten seventy first below, three and one
seventh above, now if you get out a calculator and figure this out as a decimal, what this
means is he has nailed down pi to two decimal places, 3.14, he didn't express it as 3.14,
the Greeks didn't have the decimal system, they had fractions, and so the fractional
expression that he gave would be good enough, but we can see this as sort of a two place
calculation of pi, it's a major advance in geometry, now how did he do this, he did it
by approximating the circle's circumference by the perimeters of inscribed and circumscribed
regular ninety six gons, here's what he did, he took a circle, he wants that circumference
and he put inside it a regular hexagon, regular six sided figure, he could tell the perimeter
of the hexagon, which isn't the circumference of the circle, it's a little too small, but
then he used a mathematical technique that allowed him, if he knew the perimeter of the
hexagon, to double the number of sides to a twelve sided gond, a dodeca gond, and figure
out that perimeter, well a twelve sided figure inside the circle is a little closer to the
