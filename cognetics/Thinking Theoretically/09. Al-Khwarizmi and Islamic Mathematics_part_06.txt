now stands, there's a square and two rectangles tacked on the edges. But if you add up all those
areas, you've got x squared plus 10x's. You split them, the 10x's into the two 5's. Well,
x squared plus 10x is equal to 39. So at the moment, the area of this strange shape here is 39.
All right, now what? Well, if you go back to Alcorhismy's recipe, he says this you multiply
by itself. This meaning the number of roots, 5, you multiply it by itself and get 25.
Now, look at the little lower right hand corner of my picture. It's sort of missing a piece there.
Something's missing. What are the dimensions there? 5 by 5. If I were to fill that in with a green
square, 5 by 5, I would have just added on 25. 5 times 5. And so what I'm going to do is, according
to him, he says, add this to 39 and the sum is 64. So if I take the 25, the little green square,
add it to the 39, which I started with, 39 and 25 is 64. So we're doing some geometry here of
some sophistication and where's it going? Well, let's look at the picture again. Remember, we're
trying to solve x squared plus 10x is 39. We have taken this square, added on the two rectangular
strips, put in the little green corner, and we know that that comes out to be 64.
So what's the area of this big square we've created? Well, look at it. It's x plus 5 in each
direction. So x plus 5 squared is its area. That area has to be 64. Now, what does our
charisma tell us to do next? He says, take the root of this, which is 8. That is, he says, take
the square root of both sides. If x plus 5 squared is 64, then the square root of x plus 5 squared
is the square root of 64. In other words, x plus 5 is 8. And then he tells us to subtract
from it half the number of roots, which is 5. The remainder is 3. So he says, take the 8,
subtract half the number of roots, 5, and you get 3, and that's what he claims the answer is, 3.
So this is the geometrical explanation of this kind of strange recipe he gave for solving his
quadratic. Now, the proof of the pudding when you solve an equation is, does it check,
is x equal to 3? Let's see. You check this. What do you do? Well, if I'm trying to solve
x square plus 10x is 39, I put in 3. So I get 3 squared plus 10 times 3. Well, 3 squared is 9,
and 10 times 3 is 30, and 30 plus 9, sure enough, is 39. It checks. So the result comes out as
advertised. So this is right, and this is the explanation for this. And you know what he just
did? It's what we call completing the square. You might have seen this in school, completing
