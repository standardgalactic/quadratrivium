Now, if I get out my calculator and be very non-heronian, but very modern, and punch in the square root of 336,
I get 18.33030278.
If I round this to six places, they're the same.
I am within six places in accuracy.
And it took me two steps in this approximation scheme with Heron.
I guessed x1 is 18.
I refined it once.
I refined it twice.
I got six place accuracy.
That's pretty impressive.
That's Heron's scheme.
Now, the question is, why?
Why does this work?
Can you explain this?
Can you justify this reasoning?
And yes, you can.
Now, it's going to require me to delve into the modern notation of limits,
but bear with me and you can see why this actually works.
Remember what he did?
He said x1 was his first guess.
x2 was x1 over 2 plus 336 over 2x1.
Then x3 was x2 over 2 plus 336 over 2x2.
And x4, if I had gone further, would have been x3 over 2 plus 336 over 2x3,
and on and on and on.
And we just would continue this.
The assertion is, as you do this, your approximations,
x1, x2, x3, x4, should be going to the square root of 336 for some reason.
For a reason, I'm going to show you.
Now, here's what I'm going to say.
Suppose, as n gets bigger and bigger, we usually write it this way,
as n goes to infinity, these x's are going to some limit, which I will call l.
So if I look at x1, then x2, then x3, then x4, and see where they're headed,
they're kind of converging to some limit, l, and I've got to figure out what l is.
Now, if Heron's right, l is the square root of 336.
That's what these things should be tending to.
But that's not at all clear that that's going to work.
So let me show you why, in fact, l is the square root of 336.
So let me put up on the screen here again the steps.
There's x2, there's x1 over 2, plus 336 over 2x1, there's x3, there's x4, on we go.
And remember what we said, that as n gets bigger and bigger,
these xn's are approaching some limit, l, whose identity I need to determine.
What is l?
Here's how you reason it.
Let me look, first of all, at the column just to the right of the equal sign.
So you see that there's x1 over 2, x2 over 2, x3 over 2,
and I want to know where are those heading?
Where are they going?
Well, if x1, x2, x3 are marching to l,
x1 over 2, x2 over 2, x3 over 2, etc., are marching to l over 2.
They're just half of the original terms.
So that limit would be l over 2.
So I'm going to say that that column has to be going to l over 2.
Then we're going to add to it the far right column.
Now where are those going?
Well, I've got 336 over 2x1, then below it, 336 over 2x2,
336 over 2x3.
Where are those headed?
Well, if the x1, x2, x3 are going to l,
