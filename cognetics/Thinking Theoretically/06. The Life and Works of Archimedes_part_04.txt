circle, then he doubled from twelve to twenty four, doubled from twenty four to forty eight,
from forty eight to ninety six, by the time you have a regular ninety six sided polygon
inside the circle, it's pretty close to the circle, and its perimeter is very close
to the circle's circumference, but it's a little on the small side, he did the same
on the other side, he circumscribed a hexagon, then a twelve gond, then a twenty four, forty
eight and ninety six gond, and now is sort of zooming in from the outside on the circle's
circumference, using that to get his upper estimate, and so by doing this he has managed
to come out with a very accurate estimate of pi so long ago, this technique of doing
this by putting circles in, circumscribed, I mean circumscribed and inscribed polygons
to approximate the circle is called the classical method for approximating pi due to Archimedes.
Now the other great work I want to mention is called On the Sphere and the Cylinder,
and this was really his masterpiece, there he found the volume and the surface area of
a sphere, this is a very sophisticated problem, the volume of a sphere, that's hard, the surface
area, that's hard, nowadays we do these with integral calculus, Archimedes didn't have
that technique and yet he found these results, the big statement of his great result there,
his great theorem is this, and let me read this to you, he says if a cylinder is circumscribed
about a sphere, the cylinder is half as large again as the sphere in volume, and half as
large again as the sphere in surface area, so again we get one of these very wordy kind
of descriptions, at this point you're saying why didn't they just give us a formula for
this, for the surface and the volume of the sphere, well they didn't have algebra, as
I've said many times the Greeks were limited with their tools, at least it would seem to
us, and so if you want to describe a result you have to put it in words, and this was
his description of his great result, when I see one of these I have to ask myself, is
he right, this doesn't look like what I know to be the volume and the surface of a sphere,
is it right, when you ask this question of Archimedes the answer is always yes, he's
always right, it just doesn't maybe sound like it, it takes a little bit of work to
see what he's getting at, so let me show you what this really is saying, this result,
first of all he tells us he's taking a sphere and circumscribing a cylinder about it, so
here's the picture you usually see, there's the sphere, and when you circumscribe a cylinder
that means that you're going to take a cylinder whose radius is exactly the radius of the
sphere, so on the vertical sides of the cylinder it just grazes the sphere, meanwhile its height,
the cylinder's height is the sphere's diameter, so that the circle on the top of the cylinder
touches the top of the sphere, the circle at the bottom of the cylinder touches the bottom,
