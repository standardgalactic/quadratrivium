They're out there.
They're out there in overwhelming abundance.
Most numbers are transcendental.
And yet, you know, people had found so few of them.
It seemed like such a battle to even find a couple.
What Cantor's saying is, no, no, they're in the majority.
E.T. Bell, a 20th century mathematician and a very fine writer put it this way.
The algebraic numbers, said Bell, are spotted over the plane like stars against a black
sky.
The dense blackness is the firmament of the transcendentals.
So the algebraics are out there, but they're like the stars.
You just hear in there.
But that background, the blackness behind, are the transcendentals, which are in the
overwhelming majority.
So there is an application of his theory of the infinite.
But wait a minute.
This was a cardinality argument.
But how many transcendentals did Cantor actually exhibit in this proof?
Which ones did he show you?
None.
He didn't show you a single one.
He knew they were there because of this cardinality reason, but he didn't provide a specific example.
And people sort of wanted to see some.
Come on.
If you tell me the transcendentals are there, you tell me they are.
In the majority, show me a few.
Cantor said, I don't have to.
I know they're there.
I've counted.
Hmm.
Well, that didn't go down too well with some people.
Imagine, let's go back to our dolphins.
Okay.
Remember, we got our algebraic dolphins, and we got all our dolphins.
And suppose I use some kind of clever counting argument and find that the scale tips.
As shown, what's that mean?
The algebraic dolphins cannot account for all the dolphins, so they'd be transcendental
dolphins, which, if you remember, are the dolphins that don't live in the water.
Well, if somebody claimed that there are dolphins that don't live in the water, I would sure
want to see one, show me one.
But Cantor would say, I don't have to.
They're there.
