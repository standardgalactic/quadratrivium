you get when you expand something like 1 plus x to the 17th.
If I wanted to do that with Pascal's Triangle then, I'd just go down to the 17th row of
the triangle, and I could read off the coefficients.
It would be great, except there's a problem there too.
Because the 17th row requires me to have the 16th row.
The 16th depends on the 15th.
And so I would actually have to build from the start all the way down to the 17th row.
That wouldn't be much fun either.
But what we'd like is a more efficient way to do this, and there's something called the
binomial expansion, which gives you an automatic way to find things like 1 plus x to the 17th.
So let me show this to you.
It's aimed at figuring out 1 plus x to the r, I will write it, where r could be 17 or
3 or whatever.
The expansion looks like this.
It starts with 1 when you multiply 1 plus x times itself r times.
All those 1's will multiply.
Then you get an r times x.
Then you get an r times r minus 1 over 2 times 1 times x squared.
That's the third term.
The x cubed term has, as its coefficient, r times r minus 1 times r minus 2 over 3 times
2 times 1.
That's how many x cubes there are.
And the pattern continues.
You can see what they're doing here.
You always march down from r, r minus 1, r minus 2, and so on.
In the bottom, you're taking 3, 2, 1.
The next term would have a 4, 3, 2, 1 in the bottom, and so on.
It's a very nice pattern.
It's called the binomial expansion.
So let's do an example with r equals 2.
Suppose I wanted to go back to my first example, 1 plus x squared, and not do it by multiplying
these out, but by using this binomial expansion.
So the r's 2, I just go to the pattern, it'll start off with 1 plus 2x, rx, plus 2 times
2 minus 1, that is 2 times 1, over 2 times 1, x squared.
The next term, think about this one, it'll be 2 in the numerator, 2 times 1 times 0 as
we descend, over 3, 2, 1, x cubed.
But that's going to be 0.
The term after that would be 2 times 1 times 0 times negative 1, over 4 times 3 times 2
times 1, but that will be 0, too.
In fact, all the rest of the terms are gone.
They all will have a 0 in them.
