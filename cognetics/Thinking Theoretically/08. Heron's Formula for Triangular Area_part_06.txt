A, B, and C are the three sides, 5, 8, and 11.
So you substitute, and you'll get, according to Heron,
the area of the triangle is the square root of 12
times 12 minus 5 times 12 minus 8 times 12 minus 11.
Okay, so you figure this out.
This will be 12 times 12 minus 5, which is 7,
times 12 minus 8, which is 4,
times 12 minus 11 is 1.
You multiply all this together
and you see the area of the triangle is the square root
of 12 times 7 times 4 times 1,
which is the square root of 336.
Now, wouldn't it be nice if I could find
the square root of 336?
Well, Heron could.
That was my previous example.
This is why he needed to approximate square roots
in the metrica, because he runs into them
right here with the area of the triangle.
And so Heron would get to work and show us,
rather quickly, that the square root of 336
is about 6049 over 330.
That would be his area for the tax collector's purposes.
It's a wonderful, wonderful result.
Now, suppose I had this thing.
Suppose I had a quadrilateral, a four-sided figure
that was 10 yards by 17 yards by 25 yards by 24 yards.
I need the area of this.
How do I find this?
Well, actually, there is no unique answer here.
For a quadrilateral, knowing the four sides
is not enough to nail down the area.
I assume you know that.
But if not, just imagine a square,
maybe 5 by 5 by 5 by 5.
It has area 25.
If you were to tilt it,
you'd still have 5 by 5 by 5 by 5
in a thin-looking diamond, which has much less area.
So just knowing the sides of a four-sided figure
does not determine the area.
You need more information.
Three-sided figure, if you know the three sides,
the areas are set by side, side, side.
Four sides, all bets are off.
So if this was my plot of land,
and I walked around 10 yards and 17 yards
and 25 yards and 24 yards, I'm not quite done.
But what I do then is you walk the diagonal.
So I march along that way,
and let's say that came out to be 26 yards.
So now I have the four sides of my quadrilateral
plus a diagonal.
Now I can find the area,
and you do it by just applying Heron's formula
to the triangle that's formed on the left,
whose area is A1, and the one on the right,
whose area is A2.
