because it felt so good when he stopped, except this wasn't a joke.
This is how Cardano lived.
He believed in trinkets, amulets, portents.
He believed in guardian angels.
He wrote this.
He said, attendant or guardian spirits are recorded as having favored certain men constantly.
Socrates, Plotinus, Sinicius, Dio, Flavius Josephus, and I include myself,
all to be sure lived happily, save Socrates and me.
Well, it was one thing to believe in guardian angels.
It was another thing to converse with them.
And in fact, Cardano would regularly be seen talking to his guardian angel,
and the public was somewhat suspicious of his sanity, I think.
In addition, he gambled big time.
In fact, he wrote it the first treatise ever on probability,
called the book on games of chance.
And in the whole history of probability, this is where it started,
as he's giving the rules and the strategies for winning in various gambling situations.
He gambled a lot.
He said, I gambled at chess and dice for many years, and not only every year,
but I say it with shame every day.
And he cheated.
That got him into all sorts of scrapes.
So, you know, quite a lusty character, but also a Renaissance man.
He became one of Europe's foremost physicians.
He was a doctor who was very good, and his reputation extended well beyond his hometown,
all across Europe.
For instance, he treated the pope.
Now, that was about as illustrious a patient as any physician could have.
The pope would call Cardano in for treatment.
And even more amazingly, he treated the Archbishop of Scotland.
Now, somehow his reputation reached Scotland.
The Scottish Archbishop demanded that Cardano treat him, and Cardano went to Scotland to do so.
If you think about travel in the 16th century, that was a major journey.
And yet, because of his fame, he was called to that task.
He also was a prolific writer on a wide variety of subjects.
Cardano wrote on medicine.
He wrote on mathematics.
He wrote on religion.
He wrote about astrology.
