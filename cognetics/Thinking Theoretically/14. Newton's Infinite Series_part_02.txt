And all we're left with are the first three terms, 1 plus 2x, and look at the next one,
2 times 1 over 2 times 1, cancel, and so you get 1 plus 2x plus x squared as we expected.
Now let me use the same expansion for the harder problem, 1 plus x to the 17th.
Now you can see where this is going to earn its keep.
1 plus x to the 17th, I just substitute in, let r be 17, run across it, you'll get 1 plus
rx is now 17x, plus r times r minus 1 over 2 times 1, 17 times 16 over 2 times 1x squared.
The term 17, 16, 15 over 3 to 1, x cubed, 17, 16, 15, 14 over 4, 3 to 1, x to the 4th.
You can just keep going.
The pattern is quite clear.
And then all you have to do is simplify these fractions.
Now the arithmetic can be a little bit tricky, but it's not bad.
If you're paying attention, you'll get 1 plus 17x plus 136x squared plus 680x cubed, 2380x
to the 4th, on and on it goes, you're finally grind to a halt with 17x to the 16th and lastly
x to the 17th.
So this is a finite series, not an infinite one, but it's done via the binomial expansion.
And one more problem like this with my expansion, what if somebody asks you what's the coefficient
of x to the 11th in the expansion of 1 plus x to the 17th?
Because that's all they wanted to know.
If you took 1 plus x, raised it to the 17th power, how many x to the 11th would there
be?
Well, the multiplying out is not what you want to do.
The Pascal's Triangle is probably not what you want to do.
I want to use the binomial expansion.
But this time I'm just going to zero in on the x to the 11th term.
Now if you look at the formula, you can see what's going to happen.
To get an x to the 11th, you're going to have a fraction in front of it.
That'll be the coefficient.
Under it will be 11 times 10 times 9 times 8 times 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
And on the numerator you'd start with 17 and go down to 16, 15, 14 until you get 11 terms
up there.
So I can immediately write down what the 11th term's going to be, what the x to the 11th
term's going to be.
There it is, this big fraction with all these numbers on top and all these numbers on the
bottom.
It looks like a mess to try to multiply all this out and simplify it, but actually all
kinds of cancellations will occur.
If you look at that, you see 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 in the top, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 in the bottom.
So right away you can lop off most of those terms.
What's left isn't too bad.
You do the work and you see that there's 12,376 x to the 11th.
All right, so that's kind of background.
