A prime number, he says, is a whole number greater than one that is divisible only by
one in itself.
A prime has no other divisors than one in itself.
So for example, two is a prime.
Seventeen is a prime.
The only things that divide into 17 evenly, the only whole numbers are one and 17.
There's no others.
So as 65,537, that's a prime, but that's a little harder to show that it can have no
other divisors but one in itself.
And then he defines a composite number, the counterpart of the prime.
This is a whole number greater than one that is divisible by some number strictly between
one and itself.
So a composite number has an intermediate-sized divisor, not just one, the smallest divisor
possible, and itself, which of course is the greatest.
There's some intermediate-sized one.
Another way of thinking of this, a little more symbolic, is this.
It is a composite number if you can write in as a product of A times B, where the A
is bigger than one but less than n.
There's that intermediate-sized divisor, A. Such a number is called composite examples.
Well, 15 is composite because it's 3 times 5, and 3 is intermediate between 1 and 15.
49 is composite, 7 times 7.
The numbers can be the same as long as there's an intermediate-sized divisor.
So he's got the big terms of prime and composite on the table.
And then Euclid proves in Proposition 31 of Book 7 this very important idea.
Any composite number has a prime divisor.
Now you can see this at work in an example like 30.
30, you can write as 3 times 10.
The 10 isn't prime, of course, but the 3 is.
So 3 is a prime divisor of the composite number 30.
Suppose I took 120.
Now that's a composite, and I can write it as 10 times 12.
Break it down into two pieces.
It's composite.
But notice, neither of those is a prime, neither 10 nor 12.
So I have to break the 10 down.
10 is 2 times 5.
And now what I say is, look, 2 divides evenly into 10.
10 divides evenly into 120.
So the 2 divides evenly into the 120.
And the 2, of course, is a prime.
So there's a way to get a prime divisor of 120.
Now what Euclid says is, any composite number has a prime divisor, not just 120 and 30,
any does.
