We've done battle with the cubic equation, whose solution was the great achievement of
the 16th century.
Now it's time to move on to the next, to the 17th century, which is sometimes called
the heroic century in mathematics.
That's because the 17th century contributed so many ideas, which are now fundamental to
our mathematical world.
Ideas that you encounter in school, ideas that are still being studied and researched
to this day.
It was the century when mathematics became modern.
I want to introduce you to a cast of characters from at least the first half of the century
in this lecture.
Perhaps first though, we should just see what was going on elsewhere in the world early
in the 17th century.
Well, there's a couple of pretty substantial achievements.
In 1601, Shakespeare wrote Hamlet.
In 1607, the British formed their first settlement in Jamestown in the New World.
In 1609, Galileo turned his telescope on the heavens in the process confirming Copernicus'
theory that the sun was the center of the solar system and discovering many other wonderful
heavenly things as well.
So it was an exciting time, as it was in mathematics.
Now my first character from the heroic century is actually someone that lived most of his
life prior to that.
It was Fran√ßois Viet.
Here's a dashing looking fellow.
This is Viet.
And his great achievements were just at the end of the 16th, just before the 17th.
You know, these centuries don't divide perfectly in terms of ideas.
I'm going to slosh him over into the 17th century.
The Devinere Viet did lots of things.
One of them was he cracked the Spanish cipher.
The Spanish army had a code, a cipher, in which they would encrypt important messages.
The French couldn't break the code.
They got a copy of one of these messages.
They gave it to Viet.
