a small x.
I'm going to think of the cube root of 140 and you ask yourself, what is a perfect cube
that's somewhere in the neighborhood of 140?
A perfect cube, some number you can take the cube root of easily, that's up there around
140.
Well, how about 125?
125 is 5 cubed.
So I'm going to write this as the cube root of 125 plus whatever I need to get up to 140,
which is 15.
So it's kind of weird, you've taken the 140 and broken it into 125 plus a 15, then under
that cube root, you factor out a 125.
So I'm going to write this as the cube root of the expression 125 times parentheses, 1
plus 15 over 125.
Now if you think we're off track here, just multiply the 125 back through the parentheses
and you'll get 125 plus 15, which is 140.
So we haven't done anything wrong yet.
That expression under the cube root is just another way to write 140, but it seems like
a rather peculiar way to do it, except for this problem in which it's exactly what you
want.
All right, next up, the cube root of the product is the product of the cube roots.
So instead of the cube root of 125 times that parenthetical, we're going to write it as
the cube root of 125 times the cube root of the parenthetical.
We break these apart into two cube roots, but the cube root of 125 is easy.
That's 5, I know that, that's why I picked 125, that one I can do.
And what you're left with beside there is the cube root of 1 plus 3, 25.
Now I can use the binomial expansion.
Now I can use Newton's result because the x is going to be 3, 25, which is small.
And if I put that into the series, it will converge very quickly to my answer.
So that's the artifice, that's the little trickery you have to employ.
Let's see what happens when we do that.
I'm going to get that the cube root of 140 is 5 times the cube root of 1 plus 3, 25.
I go to the series for the cube root, and I'll tell you what, I'm only going to take
the first four terms and stop.
The series goes on forever, but I don't have forever, so I'm just going to take the first
four terms and thus I'm going to get an approximation.
Sometimes we write a little squiggly equal sign for approximately.
So I'm going to end up with 5 times, all right, stick 3, 25 into the binomial expansion.
You'll get 1 plus a third of x will be a third of 3, 25 minus a ninth of x squared will be
minus a ninth of 3, 25 squared plus 5, 81st of 3, 25 cubed.
And I'm stopping there saying that'll be a good enough approximation.
You collect all those terms in the square brackets.
