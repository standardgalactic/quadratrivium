knowing the three sides only.
First thing you do is you find
what's called the semi-perimeter.
Now, the perimeter of a triangle
of sides A, B, and C
is just A plus B plus C.
You just go around.
The semi-perimeter is half of that.
So, you take half the perimeter
and you call that S, the semi-perimeter.
A plus B plus C over two.
And then Heron's formula says
the area of the triangle is,
get ready, the square root of S
times S minus A times S minus B
times S minus C.
That can't be right.
I remember the first time I saw this,
I was ninth grade.
We had been studying areas of triangles.
We had just seen the area of the triangles
one-half base times height.
And there was a footnote.
And it said this.
It said, the area of a triangle
can also be found as the square root of S
times S minus A times S minus B
times S minus C.
And I said, that must be a typo
that can't possibly be it.
That's so complicated.
The area of a triangle
surely isn't that sophisticated.
But in fact, that was right.
They didn't show me why it was true
back in ninth grade.
But I later saw that, in fact,
this is right.
This is Heron's formula.
And it's quite amazing.
It's my favorite result from geometry,
just because it's so implausible.
Well, let's go back to our triangle
and see how this works.
Triangle 5, 8, and 11.
So we're back in Heron's day.
We got to figure out the area of that
for the tax collector who's coming around.
What you do first is find the semi-perimeter.
So that's half the perimeter.
So A plus B plus C is 5 plus 8 plus 11.
You divide that by 2.
You get 24 over 2 or 12.
So half the perimeter is 12.
And then Heron's formula says
the area of a triangle is the square root of S
times S minus A times S minus B times S minus C.
S is 12, the semi-perimeter.
