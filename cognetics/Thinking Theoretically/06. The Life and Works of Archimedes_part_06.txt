r, so the lateral surface of the cylinder is 2 pi r h, meanwhile there's a pi r squared
circle on the top, a pi r squared on the bottom, so this is the sum that will give me the total
surface area of the cylinder, 2 pi r h plus pi r squared plus pi r squared, but again this
isn't just any old h, the h is 2 r, so my cylindrical surface, s sub c is 2 pi r times
2 r, add those 2 pi r squared together, you get a 2 pi r squared, start collecting terms,
you end up with 4 pi r squared from the first spot plus 2 pi r squared all together, 6 pi
r squared, so that's the surface of the cylinder, that's how much paint you need to paint the
cylinder, now remember what Archimedes said is that this is half again the surface of
the sphere, so that's going to generate a formula for the surface of the sphere in this fashion,
you say the surface of the cylinder is the surface of the sphere plus half the surface
of the sphere, as we saw in the previous example that's going to end up being 3 halves of the
surface of the sphere, cross multiply, flip this over, you get that the surface of the
sphere is two thirds of the surface of the cylinder, but we just said that the surface
of the cylinder is 6 pi r squared, so the surface of the sphere is two thirds of that,
which is 4 pi r squared, is that right, you bet, how do we do it, we do it with calculus,
so Archimedes is right on the money, it's really quite an impressive result, in fact
he stated it in a slightly different fashion, which I like, he said the surface of any sphere
is 4 times its greatest circle, that's almost poetry you know there, the surface of any
sphere is 4 times its greatest circle, and what's he mean by that, well if you wanted
the surface say of a basketball, there's a sphere, what's the surface area, how much
paint would you need to paint that, he says slice through this so as to get the greatest
circle, which you know if this were the earth you'd slice it right through at the equator,
so I slice through there, and then imagine pulling that greatest circle out, and putting
it flat, and taking a second, and a third, and a fourth, and what he has proved is the
surface of the sphere, that's this curved surface in three dimensions, is exactly the
sum of those four flat circles, that's quite amazing, not kind of equal to four of them,
but exactly equal to four, the surface of the sphere is 4 pi r squared, that's Archimedes.
Now he says at some point that these properties were all along naturally inherent in the figures
referred to, he didn't create these, they were always part of the spheres he said, but
remained unknown to those who were before my time engaged in the study of geometry, these
properties were always there, but it took Archimedes to see them, so it was an amazing
mathematical legacy, well in the time that remains let me tell you about his death, which
is a famous story that mathematicians revere, this occurs during the siege of Syracuse in
