This is lesson ten. As promised in lesson nine, we will introduce the multiplication of decimals.
But as an extra bonus, added attraction, we'll also do division of decimals.
So this lesson is entitled, Multiplication and Division of Decimals.
Let me go back to something I've said many times. Mathematics is consistent.
We are multiplying the third different type of number. We've multiplied whole numbers.
We've multiplied fractions. Now we're multiplying decimals.
But in all three cases, multiplication is the same.
Digit times digit and place value times place value.
Now the question is, where are the place values? Well, they're determined by the decimal point.
So let's take a look at our first problem. 7.92 times 5.3.
What I've done is multiplied without regard to the decimal points.
In other words, basically 792 times 53.
And in fact, I have my students do that using the lattice multiplication system.
We're not worried about decimal points. The answer is 41976.
The question is, where does the decimal point go?
Rather than coming up with a rule, let's discover through estimation.
I know that 8 times 5 is 40, 8 being close to 7.92, 5 being close to 5.3.
Which possible answer involving 41976 is close to 40?
41976? 41.976? 419.76? Which one of those?
Well, obviously, the decimal point would go after the 1 to give us 41 and 976 1-thousands,
because our answer must be close to 40, since 8 times 5 is 40.
OK, the question now comes about, do we have to do that every single time?
And the answer is no.
The next problem shows us a way to get the location of the decimal point
without having to go through the estimation process.
Let's see. We have 7.92 times 5.3.
We know that the 3 times the 2 is 6.
You'll notice, I'm consistent.
We looked at discovering multiplication whole numbers.
We had 3 times 2.
What place value did it go in?
In fractions, we had 3 times 2.
What place value did it go in?
Now, same thing.
What place value?
Well, we look at the place values.
We're multiplying.
3 times 2.
Digit times digit is 6.
2-1-hundredths times 3-tenths.
Hundreds times tenths is thousands.
The 6 goes into the thousands place.
OK, how does that help us?
Well, let's find out.
Let's take a few examples of multiplication
and see if we come up with a way to ensure
that we know exactly where the decimal point goes.
The next problem involves a whole number,
18 times 3.6.
4, which is close to 3.6, times 18 is 72.
So I expect our answer to be around 72.
Actually, since 4 is more than 3.6,
probably our answer should be a bit less than 72.
Is it 6.48?
Is it 64.8?
Is it 648?
Well, it seems quite obvious that it needs to be 64.8.
Let's use that to discover how we find
the location of the decimal point.
Notice that there is only one decimal place in this problem.
The 6 is in the tenths place.
There is no decimal point, no decimal places in the 18.
So we only have a total of one decimal place.
Therefore, there will only be one decimal place in the answer.
And therefore, we move the decimal point from the back of 648
one place to the left to get us 64.8.
If we use that rule, that is,
count the number of decimal places in the problem
and that's equivalent to the number of decimal places in the answer,
we should always check the reasonable list of that answer
by actually estimating.
So, of course, again, 18 times 4 is 72.
64.8 makes a whole lot of sense
because it is the closest possible answer we could get to 72
given that the digits in our answer are 648.
The next problem is one for you to do.
37.4, 9.6.
Notice that in this problem, the decimal points are lined up.
Do not be fooled by that.
We do not line up decimal points in multiplication.
Why not?
Because multiplication is not counting.
It just happens that in this problem,
both numbers that we're multiplying have one decimal place.
So multiply, figure out where the decimal point goes,
use estimation to ensure that your answer is reasonable,
and then turn the tape back on and we'll go over that answer.
Okay, 37.4 times 9.6.
I multiply 374 times 96 and got 35904.
Now the question is, where does our decimal place go?
One way to look at it, of course,
is that we estimate 37 times 10 is 370.
Our answer could not be 3.5904.
That makes no sense at all.
Our answer could be 35.904?
No, that's not even close to 370.
How about 359.04?
Yes, that's rather close to 370.
How about the last choice there, 3590.4?
Well, that's way too large.
So the correct answer appears to be 359 and 4100.
Again, notice there is one decimal place in the 37.4,
one decimal place in 9.6,
a total of two decimal places.
Therefore, there must be two decimal places.
The answer is 359.04.
Okay, let's take a look at another problem.
4.9 times .38.
In this case, I've done the multiplication for you.
1862, and I multiply 38 times 49.
And there are three choices.
1.862, 18.62, and 186.2.
I want you to stop the tape.
I want you to think about which of those answers must be correct.
And when you start the tape up again,
we'll see if your answer is right.
Well, again, 4.9 is pretty close to 5.
.38, well, let's see, .3 is a fraction.
So the answer has to be a bit less than 5.
Okay, so could it be 18?
Could it be 186?
I don't think so.
1.862 is obviously a correct answer.
Again, 4.9 has one decimal place.
.38 has two decimal places.
All together, that gives us three decimal places.
And there must be three decimal places in the answer.
We start at the extreme right after the last digit
and move decimal point 1, 2, 3 places between the 1 and the 8
and we get 1 and 862 thousandths.
And that is our introduction to the multiplication of decimals.
Let's take a look at division.
Now, the first problem we see here is .3 divided into 7.44.
Let's think about what the meaning of division is.
Division is the opposite of multiplication.
What we're asking ourselves is .3 times what equals 7?
That is, if we're going to divide the 3 into the 7, .3 times what equals 7?
Okay, now, what if I simply said, breaking it up, .3 is 3 tenths.
7 is 7 ones.
Remember, we multiply digit times digit and place value times place value.
3 times what whole number is 7?
Well, let's see.
Pretty close to 2, right?
3 times 2 is 6.
3 times 3 is too large.
The place value, 1 tenth times what is 1?
Well, 1 tenth times 10 is 1, which would mean that the 2 we get by dividing 3 into 7
would go into 10's place.
That may seem a bit confusing, as it should be.
There's got to be an easier way to do this.
And the easier way is quite obvious.
What we need to do is change the number we're dividing by, the divisor, into a whole number.
Move that decimal point to make it, the number itself, a whole number,
as move it to the back of the number.
So you'll notice we took the decimal point in .3 and moved it one place.
We also needed to do the same thing to the number we're dividing into.
We took the decimal point between the 7 and the 4 and moved it one place to the right
between the 4 and the 4.
The reason for this, if we look at the division problem as a fraction,
a fraction and division problem of the same thing, we have 7.44 in the numerator
and .3 in the denominator.
What we did when we moved that decimal point from .3 to make it 3 point was to multiply by 10.
We know from operating with fractions, if we multiply the denominator by 10,
we must multiply the numerator by 10, and therefore 7.44 becomes 74.4.
We really don't have to worry about the multiplication of 10.
I just wanted to show this to you.
The key thing is we move the decimal point to the back of the number we're dividing by.
As many places as we move that decimal point, we do the same thing in the number we're dividing into.
Once we've done that, we place our decimal point above the decimal point in the number we're dividing by.
That is, we place the decimal point for the answer above it, and we simply divide.
The answer will be correct.
Of course, we need to check using our estimation skills.
Let's take a look at a problem.
We have 7.44 divided by .3.
That's the problem we just started with, but now we're going to actually divide it using this method.
The first thing we do is we move the decimal point from the front of the 3 to the back of 3,
making the .3 into 3 1s.
Now, we take and do the same thing in 7.44.
We move the decimal point one place to the right, placing it between the 4 and the 4,
and immediately put the decimal point in the answer above it, and then we divide.
3 goes into 7, 2 times.
2 times 3 is 6.
We subtract.
We bring down.
3 goes into 14, 4 times.
4 times 3 is 12.
We subtract.
We bring down.
And 3 goes into 24 exactly 8 times.
Giving us an answer of 24.8.
And now we need to check our answer.
There are two ways we can do this.
One is using our estimation skills and our knowledge of division by fractions.
We're dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by a reciprocal.
We are dividing by 3 tenths.
Dividing by 3 tenths is the same as multiplying by 10 thirds.
And 10 thirds is pretty close to 3.
So we're going to multiply 7 by 3.
We'll get 21.
So our answer should be around 21 and certainly 24.8 qualifies.
The other way we can check this is to simply multiply our answer 24.8 times 0.3 and see
if we get 7.44.
It should not be surprising that indeed if we do that multiplication, we get 7 and 44.100.
The answer is correct.
Now let's go ahead and take a look at some problems that will show us various types of
problems in which we divide using decimals.
The first problem is 0.19 divided into 0.684.
The very first thing we must do is move the decimal point in 0.19 to make it a whole number.
We move it two places to the right.
And now we must do the same thing to the number we're dividing into.
We move the decimal point in 0.684 two places to the right, making it now 68.4.
Having done that, we put the decimal point in the answer immediately above the decimal
point in 68.4.
Now we can divide.
Our division skills should allow us to divide and we wind up with an answer of 3.6.
Notice we multiplied, we subtracted, we brought down until we used up all our digits.
We had a remainder of zero.
Our answer is 3.63 and 6 tenths.
Again, does that make sense?
Well, let's see.
We have 0.684 divided by 0.19.
Well, 0.684 is close to 1.
0.19 is fairly small fraction.
We divide a larger fraction by a smaller fraction.
We should get a number greater than one.
We got 3.6, which is certainly greater than one.
A more accurate way to check this, of course, would be to multiply 1.19 times 3.6.
And you shouldn't be surprised.
We get 684.1.
Multiplying the answer by the divisor should give us the number we're dividing into.
And it does, and therefore we know we're correct.
So the best way to check is through multiplication.
The next problem is for you to do.
2.5 divided into 7.
Turn the tape off.
Do the best you can at dividing this problem.
Check your answer and come on back and we'll take a look at how I would do it.
Well, the first problem you might have had is that there's no decimal point in 7.
But we know where it goes.
7 is a whole number.
It's in the ones place.
The decimal point goes after the 7 because it separates the ones place from the 10th place.
The next problem you have is, OK, I moved the decimal point in 2.5, one place to the right.
How do I move the decimal point in a whole number?
Well, it's very simple.
You move it to one place and put a 0 in there.
You can always put a 0.
Remember, 7 is the same as 7 and 0 tenths.
And when I move the decimal point one place to the right, the 7 becomes a 70.
So instead of dividing 2.5 into 7, I'm dividing 25 into 70.
And I divide 25 goes into 70 twice.
I multiply 2 times 25 and get 50.
I subtract and I get 20.
So now what do I do?
I have nothing left to bring down.
That's the wonderful thing about dividing decimals is that once you're to the right of the decimal point,
you can put in as many zeros as you please.
So you'll notice I put a 0 in.
I brought it down.
The 20 becomes 200.
And now I can divide 25 into 200.
I get 8.
8 times 25 is 200.
I subtract.
I get 0.
So there's no need for any additional zeros.
My answer is 2.8.
And again, I could check that very quickly.
Multiplying 2.8 by 2.5, I get exactly 7.0.
OK, so that should check by multiplying.
OK, let's take a look at another problem.
This next problem is 2.9 divided into 4.6.
And as you can see on the visual, we put a bunch of zeros in.
Now you could put a whole bunch of zeros in and the ones you don't need.
You can erase or you can put them in one at a time.
When we divide, we move this a point one place to the right in 2.9.
We also move the decimal point one place to the right in 4.6.
And now we have 29 divided into 46, which goes once.
1 times 29 is 29.
We subtract.
We get 17.
And now we need to have those zeros after the decimal point to bring down so we can complete our division problem.
We bring down the zero.
We get 170.
OK, how many 29s in 170?
Well, 5 times 29 is as close as we can come.
5 times 29 is 145.
And 145 is subtracted from 170, giving us 25.
Well, we can't leave it there, so we bring down another zero.
Remember, we can put as many zeros as we need to to the right of the decimal point.
Well, how many 29s are there in 250?
There are eight.
8 times 29 is 232.
We subtract.
We get 18.
Again, we're not done.
We bring down another zero.
How many 29s in 180?
Well, it goes in six times.
We subtract 180 minus 174.
We get six.
Why didn't I bring down another zero?
Very simple.
I'm getting tired of doing this.
And I realize this could go on forever.
And in most cases, why do I need to have decimals to the 10,000s or 100,000s or millions place?
Now, if I'm dealing with very fine measurements, or perhaps if I was a paramecium living in a microscopic world,
I would be concerned about very, very small place values.
But for example, let's say all I really cared about was the 100th place.
Why go any further?
And in fact, I won't, because at this point we're going to introduce the notion of rounding off.
In decimal division problems, they could go on forever.
We don't have forever to do one problem.
So we might as well stop and round off to a convenient place value.
I chose to round off to the 100th place.
So we have the number 1.586.
If we want to round off to the 100th place, notice I put a backwards L between the eight and the six.
I put that backwards L, it's a little marker I use, right behind the place to which I want to round off.
And I always divide to one more place.
That's why I stop with the six.
Very simple.
I look at the six.
If that number is five or more, five, six, seven, eight, or nine,
I then add one in the place to which I want to round off.
If the number in that last place, the one I'm looking at is less than five, zero, one, two, three, or four, I just forget it.
In this case, the six is five or more.
So I add one to the 100th place and it becomes 1.59 and that's the rounded off answer.
So if you said what is 2.9 divided into 4.6 rounded to the 100th place, I would say the answer is 1.59.
What I'd like you to do next is to look at these numbers.
There are four numbers and I like all of them rounded off to the 100th place.
Notice the little arrows there indicating we're going to round off and I'm telling you I wanted to round off the 100th place.
So you'll notice that all the numbers go out to the 1000th place.
Any digits beyond the 1000th place we would not be concerned about.
So stop the tape and round off each of those numbers to the best of your ability to the 100th place.
Okay, let's see.
Notice that in each of those numbers I put a marker after the 100th place.
2.694 is four, five or more or less than five.
It's less than five, I forget it, and therefore I rounded off to 2.69.
In the second number, 37.907, the seven in the 1000th place is five or more.
So I add one and get 37.91.
The third one is a little bit trickier.
12.498, the number in the 1000th place is more than five.
It's actually five or more.
It's eight.
I round off by adding one, but when I add one to the nine, I get 10.
I put down a zero, carry the one.
So I wound up rounding off to 12.50, 12 and 50, 100ths.
In the last of the four problems, 30.995, there's a five in the 1000th place,
which is five or more.
I add one, but when I add one to the nine, I get 10.
I put down a zero and carry the one, but the one plus the other nine is also 10.
And ultimately I wound up rounding off 30.995 to 31.00.
Okay.
Why did I choose to round off to the 100ths place?
Very good reason.
The reason is that, again, as we said in the previous lesson, one of the more important things in life is money,
and money comes in dollars and cents, and cents is rounded off to the 100ths place.
So the next little problem we have here shows us, let's assume that our bank figured out the interest
that we're going to pay us on our savings account.
And later on we'll talk about interest and those kind of things.
We have 17.7349 dollars.
Unfortunately, we can't figure out what that four and the nine mean because our money system only goes to cents.
We don't have fractions of a penny.
So we make a mark after the 100ths place.
Even though the numbers go out to the 10,000ths place, we disregard the 10,000ths place.
We don't look at the nine.
We only look at the number and the place immediately following the place to which we want to round off.
And that is the four, which is in the 1,000ths place.
Is that five or more or less than five?
It's less than five, so we forget it, and we round it to dollars and cents to 17 dollars and 73 cents.
Another very interesting use of rounding off is in baseball.
I'm a very big baseball fan.
And one of the things we look at for batters is their batting average, which actually is not an average.
It's a decimal fraction.
It's the fraction of the times other at bats that the batter got a hit.
And I don't want to get to all the ramifications of how you figure batting average.
Perhaps someday, Teaching Company will do a tape called Understanding Baseball, and we'll talk about that.
But right now, the idea is that we do want to round off.
And the reason is, let's assume a batter batted 611 times.
Obviously, a batter who played every day towards the end of the season and had 197 hits, which is quite good.
Well, as you see on the screen, that batting average would be .322, 4222586.
Sounds like a pretty good batting average, except we always do batting averages to the thousands place,
with one exception that I'll talk about shortly.
So what are we going to do?
We're going to round off.
And notice we could care less about all the places except the one that's in the place immediately following the place to which we want to round off.
In this case, we want to round off to the thousands place.
So we look at the ten thousands place.
Once again, we have a 4.
That 4 is less than 5.
We disregard it, and the batter's batting average is .322.
Or we say he's batting 322.
Now, what is that one time we don't round off to the thousands place?
Well, at the end of the season, in each of the two leagues, the winning batting average is determined.
Well, on a few occasions, it turned out that two batters had the exact same batting average when rounded off to the thousands place.
Perhaps one had .3224, and the other one had .3217.
But we didn't know that because we rounded off.
They both had .322.
They were batting 322.
One of those players had to be chosen as the outstanding hitter in that league.
That's when they go to the ten thousands place.
And the batter who was batting .3224, let's say, would win out over the batter who was batting .3217.
I know of no circumstance where they've ever had to go to the hundred thousands place.
But perhaps someday they will.
Maybe if they play more games.
But the fact is that rounding off after you divide it is a very important skill.
Let's go ahead and go to the whiteboard and do one division problem just to be sure we know we're doing.
And we'll also see about rounding off.
And here's the problem.
We're going to divide .25 into 6.5.
Divide that first and then we'll discuss rounding off once we get the answers.
Stop the tape.
Come back when you've done the computation.
Okay.
The first thing we need to do is move the decimal point one, two places to the back of our divisor.
If we move the decimal point two places in the divisor, we must also move it two places inside.
The number we're dividing into.
By the way, sometimes called the dividend.
We have a blank space.
Well, as we indicated, we need a zero to fill that space.
Now we're dividing 25 into 650.
25 goes into 65 two times.
Two times 25 is 50.
We subtract and we get 15.
We bring down the zero.
We have 150 and 25 goes into 150 exactly six times.
Six times 25 is 150 and we stop.
Notice we should have put a decimal point up here.
I guess in anticipation of knowing the answer was a whole number.
I did not, but really it should be the decimal point should be placed above the decimal point in the dividend.
And we have the whole number 26.
How would I round that off?
I could always round it off to the 10s place.
Let's say I wanted to know to the nearest 10 what the answer was.
And the answer of course would be we look over here in the ones place.
This is five or more.
I'd add one and the answer rounded off to the nearest 10s is 30.
Well, we've seen how to multiply and divide decimals.
We multiply and divide decimals exactly the same as we multiply and divide it whole numbers.
The consistency of mathematics, digit times digit and place value times place value is the key to understanding that.
Now we're ready to go on to lesson 11 in which we'll see how to use the calculator.
In fact, a very special calculator to do whole number fraction and decimal problems.
We'll see you there.
