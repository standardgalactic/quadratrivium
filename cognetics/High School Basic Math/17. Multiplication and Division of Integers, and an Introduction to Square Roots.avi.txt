Welcome to Lesson 17.
We will learn about multiplying and dividing integers.
We'll also get introduced to square roots.
We've already seen how to add and subtract integers.
Now let's take a look at a few examples
to see if we can discover a pattern
that will help us multiply integer numbers.
We see positive 3 times positive 4 equals positive 12.
All that is saying is that 3 times 4 is 12.
We knew that already.
Again, positive 3 and positive 4 can be treated the same
as the number 3 or 4.
Positive 3 times negative 4.
Well, that means 3 negative 4 is added.
Multiplication is repeated addition.
Negative 4 plus negative 4 plus negative 4.
Well, that's negative 12.
So a positive 3 times negative 4 is negative 12.
The question is, what has happened if I multiply by a negative?
Well, again, this next visual shows us
the positive 3 times the negative 4 is negative 12.
And then if we reverse the order of the multiplication,
negative 4 times a positive 3 is also negative 12.
We know that in multiplication,
the order of multiplying doesn't make a difference.
So if we reverse the order, the answer will be the same.
So if negative 4 times positive 3 is negative 12,
let's use that to try to discover
what multiplying by a negative means.
Imagine covering up the negative side in negative 4.
4 times a positive 3 would be positive 12.
Yet negative 4 times positive 3 is negative 12.
It appears that multiplying by a negative
means multiply and change the sign, get the opposite sign.
So therefore, what would negative 3 times negative 4 be?
Well, 3 times negative 4 is negative 12.
And therefore, negative 3 times negative 4
would be the opposite of that or positive 12.
So there are two possible ways to remember the rules
for multiplying integers.
You could simply say that a positive times a positive
is a positive and a positive times a negative is a negative
and a negative times a positive is a negative
and a negative times a negative is a positive.
That's a mouthful.
Or you could simply say if the signs are the same,
the answer is positive.
If the signs are opposite, the answer is negative.
But this conflicts with the addition rule
and sometimes people get confused about that.
I just simply say when I multiply by a positive,
I keep the sign.
And when I multiply by a negative,
I multiply and change the sign.
To me, that makes a whole lot of sense.
Let's take a look at some division problems.
Negative 24 divided by negative 6.
Now, what does that mean?
Well, it says what times negative 6 is negative 24?
What times a negative is a negative?
A positive times a negative is a negative.
And what times 6 is 24?
Four times 6.
And therefore, the missing number is a positive 4.
Negative 32 divided by positive 4 is the next problem.
Positive 4 times what number is negative 32?
But the same process, the answer is negative 8.
The next problem, positive 30 divided by negative 5.
Negative 5 times what is positive 30?
Well, the negative times a negative is a positive,
so the answer must be negative 6.
And the final problem we look at,
positive 45 divided by positive 9 is positive 5.
Positive 30 divided by negative 5 is negative 6.
Negative 32 divided by positive 4 is negative 8.
And negative 24 divided by negative 6 is positive 4.
What do you notice about these division problems?
Well, the rule for division is the same as the rule for multiplication.
If you're dividing by a negative, divide and change the sign.
If you're dividing by a positive, divide and keep the sign.
So, as we said before, multiplication and division are quite similar.
And therefore, the rules for dividing integers really is the same as the rules
for multiplying integers.
Now we know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide integers.
We need to work some problems to ensure we understand how we're going to apply
the order of operations to that problem.
So, at this time, let's go take a look at a problem.
As you can see, the problem is negative 8 times parentheses negative 4
minus a positive 7, close parentheses, plus a negative 12 divided by a positive 3.
The order of operations rules, P-E-M-D-A-S, still applies.
Notice there's no exponents here, so we'll just worry about P-M-D-A-S.
We'll do parentheses, we'll multiply and we'll divide before we add and subtract.
So, looking at the problem, what's the first thing we need to do?
We need to do the parentheses.
The parentheses is a subtraction problem.
But remember, we previously said we will never subtract integers,
so we change the sign of the second number.
The positive 7 becomes a negative 7, and we change the problem to addition.
So, on the second line, it's the only change we've made.
Everything else remains the same.
Now that we have an integer addition problem in the parentheses, we can do that.
A negative 4 plus a negative 7 is a negative 11.
So, we have negative 8 times negative 11 plus a negative 12 divided by a positive 3.
What do we do next?
Well, we're going to multiply and divide before we add,
and since the multiplication is at the left, we'll multiply negative 8 times negative 11.
A negative times a negative, we multiply and change the sign.
8 times 11 is 88.
We change the negative to a positive, positive 88.
Now, notice we also did the division problem,
and the reason we can do that is because the multiplication and division problem
was separated by adding, and it's almost like in previous lesson
where we had a parentheses that was separated from another parentheses.
They were independent. We could work it that way.
So, this is certainly legitimate.
We divided negative 12 by positive 3.
Dividing by a positive 3, 12 divided by 3 is 4,
and dividing by a positive does not change the sign,
so negative 12 divided by a positive 3 is negative 4.
We have a positive 88 plus a negative 4.
The addition rule says take the sign of a larger, which is positive,
subtract 88 minus 4, and the answer to that problem is positive 84.
Okay.
On the screen, you now see two more problems, two different problems.
Write the problems down, work them,
and the way I like to see them worked is ask yourself,
what do I do first and justify it?
What do I do next?
What do I do next until you get down to your answer?
Then do the same thing for the second problem,
and you're all done.
Come on back and we'll walk through these two problems
to ensure that you understand about the order of operations with integers.
The first problem, negative 3 minus a positive 6 times a negative 2
divided by a positive 4 minus a negative 4,
the question is what shall we do first?
Well, we'll need to multiply first,
because we always multiply and divide before we add subtract,
and the multiplication problem is to the left.
So positive 6 times negative 2 is a negative 12,
and as you see on the second line,
everything else has remained the same.
What do we do next?
We divide before we subtract,
so we must do negative 12 divided by a positive 4,
dividing by a positive 4, you divide by 4,
and leave the sign alone.
So negative 12 divided by a positive 4 is negative 3.
We now have negative 3 minus a negative 3 minus a negative 4.
We never subtract integers.
We change the sign of the second number and add.
Subtracting a negative 3 becomes adding a positive 3.
Subtracting a negative 4 becomes adding a positive 4.
And now we're left with an addition problem.
And since there's only three numbers to add,
we might as well just add left to right.
Negative 3 plus a positive 3 is 0.
When you're adding opposites, you get 0.
0 plus positive 4, of course, is positive 4,
which is our final answer.
How about the second problem?
In the second problem, we have two separate parentheses.
We can operate in each one.
In the first parentheses, what do I do first?
I multiply before I add.
Negative 8 times negative 2 is positive 16.
In the second parentheses, I again multiply before I add,
so positive 4 times negative 5 is a negative 20.
And now I have two parentheses separated by a division symbol.
In each parentheses, I'm adding.
So I add in the parentheses before I divide,
because I always do parentheses first.
Positive 16 plus a negative 4 is positive 12.
Positive 2 plus a negative 20 is negative 18.
Positive 12 divided by negative 18, I cannot do that.
18 cannot be divided into 12.
It's too large.
So what do I do?
I can write it as a fraction.
Negative 12 divided by 18 is negative 12 over 18.
Except I have positive 12 divided by negative 18.
And of course, you could put the negative in either place,
because positive 12 divided by negative 18 would give me
the same answer as negative 12 divided by positive 18.
In either case, I would get negative 12, 18.
Of course, I would never leave a fractional answer like that,
because I can reduce by dividing top and bottom by 6.
And I get negative 2 thirds, which is the final answer.
So even though we're talking about integers,
we snuck a little fractional problem in on you.
All right, we've looked at a couple of problems.
And again, if you did not get them right,
go back and take a look at them again,
work them through on your own,
and then replay the part of the tape,
where I go step by step through the solution.
Because what we're going to do now
is enter the world of square roots.
What is a square root?
Well, just as we know that when we add,
we could always subtract that.
We know it at 8 plus 2 is 10.
We know that 10 minus 2 is 8.
If we can multiply, we also can divide.
5 times 4 is 20.
20 divided by 4 is 5.
What do we do when we have a number that's squared?
For example, 6 squared is 36.
And we want to go backwards.
We want to do the reverse.
We want to say what number squared is 36?
Now, we know that's 6.
What we want to know is if I have 36
and I squared a number to get it,
what did I square?
Well, rather than coming up with a whole bunch of fancy words,
we call that the square root.
And the symbol looks like a division symbol
with a little extra piece on the front.
The square root of 36 is 6.
As you can see on the screen,
that's identical to saying that 6 squared,
or 6 to the second power, is 36.
Similarly, since 10 squared is 100,
the square root of 100 is 10.
So the square root is simply the opposite procedure to square it.
The same as division is the opposite procedure to multiplication.
And subtraction is the opposite procedure to addition.
Where did they get that funny-looking symbol?
Well, it actually goes back to the Middle Ages,
and the fact that most mathematics done in Europe was done in Latin.
And the word for root in Latin, and I'm no linguist,
but I'm told is radix, R-A-D-I-X.
I guess that's when we get the word radish,
which, of course, is a vegetable.
It's a root.
And the R in radix was drawn to look as you see on the screen.
And from that funny-looking R grew the square root symbol.
And if that's not true, it sounds like a good story anyway.
But the fact is that symbol, by the way, is called a radical.
And when we have something in the radical,
it is we're taking the square root of that number.
So again, if I said what's the square root of 49,
you would say, really, what squared is 49?
7 times 7 is 49.
Therefore, the square root of 49 is 7.
What I want to do now is an interesting exercise
in pattern recognition talking about square roots.
If you look on the screen, you'll see two columns of numbers.
The first column says numbers, the number ends in.
And we have the digits 0 through 9.
All numbers end in one of those 10 digits.
The second column says it's square ends in.
If we square a number that ends in 0, that number ends in 0.
If I square a number that ends in 4, that number ends in 6.
And so on and so forth down that column.
Now, what I'd like you to do is stop the tape
after I give you these instructions
and write down the numbers 0 through 9.
And that column will be the number ends in.
And in the second column, I want you to write the square root ends in.
And then look at the answers that are on the screen
and use those to figure out what the square root ends in.
And when you've listed those endings,
and you may get a little frustrated, but that's okay,
come on back to the tape and you'll see what my list looks like.
I think the frustration comes about when you try to find
if I have a number that ends in 2, what's its square root end in?
If you look at the original table we had,
there is no number which when squared has a square number that ends in 2.
That is, if a number ends in 2,
it was not created by multiplying a number by itself.
The same is true for 3 and 7 and 8.
If you look at the table you see now on the screen,
you can see that if a number ends in 0,
and if it is a square number,
not all numbers that end in 0 are square,
but if it is a square number, its square root will end in 0.
If a number ends in 1, and if it is a square number,
its square root will end in 1 or 9,
since 9 times 9 ends in 1 as well as 1 times 1 ends in 1.
2 and 3 with a big X.
If a number ends in 2 or 3, it cannot be a square number.
If a number ends in 4, its square root could end in 2 or 8.
If a number ends in 5, and if it is a square number,
its square root will end in 5.
If a number ends in 6, and it is a square number,
its square root must end in 4 or 6.
Again, a big X for 7 and 8,
because if a number ends in 7 or 8, it cannot be a square number.
If a number ends in 9, and it's a square number,
its square root will be 3 or 7.
Keep talking about if a number is a square number.
Are there numbers that are not square numbers?
We'll think back to the first lesson,
and we looked at physical representations of multiplication,
and we saw that we could represent 12 as 4 times 6,
I'm sorry, 4 times 3, 2 times 6, and 1 times 12.
Those were all rectangular arrays, we said.
None of them was squared.
We looked at 9, we saw that 9 was 3 times 3.
12 is not a square number.
9 is a square number.
So let's take a look at why a number is not square
and what sort of square root it might have.
We look at the square root of 11.
If you have a calculator with a square root button
and you press the square root of 11,
it'll give you something that looks like 3.31662479.
And the question I ask is that the square root of 11?
If it is, then when you multiply 3.31662479,
by itself you'll get exactly 11.
Or if you like 11.0000 or all zeros, well, that's impossible.
Because as you can see, if I multiply the number that ends in 9,
and by itself, which of course ends in 9,
the answer I get the last decimal place will have a 1 in it,
not a 0.
So it turns out that there is no number that I can multiply
by itself and get 11.
That is, there's no number I can write.
Remember we talked about those decimals
that kept going around in circles, that repeating decimals.
Well, this is a decimal, the square root of 11,
that goes on forever and does not repeat.
It goes on forever and therefore we cannot write it as a fraction.
This is a number, the square root of 11, that's called irrational.
Ir meaning not, notice the word ratio in that.
Irrational means a number that cannot be written
as the ratio of two integers.
We cannot write the square root of 11 as a whole number or a fraction.
It can't be a whole number because you see 3 times 3 is 9
and 4 times 4 is 16 and 11 is some place in between.
It can't be a fraction number, 3 point something,
that is one that terminates a rational number,
because, or one that repeats if you will,
because we saw that we multiplied a rational number by itself,
we'll wind up with some number that has decimal place numbers in it.
It will not be 11, so the square root of 11 exists.
It is a number, some place between 3 and 4.
It's very close to 3.31662479, but not precisely that number.
And it is irrational.
Okay, now I want you to stop and think and decide
why the square root of 8 is irrational.
So stop and think and express in words or symbols
why the square root of 8 is not a rational number.
Well, 8 falls between two square numbers, 4 and 9.
2 times 2 is 4, 3 times 3 is 9.
The square root of 8 times the square root of 8 is 8.
Now, it can't be a whole number
because there is no whole number between 2 and 3.
It cannot be a fraction or decimal number
because any fraction or decimal number between 2 and 3,
which when multiplied by itself will give us a number,
a mixed number, will not give us the whole number 8.
And the square root of 8 exists.
It is a number between 2 and 3, but it is not a rational number.
It is not a number we can write as the ratio of two integers.
Okay, so we know about irrational numbers.
We know about square numbers.
We also know about endings.
If we have a square number, for example, that ends in 6,
we know that its square root must end in 6 or possibly 4.
We need one more fact, and then we'll be able to find
square roots on our own without a calculator.
You may say, well, why not simply use a calculator?
Because I like my students to understand
what they're doing on the calculator
and not be blindly loyal to the calculator's answers.
So next, we're going to look at what I call round square numbers.
What is a round square number?
A round square number is a number that ends in zero
or a bunch of zeros and is square.
So 10 times 10 is 100.
100 is a round square number.
The square root of 100 is 10.
20 times 20 gives us the next round square number 400.
And we have the square root of 400 is 20.
So given that the square root of 100 is 10
and the square root of 400 is 20,
I want you to make a list of the next eight round square numbers
with their square roots.
So for example, the first number you'd have on your list
would be the square root of 100 is 10
and the square root of 400 is 20.
And I'd like you to figure out the next eight round square numbers
and their square roots.
Try to do that.
Come on back and we'll take a look at what the answer should be.
Well, the next round square number is 900.
It's 30 times 30 is 900.
The square root of 900 is 30.
And you see on the screen, the square root of 1600 is 40.
The square root of 2500 is 50.
The square root of 3600 is 60.
The square root of 4900 is 70.
The square root of 6400 is 80.
The square root of 8100 is 90.
And the square root of 10,000 is 100.
So there are our first 10 round square numbers.
How are we going to use this?
Well, let's find out.
Let's do an example.
We want to find the square root of 2025.
Now, what do I know about?
I know it has to be a two-digit number
because it cannot be a one-digit number.
The largest one-digit number 9 times 9 is 81.
And certainly 2025 is much more than 81.
Its square root cannot be a three-digit number
because the smallest three-digit number is 100
and 100 times 100 is 10,000, which is much more than 2025.
So we know it's a two-digit number if 2025 is a square number.
What do we know about it?
Well, we know that 2025 is between two round square numbers.
It's greater than 1,600 and it's less than 2,500,
which means its square root must be between 40 and 50.
Now, we know that all the numbers between
and between means not including between 40 and 50.
All those numbers have a four in the tens place.
So we know that if the square root of 2025 is a rational number,
in fact, it'll be a whole number.
It will be 40-something.
We also know that 2025 ends in five.
And from our first table, we know that if a number ends in five
and if it has a square root, its square root must end in five.
Well, the only number in the 40s that ends in five is 45.
And if we multiply 45 times 45, we get 2025,
which tells us that the square root of 2025 is 45.
Let's take a look at another square root problem,
the square root of 4096.
Again, if the number is greater than 81 and less than 10,000,
if it has a square root, it will have a two-digit square root.
We know that 4096 falls between 3,600 and 4,900,
the two round square numbers,
which means the square root of 4096 is between 60 and 70.
That is, if the square root exists, it's 60-something.
Since 4096 ends in six, its square root ends in either four or six,
which means it's either 64 or 66.
If we multiply 66 times 66, we get 4,356.
Notice it ends in six, and it's between 3,600 and 4,900,
but it's not the number we want.
64 times 64, well, that is 4096,
which means that the square root of 4096 is 64.
Now, I'd like you to do one.
The square root of 2,187.
I'd like you to stop the tape and use our procedures
to come up with what is the square root of 2,187.
Please do that now.
Hopefully, it didn't take you very long to do this problem
because 2,187 ends in a seven.
Since it ends in a seven, it cannot have a nice square root.
Its square root is irrational.
Remember, any number that ends in two, three, seven, or eight
cannot be a square number,
and will have an irrational square root.
Okay?
Here's one more for you to do.
The square root of 7,529.
Let's go ahead and do this together
because I think this will show us the one last type of problem
that you may be confronted with,
and then when we have a chance,
we'll do one problem that you can do on your own.
Well, we know it's between 6,400 and 8,100,
which means its square root is between 80 and 90,
so it's 80-something.
Since it ends in nine, its square root must end in three or nine.
Is it 83 or 87?
Well, 83 times 83 is 6,889.
As Goldilocks would say, that's too small.
87 times 87 is 7,569, close but too large.
Since those are the only two possible rational numbers
that could be the square root of 7,529,
what that tells us is that 7,529 does not have a rational square root.
Its square root is irrational.
Now, I'll go ahead and give you one quick problem to do.
Let's go ahead and do the square root of 1,024.
Use our two tables to discover what this is,
and when you've got the answer, come on back
and we'll see if it's correct.
1,024 is between 900 and 1,600,
which means if 1,024 has a square root, it's going to be 30-something.
Since it ends in four, it's either going to be 32 or 38.
If you multiply 32 times 32, you would have gotten 1,024.
So the square root of 1,024 is 32, and hopefully you got that answer.
Let's go ahead and talk about what we've learned in lesson 17.
We learned how to multiply and divide integers.
We saw that when we multiply or divide,
if we're multiplying or dividing by a positive,
that sign does not change.
If we're multiplying or dividing by a negative,
that sign does change.
We also saw how we could apply the rules of the order of operations
to problems involving a multi-step situation
in terms of adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing integers,
including parentheses.
We worked some of those problems.
We also introduced the notion of square root.
Square root is nothing more than the opposite operation,
the opposite of square root.
If 8 squared is 64, then the square root of 64 is 8.
We also saw a method for getting a better understanding about square roots.
I would suggest that normally, when you want to find a square root,
you either know it, like for example,
you might know that the square root of 25 is 5, or use a calculator.
But certainly, this was an interesting exercise
in terms of what a square root might be.
We finally saw what an irrational number was,
a number, for example, the square root of 8,
that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers.
The number exists, but it does not exist as a nice simple fraction
or what's called a terminating or repeating decimal.
In lesson 18, we're going to proceed
and learn about fractional and negative powers
and see how that affects numbers.
We'll look for you in lesson 18.
