Welcome to Lesson 13. In this lesson, we'll look at and discuss different types of problems
involving percents. Many of those problems, we problems that we face as citizens every
day. But first, we've got to look at what a percentage problem is. Obviously, a percentage
problem is a problem that involves a percent, but they have a very basic structure. And
as we see in the first visual, what we have is three numbers. Blank percent of blank is
blank. Two of those three blanks are filled in, and our job in the problem is to find
the number in the missing blank. Okay? The blank is not filled in. And since there are
three blanks, we have basically three types of problems. And over the years, I've developed
a very unique numbering system for the three types of problems. I call them type one, type
two, and type three, very ingenious. And once we see what each type of problem looks like,
we'll be able to see how to find the solution. And then we'll take a look at some problems
that will use those methods of solution to come up with an answer that may be important
to us in terms of a purchase or paying tax or getting a commission or reading a survey
or what have you. We'll discuss that later on in this lesson. I should also warn you
that in a future lesson, we'll look at an alternative way to solve some of these percentage
problems. So when you're all through there, you'll have a number of methods to solve percentage
problems. As mentioned in the previous lesson, percents are probably the most used type of
fractions. When you look at a newspaper, you see something like 83% of the population favors
whatever they favor. Or you see an ad that says all red tagged items, 25% off. Or if
you're a parent, you're told that your child is in the 90th percent dial in some achievement
test or intelligence test. You have to be in the top 10% of your graduating class to
be even looked at by some college. We see percents all the time. We get percent interest.
We pay percent interest so that all around us are percent problems. This lesson is designed
to ensure that you know how to do those. Let's take a look at a type one problem. A type
one problem is one in which the is number is missing. The is number is missing. And we
should look, here's a type one problem, 12% of 45 is what? We should understand that the
word of means to multiply. And the word is is equals. So two plus two is four, two plus
two equals four. So all we need to do now, of course, is to change the word of to multiply
and change the word is equals. And we have a mathematics problem point 12 times 45 equals
blank. Now we know how to multiply decimals. So what I'd like you to do is stop the tape
and without the use of a calculator by hand multiply point 12 times 45. And that will
be the answer to this type one problem. And when you have your answer, turn the tape back
on. All right, we can see that point 12 times 45 turns out to be 5.4. Therefore 12% of 45
is 5.4. You may notice that 12% is relatively close to 10%. Right. And 10% of 45 could be
say 12 to 10% of 50. 10% is one 10th 10 out of 100. And one 10 to 50 is five. So our answer
should be around five. So once again, we can use our estimation skills to ensure that our
answer is correct. So basically 5.4 being close to five makes a whole lot of sense. Okay.
The second type of problem type 2 is of the type shown here 48 is blank percent of 64.
I should mention that there are two ways of writing this notice here the percent comes
after the is in the first problem we had 12% of 45 is we could have said 45 is 12% of what
two ways of writing the sense. Okay. 48 is what percent of 64? Well, let's see. Basically
the way we do that is we try to change a fraction to a percent. What is the fraction? That is
48 out of 64 notice the obviously 48 out of 64 is equivalent to what percent? Well, how
would I write 48 out of 64? As a fraction 48 over 64. So the method of solving a type
2 problem is is over of times 100 over one. In this case 48 64 times 100 over one. Now
we're back to multiplying fractions. You know how to multiply fractions. So I'd like you
to multiply this out, simplify your answer, cancel if you can, and come up with an answer
that is a percent. Just as we did in lesson 12, we changed a fraction to a percent by
multiplying by 100 over one. And when you have your answer, come on back. Alright, let's
say we multiplied the fraction 48 64ths by 100 over one. We were able to cancel. We could
cancel the 48 and the 64 that reduced to three fourths. And we noticed that four goes into
125 times. We canceled the four and 100 getting one and 25. Three times 25 is 75 over one.
We recognize immediately that's a whole number 75. But remember it's a percent. So therefore
48 is 75% of 64. Okay, if you don't believe that, we sorted 48 over 64 was three fourths.
And we know that three fourths is equal to 75%. If you don't sure about that, think about
it, three fourths of a dollar, three quarters is 75 cents. And a lot of times thinking about
cents and percent makes it understandable. So the answer, of course, is 75%, not 75. We
must write it as a percent. It must be obvious what is missing in the type three problem because
in the type one problem, the is number was missing. In the type two problem, the percent
number was missing. So the type three, the of number must be missing. And here's an example
of a type three problem. 8% of what is 32.4? The of number is missing. How do we translate
this into a mathematical problem? Well, of means to multiply. So the question is 8% times
what equals 32.4? How do we do a missing multiply a problem? We've seen this before. We divide.
The multiplier we have into the number we're trying to get that is we divide 8% into 32.4.
But we haven't learned how to divide by percent. In fact, we haven't learned how to multiply
with percents. We always change the percent to a decimal. Why learn a whole new process
when it's just as easy to change that percent to a decimal? And this case divide. So what
we're going to do is we're going to take 32.4 and divide it by 0.08. Well, this is again
a problem that you know how to do a decimal division problem. So what I'd like you to
do is stop the tape and divide 32.4 by 0.08 and get an answer. And when you have your
answer, come on back. Your task was to divide 32.4 by 0.08. Let's see. The first thing you
need to do is move the decimal point two places to the right to make 0.08 into the whole number
eight. Once you've done that, you must move the decimal point two places in the number
inside 32.4, two places to the right. You have a missing blank place there. We stick
a zero in and we now have 3,240. When we divide, as shown on the screen, we get 405. The question
is, is that 405%? It better not be. The only type of problem in which the answer is a percent
is a type two. In this case, we wanted to know 8% of what is 32.4. And of course, the
answer is 405. 8% of 405 is 32.4. How could you check that? Well, of course, you could
multiply 0.08 times 405 and you would get 32.4. In other words, we check this problem
the exact same way we check any other kind of division problem. So you can see that
using percents really involves using the skills we've learned previously, multiplying fractions,
multiplying decimals, dividing decimals, all very important skills if we believe that
percents affect our lives. My task in the remainder part of this lesson is to show you
how percents are part of your everyday life. The first thing I like to talk about is commissions.
Many people work on a commission basis. Generally, people who do that work in sales. I'm a great
example of my own personal life. When I was in high school, I sold ice cream on the beach.
And the first $50 of ice cream I sold each week, I made 15% of the sales. And the next
$50, I made 16% of the sales. And anything I sold beyond $100, I made 17% of the sales.
So at the end of the week, when I got my paycheck, if I knew nothing about percents, I would have
to rely upon the ice cream company and their accountants to be honest. But of course, I
knew about percents and I was able to check and ensure that they paid me every penny they
owed me. Now $100 may not seem like a lot of money in terms of something I should be
saying, but this was 1958. And ice cream was 15 cents then. So you had to sell an awful
lot of ice creams on the beach to make $100 in sales. And then I would have to compute
my commission. So commission is based generally on a percentage either of sales or the profits
generated by your sales. Let's take a look at a commission problem. We have a 17% commission
just like I had on my ice creams. Only now our sales are not terms of $100. We had $89,746
and 50 cents in sales. The question now is, what's my commission? Do I rely upon the payroll
department to write a check that's going to be correct? Or am I one of those folks who
never trusts anybody else to do my mathematics for me? Well, you better believe I check everything.
So I want to know what my commission is. I want to know what 17% of $89,746 and 50 cents
is. That's a type one problem. You know how to do a type one problem. So please stop the
tape and find out that commission. Okay. It's a type one problem. What's the first thing
we do? We change the percent to a decimal. 17% becomes .17 and we multiply .17 times 89,746.5.
We can drop the zero because the zero in the hundredth place is only important if we're
writing dollars and cents. When we multiply, by the way, would I do this by hand? No, I
would not. Recall in lesson 11 when I talked about when you use a calculator. These numbers
are quite big. The 89,746.5 is, I mean, you could do it by hand, but I would do it on
a calculator. Okay. Let's see what I got. I got 15,256.905. Now, no payroll department
is going to write me a check with .905 in it. We've got to round off another skill we've
previously learned. We look in the thousands place. We see a five. Since it's five or more,
we add one to the hundredths place and therefore my check is 15,256.91 cents. That's a lot
of money, you say. Well, but it may not be for a week's work. It could have taken me months
of work to get this sale. And therefore that $15,000 and change really is not a large amount
of money considering the work that was put in to generate those sales and thus to make
the commission. Does the answer make sense? Well, let's see. 89,000. So is about $90,000.
17% is about 20%. In fact, let's make that $90,000. So let's make that $90,000. Let's
make that $100,000. Just big round numbers. 20% of 100,000 is 20,000. Is our answer close
to 20,000? Yes, it is. Again, a ballpark figure, but we know it's 15,000. If the payroll
department gave me a check for $1,525.69 cents, would I be concerned? I'd be angry because
they had misplaced a decimal point. And of course, when this happens and they say, well,
it's only a decimal point, but it's a lot of money. It's a different between $1,500 and
$15,000. Our answer is correct. Okay, let's take a look at another type of problem. Let's
say, for example, you are working for a newspaper and you have an interview going on. You have
a survey and in this survey, all let's say 1,250 people, 1,250 people were interviewed.
And of those 1,250 people, 500 of those people indicated that they plan to vote in this
special election. So your newspaper was trying to determine what kind of turnout to expect
for this special election. It's an important question. Now, if you wrote in the newspaper
500 out of 1,250, for many people, they'd see as a fraction and would not necessarily understand
it. If you wrote as a decimal, people would have difficulty with the decimal recognizing
what it was, unless it was something like 0.5 or 0.25. What we want is a percent. So we want
to do is we'll find out 500 is what percent of 1,250 or what percent is 500 of 1,250. And
that's what I'd like you to do. If you've forgotten how to do it, rewind this tape to the part
of the lesson where we talk about doing a problem where the percent is missing. That was called
a type two problem. And then once you review that, or if you don't need to review it, just
go ahead and do the problem. Find out what percent I would write in the newspaper. Please
do that now. Okay, the question is what percent of 1,250 is 500? And it's a type two problem,
so it's is over of, the fraction is over of, times 100 over 1. And as you can see, we've reduced
the fraction 500 over 1,250 by dividing by 250. Now, you might not have been able to divide
by 250. Once you might have recognized that they both end in 0 and divided by 10 and then
divided by 5, you might not have been able to divide by 250. Once you might have recognized
that they both end in 0 and divided by 10 and then divided by 5, but eventually you get down
to two-fifths. Two-fifths times 100 over 1, we can cancel. 5 and 100 are both divisible
by 5. We wind up with 2 times 20 over 1, which is 40, 40%. So if you were writing this article,
you could write that 40% of the population who could vote was planning to vote in this
special election. Now, whether that's a high figure or a low figure depends on the nature
of the special election and the particular community in which you live. Some places 40%
for a special election would be an exceedingly large, very large percent. On the other hand,
if the special election was to elect a new senator or a new governor because the senator
or a governor had taken an office in Washington in the federal government, that might be a
very low percentage because you'd expect a much larger percentage to turn out for a major
special election. But at least we now can report it as a percent rather than trying to get people
to understand a fraction, for example, two-fifths. You may say, well, two-fifths is an easy fraction
to understand. You must understand that many people just see a fraction and they panic.
They remember fifth grade and they panic. 40% at least is understandable enough because
of the general use of percents. Okay. Let's take a look at another type of problem.
Here's the problem. You're a parent and your child comes home and had a grade on a very
important test of 80%. And maybe it turns out that 80% is a fairly good grade. And you know
that your child got 72 questions correct because the teacher told your child you got 72 questions
correct. Your question, because you're mathematically inclined after watching these tapes, is how
many questions were on the test? Was it a long test, a short test? Are you proud of the number
of questions your child got right? Well, you should be proud because the child got a good grade
as far as if 80 is a good grade. How would I find it out? Well, the question, of course,
is 80% of what number is 72? Or 72 is 80% of what? That sounds like a type three problem.
Again, if you know how to do it, do it. If you've forgotten already how to do a type
three problem, go back, rewind the tape, watch the part of the lesson where I discuss how
to solve a type three problem, and then do the problem. Stop the tape now, find out how
many questions were on the test. That is 80% of what number of questions is equal to 72
questions correct. Okay, that's a type three problem. You may have noticed we did a type
one problem for the commissions, a type two problem about the newspaper article, and now
a type three problem. Well, we're going to divide 72 by 80%, but first we change 80% to
a decimal, 0.80. And as you can see, we're using our decimal division skills. We first
move the decimal point two places to the right, 0.80 becomes 80. We move the decimal point
in 72 two places to the right. Since 72 is a whole number, the decimal point comes immediately
after the two in the ones place. When we get to place to the right, we now have 7200. When
we divide very quickly, we get a nine, but notice we cannot leave a blank ones place.
And since nine times 80 is 720, we subtract, we get zero. We bring down that last zero,
and the question is how many 80s are in zero? Well, the answer is zero, and thus our answer
is 90. There were 90 questions on the test. 72 out of 90 is 80%. And again, that's one
way we could check it. We could check it as a type two problem. 72 over 90 times 101 should
equal 80%. And it will, because if you got 80%, I mean, if you had 90 as 80% into 72,
then you got the correct answer and you know how to do type three problems. Now let's take
a look at a problems that involve something dear to my wife's heart. And that is sales.
She loves to go out and save money. You know, it's amazing how much money you can spend
as you're trying to save money. And of course, when you go to a sale, they tell you what percentage
off you get. And there are sometimes different deals you get. We'll look at a couple of different
situations. But the key thing is if you don't understand percents, then you may make the
wrong decision in your purchasing. And if the owner of a store or chain of stores knows
that most people don't understand percents, they will use your lack of knowledge to take
money out of your pocket. I always say to my students, failure to understand mathematics
can cost you money. And it really can. This is a great example. Alright, here's the first
problem. We're going to buy something that has a list price of $87 and 59 cents, which
hold that the discount is 15%. You get 15% off the list price on this sale because you're
such a good person. Really, they're giving you the discount because they can't sell it
otherwise. But when you go to the counter, you're going to pay a 6% sales tax because
the governor needs money too. So we want to know what the final price is. That is, we're
going to get the discount of 15%. And we're going to pay a sales tax of 6% on the sale
price without paying 6% on the list price. So what I'd like you to do is stop the tape
and find out exactly what it is that you pay for this item, including sales tax. When you
go to the cashier, usually at the front of the store, stop the tape and try that problem
now. Okay, the first thing we need to do is find out what the discount is. And the discount
is 15%. So 15% of $87 and 59 cents is what? That's a type one problem. And therefore,
as you can see, we're going to multiply 0.15 times 87.59. And we get 13.1385. Well, of
course, that is not an appropriate discount. It should be in dollars and cents. We use our
rounding off skills. And since the number in the thousands place is eight, we add one.
And our discount is $13 and 14 cents. Be wary of the discounts who doesn't add that extra
penny. Every penny counts. Now, what do we do with that discount? Well, that's a subtraction
to our original price to get the sale price. We take 87.59 and subtract $13 and 14 cents.
And our new price, our sale price is $74 and 45 cents. Well, we've got to pay the tax. The
tax is 6% of $74 and 45 cents. Therefore, we must do a type one problem. 6% 0.06 times
74.45. And we do that we get 4.467. Again, we can't pay a tax with thousands place. We
round off the $4 and 47 cents. We add the $4 and 47 cents to the $74 and 45 cents. And
the actual going out the store with the bag with the stuff inside is $78 and 92 cents.
We add the tax to the discounted price. Now, there's another way to get the discounted
price. And that is by simply saying if 100% of the list price is the list price. Remember,
100% is one. If the discount is 15%, then we're actually going to pay 85%. The difference
between 100 and 15. 85% of the list price. So instead of multiplying by 0.15 and then
subtracting, what we could do is multiply the list price by 0.85. And as you can see,
0.85 times 87.59 equals 74.4515, which rounds off to $74 and 45 cents. The exact same answer
we got using the other method. So it really depends whether you rather subtract the discounted
percent from 100 and then multiply to get the discounted price or multiply by the discount
and subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price. In fact, you can
do it both ways. You should get the exact same answer. Now, this is one of my favorite
kinds of problems in terms of making decisions. Let's assume you were given a choice. You
were told you could either have 35% off the price or 25% off and another 10% off after
that. Some of you would say, well, 25% plus 10%, that's the same thing as 35%. It doesn't
make a difference. Some of you might say, well, I like 35%. That sounds good. It's a bigger
number. And some of you would say, no, no, no, no, I want 25% and an additional 10% because
I'm getting two discounts. That's got to be more. Well, again, failure to know mathematics
could cost you money if you make the wrong decision. What we need to do is take a look
at an item. Let's say the list price is $100. I chose $100. That's an easy number to work
with. And if we take 35% off, we get, we pay 65% of $100, which is $65. So in other words,
if we took the 35% off on an item that has a list price of $100, we would pay $65 of
course, plus the tax. If we took 25% or first, let's see, 100% minus 25% is 75%. 75% times
100 or 0.75 times 100 is $75. But now we get an additional 10% off of that. 10% taken off
gives us 90%, 90% of $75 or 0.90 times 75 gives us $67.50, a full $2.50 more than we would
have gotten had we taken the 35%. So when you see a store says take 25% more and take
an additional 10% off, if they're talking about taking 10% off of the discounted price after
you've taken the 25% off, they are cheating you out of $2.50 for every $100. So what if
we had a 20% reduction, 20% reduction? We had 20% reduction. What? Well, we had 20% reduction
in our salary. Company is having hard times and we have a 20% reduction in our salary.
How much would we have to make to get back? What kind of percentage increase we need to
have when the company becomes profitable to be back where we started from? Let's assume
our salary was $1,000. If we took a 20% pay cut, that means our salary now is 80% of the
$1,000, which is $800. The question is what percentage increase of $800 would get us back
to $1,000? Well, from $800 to $1,000 is $200. So the question now is what percent of $800
$200. $200 over $800 times $100 over 1 gives us 25%, which means if we took a 20% cut
and pay, we'd need a 25% increase in pay to match it. A lot of people would simply think
an increase of 20% would balance it out and they'd be wrong and their failure to understand
this could cost them money or at least a big surprise when they got their new increasing
paycheck. So we've taken a look at various types of percent problems. We've looked at
type one where the years number was missing. We've looked at type two where the percent
was missing and type three where the of is missing. We've also seen various practical
applications of using percent in real world problems. And hopefully you now have a real
good control of fractions, decibels and percents. And the next lesson will go on to new
adventures in mathematics.
