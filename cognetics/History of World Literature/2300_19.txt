The subject of today's lecture is a 16th century Chinese novel.
It's been variously translated either as monkey or journey to the west.
As we can tell by how long it took the novel to make an appearance in this course, the
novel is a latecomer to literature.
It emerges quite a long time after the epic and drama and lyric poetry have been around
for a long time already.
In every country where it emerges, it shares with storytelling at first, a kind of inferiority.
It's a sort of poor cousin of the genres that have longer and mostly aristocratic histories.
The Tale of Genji, we remember, was written in the vernacular in Japanese rather than
Chinese when Chinese was the official language of Japan, and in China it will be written
in the vernacular rather than classical Chinese, beginning its life as novels do almost everywhere
as a popular rather than a respectable genre.
This will happen again in the west.
In lecture 22 we'll notice that when Don Quixote was written in Spanish, when Latin was the
official language of culture and learning in Europe, the novel will eventually of course
develop a tradition of its own, and it grows in importance as we move through literary history
so that most of the works we do in the last part of this course will be novels, but it
had to earn that place in the literary canon everywhere.
Chinese in the 16th century to oversimplify was divided into classical and vernacular.
Classical Chinese had its roots in the last centuries BCE, and it was still the official
language of literature.
The vernacular had evolved and was different from the classical in perhaps the same kind
of way that modern English, the everyday English of today is different from that of Shakespeare
or the King James Bible.
The classical Chinese had been used for the Tang poets that we did in lecture 13, and
it was still being used for official stories.
The vernacular was the language of the everyday whose stories circulated usually in oral form
underneath the official level of culture.
The same phenomenon we've noticed in other cultures, the Jataka, when we talked about
that, we noticed was written in Pali, which was a vernacular dialect rather than Sanskrit,
and the Thousand and One Nights was written in Arabic prose at a time when Arabic poetry
was the official language of Arabic literature, and Boccaccio, we remember, wrote the Decameron
in Italian, not in Latin.
Every culture develops a literature for ordinary language, but its audience to begin with is
almost always one or two levels beneath the levels of the intelligentsia.
In China that happens in the 16th century when three important novels were written,
ours is one of those.
And what the novel did in China as it was going to do in other places is it brought
new subject matter into literature and it addressed a new audience.
The official title of this is Shiyu Ji, which more literally translates as Adventures to
the Western Ocean.
The story is a story of a Buddhist monk and his companions who bring back sacred scriptures
from India.
Wu Chung-Un is the reputed author of this.
We don't know much about him except that he spent his lifetime in the provinces, in
government posts, and he turned to writing only after retirement.
We're not even absolutely certain that he's the one who wrote this, but as critics say,
until somebody with better credentials shows up, he'll get credit for having written it
for the moment anyway.
The monk who went on this trip to India was a historical figure.
His name was Sho An Zang and he was a Buddhist monk of the 7th century who became perplexed
over certain theological questions and he decided that he needed more texts in order
to resolve his doubts.
He left India in 627 and it took him four years to get to India and then he spent 12
years in India first learning Sanskrit and then studying and collecting the scriptures.
It took him two more to get home so by the time he got back home, he had been gone nearly
as long as Odysseus had been from Ithaca.
He brought back with him 657 separate Buddhist writings and he spent the rest of his life
then translating them with the help of a trained staff that was provided him by the emperor
who at the time was promoting Buddhism in China.
It was a dedicated and sober life on the whole.
It was recorded in Chinese annals as a kind of interesting detail.
Both the monk and one of the companions who had accompanied him to India wrote accounts
of their travels, both of them were factual, both of them serious, but very shortly afterwards
literature appropriated this journey and then it got repeated by storytellers for a thousand
years and during those thousand years it was like a snowball just gathering material as
it went.
By the time it got to Wucheng Un, the countries through which he passed had become mythical
ones populated by demons and monsters, the kind of places where some very unusual things
can happen.
By then the monk's name had become Trippie Taka.
He had lost his human companions and he had picked up some animals who were really semi-divine
shapeshifters, a monkey, pigsy, sandy, and a white horse in the Arthur Whaley translation.
Sandy and the white horse are really dragons.
The central character also as this story grew over time stopped being the monk and became
the monkey so that when Whaley in a much abridged translation that he did called his translation
monkey folk novel of China, Anthony Yu did a complete translation and he titled his journey
to the west and as Anthony Yu says in the introduction to his translation an immense
amount of folk material had been added to this story in the process of accretion.
Old deeds and fantastic adventures and mythic beings and animal spirits and fearsome battles
and monsters and miraculous deliverances all had gathered around this story of this sober
monk who had gone to get scriptures from India.
The first seven chapters of the novel deal with monkey himself who is hatched from a
rock by the action of the sun and the moon.
It's an unusual birth which identifies him as an extraordinary being from the very beginning.
He becomes the king of the monkeys and they live in a kind of idyllic happiness for about
a hundred years until he becomes aware of his own mortality.
And then like Gilgamesh in his story monkey decides to set out on a quest to see if he
can find some cure, some remedy for this cycle of rebirth and re-death.
He finds a series of masters who teach him not only many things about Buddhist enlightenment
but who also along the way he also acquires magic powers.
He also acquires a new name.
His new name is aware of vacuity or aware of emptiness.
He uses these new powers of his actually to invade heaven where he plays an immense number
of pranks on the denizens up there including eating enough of Lao Tzu's magic elixir pills
to make himself almost invulnerable and almost immortal.
The gods eventually decide that this is a troublemaker and decide to throw him out almost
too late for their own good because by this time he's become a fairly powerful creature.
All of the citizens of heaven then have to rally together to expel him and he puts up
a terrific fight but in the end Buddha himself subdues him and then plants him under the
primeval mountain of the five elements where he's kept captive for 500 years.
By the end of this 500 year period the Buddha decides that the east needs more scriptures
and so he sends a bodhisattva to earth to acquire them.
We remember from lecture 12 that a bodhisattva is either one who is on the way to enlightenment
but has several lives to live through to get there or in this case the bodhisattva is one
who has already achieved Buddhahood but who wants to return to earth to help others achieve
salvation.
This one's name is Guan Yin and her task is to select a pilgrim to make the trip and
then to arrange for some companions.
She first finds a monkey trapped under his mountain and she convinces him that he can
work off a considerable amount of bad karma by waiting to be released by the yet to be
determined pilgrim and then assisting him in his quest.
She also arranges for another companion.
This will become Pigsy who once lived in heaven but who was sent back to earth as punishment
for making a pass at the daughter of the moon goddess when he was a little drunk one evening.
He's now living as a farmer.
He's abducted and married the farmer's daughter and while he's a fairly hard working guy living
a fairly respectable life somehow he's turning more pig-like in appearance as time goes by
and each day he looks a little bit more like a pig hence his name Pigsy and his appearance
also will tell us a certain amount about his character.
Later when the pilgrim has been selected Guan Yin has Trippie Taka and Monkey pass through
the farm where Pigsy lives and there Pigsy and Monkey have a terrific fight.
Eventually Monkey defeats Pigsy and actually asks he asked to go along.
Pigsy asked to go along because he thinks that it will perhaps earn him enough merit
that he can be accepted back into heaven.
Pigsy is the comic character throughout this novel.
He has no real vocation as a pilgrim mostly what he wants is a good meal and if possible
a woman to sleep next to and at every opportunity he suggests turning back abandoning the quest
getting back to his farm somewhere.
He hates any kind of deprivation.
He complains a lot and he's one who has to be really really really kicked into doing
a job that he has to do.
The last two companions as we mentioned earlier are simply different kinds of dragons and
they feature a lot less in the story than Monkey and Pigsy do.
Once the companions are lined up then Guan Yin needs a pilgrim and the novel then moves
backwards in time to tell the story of the man who will become that pilgrim the Trippie
Taka who will actually lead this expedition to India.
He's the son of a young man who took first in the Chinese civil service exam.
Having taken first they held a big parade for him and the daughter of a magistrate standing
on her balcony sees him pass by falls in love with him arranges a marriage and so he gets
a good marriage as well as a good score on the civil service exam.
Because he did so well on the civil service exam he's made a provincial governor and
when he goes there to assume his duties he takes along with him his now pregnant wife
and his mother.
His mother gets ill along the way and he has to leave her behind at an inn and her presence
of that inn will be important later on.
While he's crossing a river with his wife a fairy man kills the young man and takes
his papers and his robes and his name and his commission and his wife and then goes
on to assume the governorship himself.
The wife is too terrified to do anything about it doesn't know how she could resist
this anyway except to go along with the deceit so she goes along and accompanies him.
Meanwhile the young man who was ostensibly killed by the fairy man isn't really dead
that's one of the wonderful things about this story.
He is rescued by a yaksha and because this young man had one time thrown a carp back
into the river because the carp had a particular gleam in its eye and he just thought there
was something odd about that carp and because that carp turns out to be a dragon king
the dragon king now saves this young man and keeps him alive in his court underwater.
The wife meanwhile having gone on to take up the post with the imposter has a son
whom her counterfeit husband orders her to kill instead she ties it to a plank and sets it
adrift in a river along with a note explaining the child's heritage.
That story should sound familiar because in our course already that's the third iteration of
that story we heard it of Sargon the Great in Acadia and we heard the story it was the same
story as Moses in the in the Old Testament. This time the baby is taken in by Buddhist monks
who raise him and eventually when he turns 17 they admit him to the priesthood eventually
they tell him the story of his origins and when he knows who he is and where he's from
he goes back up river to look for his mother when he finds his mother they're secretly
reunited his mother confirms the story the one little detail of the story is different here this
is a rather unusual little detail to make sure that she could identify him later before she ties
him to the plank she bites off one of his little toes so that she will always be able to identify
him and so when he shows up and says he's her son she said could you take your shoes off and
that way she knows that it's really it's really her son. They go to the emperor and the emperor
then helps them capture and execute the usurper. Then the family is now after all these years
the family is reunited the young son is the one who's chosen by Guan Yin to go to India and then
chapters 13 through 97 tell the story of that journey to India. It is a story which is amazingly
full of incident so many things happen in the story and they happen so fast and in such a
complicated sequence that there's no way that it could even be briefly summarized in the few minutes
that that we have so but in a broad outline what happens is the pilgrims do eventually get to India
they get their scriptures and they return home after which all five of them achieve full buddhahood
so it has a really great happy ending. Rather than to try to talk anymore about the incidents of
the novel let me spend the last few minutes of it simply talking about some of the things that
people have admired about this book some of the things that make it important some of the things
that critics have said over the years about this book. For one thing monkey the character of monkey
is one of the great creations in literature and he comes from a lot of different traditions and
shares a lot of traits with a lot of other characters. He's a little bit in some ways
like the trickster gods of some mythologies like Norse mythology or some American Indian mythology
for example and he derives some things from the animal fables that we talked about in lecture 12
came from India and which recur in the thousand and one nights and in stories like Chaucer,
Shanta Clear and the Fox. He may also owe some little bits to the monkey warrior of the Indian
epic poem the Ramayana. In some ways he's also kind of a comic Prometheus figure too especially
early in the novel. He's ambitious for knowledge and power and he's always very very defiant of
authority but like the monkeys in the Indian stories he also stays in character as a monkey.
He's always curious and arrogant and brash and willful and noisy but he's no ordinary monkey
remember thanks to the elixir thanks to his enlightenment thanks to the magic powers he's
accumulated along the way. He has some of the powers that some of our comic book characters
do characters like Superman and he is also a shape shifter he can change from one shape into another.
In the battle in heaven there's a really great sequence a divine general is trying to chase monkey
out of heaven and what happens is in the process of this chase both the general and the monkey
change through a bewildering series of disguises as animals and things and again if we're if we're
trying to think of parallels or analogs for this this should remind us of the story of the three
the the porter and the three ladies of Baghdad in the thousand and one knights and it's also very
similar to a folk song the child was going to collect in the 19th century a folk song about a lady and
a blacksmith in the journey to india monkey is going to be the one who has to come up with the
plan to save the pilgrims and most often he's also the one who has to carry it out he he goes in
the process of this of this story from being just an assistant to actually the the real leader of
the expedition in truth he does get the pilgrims into a certain amount of difficulty as well
because that's part of his character but whether he gets them into the difficulty or difficulty
simply comes to them it's generally up to monkey to come up with a plan to get them out of it
he's also the novel's satirical character who's always put off by pomposity or stuffiness
or an excessive show of authority and he always attacks these things wherever he finds them
interestingly he gets to show this side of his character most richly in the scenes in heaven
which this heaven turns out to be a really really doer place it's the sort of place that
doesn't look like anyone would want to spend much time there and monkey's the only thing
that provides some liveliness and the liveliness manages to totally upset this kind of authority
written solemn order that that characterizes heaven in this novel and he he keeps causing
trouble until as we said the heavenly troops have to muster in order to throw him out so monkey
is in in many ways a very very flexible character this probably has to do with the fact that this
story grew over a thousand years picking up bits and pieces from all kinds of different places
and down through history he's been the subject of a lot of adventure stories he's appeared in
other novels he's appeared in comic books and he even in fact still lives on in two at least two
modern novels that I know of Maxine Hong Kingston's tripmaster monkey and Gerald Visinor's an American
monkey in China would still draw very much on the character of this monkey figure trippy taka
is also in the novel is as much a character out of folklore as he is that serious monk who actually
went to india and brought the scriptures back ct shia in a book called the classic chinese novel
says that trippy taka actually comes out of three separate traditions one he is instill in some ways
the saintly monk and sometimes he still actually behaves that way but early in the novel we also
find out that he was a disciple of buddha in the western paradise who was banished to earth
for 10 incarnations and 81 ordeals for being inattentive during a sermon said this this this heaven
up there is a pretty serious place and a lot of lore gathered around this figure who is now in his
10th incarnation who still has the 81 ordeals to go through and in fact the 84 81 ordeals will
happen on his trip to india we are told that he has been so pure during these nine and now his
10th incarnations that he has never lost a drop of semen so by this time he is so unbelievably
pure that his flesh could bestow immortality on any monster who could eat him or his semen could
bestow immortality on any female who can seduce him this makes the journey fraught with danger for
his companions because every monster male or female is after him for the gift that he could bestow
and that makes the job of the the guardians of people who go with him even more difficult they
have their hands full protecting such a wonderful treasure finally as shia says he's just an ordinary
mortal on a on a hazardous journey and as an ordinary mortal he's whiny it worried and upset
by the smallest obstacle or inconvenience he turns out thus to be a really really bad leader
of an expedition which again forces monkey into that rule a role that he couldn't possibly have
expected to have to play when he was waiting under his mountain waiting for deliverance and
asked to go along as a companion so it's on the one hand it's a really good story a lot of individual
episodes will remind you of stories from other places as as we've said it picked up so much
material from so many different folklore traditions that many of the episodes that occur in this
novel are episodes that we are familiar with from other places and they sound familiar to us
among others you'll you'll run across a story that sounds very like hamlet you'll run across a story
that sounds very much like adipus the king you'll run across a story that sounds very much like the
orastaya there's a story that sounds very much like the minotaur and there's a story
which is very like moses defeating the egyptian sorcerers so in spite of all of this diverse
materials gathered together in the novel some critics at least see the work still unified
or held together by wu chung un held together by what they see as a buddhist vision of life
um some critics uh anthony you who translates the the complete version of it believes it's a
dauest version of vision rather than a buddhist vision but a religious one in any case ct shea
says that the keystone of the entire novel is the heart sutra which trippy taka receives
before he leaves on his trip in order to guide him in his travels um this is supposed to be
something that he treasures that he holds to his heart that he remembers every day because if he
remembers and knows it lives by this it should help him with his journey in the u translation
this is what the heart sutra sounds like form is no different from emptiness emptiness no
different from form form is emptiness and emptiness is form of sensations perceptions
volition and consciousness the same is also true it is thus that all dharmas and by dharmas
here of course this means laws or rules or duties it is thus that all dharmas are but
empty appearances neither produced nor destroyed neither defied nor pure neither increasing nor
decreasing this is why in emptiness there are no forms and no sensations perceptions volition
or consciousness no eye ear nose tongue body or mind no form sound smell taste touch or object of
mind there is no realm of sight and so forth and the and so forth by the way are in the translation
i'm not adding those myself but we're supposed to go through that entire list each time he just
shortened it by saying and so forth there is no realm of sight and so forth until we reach the realm
of no mind consciousness there is no ignorance nor is there extinction of ignorance and so forth
until we reach the stage where there is no old age and death nor is there the extinction of old age
and death there is no suffering annihilation or way there is no cognition or attainment
because there is nothing to be attained the mind of the bodhisattva by virtue of reliance upon the
perfection of wisdom has no hindrances no hindrances and therefore no terror or fear he is far removed
from error and delusion and finally reaches nirvana characteristically however trippi taka
keeps forgetting this sutra and failing to live up to it and once again over and over again he has
to be reminded by monkey who's the one who has to keep reminding him of the heart sutra this is
just one of those reminders where he says old master you have forgotten the one about no eye
ear nose tongue body or mind those of us who have left the family should see no form with our eyes
should hear no sound with our ears should smell no smell with our noses should taste no taste with
our tongues our body should have no knowledge of heat or cold and our minds should gather no
vain thoughts this is called the extermination of the six robbers but look at you now though you may
be on your way to seek scriptures your mind is full of vain thoughts fearing the demons you are
unwilling to risk your life desiring vegetarian food you arouse your tongue loving fragrance and
sweetness you provoke your nose listening to sounds you disturb your ears looking at things
and events you fix your eyes you have in some assembled all the six robbers together how could
you possibly get to the western heaven to see buddha so monkey has to use this speech over and over
again on the trip to india monkey himself shows the the influence of buddha's thought and shows
the way it colors the novel at the very outset he's a sort of wild character who wins our sympathy
by rebelling against every imaginable form of authority including heaven itself but his 500
years under the mountain have given him time for reflection so that when he has a chance to win merit
by accompanying trip ataka he agrees but even at the outset of the pilgrimage he's still a monkey
with traces of his early character so the body's bodhisattva gives trip ataka a kind of cap which
once the monkey once it's put on the monkey it can't be removed and it comes with a spell
that only trip ataka knows and which tightens the cap slowly until it causes great pain
the cap is clearly some kind of metaphor for the mental discipline required by buddhism or
daoism you in his introduction that the novel argues that it's the book is more daoist than
buddhist but we'll assume for the rest of our discussion here that we are talking about buddhism
rather than daoism there's a chinese proverb that refers to the monkey of the mind and we know
what that means because the way your mind jumps around and can't stay focused on anything and
jumps from one thing to the other it needs to be disciplined to focus on anything for any length of
time that cap performs that function for monkey in the novel it gives trip ataka a measure of
control over the monkey and it gives monkey himself a measure of control over his own mind
and impulses which makes him as we've noticed the most important member of the pilgrimage
he's still a monkey of course at the end he's capable of the distractions and exuberance and
curiosity and energy that can be the source of trouble but he also becomes the pilgrim most
dedicated to his master and most dedicated to the acquisition of scriptures trip ataka gets
frightened or discouraged loses heart pigs he always wants to get back to the farm or at least
to find a good meal somewhere and as the trip continues it's most often monkey who has to
recall the other pilgrims to their mission to cheer them up to get them out of some mess they've
gotten into it's been suggested that perhaps monkey is virtual to trip ataka's pilgrim in daunte
and or but i don't know i the central the i don't know if that one really works because it seems to
me that the journey couldn't have been finished without monkey's help the pair has also been
compared in some ways to don kihode and sancho panza although again it seems to me that trip ataka
is in many ways more like sancho panza than monkey is anyway the book in spite of its wonderfully
comic tone and the amazing amount of interesting adventures and all the great folklore that's
been gathered together in it still does manage to maintain a religious focus shea sees the entire
book governed by a serious religious meaning and he sums it up in this way he says with his sense
of the ridiculous anchored in the buddhist doctrine of emptiness therefore the author mocks all the
monsters as he mocks all the pilgrims and celestials in the book not only is everything infinitely
amusing to his observant eye but in the ultimate religious sense everything that exists is but
maya that is illusion with which we are infatuated even the most serious character in the one nearest
to approaching an understanding of emptiness monkey himself is not spared this affectionate
ridicule one of the interesting things that happens in this book is that quite frequently
will be caught into an adventure that seems really important intense and they'll get out of it
and then they'll discover that this was all just set up by the bodhisattva as some kind of test
and monkey sometimes gets a little annoyed with this he said i thought she was supposed to be
helping us not setting up problems for us to overcome but what what she is suggesting here is
that the ultimate buddhist vision of this novel is a awareness of vacuity or awareness of emptiness
that's what the heart sutra is about that's what monkey keeps reminding us of and in some ways
making fun of everything is a perfect kind of buddhist comedy a way of suggesting that
everything in this novel is after all is maya is illusion as he says for us in the western
tradition we're not used to treating religious subjects in this kind of way in in religious
literature we're used more used to techniques like those of daunte who gives a kind of substantial
reality to the souls whether they're in heaven or in hell and and he wants to elicit a strong
emotion from us she then continues about this book he said wu chan an on the other hand provides
an episode after comic episode the illusion of mythical reality but then inevitably exposes
the falsehood of that reality in furtherance of his buddhist comedy and we remember that monkey's
new name is awareness of vacuity or awareness of emptiness so what she is suggesting is some
ways this is kind of the ultimate buddhist comic vision a vision which sees through the illusion
of everything and and comes to see that great vision of vacuity or emptiness anyway this is
another step in the history of the emergence of the novel we'll get back to this history in three
lectures with don kihody and then we'll finally get around to defining the novel we've done two
of them already it's about time we talked about what a novel really is in the meantime in our next
lecture we'll be back in europe where we'll go back to our study of narrative strategies and
narrative techniques in marguerite of navars heptamaran
