Lecture 4, Homer's Iliad
In the last lecture and in this one and the next one we are dealing with the three works
which probably more than any other works have been the biggest and strongest and most lasting
influences on western literature. Last time we looked at the Tanakh and this time we will
look at Homer's Iliad and the next time we will look at Homer's Odyssey. Harold Bloom
in his introduction to a collection of essays on Homer says about these works about Homer
and the Hebrew Bible. He says, the Hebrew Bible and Homer compete for the consciousness
of western nations and their belated strife may be the largest single factor that makes
for a divided sensibility in the literature and life of the West. For what marks the West
is its troubled sense that its cognition goes one way and its spiritual life goes in quite
another. We have no ways of thinking that are not Greek and yet our morality and religion
outer and inner find their ultimate source in the Hebrew Bible.
One of the slightly interesting things about the juxtaposition of these is the fact that
they are also roughly contemporary. The Trojan War was dated by Greek historians at 1184
BC which would have been about the same time that the Hebrews were moving into Canaan and
the Iliad would have been written down about 200 years after the first books of the Hebrew
Bible were written down using the same alphabet that the Phoenicians had invented had been
adapted by the Hebrews for their language and the Greeks eventually adapted it for their
language adding vowels this time which made it slightly easier. We'll be talking in this
in the next lecture about Homer and we should remind everyone at the very outset that Homer
is a kind of fiction. The Greeks said that thought that both poems have been written
by someone named Homer. The Romans went along with that. We still don't know anything about
Homer at all so we'll keep calling it Homer's Iliad and Homer's Odyssey even though we don't
know any more about Homer than we do about Sin Lekki Unini who may or may not have written
the Gilgamesh epic. Homer locates the Iliad and the Trojan War toward the end of the
Mycenaean Age. The Mycenaean Age was about 1500 to about 1150 BCE and it was named after
the largest and wealthiest and most powerful city on the mainland ruled according to Homer
at the time by a king named Agamemnon. According to the Greeks themselves the Trojan War was
a ten year siege that was fought by a consolidated army that was made up of contingents from
all of the mainland citadels and some of the island citadels which were all called together
by Agamemnon and they sailed 1,000 armada of black ships against what Homer generally
considers to be another Mycenaean city Troy. It was fought in the completely developed
version of the story because Paris or Alexandros who was the son of King Priam of Troy abducted
Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. King Menelaus of Sparta happened to be the
brother of King Agamemnon and Agamemnon and Menelaus were deeply insulted at this violation
of hospitality laws and so that it was Agamemnon who called together this armada of 1,000 black
ships to sail to Troy to avenge the insult and to bring Helen back. Homer's Iliad doesn't
tell the entire story of the Trojan War. It deals really only with about 52 days to take
place in the last year, the 10th year of the war and its arc is a sort of internal, much
smaller arc. It begins with the wrath of Achilles. It begins when Achilles gets angry and it
ends 52 days later when the wrath of Achilles subsides and so the poem is really about the
first line says, help me sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles, the anger of Achilles and
so it covers only about 52 days in the 10th year of the war. When the poem ends Troy is
still standing. Troy has not fallen. The fall of Troy is assumed everyone would have known
the story but it ends sometime after the poem ends. The poem was kept alive for about 400
years from the time of the events that occurred in the Trojan War until the time it was written
down were kept alive for about 400 years by the oral tradition. Presumably it was kept
alive by Bards who sang songs after dinner at aristocratic houses. We will meet two of
those Bards in Homer's Odyssey so we can see there how they worked but the idea was for
about 400 years these stories had just been circulating until someone whom the Greeks
called Homer gathered some of them together and wove them into a single grand narrative
doing for the stories of the Trojan War perhaps what Sin Lekki Iunini had done for a whole
lot of different stories about Gilgamesh. The distance between the events and the time
of the telling shows up in some interesting kinds of ways. The tradition, the oral tradition
that Homer is working with had the Greeks, the Achaeans that if I call them Greeks I
mean Achaeans that's what they're really called in the poem. Homer had the Achaeans fighting
in chariots but during the 400 years of the Dark Ages the Greeks had lost the ability
to fight in chariots. They didn't use chariots in fighting anymore so he has these chariots
but he doesn't know how they're used he doesn't quite know how to use them and so what he
does is he in the Iliad he uses them as taxis. The great heroes get in the chariots in the
morning they ride out to the field of battle and they get out of their chariots and they
fight hand to hand on foot. There are other little anomalies like this that show up that
show some of the distance between Homer and when he's working and when the events took
place. Homer defined what an epic was going to be and from here on out every epic that
we look at will be like homers because it is influenced by homers it is shaped by homers
and so it perhaps would be a good idea to just mention a few of the conventions that
were established by Homer and thus became mandatory for all epics that are written later.
Because the events happened a very long time ago Homer assumes that people in those days
were bigger and stronger than we are so that his people are larger than life they're huge
they're somehow the human race is deteriorated in the 400 years between then and now and
humans were bigger then. He tells at one point he tells about Aeus who's the second greatest
warrior in the Achaian army picking up a rock and he says the rock is so big that six people
six men the way men are now couldn't lift that rock to give some sort of sense of scale
so one people are larger than they are now. He also understands that in the past gods
and goddesses participated more directly and more frequently in human life than they do
now. That makes life more transparent it's easier to see what life is about and how it
works if the gods and goddesses are there making decisions and doing things and so the
gods and goddesses are so present in the Iliad and Odyssey that they became mandatory for
every epic that follows everybody who writes an epic is going to have to put gods and goddesses
in them. By the 18th century the 18th century in a kind of flippant way said called this
the supernatural machinery of the epic so every epic has to have supernatural machinery
in it. The epic style as Homer defined it is a lofty style it avoids vulgarity it avoids
colloquialism and even it's rhetorical what devices are always on a very very grand scale.
One of the devices which became mandatory for all later writers was the epic simile.
It's a comparison which is introduced by like or as but which can run on for many many lines.
Sometimes in fact as you're reading you get the feeling that he's forgotten what it is
that he's comparing to what he's gotten so interested in simply this comparison in describing
what he's talking about. There's a really very famous one that happens in book eight this is
one one night the Trojans have pushed the Achaeans back up against their own ships and they're so
sure about victory that they don't even go back inside their city walls at night they camp out
on the plains and from the bulwarks that the Achaeans have thrown up around their ships they can
look out over the plane and see all of these campfires burning out in the plane and then Homer
makes a beautiful simile which goes like this and so the Trojan spirits soared as they took
positions down the passageways of battle all night long and the watchfires blazed among them
hundreds strong as stars in the night sky glittering around the moon's brilliance blaze in all their
glory when the air falls to a sudden windless calm all the lookout peaks stand out and the
jutting cliffs and the steep ravines and down from high heavens bursts the boundless bright air
and all the stars shine clear and the shepherd's heart exalts so many fires burned between the
ships and the xanthus whirling rapids set by the men of Troy bright against their walls a thousand
fires were burning there on the plane and beside each fire sat fifty fighting men poised in the
leaping blaze and champing oats and glistening barley stationed by their chariots stallions
waited for dawn to mount her glowing throne that's a very famous epic simile and you realize
that what happens is Homer gets so carried away with the idea of the shepherd on a hill looking
out and seeing all these beautiful stars that for a moment we almost forget that he's describing a
bunch of bonfires out on the on the plane the poem also begins Homer begins his poem with an
invocation of the muse Homer wasn't there himself so he doesn't know the details of this story so
he asked the muse to help him remember the convention here is that an epic poem is not written
by a poet but the poet is just the vehicle who threw through whom the muse sings and therefore
an epic poem is never personal it's never about the poet it's the poet simply recites what the
muse tells him to and that's why in twenty seven thousand lines in the Iliad and Odyssey there's
not a single detail about the poet not a single detail which is one of the reasons why we know
so little about him the poem isn't about him it's about the story the epic also begins after
Homer it begins in medius race that is in the middle of things Homer begins in the middle or
toward the end of the story and then he fills in all the necessary background for us in flashbacks
Homer's subject in this first poem anyway was war and that likewise became very crucial so that
future epics will mostly be about military heroes heroes on the battlefield and the honor that they
can win there the poem itself begins with a dispute between Agamemnon the great king and Achilles
who's the greatest fighter of the Achaeans over a slave girl and that's what leads to the anger
of Achilles which is the announced theme of the poem the reason why a slave girl can matter so much
is that the Greeks lived in what anthropologists and sociologists sometimes call a shame culture
which to oversimplify it is a culture in which one's own worth is based on how one is valued by
one's peers a warrior's worth therefore is based on the prizes that are awarded him after each battle
by the army a little perhaps like a game ball and football in which the the players decide that one
person who was most instrumental in winning this game gets the ball for the day these prizes pile
up so after every battle whoever's most instrumental gets more prizes than anyone else so the more
prizes you have the more value you are so when Agamemnon strips Achilles of one of his prizes a
slave girl Achilles loses face in front of the entire army and Agamemnon who who is the leader
of this troop considers that he would lose face by backing down to Achilles Agamemnon has lost his
slave girl through a set of circumstances and aren't really his fault but he feels that he would lose
face if he has less prizes than he deserves and so he takes one from Achilles and Achilles now is
stripped of his honor in front of the entire army he can't back down Agamemnon can't back down and so
what Achilles finally decides to do is he's just going to go back to his tent and not fight anymore
he's going to sit out and he hopes the Achaeans lose while he's sitting out this you know this this
sounds this this is overly simplistic i'm explaining it in overly simple terms but it's perhaps easier
to remember if we think the modern army still works in some ways in the same way
how what your status is depends on how many stripes you have and how many epaulets and
how many metals and to have those stripes stripped off in front of the army is still a way to lose
a lot of face and people will treat you differently afterwards maybe even a clear example would be
professional athletics the way a quarterback knows how valuable he is is how much he makes
if he makes less than other quarterbacks his peers whom he thinks are not any better than he is
what he wants then is he wants a compensation which is equal to theirs so that he will then
regain his face in the eyes of his peers and so what he does is if his owners or management won't
pay him that then he will do exactly what Achilles does that's he'll sit out and he hopes his team
loses while he's sitting out until they know how valuable he is and how much he's worth
the whole action of the poem starts from this confrontation between Achilles and Agamemnon
and because Achilles is like Gilgamesh is half divine his mother is a goddess his father is mortal
he asks his mother if she will make sure that Zeus helps the Trojans win against the Achaeans as
long as he sits out which he does and which Zeus does and in a way this in part simply validates
what's going to happen because if with Achilles out the Achaeans are not going to do very well
anyway but what this does is it also engages the gods and goddesses in the action of the poem
with Achilles out of action the Trojans gradually begin to win slowly day by day they push the
Achaeans back across the plains and then finally they they're when they're getting their backs up
against their own ships they throw up some earth bulwarks to protect their ships when the Trojans
actually breach those bulwarks and set some of the ships on fire Patroclus Achilles dearest friend
asks whether he can put on Achilles armor and go out that day and drive at least drive the Trojans
back away from the bulwarks Achilles says yes but just long enough just drive them away from the
bulwarks as soon as they're gone then you come back and Patroclus agrees to this now he puts on
Achilles armor and of course Achilles armor is very noticeable and for a brief moment it's a great
help because the Trojans think whoa Achilles is back in the fight again but after the Trojans
begin to retreat Patroclus gets carried away by a sort of battle frenzy that day and he can't stop
he just keeps driving them back and back and back until he has the Trojans pinned up against their
own walls and there he fights and dies killed by Hector who's the the greatest Trojan warrior as
Achilles is the greatest Achaean warrior Achilles up until this time has been angry primarily at
Agamemnon now he redirects that anger it goes up a notch or two and he redirects his anger at the
Trojans and at Hector he has a perfunctory reconciliation with Agamemnon Agamemnon loads
him up with gifts he doesn't care about that he goes out to fight and it's a nightmare day of fighting
he skewers people he just kills them at random he doesn't observe any of the rules of fighting
he just kills and kills and kills and it's a horrible horrible nightmare day for both sides
and finally at the end of the day he meets Hector whom he's been looking for all day he's been
fighting his way through the Trojan ranks to find his way to Hector he does find his way to Hector
and then he kills him and after he kills him he's still his anger still isn't over so he ties
Hector's body to the back of his chariot and then three times carries it drags it around the city
walls in front of Hector's wife and his infant son and his mother and his father and all the people
who know that Hector was their defense now that he's gone how terrible is this is going to be
Achilles drags Hector's body back to his the camp and he still won't allow it to be
buried he has a great burial service for patriclus his friend but every morning he still
drags the body around grave of patriclus and then he drags it one more time around the city wall
so the the Trojans will see this the anger of Achilles ends when prime the old man the father
of Hector king of Troy makes his way out alone to Achilles tent to beg the return of his son's body
Achilles wakes up and he looks down and there is this old man this grand old man the man who was
king of the most magnificent city in the world weeping holding his hands kissing the hands
that had actually killed his son and begging for his son back and Achilles looks down at this old
man and what goes through his mind is he thinks of his own father back home waiting for a son who
will never come home again and Achilles begins to cry as well Achilles weeps for his own father
and he weeps for patriclus and priam weeps for Hector and he weeps for Troy and both of them
weep for what it is to be human and at the end of it Achilles takes the body of Hector and carries
it himself out to priam's wagon and then with the with the end of Achilles anger the poem ends
to the very last event in the poem is the funeral of Hector and Troy well this this is that's just
a kind of quick overview of the entire story there are so many things that this poem bequeathed
to later literature um that we could spend hours and hours and hours talking about them
but let me just pick out two that i think are really really important not only in that rest
of the history of literature for for our course coming up the first is the idea of heroism that
comes from this poem this is a war poem and in this in this poem heroism is defined in terms of
fighting hand to hand in battle two great warriors armed equally with the same skills
meet they exchange genealogies and then they fight it's been compared in some ways to the great
gunfight that happens at the end of a western in which two heroes face off against one another
what invariably happens in Homer is that one of them walks away covered in glory and the other one
dies because it's a zero-sum game in order to win glory in order to win honor you have to win it
from somebody in this poem you have to win it from somebody else and it's one of the reasons why
the exchange genealogies because you don't win glory fighting an inferior man so they always
exchange genealogies to make sure they're worth the fight make sure that you're worth killing
and then these two men without without magic tricks without any kind of trickery
simply square off and one of them goes away covered in glory the other one loses his life
and if we ask why why heroes are willing to fight for glory for honor to risk their lives like this
when life is so short anyway life lasts such a short time so why would you risk it doing
something like this their answer is as it would have been for Gilgamesh I think is that they fight
for glory because life is so short because it's so short you want something that's going to outlive
me you're going to want something that's going to last after I'm gone the way Gilgamesh finally
settles on the walls of a rook as his legacy and there's a there's a wonderful passage that happens
in this poem when a Trojan named Sarpedon is about to charge the walls the bulwarks that the
Achaeans have thrown up around their ships and he says this to his friend Glaucus he says ah my
friend if you and I could escape this fray and live forever never a trace of age immortal I would
never fight on the front lines again or command you to the field where men win fame but now as it is
the fates of death await us thousands poise to strike and not a man alive can flee them or
escape so in we go for attack give our enemy glory or win it for ourselves and so that's why you do
it you do it because life is so short because you have such a short time to win this kind of
honor to win this kind of glory Achilles illustrates this perfectly Achilles is not only the protagonist
of the poem he's also the greatest fighter and he illustrates this point perfectly in book nine
Agamemnon has sent an embassy to Achilles begging him to come back into the fight and and what Achilles
says to the embassy is he said I don't have anything personal against the Trojans they've never
done anything to me and in fact the only people who do have something personal against the Trojans
are Menelaus and Agamemnon he said I am here only for a chance to win glory for myself for myself
and to leave behind a glorious name and then he says because his mother is a goddess his mother
has told him that he has two possible fates he can either stay home and live a long anonymous happy
life or he can go to Troy and he can die very young but leave behind a great name and he is here at
Troy so his two fates in some kind of way he knows he's going to die at Troy he made the choice and
came here anyway but that's in fact the sort of fate that awaits almost everyone who came to Troy
because although they don't know they're going to die at Troy they have to risk their lives for
glory every single day instead of staying home comfortably where they could have because they
can say with with Achilles I don't have anything against the Trojans they never stole my wife
and Hector who's the greatest of the Trojan warriors actually can illustrate this same
point in book six he comes home and has a as an interview with his wife Andromache and what his
wife says is she says look don't go back out to the field because every day you go back out to the
field you run the risk of getting killed and one of these days it's really going to happen
and when it happens she reminds him Achilles has killed my father he's killed my brothers
he sold he gave my mother into slavery so he said you are my family now you are everything I have
and if something happens to you you know what's going to happen to me your son is going to be
killed I will be given into slavery your parents will be killed your city will be leveled all that
so don't go out to fight fight a defensive war stay here guard the walls and you know that the
city will never be taken if you fight a defensive battle and and Hector listens to her and he says
I understand I know exactly what you're talking about and I agree with your strategy I agree with
everything you say but he says all this weighs on my mind two dear woman but I would die of shame to
face the men of Troy and the Trojan women trailing their long robes if I would shrink from battle
now a coward nor does the spirit urge me on that way I've learned it all too well to stand up bravely
always to fight in the front ranks of Trojan soldiers winning my father great glory glory for
myself and so what Hector says is I know I know what's going to happen to you and he says the
only thing that makes it easier to take is I know that by the time my son is killed by the time
you're given off into slavery I will be dead and I won't be here to see it and that's in fact pretty
much what does happen to Hector in the poem he does stay outside the walls when the rest of Achilles
has driven the rest of the Trojans inside the walls and he stands out there and he thinks what
should I do if I went in I could if I go inside I could be safe but do I dare go inside would I lose
too much face by going inside and then he says I would die of shame to face the men of Troy and
the Trojan women trailing their long robes so now better for me to stand up to Achilles kill him
come home alive or die at his hands in glory out before the walls and of course that's what
happened he is killed by Achilles out before the walls and everything that his wife prophesied
is going to happen what it suggests here is that the first duty of a Greek hero is to his
reputation to oneself family considerations community considerations come second and third
because the first and primary duty is one that you owe to yourself and this idea has had a very
very long run in Western history in the classic American film High New when when Marshall Kane and
Amy are in the buckboard leaving town and he turns the buckboard around he says they're making me
run and nobody's ever made me run before and he goes back to meet the Frank Miller gang even
though he knows by going back Amy has said she will leave him if he goes back the community
doesn't want him to go back he goes back he makes the same choice Hector does that is he chooses
his own dignity his own self-esteem his own integrity over that of his family and over that
of his community Moses Hadass in a book called the Greek ideal and its survival comments on this
really stunning aspect of Greek heroism he says the most striking single feature of the Homeric
ethos is the enormous importance attached to individual prowess individual pride individual
reputation heroes of other epics prize their individuality also but in none is the drive for
self assertion so ruthless and pride so paramount as in Homer in Roman or Christian or Indian epic
it is a function of heroism to submit individuality however grandiose to a higher sanction the Homeric
hero may not compromise loyalty to his own being with loyalty to any other human or divine and
that's a powerful way to say it but that really is true that is the ideal of Greek heroism
that's powerfully stated but it isn't any more powerful in this Greek individualist conception
of heroism really is the second enduring legacy one that is equally important I think especially
for the history of literature is Homer's treatment of the enemy the Trojans as equal indignity and
humanity to the army of Agamemnon and Achilles as Homer has them the Trojans speak the same language
they worship the same gods they live by the same codes it may even be that for most of us the Trojans
are even slightly more sympathetic than the Achaeans because we get to see the Trojans at home with
wives with mothers with children with parents while the Achaeans are simply an army on the prowl the
only women in the Achaean camp are our slave women my students when I teach this in class almost
always wind up liking Hector better than they like Achilles in part because you get to see
aspects of Hector's humanity that we don't get to see of Achilles and the reason why this is so
important is if we think back to some of the stories about the wars that are told in the Tanakh
or in the the the the Old Testament what we hear what we get there is the fact that
enemies are treated as pretty reprehensible people because an enemy of the people is also an enemy
of Yahweh here what we get is we get Homer treating these Trojans as equal indignity and
humanity we care about them by the time the poem was done as much as we do about the Achaeans and
that is a great step forward Northrop Frye in his anatomy of criticism says it very beautifully
when he says this about the importance of this detail in this poem it is hardly possible to
overestimate the importance for western literature of the Iliad's demonstration that the fall of an
enemy no less than that of a friend or leader is tragic and not comic with the Iliad once for all
an objective and disinterested element enters into the poet's vision of human life without this
element poetry is merely instrumental to various social aims to propaganda to amusement to devotion
to instruction with it it acquires the authority that since the Iliad it has never lost an authority
based like the authority of science on the vision of nature as an impersonal order and so those two
things if we remember nothing else from these will there'll be lots of other things we'll pick
up as we as we go along but those two things I think are really really important as legacies
which the the Iliad left not just for culture but for the literature that we'll be looking
at in the next programs next time we get to take a look at the eternal companion piece of this poem
the Odyssey which continues the focus on heroism which is in this poem while dealing with a hero
who is a very different kind of hero Odysseus and Achilles will share not very many characteristics
except that desire for personal individualistic heroism which we'll take a look at next time
the the context for this is that the heroes who managed to survive the Trojan War came home
those who survived and the Odyssey deals with their homecoming particularly with the homecoming
of the one character whom James Joyce always said was the most universal man in all of literature
Odysseus that's in our next lecture
