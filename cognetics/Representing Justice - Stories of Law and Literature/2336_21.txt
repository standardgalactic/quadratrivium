Lecture 21
Lolita and the Art of Confessing
Thus far we have discussed how legal and literary texts together construct and critique our
cultural values. But we now turn to an example of how a literary text becomes a symbolic
challenge to the law, both as written jurisprudence and the unwritten moral codes of society.
It is perhaps symptomatic of 20th century culture that this challenge to the law should
come in a debate about sexual morality rather than the political rebellions or religious
heresies of previous centuries. Lolita has become part of the American cultural landscape,
despite its apparently unsavory subject matter, or would that be because of its unsavory subject
matter? The ambivalent way in which critics and readers respond to this text is a metaphor,
it would seem, for America's fascination with, and yet overtly moralistic aversion to,
criminal behavior and sexual perversities. Lolita was not only a symbolic challenge to the law
when it was published in 1955, but is also an extremely difficult text on its own terms,
in part because of its many references to other texts, other languages, and other myths.
Perhaps the central concern that this novel raises for us, both personally and as part of
the legal history of obscenity, is how we respond to it in aesthetic terms, given the
unpleasantness of its subject matter, that is, pedophilia. The story details the obsession of
the narrator, Humbert Humbert, with his 12-year-old stepdaughter, an obsession that leads him to
abduct her after the death of her mother, and begin a two-year odyssey that takes them across
America, until Lolita finally flees into the arms of another abuser. Reunited after three years
with the now married and pregnant Lolita, who is written asking for money, Humbert hunts down and
kills the man he believes has corrupted her, still failing to realize that he, Humbert, is in fact
the perpetrator of the greatest crime against Lolita, that of robbing her of her childhood.
The narrative begins with Humbert in his prison cell, retrospectively describing his obsession,
where he is awaiting trial for the murder of his rival. This summary of the story might suggest
exactly how one should respond to Humbert's story, and indeed the novel is frequently condemned even
by those who have never read it. In fact, one's response is enormously complicated by Humbert's
brilliant manipulations of language and culture, a fact that he himself acknowledges by alerting
the reader to be wary of his deceptions. The deceptions begin in the novels forward,
where the fictional editor, John Ray Jr. PhD, explains how the confession came into his hands.
Apparently it was passed on by Humbert Humbert's lawyer. Ray also explains the inclusion, or rather
his unwillingness to exclude, certain scenes that might be called aphrodisiac. This reference to
what the editor calls the most strictly functional scenes in the development of a tragic tale,
leads him to allude to another considerably more outspoken book, by which he means James Joyce's
Ulysses, a novel that was, like Lolita, first published in Paris and not legally available
in the United States until eleven years after its publication in 1922. Lolita has often been
compared to Ulysses. Both Joyce and Nabokov are wordsmiths, constantly teasing and ticing
and deluding the reader about the nature of language and its capacity to represent a stable
reality. Both authors employ the metaphor of the journey. For Leopold Bloom and Irish Jew,
the circuit of his desire is mapped onto the city of Dublin during the course of one day.
For Humbert Humbert, desire is an extended road trip, crossing and criss-crossing the American
landscape over the course of two years. One could say then that Lolita, like Huck Finn,
is a paradigmatic American novel in which two oddly mismatched companions take off for the
wilderness beyond civilization. Let me return to John Ray's forward. Obviously, part of its
function is to seduce the reader into accepting the narrative that follows as a true confession,
as the narrative of Humbert Humbert's obsession with Lolita written over 56 days
while Humbert is imprisoned waiting trial for murder. For that seduction to work,
we have to have some trust in Dr. Ray, that he is who he says he is. The author of a book titled
Do The Senses Make Sense, friend and relation of Humbert Humbert's lawyer who handed over the
confession and resident of Whidworth, Massachusetts. This elaborate construction of her similitude
was apparently so convincing to an English publishing company that they decided to separate
the forward from the novel, discarding it in favor of one written by Martin Amos, the English
novelist. Perhaps they replaced the original forward with a new one because they didn't want
to spoil the ending of the novel for the reader. The original forward contains an account of the
fate of the two major characters, Lolita who dies in childbirth and Humbert Humbert who dies of a
heart attack a few days before his trial was about to start. To be told the end of the story
before one begins suggests that we are moving into a world where the reader's expectations will be
constantly disappointed or rather fulfilled in ways they could not imagine. There are plenty of
hints in the forward about how this game will play itself out. I am not calling the central
relationship in the novel a game but rather its representation in language. We might be alerted
to the quality of play by the way the editor's initials double his junior relationship to the
world that is John Ray is JR who is also a JR a junior and this reminds us of another double name
that is the bizarre cognomen of the narrator's own invention Humbert Humbert. Or we might recognize
that the name of the mistress of Lolita's rescuer and second seducer the playwright Claire Guilty
is Vivian Darkbloom which is an anagram of Vladimir Nabokov. Or we might question the
statistic offered by the expert sexologist who informs John Ray that perhaps 12 percent of
American adult males enjoy the special experience of Humbert Humbert. Perhaps the name of this
expert would cause us to pause and wonder. Dr Blanche Schwarzman translates as white black man
a subtle reference to the game of chess perhaps or the way statistics reduce everything to a black
and white world. One could go on every sentence of Nabokov's because it is him of course who has
authored the forward every sentence is lined with illusion verbal play and the kind of dizzying
linguistic excess. We come to understand the character of John Ray Jr PhD as pompous self-important
moralizing and able to imagine only a Freudian model that is a psychoanalytical model of behavior
to explain Humbert's perversity. Recalling what Nabokov himself said about Freud
I think he's crude I think he's medieval and I don't like the idea of an elderly gentleman
from Vienna with an umbrella inflicting his dreams on me. Recalling this we might reject
the authority of the editor to explain Humbert's confession. If this is so then it means that we
cannot trust the forward to give us any insight into Humbert's confession. If the forward is
fictional then its relationship to the confessional is that of a double lie it lies about the lies in
the confession. We are now in danger of losing all hold on our sense of what is real and what is
imagined what is to be trusted and what must be seen with suspicion. Of course this unsettling
sense that we cannot identify the truth of the world we have entered is perhaps linked to our
sense that we need to know exactly what is morally acceptable and what is immoral or in the terms
preferred by our good Dr. Freud what is normal and what is perverse. This is of course precisely the
world Humbert Humbert spends his considerable skill in rejecting as an accurate description
of the world he once inhabited with Lolita or indeed of the place he inhabits even when he is
in prison charged with the murder of which he is obviously guilty. As philosopher John Hoosinger
puts it play is outside the range of good and bad. If we as readers respond to the text on its own
terms that is as play then we do not have have to either accept the authenticity of the editor
or repudiate it any more than we have to either exonerate Humbert Humbert or condemn him or believe
in his version of the story or reject it or think that his sexual preference is normal or perverse
and again I would stress that this response is not the same thing as condoning pedophilia. I am
not saying that pedophilia is a game and I am not saying that it does not deserve our censure.
I am arguing in effect that Lolita is a novel a work of the imagination and not an account
of a real relationship. If we accept then that the forward can be both a lie and yet speak the
truth perhaps we can retrieve from its elaborate subterfuge some hints some clues about the nature
of this narrative something to hold on to as we enter the simultaneously candid and duplicitous
universe of Humbert Humbert. Notice how I position the reader as the detective who has to seek out
clues in order to make a plausible story precisely one might say the task of the one who confesses
and the one who hears that confession the psychoanalyst or the magistrate.
One of those moments when we feel we should pay attention is when the editor himself makes a
confession. The psychoanalyst comes clean as it were by acknowledging that Humbert Humbert story
is seductive even to one such as he who has all the scientific training necessary to maintain
an objective distance from the enchanted web of words that the protagonist weaves.
John Ray insists that this tragic tale moves unswervingly to nothing less
than a moral apotheosis and that as readers we can recognize that Humbert Humbert is both
a shining example of moral leprosy and yet also a writer who can conjure up a tendresse
a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author.
American critic Lionel Trilling went even further in his assessment of the powerful seduction the
book exercises on its readers writing in 1958 he said we find ourselves shocked when we realize
that in the course of reading the novel we have come virtually to condone the violation it presents
we have been seduced into conniving in the violation because we have permitted our fantasies
to accept what we know to be revolting. Not all readers agree many continue to regard the
book as a defense of perversion elaborately concealed by baroque linguistic flourishes
even for those who see the book as indeed reaching a moral apotheosis there is still the question
of how one responds to this celebratory depiction of pedophilia especially in the context of our
heightened contemporary debate as with the depiction of Jim in Huck Twain's Huck Finn
one might ask whether the aesthetic pleasure is worth the cost in moral terms of the representation
Nabokov was quite clear that no one would confuse his book with pornography
its style and structure he said do not provide the necessary rising succession of erotic scenes
and it also lacks the minimal narrative interruption in this progressive escalation of sexual
engagement that pornography demands. Nabokov demanded a direct and adult response to the
subject matter of his book acknowledging as he said that my novel does contain various illusions
to the physiological urges of a pervert is quite true but after all we are not children
not illiterate juvenile delinquents not English public schoolboys who after a night of homosexual
romps have to endure the paradox of reading the ancients in expugated editions he was likewise
clear that the subject of the book was what prevented its acceptance by American publishers
according to Nabokov there were in the mid 50s three subjects that were utterly taboo sexual
perversity a happy and reproductively fruitful mixed marriage and a long and useful life lived
by an atheist Nabokov thus ably identified the three American obsessions then as now as sex race
and religion unlike John Ray jr who insists that there must be a moral to the story of
Humbert Humbert and Lolita and that this is what justifies its telling Nabokov's own defense
of his novel makes no moral claims but rests on aesthetic ones he argues that Lolita affords
what he calls aesthetic bliss that is the sense of being somehow somewhere connected with other
states of being where art that is curiosity tenderness kindness ecstasy is the norm of course
such a defense is not likely to convince the reader who insists that aesthetic bliss cannot
be produced by a morally repugnant subject a claim that has been employed of course repeatedly
over the centuries to censor books that various authorities have deemed heretical or obscene
there is a further claim made by Nabokov's assertion however which is a little more unsettling
in his statement Nabokov implies that his novel must afford the same kind of bliss to the reader
that Humbert's desire for Lolita affords him that art produces curiosity and ecstasy and
bliss and tenderness and indeed more than one reader has like the editor dr. Ray been
been seduced into developing some complicity with Humbert through the avenue of art for the
psychologist dr. Ray it is the moral apotheosis that Humbert experiences that redeems the book
but for others it might be rejecting as Humbert does the deadening bourgeois habits of the American
middle class as it is portrayed for example through Lolita's mother Charlotte Hayes and her
friends the follows or indeed as Humbert sometimes depicts even Lolita with her love of comic books
and girls magazines and soda bars and candy we see then that the reader comes to play many
different roles in this novel but two seem primary first the reader is seduced by Humbert into playing
the game of turning a perversity into a tendress and of coming to acknowledge the aesthetic beauty
of representation with which Humbert enchants even those who wish to condemn him
second the reader has to play detective and follow the clues left by Humbert to make sense of his
confession to decide in the end whether Humbert is mad and therefore unreliable or only pretending
to be mad and therefore unreliable in different ways as the teller of his own story or and this is
the most radical possibility whether the conventional distinction between madness and sanity and thus
between perverse and normal sexuality are themselves unreliable categories through which to make sense
of the world how does Nabokov craft the narrative and the character of Humbert to draw the reader
into these games let me offer two suggestions first of all we are enticed into the story of
Humbert's perverse desire for the nymphet Lolita through the double portals of convention and myth
that is Humbert's direct conventions of his early sexual adventures with Annabelle Lee when a youth
in the south of France metamorphose imperceptibly into a narrative of mythic enchantment in which
Humbert takes on a role somewhat akin to the gods entranced by mortal beauty Lolita is unfathomable
claims Humbert in the conventional terms that one uses to describe her nature she is halfway between
a woman and a child she embodies what Humbert calls the perilous magic of nymphets like Pearl the
daughter of Hester Prynne and Dimmesdale and a creature of the woods half human half enchantress
Lolita represents to Humbert something that only an artist can comprehend the narrative is replete
with mythological names like the hotel called the enchanted hunters where Lolita is first seduced
or seduces Humbert's narrative constantly refers to mythological tales and the capacity of the
estate to transform the ordinary into the magical indeed one of the ways in which Humbert seduces
the reader is to suggest that only our artists like him and us can understand what he means when he
speaks of Lolita's fragile beauty we are being morally seduced under the cloak of aesthetic
appreciation a normal man he says given a group photograph of schoolgirls or girl scouts and
asked to point out the comlias one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among them you
have to be an artist and a madman a creature of infinite melancholy with a bubble of hot poison
in your loins and a super voluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine oh how
you have to cringe and hide notice how the ordinary is revealed to be something different in the eyes
of the artist a group of schoolgirls or girl scouts are literally transformed before our eyes by the
words of the artist and the madman this uncanny ability to transform the apparently conventional
into the mythic is not only achieved by representing the ordinary through the eyes of the master
magician Humbert but by bringing into the bland and bourgeois world of mid-century America
the names and narratives of literary figures who add their own glamour to his story thus Annabelle
Lee the unconsumated first love that Humbert suggests might be at the heart of his desire for
young girls invokes Edgar Allen Poe to whom the book refers more than any other writer and
Poe's poem about the death of the youthful Annabelle Lee whose last name is spelled L-E-E
and thus reminds us of the second syllable of Lolita's name as Humbert says in the very
first words of his confession Lolita light of my life fire of my loins my sin my soul
Lolita the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palette to tap
at three on the teeth Lolita what Humbert is also counting on when he calls his first love
Annabelle Lee is that we will remember that in 1836 at the age of 27 Poe married his 13-year-old
cousin Virginia wrapping Humbert's tale of perversity under the cloak of culture and thus
appealing once again to the rare reader who will get the story Humbert also invokes other
men and their child brides Dante and the young Beatrice Petrarch and his Laura we are told that
when Petrarch fell madly in love with his Lorine she was a fair-haired nymphet of 12 running in
the wind in the pollen and the dust a flower in flight in refining his perverse desireful
Lolita through the screen of myth and culture Humbert convinces himself that he is an artist
searching for the elusive language that will capture the quality of the nymphet as the butterfly
collector searches for the elusive rare butterfly moreover he insists as he crafts his own defense
that he had no choice but to be true to his passion as an artist must be true to his vision no
matter where it leads him despite his much-wanted sensitivity and artistic soul however he fails
to see until it is too late that he has brutalized Lolita and destroyed her childhood abandoning her
to a man whose abuse is only less horrible because it is more honest my second point about how we're
drawn into this narrative he's very successful in doing this because despite the repeated evocations
of the mythic and the implausible coincidences that litter the narrative Humbert asks us to play
detective he is in jail he has committed a murder he has illegally and immorally seduced and sexually
tormented his stepdaughter but what exactly is he guilty of he offers us hints clues tormenting
half-truths and sometimes even straightforward plot summary something bad is about to happen he
might say he seems genuinely remorseful but for what moreover there is a quality of verisimilitude
that runs throughout the narrative not surprisingly given that Nabokov relied himself on the story
of a similar cross-country abduction for his for his story of Lolita and one that Humbert explicitly
refers to in his confession he says had I done to Dolly perhaps what Frank LaSalle a 50-year-old
mechanic had done to 11-year-old Sally Horner in 1948 while Nabokov is drawing on real-life cases
of pedophilia his novel has become the center of an ongoing debate about the connection between
the representation of morally offensive behavior and the prohibition of such behavior in real life
when Nabokov first approached his publisher with the type script of the novel
he was told that publishing the book would put both of them in jail after several refusals from
American publishers Olympia Press a Parisian publisher whose other authors included Samuel
Beckett Jean Genet and William S. Burroughs finally agreed to publish the novel in addition to such
avant-garde writers however Olympia Press also published poorly written sex novels with titles
like White Thighs and The Sexual Life of Robinson Crusoe the latter title is ironic
considering that the full title of Nabokov's novel is Lolita or the confession of a white
widowed male and that Humbert Humbert's confession is presented as a text that has passed through
the hands of an editor before it reaches the public precisely the fictional conventions that govern
the early 18th century novel the best known exponent of which is Daniel Defoe author of the
Confessions of Male Flanders and the Life and Strange Adventures of Robinson Crusoe
Novelist Graham Greene first drew attention to the literary value of the novel in an article
published in England in 1955 but the British Home Office was unimpressed and ordered customs
officials to seize all copies entering the United Kingdom the British also pressured the French
Minister of Culture to ban the book which he did and it remained so for two years Lolita was
distributed in America however without any legal battle and the sales of the first American edition
published in 1958 were no doubt no doubt helped by its notoriety abroad Lolita was the first book
since Gone with the Wind to sell a hundred thousand copies in the first three weeks of publication
it is perhaps surprising that in 1955 US customs agents were willing to allow Lolita to be
distributed in America after all DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover was still considered
an obscene book and would remain so until 1959 together with the trial of Henry Miller's Tropic
of Cancer which was finally published in America in 1964 the trial of Lady Chatterley's Lover would
be the beginning of the end of censorship merely on the grounds that its represent representation
of sexuality might offend the end came in a 1966 case memoirs v massachusetts in which the
supreme court examined John Clellan's memoirs of a woman of pleasure better known as Fanny Hill
and first published in 1750 the supreme court ruled that a book cannot be prescribed unless
it is found to be utterly without redeeming social value this is so even though the book is found to
possess the requisite prurient appeal and to be patently offensive the social values of the book
can either be weighed against nor canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness
it is one of the uncanny twists of literary history then that Lolita would be first published
in France with a publisher whose other books included many that resembled at least in content
if not in literary merit Fanny Hill the standard for judging a work that is obscene requires that
three conditions be met first that an average person applying contemporary community standards
finds that the material appeals to a prurient interest in sex second that it represents certain
sexual acts defined in state law in a patently offensive way and third that a reasonable person
would find that the material lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value
all three elements must be present for the material to be judged as obscene
the debate over the nature of the obscene cannot easily be resolved and perhaps law is not always
the place for that resolution Lolita's persistence suggests that even when we are horrified by the
capacity of human nature to harm the vulnerable we are nevertheless fascinated by the brilliance
with which the predator justifies his desire just as Humbert is tormented by his desire for Lolita
so too is the reader tormented by the belief that we can understand the pervert and that to
do so would somehow make his behavior less evil and our lives safer
