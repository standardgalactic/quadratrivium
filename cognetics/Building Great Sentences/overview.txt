1. Winston Weathers and Otis Winchester discuss the concept of suspensiveness in sentences, which they refer to as degrees of periodicity. They illustrate this through a series of examples starting with a simple sentence and progressively adding more elements to create varying levels of periodicity.

2. The original sentence is "red-tailed hawks hunt my meadow," which is loose in structure. By expanding the sentence, they show how additional information can be woven in to increase its periodicity, creating suspense by delaying the main clause until later in the sentence.

3. They demonstrate this with a series of variations on the original sentence, each one adding more details and varying the placement of those details to manipulate the reader's anticipation and engagement with the information being presented.

4. The key takeaway is that suspensiveness or periodicity in sentences is not an all-or-nothing proposition but rather exists on a continuum. Mastery of this continuum can enhance the effectiveness of writing by managing how information is revealed to the reader, creating a more dynamic and engaging prose.

1. **Grammar B and Its Features**: Grammar B, as described by Professor X in the context of postmodern grammar, features techniques that anticipate many elements found in contemporary electronic textuality, such as the web. Key characteristics of Grammar B include meta-commentary, repetition, refrains, lists, collage, montage, and synchronicity, which have clear parallels in modern digital media like hotlinks or mouseover animations.

2. **Double Voice**: A specific feature of Grammar B is the double voice, where the text can comment on itself or include tutorials within the narrative, as exemplified by a passage from John Barth's "Lost in the Funhouse." This self-reflexive technique is also seen in web page devices like hotlinks.

3. **Acknowledging Alternate Grammars**: The lecture emphasizes the importance of recognizing and acknowledging alternate grammars, such as Grammar B, even if they are not the primary focus of one's teaching. It suggests that educators should be honest with students about the existence of these alternative forms of grammar and style, rather than omitting them, which could be seen as a form of suppression.

4. **Style as a Problem vs. Style as a Gift**: The lecture contrasts two perspectives on prose styleâ€”one viewing it as a problem to be constructed and solved, and the other seeing it as a gift to be expressed and shared. Richard Graves describes style as "a way of finding and explaining what is true," emphasizing that the purpose of style is not to impress but to express truthfully. This aligns with Lewis Hyde's concept of gift giving, where the gift should keep moving, being passed from person to person, which can be likened to how style evolves and is shared among writers and readers.

5. **Course Offerings**: The lecturer offers the course as a gift of knowledge, encouraging students to pass along what they have learned through their writing. The lectures themselves are part of a series available for order from Teach 12, with contact information provided for further inquiry or purchasing the courses.

In summary, the lectures explore the concepts of Grammar B and its relevance to modern digital media, the importance of acknowledging different grammatical approaches, and the idea of style as a gift that should be passed along. The course is presented as an educational resource available for purchase, with an emphasis on sharing knowledge and continuing the tradition of gifting in the realm of writing and style.
