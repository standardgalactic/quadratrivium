Processing Overview for Thinking Differently
============================
Checking Thinking Differently/01 Individual Diversity and Collective Performance.txt
1. **Efficiency, Innovation, Robustness**: These outcomes require diversity. Diversity is not just beneficial; it's essential for creating a productive, innovative, and sustainable world. We must understand and maintain the right levels and types of diversity to enhance collective performance.

2. **Diversity Beyond Identity**: When discussing diversity, especially in human contexts, it often gets framed in terms of identity, which can lead to a zero-sum mentality where resources are thought to be divided among groups. However, the goal isn't about splitting a pie; it's about making a larger and better pie by leveraging diverse talents to see more clearly, find innovative solutions, and respond effectively to challenges.

3. **Personal Diversity**: Just as we emphasize diversity in groups, individuals are also complex and multifaceted. Understanding and tapping into one's own diversity can lead to greater productivity, innovation, and robustness in personal endeavors.

4. **The Importance of Mathematical Models**: To navigate the complexities of when and how diverse inputs contribute to better outcomes, we need mathematical models. These models will help us understand the conditions under which collaboration excels and where it might be counterproductive.

5. **The Value of Diversity for Its Own Sake**: Beyond the practical and pragmatic reasons for valuing diversity, it also enriches life by making it more interesting. Diversity is what gives cities like London or New York their vibrancy, makes the Earth more captivating than the moon, and turns an opera into a more compelling experience than a ballad.

6. **Effective Connections**: The key to harnessing diversity isn't just in having a wide variety of types but in creating proper connections and interactions between those diverse parts to ensure they function well together. This is true for ecosystems as well as human-made organizations and societies.

In summary, this course aims to explore the multifaceted nature of diversity, its importance across various domains, and how we can leverage it effectively to improve outcomes in both personal and collective contexts. Through a combination of theoretical understanding and practical application, we will learn how to navigate the complexities of diversity to achieve better results, create more interesting experiences, and enhance our lives and societies.

Checking Thinking Differently/02 Why Now The Rise of Diversity.txt
1. **Challenges of Modern Business**: In today's fast-paced world, businesses face complex problems that are constantly changing due to factors like technology, communication, and competition. Unlike math problems or one-time engineering challenges, these business issues require ongoing adaptation and solutions.

2. **The Importance of Diversity**: As businesses must adapt quickly to stay competitive, the diversity of a team becomes crucial. Cognitive diversity is particularly important in complex, ever-changing environments because it fosters creativity, innovation, and problem-solving.

3. **Historical vs. Modern Specialization**: In the past, specialization often led to isolation (e.g., assembly lines), where different workers would perform distinct tasks without much interaction. Today's cognitive specialization involves direct collaboration among individuals with diverse skills working together on complex tasks.

4. **Population and Globalization Trends**: There has been an increase in population diversity within countries, especially the United States, and a strengthening of global connections, leading to more interactions across different cultures and perspectives.

5. **Economic Shift from Physical to Cognitive Work**: The economy has shifted towards tasks that require cognitive skills, necessitating teamwork and collaboration among diverse individuals.

6. **The Gap Between Identity-Based Diversity and Cognitive Diversity**: While there is a lot of focus on identity-based diversity (gender, race, ethnicity), what's needed for problem-solving is cognitive diversityâ€”having people with different ways of thinking, problem-solving skills, and experiences working together.

In summary, the modern business environment demands both an increase in the diversity of teams and a focus on leveraging that diversity effectively for problem-solving and innovation. This requires recognizing and utilizing cognitive diversity to address complex challenges and capitalize on the benefits that diverse thinking brings to team performance.

Checking Thinking Differently/03 Diversity Squared.txt
1. **Talent Logic vs. Diversity Logic**: The talent logic approach favors hiring individuals who score highest on standardized tests or performance metrics, while diversity logic suggests that a diverse range of abilities and perspectives can lead to better outcomes, even if individual scores are lower.

2. **Hiring Decision Example**: Allie scored seven out of ten, Bourne and Charles both scored eight out of ten. According to talent logic, Bourne and Charles would be the ideal hires. However, diversity logic would argue for including Allie in the team because she might have unique insights on questions nine and ten that neither Bourne nor Charles possess.

3. **Problem-Solving Example**: Diversity logic suggests that when solving problems where the solution can be tested at low cost, it's beneficial to allow all employees to propose solutions rather than just the most talented individuals, as diverse perspectives may lead to innovative and effective solutions.

4. **Restructuring for Diversity**: Organizations often need to restructure their decision-making processes to fully leverage diversity. This can involve sharing power and encouraging contributions from people outside one's own silo or area of expertise.

5. **Identity and Cognitive Diversity**: A team with diverse identities may not necessarily have cognitive diversity. It's important for organizations to ensure that there is a mix of skills, experiences, and viewpoints to harness the full benefits of diversity.

6. **The Role of Affirmative Action**: Affirmative action policies aimed at achieving equal opportunity can lead to a more diverse candidate pool but also require ongoing efforts to ensure that the benefits of this diversity are fully realized within organizations.

7. **Diversity Bonus**: The diversity bonus refers to the improved performance and decision-making outcomes that can occur when a group is cognitively diverse, and each member contributes their unique perspective and problem-solving skills. This bonus is more likely to be realized if there is restructuring to facilitate the sharing of ideas and power within an organization.

In summary, while talent logic focuses on selecting individuals based on their performance metrics, diversity logic advocates for a broader approach that values the contributions of all team members, recognizing that diverse teams are often more innovative and effective in solving complex problems. This course will explore how to effectively implement this diversity bonus within organizations to enhance decision-making and outcomes.

Checking Thinking Differently/04 The Wisdom of Crowds.txt
1. **Wisdom of Crowds Phenomenon**: A group of individuals making independent decisions can often arrive at a collectively smart decision, as long as they have diverse information and opinions, and no individual or subset has a disproportionate influence on the decision-making process.

2. **Sources of Wisdom of Crowds**:
   - **Diverse Models**: Individuals use different models or frameworks to make predictions, which can lead to accurate outcomes because no single model is perfect.
   - **Idiosyncratic Errors**: Individuals make errors that are unrelated to the task at hand, and these errors tend to cancel each other out in a group setting.

3. **Base Rate Bias**: People often rely too heavily on their personal knowledge or experience when making predictions, which can lead to a bias towards what they already know (the base rate).

4. **Diversity in Predictions**: In situations where there is a high level of disagreement among individuals, it suggests that diverse information and models are being used, which increases the likelihood that the group's outcome will be more accurate than any individual prediction.

5. **Key Lesson**: For making predictions or forecasting, whether in an organizational setting or personal life, it is beneficial to include a variety of perspectives and models to leverage the collective intelligence of the group and overcome individual biases and errors. Diversity improves performance and leads to better outcomes.

Checking Thinking Differently/05 The Diversity Prediction Theorem Times Three.txt
1. **Diversity Prediction Theorem Quiz**: We're asked to consider if we can stack four diversity prediction theorems on top of each other, like in the children's book "Ten Apples Up On Top." The answer is yes, because after comparing the accuracy of two models (Bellcor and the ensemble), we see that they are equally accurate at five decimal points. However, when combined, they perform even better, with a 10.2% improvement.

2. **Combining Models**: The key insight from this lecture is that in predictive tasks, both individual talent and collective diversity contribute to collective accuracy. Combining models with different perspectives can lead to more accurate predictions than simply finding more talented individuals.

3. **Real-World Application**: A CEO of a company with an algorithm for predicting IRS audits was told that by combining his original algorithm with a new one, which used different data, he would likely improve the prediction's accuracy. The statistician confirmed that this combination would definitely lead to better results, emphasizing the importance of diversity in models and decision-making processes.

4. **General Insight**: In our daily lives, we should value and consider the opinions of others even if they are not more accurate than ours. Diverse perspectives can lead to a clearer picture of reality and more accurate predictions. The ensemble approach is a practical application of this principle.

5. **Conclusion**: While winning a million dollars or a prize like the Netflix prize is exciting, the most important takeaway from this lecture is the value of combining diverse models or opinions for better predictive outcomes. It's about leveraging collective diversity to enhance our ability to foresee events and make decisions.

Checking Thinking Differently/06 The Weighting Is the Hardest Part.txt
1. **Crowd Size and Composition**: When forming a crowd for predictions or decision-making, the size of the crowd and the diversity of its members are crucial. A smaller crowd should consist mostly of highly accurate individuals (like market researchers), whereas a larger crowd can benefit from a wider range of perspectives (like store managers). The larger crowd's collective inaccuracy is less critical due to the law of large numbers.

2. **Accuracy vs. Diversity**: In a small group, accuracy is more important than diversity because the lack of diverse opinions can lead to errors that are easily detected and corrected with precise data. Conversely, in a larger group, diversity is paramount because the collective wisdom of a varied group tends to be more robust and can cover more ground.

3. **Utilizing Multiple Crowds**: Alternatively, you can have separate smaller crowds (e.g., market researchers and store managers) and compare their predictions. Discrepancies between the two can indicate areas that require further investigation or deeper thinking, potentially leading to better insights.

4. **The Role of Waiting**: The process of waiting for a crowd's opinion can be challenging as it involves assessing who should be listened to and when. It's essential to ensure that the voices included are both accurate and diverse.

5. **Inclusion and Diversity**: A diverse group of contributors is more valuable than a homogenous one because it can provide a broader range of insights and perspectives. Including more people in the decision-making process can lead to better outcomes by leveraging their collective wisdom.

6. **The Waiting Process**: Finally, the waiting partâ€”the decision-making process after the crowd has been assembledâ€”should also take into account the diversity of thought within the group. The longer you wait and gather more information, the better your decision is likely to be. But remember, not all voices are equally valuable, so it's crucial to weigh accuracy and diversity appropriately.

In summary, when forming a crowd for predictions or problem-solving, consider the size of the group and the diversity of its members. Smaller groups should focus on high-accuracy individuals, while larger groups can benefit from a diverse set of opinions. Always be mindful of who is providing input and how their perspectives contribute to the decision at hand. Waiting for collective wisdom to emerge can be difficult, but it often leads to more informed and robust decisions.

Checking Thinking Differently/07 Foxes and Hedgehogs - Can I Be Diverse.txt
1. The difference between hedgehogs and foxes in forecasting lies in their approaches to prediction:
   - Hedgehogs take more extreme views based on a single overarching idea or ideology. They tend to be more confident and certain in their predictions, but they are prone to being less accurate because they may ignore information that contradicts their main belief.
   - Foxes consider many different perspectives and models when making predictions. They tend to be more conservative in their forecasts due to the averaging out of different viewpoints. They also respond better to new information because having multiple models allows for a wider range of data to fit into one of the models, thus reducing the likelihood of contradicting themselves or violating basic laws of probability.

2. Being a fox, with its many models and diverse perspectives, can lead to more accurate predictions but also comes with personal and cognitive costs:
   - Containing multitudes means being open to contradictory ideas, which can make a person appear illogical or inconsistent.
   - Foxes are less likely to be media darlings because strong, singular opinions are often more appealing to the public and media.

3. To become good diverse thinkers like foxes, we must:
   - Actively engage with multiple models and perspectives when analyzing situations or making predictions.
   - Obey the laws of probability by ensuring that the sum of all possible outcomes does not exceed one (i.e., avoiding overconfidence and ensuring a balanced view).

4. The challenge for most people is to resist the temptation to simplify complex issues into binary choices and instead embrace the cognitive workload of considering multiple models and outcomes, which requires effort but leads to more nuanced and potentially more accurate understanding of the world.

Checking Thinking Differently/08 Fermis Barbers - Estimating and Predicting.txt
1. **Fermi Estimation**: This is a method used to estimate quantities for which an exact measurement is difficult or impossible, by breaking the problem into smaller parts that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. It's useful when dealing with complex problems or situations where precise data is not available.

2. **Analogical Thinking**: This involves drawing parallels between a problem at hand and a similar situation for which there is known information, allowing one to make educated guesses based on the analogous relationship.

3. **Comparables**: A common real estate appraisal technique where the value of a property is determined by comparing it to similar properties that have recently sold in the same area. This method adjusts for differences between the subject property and the comparables.

4. **Linear Decomposition**: This approach involves decomposing the overall value (or any other quantity being estimated) into its constituent parts, assigning a value to each part, and then summing these values to arrive at an estimate.

5. **Self-Improvement**: Learning to make estimates is a skill that improves with practice and expert feedback. It's similar to learning any other skill, like playing the violin, where consistent practice and the ability to correct mistakes lead to improvement.

6. **Practice with Feedback**: By estimating values for things you can later verify (like the number of bricks in the Great Wall of China or the number of Indian restaurants in Raleigh, North Carolina), you can learn and refine your estimation skills, preparing you for making better predictions in the future.

7. **The Importance of Estimation**: The ability to make estimates is crucial for decision-making in a wide range of situations, from personal finance to business forecasting, where exact data may not be available or when planning for an uncertain future.

Checking Thinking Differently/09 Problem Solving.txt
1. **Problem Solving vs Prediction**: Problem solving is about finding solutions to specific challenges, while prediction involves forecasting future events or outcomes based on current data.

2. **Representation Matters**: The way we represent a problem can significantly influence our approach to solving it. Different perspectives can reveal different aspects of the problem.

3. **Heuristics Travel**: Strategies that are effective for one type of problem may be adapted and applied to another, potentially leading to innovative solutions or more efficient methods.

4. **Diversity in Tools and Talents**: The variety of tools and perspectives individuals bring to a team can lead to better problem-solving outcomes by complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses.

5. **Markov Theory Example**: A matrix representing transitions between states, such as weather conditions, can be analyzed using Markov theory, which provides insights into patterns and long-term behaviors.

6. **Further Learning**: The lecture sets the stage for exploring how different perspectives combine to solve problems and how heuristics can be recombined to foster innovation.

7. **Next Steps**: Future lectures will delve deeper into the mechanics of combining perspectives, the process of recombining heuristics to drive innovation, and the overall understanding of problem-solving processes.

Checking Thinking Differently/10 Diverse Perspectives.txt
1. **Value of Diverse Perspectives**: Diverse perspectives are crucial for problem-solving and innovation because they allow us to see new possibilities and avoid getting stuck in the current "adjacent possible." A random landscape of solutions is less likely to offer better adjacent possibilities than a well-informed, relevant perspective.

2. **Experience and Perspective Development**: As we gain experience and learn more diverse ways of thinking, we become better at generating useful new perspectives. Our past experiences enrich our understanding and ability to connect ideas across different domains.

3. **Perspectives Can Travel**: A solution or perspective developed for one purpose can often be repurposed for another. This is seen in nature, where evolution can lead to features being used for different functions (e.g., feathers leading to flight). Similarly, a seemingly irrelevant perspective (like masticity applied to ice cream) might hold value for a different product or problem (like breakfast cereal).

4. **Personal Relevance**: Personal experiences and identities can influence the perspectives we find valuable. For instance, someone with a background in a particular industry may naturally consider relevant factors that others might overlook.

5. **Continuous Learning**: We should continually seek out new experiences and knowledge to expand our pool of perspectives and become more adept at innovating and improving upon existing solutions.

6. **Historical Examples**: Throughout history, great thinkers like Einstein, Newton, and Mendeleev have reshaped our understanding of the world by introducing new, structured perspectives that bring order to chaos and unlock the adjacent possible in profound ways.

In essence, the talk emphasizes the importance of a rich tapestry of experiences and diverse perspectives for personal growth, problem-solving, and innovation. It also highlights how seemingly unrelated knowledge can spark valuable insights when applied in new contexts.

Checking Thinking Differently/11 Heuristics and the Adjacent Possible.txt
1. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making processes and help us navigate complex problems without needing to explore every possible option. They are often based on past experiences, intuition, or rules of thumb.

2. Human use of heuristics can lead to biases or errors, but they are essential for efficient problem solving in everyday life.

3. Organizations like Google and IBM use heuristic-based algorithms to process vast amounts of data and find solutions to complex problems, often outperforming individual human efforts due to the sheer scale and speed of computation.

4. The drowning ants analogy illustrates market competition as a form of natural selection, where only the fittest businesses survive. This process can lead to high-quality products but requires a diverse initial pool of competitors.

5. Computers excel at following heuristics due to their ability to process information quickly and accurately. They can automate tasks that once required human intervention, such as spell checking or playing games like Rush Hour.

6. Despite the advancements in computer capabilities, humans have an edge when it comes to dealing with complex, abstract problems like "What is the meaning of life?" or "How do we create art?" because these questions require a level of creativity and consciousness that computers lack.

7. Diversity in perspectives is crucial for problem solving, as different viewpoints can lead to more robust and innovative solutions.

8. In the next lecture, we will combine insights from heuristics and perspectives to understand the power of diversity in problem-solving scenarios. The lecture will emphasize why diverse teams often outperform individual high-ability individuals, especially when dealing with complex, ambiguous, or poorly defined problems.

Checking Thinking Differently/12 Diversity Trumps Ability.txt
1. **Diversity and Problem Solving**: The lecture discusses how diversity in problem-solving can lead to better solutions. It suggests that a group with diverse tools (abilities, knowledge, perspectives) can find global optima more effectively than a group of similar individuals.

2. **Local vs. Global Optima**: A key point is the distinction between local and global optima. Local optima are the best solutions within a certain region of the solution space, while global optima are the optimal solutions across the entire space. Diversity can help navigate through different regions to find the best overall solution.

3. **Intersection of Expertise**: The lecture illustrates that when diverse experts with different local optima intersect, they can combine their knowledge to achieve a better outcome than any one expert could alone.

4. **Implicit Assumptions**: The model assumes no communication problems and no costs associated with trying new solutions. It also assumes that the solutions proposed are reversible or adaptable.

5. **Potential Drawbacks of Diversity**: While diversity is generally beneficial, there are situations where it might not be, depending on the problem's characteristics and constraints.

6. **Communication and Irreversibility**: Communication costs and errors can affect the outcome when solving problems, especially those that are irreversible like cooking a broth. In such cases, a single decision-maker might be more effective.

7. **Military Strategy and Cooking**: The lecture uses examples from military strategy and cooking to illustrate points about the benefits of diversity and the challenges of too many cooks in an irreversible process.

8. **Application to Real-world Problems**: The concepts discussed can be applied to a wide range of real-world problems such as energy, poverty, education, healthcare, and environmental issues. Having diverse tools and perspectives is crucial for tackling these complex challenges effectively.

In conclusion, diversity in problem-solving is generally beneficial when it comes to finding the best solutions. However, it's important to consider the specific context and constraints of the problem at hand to determine the right balance of diversity.

Checking Thinking Differently/13 Digging Holes and Splicing Genes.txt
1. **GPA and LSAT Score Limitations**: While GPA and LSAT scores are important metrics for law school admissions, they do not capture the full range of a student's abilities, experiences, and potential contributions to the field of law. These tests focus on analytical skills but overlook other aspects like creativity, passion, problem-solving, and adaptability.

2. **Holistic Admissions**: Admissions committees consider a variety of factors beyond GPA and LSAT scores when evaluating applicants for graduate programs. They look for evidence of diverse experiences, a wide range of skills, and a demonstrated commitment to the field of law or relevant areas of study.

3. **Wisdom and Multiple Perspectives**: Wisdom in problem-solving, which is highly valued in legal practice, involves taking in multiple perspectives, applying flexible rules, recognizing the limits of knowledge, and learning from diverse experiences. These qualities are not fully captured by GPA.

4. **Relevant Classes and Learning Tools**: Colleges may calculate GPAs based on relevant classes to ensure that students have learned the necessary tools for their field of study. A high GPA in unchallenging courses does not guarantee success or preparedness for graduate studies.

5. **Purposeful Education**: The most successful students are those who approach their education with a clear purpose, mission, or goals and choose coursework that will equip them with the tools they need to achieve these objectives.

6. **Lifelong Learning**: Continuous learning and self-improvement are crucial for personal and professional growth. Ben Franklin's daily plan, which emphasizes reflecting on how one can do good each day, illustrates a mindset of constant learning and ethical consideration.

7. **Diversity and Wisdom**: Diversity in experiences and thought is essential for developing wisdom, which is highly valued in the legal profession. It allows individuals to approach problems from different angles and to understand complex situations from multiple perspectives.

In summary, while GPA and LSAT scores are significant factors in law school admissions, they do not encompass the full spectrum of a student's potential or their capacity for success in law. A holistic approach that considers a wide range of experiences, skills, and personal attributes is essential for identifying candidates who will thrive in legal education and practice.

Checking Thinking Differently/14 Ability and Diversity.txt
 In this lecture, Daniel discusses how the concept of a toolbox can be used to understand abilities and diversity within teams. He explains that each person's skill set is like a tree in a toolbox, with different branches representing various skills and knowledge areas. The size of the tree can be seen as a measure of a person's overall ability, while the variety and distribution of tools on the tree represent their diversity.

Daniel emphasizes that a diverse team, where members possess different skills, can outperform a group of high-ability individuals who all have similar skill sets. This is because diversity leads to more perspectives and ideas, which can improve problem-solving and decision-making.

He also touches on the concept of "team IQ," suggesting that groups can indeed be evaluated for their collective intelligence. Successful teams are not just composed of the most able individuals but are characterized by members who are open to each other's contributions, share information, listen to one another, and respect different viewpoints. This openness and respect enable teams to leverage their diversity effectively, leading to better group performance.

In summary, Daniel argues that for teams to be successful, they should aim for a combination of high overall ability and a diverse set of skills among team members. He suggests that in hiring or assembling teams, it's beneficial to consider both the individual abilities (toolbox size) and the diversity of skills (the distribution and variety of tools) to create a team that can perform well on a range of tasks.

Checking Thinking Differently/15 Combining and Recombining Heuristics.txt
1. **Idea Recombination and Economic Growth**: The lecture discusses the importance of recombining existing ideas to drive economic growth. History has shown that significant advancements, like trains and the internet, have come from combining previous inventions in new ways.

2. **Patents and Idea Freedom**: There's an ongoing debate about whether ideas should be free or if they should be patented to allow people to cash in on their innovations. The speaker has evolved his thinking to appreciate the argument for setting ideas free, as it allows for a broader exploration of recombinations that can lead to new and beneficial applications.

3. **Brokers of Ideas**: Just as cities foster productivity by allowing different ideas to collide and be combined, societies need to create environments where both the production of new ideas and their subsequent brokering are encouraged. Companies are increasingly recognizing this by giving employees time off to generate new ideas.

4. **Market Forces and Information Webs**: The market and collective intelligence (wise crowds) can help sift through the plethora of ideas generated, distinguishing between what is useful and what needs refinement.

5. **Open Questions on Intellectual Property**: The lecture raises a contentious question about whether to protect intellectual property through patents or to let ideas be freely shared. The speaker acknowledges that there's no clear answer but suggests that we want both new medicines, products, and ideas, as well as the freedom for others to improve upon them.

6. **Cities as Idea Hubs**: The productivity of people in cities may be due to the frequent collision of diverse ideas, which facilitates the specialization and refinement of those ideas, leading to economic growth.

In summary, the lecture emphasizes the power of recombining existing ideas to create new value and suggests that a balance between protecting intellectual property and allowing free sharing of ideas may be crucial for continued innovation and growth. It also highlights the role of cities as idea hubs and the importance of creating social structures that support both the generation and brokering of ideas.

Checking Thinking Differently/16 Beware of False Prophets - No Free Lunch.txt
1. Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that help individuals make decisions and solve problems more efficiently. They are particularly valuable when facing complex problems where exhaustive analysis is impractical.
   
2. Books in management, self-help, and even architecture often provide heuristics to guide readers towards finding better solutions. For example, the heuristic of light from two sides in architecture can enhance the quality of a space.

3. Domain-specific heuristics can sometimes be applied successfully in different domains. An architect's ideas might influence software designers because both domains share underlying principles that can be abstracted and reapplied.

4. The No Free Lunch Theorem states that no heuristic is universally better than any other across all problems, but within a specific domain or type of problem, certain heuristics will perform significantly better.

5. Heuristics are conditional and their effectiveness depends on an individual's understanding and experience with the class of problems they are trying to solve.

6. To tackle complex problems effectively, individuals should have a diverse set of heuristics at their disposal, drawing from various domains and experiences.

7. The concept of crowd sourcing leverages the collective intelligence and diverse toolsets of many individuals to find solutions that might be beyond the capabilities of a single person. In the next lecture, we will explore how modern technology enables this collaborative approach to problem-solving.

Checking Thinking Differently/17 Crowdsourcing and the Limits of Diversity.txt
1. **Crowdsourcing Challenges**: When faced with many possible solutions, groups can become cognitively overloaded, leading to poor decision-making, a phenomenon known as the "paradox of choice." A solution to this is having an "oracle" â€“ a tool or method that accurately, quickly, and cheaply evaluates potential solutions.

2. **Oracles**: An oracle provides immediate feedback on the effectiveness of a solution. Goldcorp had a nearly perfect oracle for finding gold â€“ they could test their hypotheses in real-time. Netflix also benefits from an oracle through its recommendation system that provides immediate user feedback.

3. **Problems Without Oracles**: Many problems, such as improving education or ending poverty, lack oracles because the results can take years or decades to manifest. These are difficult to crowdsource effectively due to the lack of immediate feedback on the solutions' success.

4. **Complexity Not Necessary**: A problem doesn't have to be complex to lack an oracle; even simple tasks like designing a coffee table are hard to crowdsource without an oracle.

5. **Music and Oracles**: Writing popular music currently lacks an oracle, but computer programs that predict sales can act as proxies for success in the music industry.

6. **Threadless' Success**: Threadless, a t-shirt company, uses crowdsourcing without an oracle for design submissions. They rely on a diverse group of people to generate ideas and then use another crowd to select the most popular designs.

7. **Double Crowdsourcing**: The future of problem-solving involves using diverse crowds not just for idea generation but also for evaluation, combining the "diversity trumps ability" principle with predictive models.

8. **The Future of Crowdsourcing**: In the future, crowdsourcing will likely involve both human and computer participation in both stagesâ€”idea generation and evaluationâ€”enhancing the process's effectiveness and efficiency.

9. **Potential Impact**: The use of diverse crowds as oracles has the potential to revolutionize how we create new products, generate ideas, discover cures for diseases, and enrich our lives. It represents a significant shift in problem-solving and decision-making processes.

Checking Thinking Differently/18 Experimentation, Variation, and Six Sigma.txt
1. **Variation and Selection**: In evolution, variation within a population is followed by selection to keep only those forms that are best suited to their environment. This process of natural selection leads to adaptation over time.

2. **Six Sigma**: The concept of Six Sigma aims for near perfection in a process by reducing variability. It's a methodology for improving quality and operational processes by identifying and removing the causes of defects (errors) and minimizing variability.

3. **Strategic Choice of Variation**: The amount of variation should be strategically chosen based on context. In stable environments, low variation (Six Sigma) is beneficial to maintain consistency. However, in dynamic environments where the landscape changes, higher variation may be necessary to adapt and innovate.

4. **Innovation vs. Stability**: Rock stars and artists often benefit from high variation to keep audiences engaged, while chain stores like Starbucks benefit from low variation to ensure a consistent customer experience.

5. **Adaptation and Landscape Changes**: In evolution, when the landscape becomes less steep (less selective pressure), we see more variation as a way for populations to adapt faster. Similarly, in economic or social contexts, when a dominant solution is no longer working well due to an impending change, increased variation can lead to better solutions.

6. **The Role of Variation**: Variation is crucial for exploration and innovation. It's the engine of evolution and adaptation. In human endeavors, it's what leads to novel products, services, and ideas that can thrive in a changing world.

7. **Lessons from Evolution**: The evolutionary process provides insights into managing variation in human contexts. For example, when a "peak" solution is stable, we go for Six Sigma; but when the environment changes, we need to explore more to find new solutions.

8. **Historical Context**: Historically, tools like forks evolved and sometimes reverted to earlier designs as they became effective (reaching a peak on the landscape). Similarly, in fashion, art, and ideas, variation increases before a paradigm shift.

In summary, the lecture emphasizes that variation is not just about making mistakes; it's a strategic tool for adaptation, innovation, and survival. It's a source of new ideas and improvements, but it must be managed carefully to ensure consistency where needed and novelty where beneficial.

Checking Thinking Differently/19 Diversity and Robustness.txt
1. **Requisite Variety**: This principle by William J. Ashby suggests that an organism or system must have a variety of responses equivalent to the variety of perturbations (disturbances) it experiences to cope with its environment effectively. In terms of our bathroom example, we need a range of tools like washers and patch kits to address various issues, but not so many tools that we're overwhelmed or using inappropriate ones like a chainsaw.

2. **Portfolio Effects**: Diversity within a system can lead to resilience. Just as a financial portfolio becomes more stable with a diverse set of investments, a system with a variety of components is less likely to fail if one component does. Xerox's decision to let Apple use their mouse technology is an example of this, where Xerox's lack of interest in consumer computing allowed Apple to capitalize on the technology and succeed.

3. **Redundancy and Overlap**: Having multiple tools or systems that can perform similar functions provides resilience. If one fails, another can take over. This is evident in government systems, where checks and balances (like Congress, political parties, the courts, and public opinion) serve as redundant mechanisms to prevent any single entity from gaining too much power. This concept of "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again" emphasizes the importance of diverse attempts to address problems, each approached differently.

In summary, diversity in responses (requisite variety), a range of tools or systems (portfolio effects), and redundancy with overlapping functions (redundancy and overlap) all contribute to the robustness and resilience of a system. This helps ensure that if one part fails, there are other parts that can step in and take over to maintain functionality and adaptability.

Checking Thinking Differently/20 Inescapable Benefits of Diversity.txt
1. **Benefits of Diversity**: The lecture emphasizes that diversity, even without explicit synergies between different types within a collection (like a team or an ecosystem), can lead to better performance due to averaging and diminishing returns to scale. This means that as long as negative interactions between diverse types are not overwhelmingly detrimental, the collection with more diverse types will typically outperform one with fewer or more homogeneous types.

2. **Historical Trend**: Historically, human societies have tended to favor positive-sum games (non-zero interactions), which create synergies and benefits for all parties involved. This is according to Robert Wright's thesis in his book "Non-Zero."

3. **Self-Selection of Diverse Systems**: Over time, systems that engage in positive-sum interactions tend to be selected for because they are more productive and robust. This self-selection process can be seen in various aspects of human society, including trade, family units, cultural identities, and even our genetic evolution.

4. **Synergies**: When synergies are added into the mix, the benefits of diversity are further enhanced. Synergies are positive interactions that create additional value beyond what would be expected from averaging alone.

5. **Potential Collapse Without Diversity**: If a society or system chooses to eliminate diversity and only engage in zero-sum games (where one party's gain is another's loss), it could lead to the system's collapse due to a lack of resilience and adaptability.

6. **Overall Implication**: The overall message is that diversity leads to better performance and resilience, not just because of synergies but also because of averaging and diminishing returns to scale. Throughout history, human societies have been selected for their ability to engage in positive-sum interactions, which inherently encourage diversity. Without diversity, systems risk becoming vulnerable and potentially collapse.

Checking Thinking Differently/21 The Historical Value of Diversity.txt
1. **Jared Diamond**: Societies often collapse due to cultural and institutional factors that prevent innovation, leading to a failure to adapt to environmental challenges or technological changes.

2. **Mancur Olson**: For a society to innovate and grow, it must be open and pluralistic, allowing for the diverse skills of its people to contribute to new solutions and economic prosperity.

3. **Joseph Tainter**: Societal complexity can lead to collapse because as complexity increases, the benefits from increased complexity decrease while the costs remain constant or increase, leading to diminishing returns.

4. **Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler**: Social networks influence individual behaviors, and these behaviors can have widespread impacts on society.

5. **Yuval Noah Harari**: Humans have a unique ability to believe in shared fictions (like money, nations, or gods), which allows for cooperation at scale, but also leads to the potential for mass destruction if those beliefs turn hostile.

6. **Marshall McLuhan**: Media and technology shape and change cultures. The print-based culture was standardized, leading to a world where everyone could understand each other and facilitating global connectivity, but also creating challenges in an increasingly digital age.

7. **Tim Berners-Lee**: The open nature of the internet has led to unprecedented levels of innovation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, which has transformed societies and economies.

8. **Craigslist**: An example of innovation that disrupted the newspaper industry, illustrating both the creative potential and destructive impact of new technologies on established industries.

9. **Joseph Schumpeter**: Economic development is driven by innovation and creative destruction, where old products, processes, and organizations are destroyed to make way for new ones.

10. **Robert D. Atkinson and Stephen J. Ezell**: Countries that encourage innovation through research and development, education, and open competition are more likely to experience economic growth and success.

11. **Richard Florida**: Diversity and creativity are critical for economic and social vitality, with diverse places attracting talented individuals who drive innovation and economic success.

12. **Rochester's Library**: A metaphor for the open access to knowledge and ideas that can lead to societal progress and innovation, as well as a reminder of the importance of freedom in shaping a society's future.

Checking Thinking Differently/22 Homophily, Incentives, and Groupthink.txt
1. **Leap Before You Look**: To avoid groupthink and mimicry, encourage individuals to propose ideas initially without overly analyzing them first. This approach allows for a wider range of ideas to be introduced and considered before people start influencing each other.

2. **Change the Culture**: Foster a culture that values constructive conflict, where it's acceptable to disagree. This can prevent people from mimicking one another and encourage diverse perspectives. Companies like Intel, under Andy Grove's leadership, have emphasized this approach.

3. **Green Fields or Tiger Teams**: Isolate groups of people to work on separate projects. This prevents them from directly influencing each other while still allowing for recombination of ideas and benefits later on.

4. **Limit Communications**: Reduce the influence of individuals with high charisma or extensive contacts who can speed up the process of mimicry by limiting the amount and type of communication within a group.

5. **Encourage Mutation, Not Copying**: Instead of copying what others are doing, encourage people to seek out different sources of information and inspiration. This could mean reading about different historical figures or adopting new strategies that diverge from the prevailing trends.

6. **Combat Homophily by Mixing People Up**: Ensure diversity in experiences by physically and socially mixing people up within an organization, whether through changing office assignments or rotating positions.

7. **Exposure to Diverse Experiences**: As Montaigne suggests, exposure to a variety of life experiences, fancies, and customs is crucial for personal development and innovation. This can be achieved by actively seeking out different perspectives and ways of thinking.

By implementing these strategies, organizations and individuals can mitigate the effects of mimicry and conformity, leading to more creative, diverse, and innovative outcomes.

Checking Thinking Differently/23 The Problem of Diverse Preferences.txt
1. **Preference Diversity Challenges**: The lecture discusses the challenges that arise due to preference diversity among individuals or groups, particularly when multiple veto players are involved in decision-making processes. This diversity can lead to suboptimal outcomes, as seen in the Democratic Party's focus on equity potentially conflicting with efficiency considerations in the other party.

2. **Cycles of Preference Diversity**: In situations where each person's preference is rational but opposed to the others, a collection of individuals can end up making irrational decisions due to the interdependent nature of their preferences. This is similar to the rock-paper-scissors dynamic where one strategy defeats another, leading to unpredictable and suboptimal outcomes.

3. **Strategic Misrepresentation**: Individuals may misrepresent their true preferences to achieve more moderate outcomes that might be more acceptable to everyone involved, which can be seen as a strategic behavior rather than outright deception.

4. **Impact on Problem Solving**: Preference diversity can hinder problem-solving efforts, where the benefits of diverse perspectives and heuristics are offset by the inefficiency of groups spending significant effort to arrive at no better solution than if they had fewer preferences to consider.

5. **Reduced Incentive for New Policies**: The potential for vetoes from other parties with different preference priorities can discourage individuals from proposing new policies, leading to a status quo bias and less innovation in governance or policy-making.

6. **Humility and Understanding**: The lecture emphasizes the importance of humility in recognizing the limitations and challenges that preference diversity presents, linking it to the broader implications of diversity on outcomes.

7. **Coping with Diverse Preferences**: The course sets the stage for addressing these challenges in the next lecture, promising to explore solutions and strategies for managing diverse preferences while leveraging the benefits of cognitive diversity.

Checking Thinking Differently/24 The Team. The Team. The Team..txt
1. **Cognitive Diversity as an Engine of Progress**: A shared objective within teams and organizations allows for the effective utilization of cognitive diversity, driving innovation and problem-solving.

2. **Challenges in Governance**: Unlike businesses, governments must serve diverse populations with varying preferences and moral values, making policy-making more complex and requiring robust institutional arrangements to navigate this diversity.

3. **The Role of Political Systems**: The success of a political system is tied to its ability to manage diversity effectively, freeing up cognitive diversity while tapping into it for societal benefit.

4. **Compromise and Collaboration**: Acknowledging that preference diversity can lead to the identification of different problems, compromise and collaboration are essential for the betterment of all within a political system.

5. **Continual Learning and Adaptation**: As individuals within society, we must continually acquire new tools and perspectives to stay relevant and adaptive in a world that is constantly changing.

6. **Embracing Diversity**: As a society, we should encourage diversity of thought and maintain it despite the natural human tendency to conform. This requires intentional effort to foster thinking outside the norm.

7. **Whitman's Advice**: Embracing our inherent complexity and the multitudes within us is crucial for personal growth and societal advancement.

In summary, the key to thriving in a complex world is to maintain cognitive diversity, encourage preference diversity, and foster an environment where both can coexist effectively, leading to innovation and improvement of society. Individual learning and adaptation are essential, as is collective compromise and collaboration within a diverse and changing political landscape.
