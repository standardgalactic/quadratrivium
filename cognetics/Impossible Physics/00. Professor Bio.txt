The lecture is Benjamin Schumacher, professor of physics at Kenyon College, where he has
taught for 20 years.
He received his BA from Hendricks College and received his PhD in theoretical physics
from the University of Texas at Austin in 1990.
Professor Schumacher is the author of numerous scientific papers and books, including Physics
in Spacetime, an introduction to special relativity, and is the co-author of Quantum
Processes, Systems and Information.
As one of the founders of Quantum Information Theory, Professor Schumacher introduced the
term Qubit, invented quantum data compression, also known as Schumacher compression, and
established several fundamental results about the integral, the University of Innsbruck,
and the University of Queensland.
At Kenyon College, Professor Schumacher mostly teaches physics, but he also regularly ventures
into astronomy, mathematics, scientific computing, and the humanities.
Professor Schumacher has prepared the course guidebook that comes with these lectures.
The course guidebook includes a detailed outline of each lecture, a glossary, biographical
notes, and a bibliography.
To get the most out of this course, you may find it useful to review these materials before
or after each lecture.
