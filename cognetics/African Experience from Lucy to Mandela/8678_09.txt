Lecture 9, Ethiopia, Outpost of Christianity
Welcome.
In our last lecture, we offered a very broad survey of religious themes in African history,
including the spread of Islam and Christianity.
For a very long time, well over a thousand years, in fact, there was really only one
place in Africa where Christianity could be called the dominant religion, Ethiopia.
In this lecture, we examine the unique history of Ethiopia over the long haul, and indeed
this is one of those times in the course where I will stay with the subject for the sake
of continuity.
In this case, I'm going to carry it forward up to the present.
I must say off the bat that Ethiopia is one of those places in Africa which seems to exert
a very magnetic pull on many outsiders.
I don't think I've ever met an American Ethiopianist who didn't consider it sort of the natural
course of things that one would choose to exert your energy in studying this place.
They look at you as if you're a little bit crazy to consider anything else.
Much of Ethiopia is high and mountainous country.
It is associated with the great rift that we talked about in the second and third lectures
that tectonic plate movement which is responsible for the Red Sea, the great lakes of East Africa,
and so forth.
The volcanic and therefore rather fertile nature of the soils in Ethiopia has meant
that for a very long time indeed, because Ethiopia certainly has one of the longest histories
of agriculture anywhere in the world, for a very long time indeed it has sustained and
supported quite high population density even in the late 20th, 21st century when we have
heard on a number of occasions of devastating droughts and famine indeed in Ethiopia.
Its population density remains among the highest in Africa.
In the first centuries AD a kingdom emerged in the area, the region we call Ethiopia.
Its original name was Axum.
The basis of the kingdom's wealth was agricultural as we might expect but its external trade was
largely in ivory, a theme that we'll encounter on a number of occasions in the next couple
of lectures.
In this case the principal entrepot for trade between the interior, the Axumite kingdom,
and the outside world was the Red Sea port of Adullis.
The people's language here was Ghez, the basis of modern Amharic, and they had already in
these first few centuries of the modern era developed their own quite unique literary
script and it is indeed unique.
There are a number of places where one sees script worked into works of art in great
tapestries and so forth, sort of a book of Kells style where the written word will be
embroidered and embellished and become part of the artwork and it's a very striking component
of a number of the works of art to come out of this part of the world, Amharic, an early
literary script out of Africa.
They built already in these centuries tall stone monoliths known as Stelle to mark the
tombs of rulers and some of these still stand today.
If you think of Cleopatra's needle in central London, right on the Thames but of course not
originally built there, taken from Egypt and brought there, that is a very similar style
to these monoliths called Stelle.
Now we mentioned in our overview in the last lecture that a particular strain of Christianity
developed early on in North Africa specifically in Egypt and became the dominant strain there.
This was Coptic Christianity committed among other things to a monophysite that is a single
divine nature of Christ and became the dominant form of Christianity there although of course
eventually greatly overshadowed in Egypt by Islam.
Coptic Christians from Alexandria in Egypt arrived in the fourth century AD in Ethiopia
and in fact they achieved or got their great prize when the early Ethiopian king or I should
say Axomite at this point, Axomite king converted to Christianity during his reign from 330
to 350 AD.
This is the same King Isana by the way who eventually was responsible for dealing the
death blow to the old iron production center of Meroe in the Kushite kingdom of Nubia.
Now by the eighth century or so the rulers of Axom buffeted by Arab Muslim pressure
predominantly from the east as well as Persian had retreated further south well into the
central highlands of modern Ethiopia.
This relatively greater degree of isolation developed a distinctive strain of Coptic Christianity
in the Ethiopian church.
It was marked on one hand by a very strong monastic tradition and if you ever get a chance
to see the film footage of some of the monks who have established monasteries high up on
these cliff sides or cliff tops and reaching it only by means of a series of rope ladders
which they then pull up after them you definitely do get the impression that these were monks
determined to in a sense leave the world behind.
Strong monastic tradition on one hand but on the other the church hierarchy was very
worldly indeed and indeed in a quite material sense.
They eventually controlled great wealth and vast domains of Ethiopia's land.
Now to jump forward a bit in 1150 the founders of the so-called Zagwe dynasty seized power
again we see a succession of dynasties not quite as many as we saw in ancient Egypt not
quite as long obviously but nonetheless a similar kind of dynamics seized power and
ushered in an era of aggressive Christian expansion in the region.
In the early 13th century Christian monks began building a series of churches out of
solid mountain rock carved out of solid mountain rock.
These churches in Kevin Shillington's words testament to the strength and fervor of the
Ethiopian Christian church remain among the most astonishing architectural marvels of
sub-Saharan Africa.
You know maybe I shouldn't even qualify that by saying sub-Saharan I'm not sure anything
can be compared to Egyptian pyramids I guess it's a matter of sort of choose your your
marvel here but this was not a case of constructing churches with stone carved or taken from
quarries or what have you.
This was taking the monolith itself the huge part of a mountain a flattish part of a mountainous
region usually and essentially sculpting a church out of it complete with the pillars
and seats and alters and so forth so again it may be closer to sculpture than construction
as we as we normally think of it incredible churches.
Now in 1270 we have another dynastic change and this ushered in the dynasty most famous
in Ethiopian history known as the Salamanid dynasty.
Now Salamanid obviously is a reference to none other than the legendary King Solomon
of the Old Testament in in this case and I must say this is where Ethiopia's religious
history gets to be very intriguing and interesting indeed.
There came to be what to call them legends myths stories about the origins of Ethiopia
and of the Ethiopian yes of the entire culture and its religious life which goes something
like this long before the birth of Christ none other than the Queen of Sheba who does
appear in the Bible a number of cases and is always assigned to Ethiopia however it's
important to clarify that in sources like the the the Bible Ethiopia was a very generalized
term it didn't necessarily apply to you know what I've called axon in the process of becoming
you know the Ethiopian King of Ethiopia is a very generic term and it basically referred
to you know sort of any part of inner Africa any part of unquestionably black Africa.
So you know the notion that there was a Queen of Sheba from the Ethiopia we're talking
about or even that there was ever a Queen of Sheba at all many consider this quite a
mythical figure perhaps open to question back to our story though Queen of Sheba leaves
goes to you know ancient Israel essentially meets King Solomon and you know Boy meets
girl at this point King meets Queen and in fact Solomon and Sheba have a child and they
named they named David. Now David eventually according to this this line of of founding
mythology takes the name of Minelik obviously a much more localized name as opposed to the
the the biblical David and is considered sort of in this retelling of it the the founder
of the Ethiopian state and in fact he goes further than this the Ark of the Covenant
maybe the most what revered artifact of all of the Old Testament and probably
you know created something like 1250 BC or something you know a beautiful box basically
but lined and covered with with fine gold and originally designed apparently to hold the
the two tablets of the the Ten Commandments you know written by the finger of God and so forth.
The Ark of the Covenant has been missing for a very long time and and the the Ethiopian
Church's explanation for this is that Minelik our son of Solomon and Sheba actually brought
it with him to Ethiopia and the the monks the church clergy in Ethiopia in fact very
definitely claimed to this day that the Ark of the Covenant is inside a particular one of these
these Christian churches in Ethiopia now no one and I mean no one is allowed Ethiopian
African European outsider insider to see the Ark of the Covenant so obviously it's a difficult
sort of thing to to establish maybe that's not a significance though replicas of the Ark of the
Covenant are which are called Tabot TABOT Tabot are in fact placed in every single one of Ethiopia's
twenty something thousand Christian churches and they're brought out as part of religious
processions etc etc now again with the cold eye of the historian it's it's rather hard to accept
this after all Solomon lives in about the ninth century BC the Kingdom of Aksum certainly has
been established by radiocarbon dating to the early centuries AD nonetheless faith that's what
we're getting at here and again this has not only Christian connotations but in a sense connotations
from the Old Testament as well I might mention that you know I've been speaking of a Christian
outpost in in Africa but in fact there was a community in Ethiopia for a very long time and
there's still some remnants of it which was quite self-consciously Jewish as was an African
Jewish community known as the Fallasha a great number of them have actually left Ethiopia now
they came under considerable persecution particularly after the the fall of Haile Selassie that will
come to in the 1970s and actually a substantial number of them now have immigrated to where else
to Israel and have been accepted in in Israel at this point so there is a smaller but nonetheless
present Jewish tradition here as well now this new Solomon dynasty however grandiose it's it's
stories of origins in fact cease-building in stone in fact began a period over a couple of centuries
where the capital was moved rather frequently apparently in part because of exhaustion and
natural resources some of the environmental deterioration in this heavily populated part of
Africa may indeed have have begun to to show its face at this point after all when I mentioned
early on that Ethiopia has become known for rather tragic kinds of famines and so forth the first of
the bob geldorf bob yes bob geldorf organized aid concerts and so forth which was in 1985
was specifically stimulated by excruciating imageries of famine out of of Ethiopia so
both feast and famine present in the long run of this this history now over the next several
centuries Ethiopia was often under pressure from muslim merchant military penetration from the east
and from quite fiercely independent aromapastrolis along the southern edge where it gets to be very
dry and and semi desert of the area we call Ethiopia now in fact substantial portions of
what we call Ethiopia in the modern sense were occupied either by muslim powers like Odal or
these quite independent pastoralists in the in the south closer to home many regions were under
the sway of local nobility and the church both great landholders rather than the central monarchy
it is for good reason that Ethiopia has often been described as as feudal in my surveys of
african history indeed this is the the one place that really seems to ring a bell with
with my understanding of of medieval medieval europe including kind of this ongoing tension
which you see in you know practically every european country between a central monarchy
and a very powerful local nobility which is part secular and part religious it's it's it's
very hauntingly similar in in a lot of ways now in 1855 a provincial governor named Tawadros the
second is actually sort of anaharic rendering of theodore the second after modernizing his locally
based army seized the monarchy and and took that title i should say that's the title he took after
after taking the the ethiopian monarchy now Tawadros was a modernizer in a number of respects and
he was successful in tilting his balance of power between a localized provincial nobility
religious or secular and the central monarchy in his own favor for a time predictably this
earned him the enmity of those more peripheral uh kinds of of powers within the kingdom
now in 1868 there occurred what these days we would probably call a diplomatic incident
um which uh
leads to the unhappy end of of Tawadros but in some respects also points us forward
not only in Ethiopia's case but in in some of the themes of of this course there was a British
trade uh a console again far from a colonial ruler at this point but you know an agent there
basically to promote trade which obviously Britain and the US and probably Ethiopia has all over the
world uh up to this to this day in any case for reasons that don't concern us he was arrested
and held by the government of Tawadros and this led to a brief but quite quite forceful British
invasion of of Ethiopia something like 30 000 troops were dispatched here again Britain really
feeling its its oats in the in the mid and late 19th century um Tawadros resisted but he found here
that the the bad blood he had sown with the localized nobility and church leaders led to
and came back to haunt him because with their encouragement a substantial number of his soldiers
deserted and in fact in the in the ultimate confrontation with his British force he himself
took his pistol and committed suicide now the British withdrew and this is why I said it points
forward a bit the British withdrew but we are approaching an era in 1868 when most of Africa
was colonized by Europeans during the the so-called scramble and we're going to play pay a great deal
of attention to that in our coming lectures 19 and 20 now to look at Ethiopia in the time of this
scramble extremely important the late 1880s and 1890s Italy moved to take over Ethiopia Italy
um in a sense wanted a piece of this this action this this this magnificent African cake which
obviously Britain by the 1880s and 90s France Germany were so actively involved in in the
colonial carving up of Africa and Italy wanted to get in on this this uh this process by this
time the Ethiopian king was none other than Menelik II taking his name from the the legendary
founder who took power in 1889 and like Tawadros proved himself a skillful ruler
and a military modernizer Menelik grudgingly recognized the establishment of an Italian
colony in the coastal strip of Eritrea that I'll come back to at the end of our our lecture that
is the it's the coastal strip of what used to be all of Ethiopia along the Red Sea there
but in 1896 consider that a 1896 and consider what's happening in the rest of of Africa in terms
of the colonial occupation at a place called Ottawa in in uh in in today's Ethiopia Menelik II's
forces inflicted a resounding defeat on the Italians and sent them packing now the significance
now the significance of Menelik's repulsion of the Italians can hardly be overstated
aside from Liberia in West Africa which was founded by freed African-American slaves Ethiopia
was literally the only place in Africa not colonized by Europeans in this period so when
I use the word unique about Ethiopian history at the beginning of the lecture as a Christian
you know outpost it's unique in other ways as well independent Ethiopia was an inspiration to
Africans in Africa and in the diaspora and indeed the emperor threw much of the 20th century whose
name was Ross Tafari but who later took the name of Haile Selassie was seen by many as a symbol of
African pride and I'll come back to Haile Selassie in in a moment well the Europeans in fact the
Italians eventually returned with with the vengeance and it was none other than Benito
Mussolini the founder of fascism who took power in Italy in 1922 but in 1935 was determined to
avenge his nation's humiliation of 1896 invaded Ethiopia and seized most of his country
in exile Haile Selassie went to the League of Nations and made a dramatic plea to international
leaders to confront such aggression their failure to do so they essentially ignored him
their failure to do so was viewed by many is viewed still by many as a as a seminal moment
a moment if you like of of appeasement leading to world war two and more so as you can readily
imagine in the eyes of of many Africans both in Africa and the diaspora a sign of essentially
contempt for for Africa itself now Mussolini's success well in a lot of ways it didn't last
terribly long but it certainly didn't last long in the case of Ethiopia the Allied forces launched
a major theater of war in well several major theaters of war in in the Second World War in
Africa and one of them was definitely the Ethiopian front they succeeded in expelling the Italians
relatively early in the war in 1941 and somewhat reluctantly sort of re-recognize Haile Selassie
and Ethiopia's restored independence again another word about about Ethiopia's meaning
to to Africans all over the world and specifically Haile Selassie's you know I mentioned in passing
last time so-called Ethiopianist churches that is the independent churches created all over
Africa I mean that's a term you find for these independent churches in in in southern by independent
I mean independent of European control Christian but we don't want to be under that hierarchy and
and control and the fact that they took the the name of Ethiopian churches was in essence recognizing
that even though they were thousands of miles had no actual link with Ethiopia whatsoever
that they were drawing inspiration from that African Americans in the United States organized
a whole movement to you know the save Ethiopia campaigns when when Ethiopia was under this
this this pressure and an invasion from from from Italy and in the in the diaspora more widely of
course I mentioned Haile Selassie's original name of Ross Tafari well of course that's the basis for
the what quasi religious quasi political movement we think of Jamaica above all probably but in the
West Indies and elsewhere known as Rastafarianism and they revere Haile Selassie as as a as a
political and religious symbol so famous I suppose he's the most famous Rastafarian of all and that's
Bob Marley actually composed a song which Marley rather curtly titles war and titles war but it's
a song based it takes it's much of its lyrics from a speech by by Haile Selassie very noble
speech in which Selassie was saying I'm just giving you some of the lyrics of the song here
until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently
discredited and abandoned and then Marley gives you his his his chorus of everywhere
there will be war essentially it's a kind of you know no justice no peace sort of thing
now it's a very it's a very eloquent speech by Selassie a very noble speech back at home however
things were we're not quite so so so pretty in a lot of respects if you look at Reichard
Kapuchinsky's portrait of the last days of of I shouldn't say the last day the last years of
of of Selassie's reign in his book The Emperor you you get a portrait of a man who
certainly is extremely intelligent and extremely clever and wily in in playing enemies off against
one another the the almost fantastic parts of that book are are the the ways in which
Selassie was able to again win this sort of tug of war between himself and local nobility
and I think it's fair to say that in a way he becomes kind of the last of the
of the absolute monarchs in the world I mean some of the descriptions in that book of
you know there's the he's not the minister but he's the he's the keeper of the pillow and
Selassie was quite a short man when he when he took his seat on the throne you know his feet
were not meant to dangle for for a second and this guy's job for 26 years he was telling
Kapuchinsky was to slip that pillow under there you know highly Selassie then very much
an autocrat at best a dictator at worst he met his own reckoning finally in 1974 after
something like a half a century on the throne radical military officers devout that well
very committed Marxist officers overthrew his government and ended at last the Ethiopian monarchy
after again something like 1700 years they replaced it with a military hunter which although it had
some successes which won sympathy from leftists elsewhere in adult literacy for instance was in
fact even more brutal than than Selassie's in the name of revolution it spawned the seeds of its own
destruction and its leader went into exile in Zimbabwe where he remains among the new rulers
problems were armed secession movements in Tigray and Eritrea and I'm simply going to end by note
that Eritrea eventually organized a secessionist movement an armed secessionist movement and
was successful established its own independence in the 1990s now a great many people including
myself have noted the artificiality of Africa's modern borders after all every country on the on
the map it's a true was was drawn by by outsiders during the so-called scramble for Africa and so
forth this artificiality however once colonialism was passed has essentially remain unchallenged
Ethiopia is the one and only case of official legal formalized change in African borders
since since independence despite the fact that all of those borders are the direct legacies and
and products of colonialism so Ethiopia is today no longer particularly unique
I hope I'm not cynical to say that at this point it is another African country struggling with
a lot of problems but what a history thank you
