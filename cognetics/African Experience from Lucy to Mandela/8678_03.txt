Lecture 3 A Virtual Tour of the Great Land
Welcome.
In our last lecture we offered a typology of environments on the African continent, primary
or major environments like tropical rainforest, desert, above all perhaps savanna, secondary
environments like lacustrine or riverine.
In this lecture our object is to add specificity to this general discussion of African environments
and frankly and simply to enjoy an imaginary tour of some of the great places not just
in Africa but on the planet.
In a number of our coming lectures we are going to be dealing with very serious topics
indeed so this one more than any other perhaps is for fun.
Our itinerary calls for us to begin at the southwestern tip of the continent and then
to move in a roughly counter clockwise fashion towards the north and east first then wheeling
west before turning south again and ending at Victoria Falls one of the seven natural
wonders of the world.
Now if as we suggested in the last lecture Africa but especially southern Africa can
evoke comparison with the North American West it's possible to narrow and sharpen that analogy.
The modern country of South Africa like the western American state of California packs
an astonishing variety of scenery into one place.
Both provide us great mountains and great deserts rugged spectacular sea coasts as well
as broad sandy beaches sun-drenched wine country and protected bays where great cities arose
Cape Town and San Francisco.
Just how striking is the country of South Africa.
As Alan Paton's narrator on the first page of his famous novel cry the beloved country
puts it it's a land beyond the singing of it.
Okay Cape Town the Cape of good hope the Cape of storms the fairest Cape of all as one Mariner put it.
All of those terms direct us to this extreme southwestern corner of the African continent.
The Cape region was home for many thousands of years to foraging and pastoralist peoples
whom we will meet again beginning in our next lecture and of course this is also the place
where South African history took a sharp turn for it was here that the Dutch and later the
English began their colonial enterprises in Africa.
All that is coming as well.
There's nothing quite like flying in to Cape Town the combination of ocean mountain and
city is breathtaking commanding Table Bay and the city of Cape Town is Table Mountain.
San Francisco of course is known for its hills that city so similar in its origins
to Cape Town in that both are located on protective bays along rugged shorelines.
San Francisco known for its hills but Table Mountain at 3,556 feet about the same height
as the Blue Ridge in the Shenandoah National Park and right next to this city represents
another order of magnitude.
The actual Cape of Good Hope considered to be the place where the cold waters of the
Atlantic and the warmer ones of the Indian Ocean meet lies actually south of Cape Town
the city at the southern end of the Cape Peninsula a steep rocky very narrow and utterly spectacular
finger of land stretching for about 30 miles south of Cape Town.
Driving the highway to the tip of the Cape Peninsula is a bit like going on Highway 101
in California that notion of the sea dropping off directly below you the cliffs directly
above you you've probably seen it in movies with cars teetering on the the the brink of
the abyss if if you have not driven it yourself.
If you take that drive to the tip of the the Cape Peninsula to the actual Cape of Good
Hope on a windswept day you'll quickly see why this was known originally as the Cape
of Storms and of course the hope in Cape of Good Hope represented the hate the hope for
safe passage on the part of so many sailors a vain hope as the history of shipwrecks
shows in southern Africa and you realize again why the protection of Table Bay was so welcome.
The immediate hinterland of Cape Town the Cape Basin or the Boland is South Africa's
classic wine country it's well described as Mediterranean in its climate and there are
good reasons for that if you look at the map of Africa as a whole you can see that the
latitude in the southern hemisphere of Cape Town the the Cape region immediately adjoining
Cape Town is approximately the same southward latitude as the Mediterranean shore of North
Africa is if one went north in any case if your idea of a good time is a meander through
Napa or Sonoma valleys in California believe me this region so nearby Cape Town is for
you cross over the the various mountains it's not a single range creating that basin or
bowl but cross through those mountain passes leading northward or northeastward from the
Cape Basin and you will enter rather suddenly in the space of 30 miles or so the Plotland
an Afrikaans word Afrikaans the Dutch descended language means simply the flatland although
once you're in it you'll see that it's intersected and interrupted by a number of quite vivid
rises this is the arid outback of the Cape and the South African interior push to the north and
the drier it gets you're approaching the deserts of the Kalahari or the Kalagari and the Namib you
talk about big-sky country in the American West this is spectacular overwhelming gigantic its big
sky capitalized now suppose we took a different route not north or northeast but straight east
of Cape Town and we would find ourselves on the so-called Garden Route and encounter the
Finbos or fine bush floral kingdom one of only six such floral kingdoms designated in the entire
world the proliferation of plants and flowers is incredible the floral kingdom really starts at
at Table Mountain itself and if you take the the cable car up Table Mountain your brochure points
out that there are more plant species on the slopes of Table Mountain than in the entire British
Isles continue east along this Garden Route along the southern African coastline of South Africa
and again the California comparison arises places like Sitsi Kama sitting at the evocatively named
Storms River mouth is very comparable to places like Big Sur or Malibu along the California coast
we continue eastward even further we cross the Kai River into the region of South Africa known
simply enough as the trans sky this is Nelson Mandela's home country and on the first page of
his book he's at some pains to tell us what he thinks of its appearance and Mandela's words it is a
beautiful country of rolling hills fertile valleys and a thousand rivers and streams which keep the
landscape green even in winter the trans sky alone is as large as the country of Switzerland
our last stop in South Africa is one of Africa's great mountain ranges the Zulu peoples whose
home territory is bounded on the west by the range called it Uka Shlamba the barrier of spears
the immigrant Dutch descended Afrikaans or Bowers speaking the language I just mentioned Afrikaans
called it the Drakensburg or the Dragon Mountains both of these terms describe the spiked peaks
which run for hundreds of miles southwest to northeast largely treeless the rocks and grasses
give off a reddish gold glow in winter particularly from the eastern side as the morning light hits
it when the summer rains come as in so many parts of Africa the seasonal rainfall those
rains paint the Drakensburg with a patina of soft green well let us leap north now to the
heart of East Africa this is truly out of Africa country indeed Meryl Streep who of course
starred in that in that motion picture I was looking at Robert Caputo's book of extraordinary
photographs about Kenya and she'd contributed a jacket blurb to this book which in which he spoke
of Kenya's overwhelming beauty says that his book quote gave shape and color to the dreams I
still have of this unforgettable land among the many people hooked by by Kenya Richard leaky was
born raised in Kenya he's the son of two great paleontologists who became a great paleontologist
himself and we'll meet him in the next lecture similarly describes Kenya on this for this same
book as a place of quote extraordinary array of contrasting an awesome country now Kenya and
South Africa may indeed be the jewels in terms of scenery in in Africa but as my son might put it
you can go nearby Kenya to Tanzania Uganda Malawi places like that as he might put it they're not
too shabby either and leaky's right East Africa like California like South Africa
packs a great deal of contrast into a single region besides the warm beaches washed by the Indian
Ocean your home to the Swahili cultures will examine the long history of in lecture number 11
there are considerable stretches of savanna and many of East Africa's notable features are related
to the tectonic plate disturbance in the earth's surface that we call the great rift now the great
rift runs essentially north to south along the eastern semi interior of the the African continent
some people have referred to it as the the spine of Africa on one hand the rift created a gigantic
gash running down the the so-called spine of of the continent the dry portions of that of that gash
if you like have created the great rift valley which runs in Kenya and northern Tanzania home of
Africa's one of Africa's most legendary peoples the the quite pastoralist historically Masai peoples
of of East Africa now when parts of this depression are filled with water they can create either in
the case of the northern most one filled with ocean water the red sea or further south can give
us some of Africa's so-called great lakes Lake Tanganyika Lake Malawi and so forth fresh water
versions of the the great rift activity place like Lake Malawi I would describe essentially as a sort
of Hawaii with fresh water for a long time the the tourist industry of Malawi advertised this is not
only drop dead gorgeous if I can use more of my son's lingo but as a place that was for reasons I
don't entirely understand free of two reasons you might not want to get in the water crocodiles on
one hand and Bill Hartsie or schistosomiasis which is a debilitating disease found in a lot of
particularly of of settled water in East Africa now in fact both of these things have apparently
cropped up as you can imagine they're not too happy in the in the tourist bureaus of of Malawi but
an extraordinary place there's something like 200 species of fish which occur only in Lake Malawi
many of them are not just technical or they're almost psychedelic in their appearance and I
encounter undergraduates who are aquarium buffs and tell me that they they get some of their most
spectacular species originally from from Lake Malawi marketed across the world now on the other
hand the rift is associated with crust uplift and with volcanic activity both creating mountains
either mountain ranges like the mountains of the moon in Uganda or standalone volcanic peaks
like Mount Kilimanjaro or Kenya in the last lecture we spoke of the way that elevation
counteracts latitude in determining temperature and indeed these two great mountains are as I
mentioned at that point quite snow packed on top Ernest Hemingway titled his famous story later
they made a movie out of that the snows of Kilimanjaro and he was right his description of that is
always stuck with me great high and unbelievable white in the sun was the square top of Kilimanjaro
Kilimanjaro is the tallest freestanding mountain in the world that by that I mean it's not part
of a range it is a gigantic volcanic cone in essence 50 miles in diameter the soil because of its
volcanic origins is unusually fertile and I've been told that something on the order of a million
people live just on the lower slopes of this this mountain now for visitors probably the best of all
is you can climb Kilimanjaro I did it and if I can do it there's a very good chance that that you
can do it it's no walk on the beach obviously things like altitude sickness have to be taken
seriously if you go through it you traverse several worlds on one major hike when I say
that you can do it I mean that it's not a technical climb you go through the the lower slopes covered
with maize bananas and coffee you enter into a kind of montane forest quite thick above that
then the the tree line is met and grassland kicks in rocky moors tarns small lakes of the top and
then finally to that snow and ice on top although as I mentioned last time associated by many with
global warming apparently the the snow and ice pack on the top of Kilimanjaro is shrinking at a
rate alarming to to some Everest for every man is what one travel writer called Kilimanjaro
a phrase I rather I rather like now if we move east excuse me move west at this point from east
Africa from from Tanzania from from Kenya and so forth we encounter Africa's great equatorial
rainforests second largest rainforest in the world is the Congo basin rainforest following
only the amazon very much in the in the center of the the continent and then a belt of forest which
extends further west from there stretching across the the coastal strip of of west Africa
this equatorial rainforest when joseph Conrad wrote the heart of darkness he was writing largely
about the darkness in the human and not necessarily the African human heart and not the the natural
environment but it's probably not accidental that he said it here in this forbidding expansive forest
let me give you another description of these equatorial rainforests from John Reader whose
book Africa a biography of the continent is is is much recommended the tropical rainforest has an
aura of still silent unfathomable power massive trees huge living things crowned with a tracery
of green flickers of sunlight a tangle of undergrowth soft damp decaying leaf mold underfoot once
among the trees perceptions of distance are frustrated a sense of direction is hard to
maintain location is difficult to establish people are quickly disoriented lost and not only in the
physical sense the close absolute self-sufficiency of the forest also confuses the human sense of
purpose and self-esteem the forest is alive and growing and all-encompassing it appears to extend
forever and seems capable of living forever prime evil and eternally recycling its beneficence
well as i say if you continue that westward movement out of the great congo basin but
continue in the forest belt along the the west african coastal line you of course have come to
the the west african subcontinent now at this point i'm going to turn things over to a far better
writer than than i and that is probably africa's most famous writer in the outside world i'm referring
to the nigerian writer chenua achebe still with us uh his last great book um which is a masterpiece
was titled ant hills of the savannah which i'll explain the title of in a moment but towards the
end of that book a chebys hero is is on the run by the way if you've read any of a chebys novels
you know they're set in these fictional countries but hey anybody knows that it's nigeria that he's
writing about his his home country his heroes on the on the run for political reasons he's got to
get out of town he's in disguise and so forth and he undertakes a bus journey he figures that'll be
safer and his narrator here a chebys narrator describes his journey essentially from south
to north through some of these uh zones of of the west african subcontinent let me let me give it to
you from a cheby the impenetrable rainforest of the south through which even a great highway
snaked like a mere game track began to yield ground most grudgingly at first but in time a little more
willingly to less prodigious growths and a couple of hundred kilometers further north unbelievably
to open parklands of grass and stunted trees the traveler's spirits rose in step with this
diminution of forests which gave the eye a heady facility to roam freely and take in the wide
panoramas of space stretching to a horizon where tiny trees on distant hills and against clear
skies form miniature japanese gardens his hero continues further north and he's really getting
now into very dry country indeed beyond that dried up river there was hardly a yard of transition
you drove straight into a scrub land which two years without rain had virtually turned to desert
desertification again the air current blowing into the bus seemed to be fan from a furnace the
only green things around now where the formidable spike cactus serving as shelter around desolate
clusters of huts and once a while in the dusty fields a fat bottom baobab tree so strange in
appearance that one could easily believe the story that elephants looking for water when they
still roam these parts would pierce the crusty bark of the baobab with their tusk and suck the
juices stored in the years of rain by the tree inside its monumental bowl i mentioned that i would
explain the title of anthills of the of the savannah at one point a chebys narrative writes that
this is like anthill surviving to tell the new grass of the savannah about last year's brush fires
he's really making a point about reminiscence which is one of a chebys great themes uh reminiscence
of the by the old uh filling in the the young on on history and and what is what is transpired
let me just flesh out a chevy's description a little bit we started with that coastal belt
we moved into west africa's great savannah belt running east to west some terminology here sudan
obviously refers to a modern country in northeastern africa but sudan in the larger sense in the
historical sense is the belt of savannah stretching east and west across a huge section of west and
indeed all the way over to northeastern africa bilad al sudan arabic for land of the blacks
is is where the term comes from it's you know a traverse of of the west african sudan will be
like driving across kansas times ten uh without an an interstate big sky country between the
sahara and the or between the savannah and and the sahara for moving south to north there's a
strip there of semi desert again terminology the sahel this comes from the arabic word for shore
and it refers to the southern shore if you like of a great ocean of sand the the sahara as the
sahara expands by definition the sahel and the savannah shift southward to and finally of course
we do enter into the vastness of the world's greatest but as we specified last time also its
youngest desert i'm going to end by moving to uh one of the wonders of the earth it's official it
is one of the seven natural wonders of the of the earth and that's victoria falls on the on the zambizi
in my mind this is the greatest place on earth um there's quite a uh journalistic fad these days
to to issue these lists of things to do before you die and that's the one that i might suggest
you put on your list if you're if you're so inclined to to construct such a list i'm not
making this up in my will i asked for my ashes to be thrown over uh victoria falls whether anybody
will bother is is another question but it has that sort of effect now let me let me set the scene
here a bit the zambizi river just upstream from the falls is about a mile wide so we have this
mile wide river flowing through islands and so forth it then falls over and into a very steep
and narrow trough over 300 feet deep so mile wide river falling 300 feet about twice the uh the the
height and and more than twice the width of of niagara falls into this very narrow trough now
the river's a river it's got to continue downstream and it does continue downstream but the outlet
from the trough is very very narrow it's less than 100 yards wide and what you have then is this
concentration of a colossal energy created by the fall of so much water into this narrow trough
and he explains the local name in the silozy language mosey watunya the smoke that thunders
the smoke is the mist which rises in some cases uh in the high season visible for 30 miles or so
the thunder is the overwhelming noise that this makes it's deafening the roar particularly in
the high season now i mentioned sees the zambizi drains savannah country that means as we observed
last time that it's draining uh countryside with seasonal rainfall now what this means in turn
is that the zambizi is a seasonal river and it changes radically the falls is a completely different
experience depending on the time of the year that you visited at its peak and it takes some time to
fill up a system this big but at its peak in say march or so the you know cubic feet of water per
second coming over that that falls is approximately 30 times what it was in the previous november
so again a very different experience depending on when you see it i'd like to give a couple of
impressions of of the falls by old time uh first observers this is from a book called zambizi river
of africa put together by my copinger and jumbo williams mostly a book of photographs but they've
culled some some very uh juicy uh reactions to the falls as as the authors of the book say
mostly watunya engenders emotion it's not a passive experience they quote a visitor from 1876
it seemed to me as if my own identity were swallowed up in the surrounding glory the voice
of which rolled on forever like the waves of eternity no human being can describe the infinite
and what i saw was a part of infinity made visible and framed in beauty as they say it engenders
emotions sometimes the emotions uh struck people in a rather different way a visitor in 1898 it is
hell itself a corner of which seems to open at your feet a dark and terrible hell from the middle
of which you expect every moment to see some repulsive monster rising in anger now i wouldn't
share that reaction but their point that it engenders reaction and response and emotion is
certainly there i would agree with them the scale is massive the spectacle spellbinding
and perpetually changing now the only way to see the entire expanse of the falls the the whole
mile wide stretch is from the air and the only way to get in the air is by machine at this point
there are no high places around i first did this in a terrifying journey in a four-seater
single engine plane the last time i went i truly bit the bullet and took a micro light flight
over the falls essentially a hang glider with a with a motor and a pilot thank god and and finally
i think was able to appreciate probably the most famous words ever written about this place
they came from david livingston who was the first european to see it in 1855 and of course
named it after his queen as livington put it seen so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels
in their flight thank you
